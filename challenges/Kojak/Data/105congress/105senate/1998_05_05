Mr. President, today we begin our second day of floor \ndebate on legislation to rein in the Internal Revenue Service. As \nhearings demonstrated last week, once again, the IRS is an agency with \nreal problems. I should note, again, it has a job to do. It is not an \neasy job. We acknowledge that. We also have to give credit to those IRS \nemployees who work hard, do an honest job, and don't target people for \nunnecessary audits or try to set up laundering schemes, things of that \nnature. A lot of IRS employees have put their own jobs on the line and \nhave endured a lot of harassment because they have said there are \nproblems here.\n  We heard from a number of them last week who came in. In fact, one \nlady came in, she is chief of a division, and complained about the \nslowness or inaction by the Deputy Commissioner of IRS where there has \nbeen misconduct within the IRS. It seems when complaints or problems \ndevelop and recommendations are made, they are put in a desk somewhere, \nor on a desk, and they seem to just disappear. It was an IRS agent who \ncame and said the Deputy Commissioner is not following up on things.\n  We had a panel of IRS agents who came in and talked about the \nproblems they had found. IRS agents are the ones who pointed out there \nhad been targeted audits of people like Senator Howard Baker. It was \nthree IRS agents who were, in effect, punished or moved because they \nsaid there is a rogue agent here out of control doing something that is \nwrong and illegal. So a lot of IRS workers are the ones who have \nbrought these matters to our attention.\n  The most compelling testimony, though, last week, for me, involved \nsmall businessmen who had been raided unfairly. Some of them still, \nobviously, are emotionally distraught over what\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nthey had to endure. One of them was a man by the name of John \nColaprete. Mr. Colaprete is a small businessman, a restaurant owner, in \nVirginia Beach, VA. He told the Senate Finance Committee how the IRS \nalmost destroyed his business. This morning you will get a chance to \nhear his story in his own words. I am going to read his testimony \nbecause it was so compelling. I fear a lot of Senators did not hear his \ntestimony, and a lot of the American people didn't hear it, but this is \njust one of the three. I know there are many others in the country.\n  This is the type of thing that is being done by the Criminal \nInvestigation Unit at IRS that has to be reined in.\n\n       My name is John Colaprete. I'm from Virginia Beach, and I'm \n     in the restaurant business.\n       I'm also a husband, a father, and veteran, having served my \n     country proudly as a U.S. Marine Corps captain from 1965 to \n     1969.\n       I have never been in any sort of trouble with the law, and \n     I believe that every American has an obligation to pay their \n     fair share of income taxes.\n       I have never failed to meet that obligation.\n       I have always considered myself both patriotic and a law-\n     abiding citizen.\n       I will always be a law-abiding citizen. However, I feel I \n     have literally been punished for upholding the laws of the \n     nation I swore an allegiance to honor and defend.\n       Four years ago, I employed a bookkeeper in my restaurant \n     who eventually embezzled approximately $40,000.00 from the \n     business. She went to prison for her crimes, but not before \n     turning my life, and the lives of countless others, upside \n     down. With the full cooperation of the Internal Revenue \n     Service, this woman, a multiple felon, who already had an \n     outstanding warrant for her arrest, managed not once but \n     twice, to victimize me, my family, partners, employees, \n     patrons and others in the business community who depended \n     upon me and my business.\n       This dance with the Devil began in March of 1994, when my \n     partner and I became aware that we were being swindled by our \n     bookkeeper. When we discovered substantial shortages in our \n     accounts, we confronted her, and she admitted to stealing \n     from our business. She told us she would make restitution. \n     Unfortunately, rather than make restitution, she sought \n     shelter with the IRS and told them a fantastic tale of money \n     laundering, gun running and drug dealing by my partner and \n     me.\n       Little did I know that the IRS would spend less than 48 \n     hours investigating my bookkeeper's allegations before \n     conducting raids on my business, my home, and the home of my \n     manager.\n       Little did I know that the government I had so proudly \n     served would accept these allegations to be true, despite the \n     alarming lack of substantiation, probable cause, or proof of \n     any sort whatsoever.\n       Little did I know that the IRS, when faced with the \n     outrageous claim that I had thousands of pounds of cocaine \n     stored like cordwood in my office, would subscribe to a \n     policy of Guilty Until Proven Innocent. Unfortunately, in the \n     case of the IRS, I now know this is standard operating \n     procedure when dealing with law-abiding taxpayers.\n       This wasn't a matter of an honest mistake; in fact, a \n     recently retired FBI agent divulged in a deposition taken for \n     the case that I have pending against the IRS, that he had \n     advised all involved to be skeptical about the claims of my \n     accuser. The FBI specifically declined to become involved, \n     and in the words of one of its agents, the whole story \n     sounded like a ``Grade B'' movie.\n       On the morning that both my home and business were raided--\n     raids executed solely on the word of my ex-bookkeeper--I was \n     in a church for the occasion of my son's first holy \n     communion. Armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniffing dogs, \n     stormed my restaurant during breakfast, ordered patrons out \n     of the restaurant and interrogated my employees. The IRS \n     impounded my records, my cash registers, and my computers. \n     Since the raids, we managed to get up and running, despite \n     what can easily be perceived as our own government's best \n     attempts to put us out of business.\n       Today, I still wonder how such a thing can happen, but I \n     know it does. And I'd like you to know that for every \n     taxpayer like me--those who have survived armed assaults on \n     our businesses and our homes--there are perhaps several \n     thousands of taxpayers who, in fear, lick their wounds, tally \n     their losses, and consider themselves lucky that the IRS has \n     finally left them alone, their innocence notwithstanding. I \n     have nothing to hide, and I will never consider myself lucky \n     when I ponder the events of the last four years. As for the \n     taxpayers who have suffered similar injustices at the hands \n     of the IRS, I hear from these people every week. They seek me \n     out and relate horror stories that, at one time, would have \n     evoked from me nothing more than simple skepticism. I used to \n     believe that such things could only happen in a Communist \n     bloc country, or a police state. I don't believe that \n     anymore.\n       When the raid occurred at my home, the front foor was torn \n     from the hinges. My dogs were impounded, along with my safe \n     and 12 years of my personal income tax returns and supporting \n     documents. When that safe was finally returned, an heirloom \n     watch that I had received as a gift from my father was \n     missing. In the aftermath of the raid, I returned to find my \n     home in shambles. It was as if I had been burglarized, both \n     in appearance and in the sense of having been grossly \n     violated.\n       While my restaurant and my home were being raided by armed \n     agents of the Internal Revenue Service, a raid was also being \n     conducted on the home of my manager.\n       In that raid, my manager was pulled at gunpoint from the \n     shower and forcibly restrained while he attempted to call an \n     attorney. His teenage son was forced to the floor at \n     gunpoint. His daughter, 14 years old at the time, had several \n     friends over for a slumber party the night before. These \n     young girls had to get dressed under the watchful eyes of \n     male agents, despite the presence of female agents. The IRS \n     agents stood in the doorway to the bedroom, refusing these \n     young girls even a semblance of privacy.\n       We were never charged with any crimes. After scrutinizing \n     our records for four months, the IRS returned most of them. A \n     rental truck pulled up in front of my business one day, and \n     the items that were returned were basically dumped in a pile \n     on the street for us to sort through. I never received an \n     apology.\n       Following the raids, I could get no answers as to why all \n     of this occurred. I was met with ``No comment, Mr. \n     Colaprete,'' at every turn. Freedom of information requests \n     were ignored, ostensibly due to a backlog of such requests, \n     and despite legally mandated time limits on such requests. \n     Two newspapers in Virginia Beach made repeated requests under \n     the Freedom of Information Act, only to have the Justice \n     Department thumb its nose at those requests. When an \n     investigative journalist began to get to the bottom of \n     things, he was also subjected to the harassment of the IRS. \n     He had an opportunity to interview Special Agent Carol \n     Willman from the IRS office in Norfolk, Virginia. During that \n     interview, Ms. Willman interrupted the reporter's inquiries \n     with a demand for his Social Security number. Within the \n     year, he was notified that the IRS wanted to audit his \n     return. When a local publication reported this, the audit was \n     abruptly canceled. An IRS agent stated at the time that the \n     agency does not retaliate against citizens through the use of \n     audits, but the facts would seem to indicate otherwise.\n       The ex-bookkeeper, meanwhile, was kept in protective \n     custody by the IRS in a motel up until the time of the raids. \n     It is almost unimaginable that there could be such a level of \n     incompetence at the IRS that they would not only take the \n     word of this woman and begin any sort of investigation, but \n     they would shield her from the authorities who were trying to \n     arrest her. The woman who the IRS was protecting and on whom \n     they had relied had already been convicted numerous times. In \n     fact, the outstanding criminal charge pending against her at \n     the time she approached the IRS was for a crime involving \n     lying and stealing. Ironically, just a week before this woman \n     approached the IRS, I had specifically gone to the police and \n     filed a complaint against her, alleging that she had lied, \n     stolen and embezzled from me. In the face of all of that, how \n     could anyone, let alone a supposedly trained, professional \n     inspector with the IRS, accept at face value what this woman \n     was saying? Based on her word, she--Carol Willman--not only \n     commenced an investigation, but completely shut down a \n     business and turned the lives of innocent people upside down \n     less than 48 hours after first being introduced to the woman. \n     Is there such a competitive atmosphere within the IRS to add \n     another feather in their cap that they would ignore not only \n     basic investigative techniques, but the obvious flaws in this \n     woman's character and simply accept her at face value? It is \n     frightening that such a woman could have conned the IRS into \n     believing that her employer, despite all appearances to the \n     contrary, was a high-level gangster and then shield her from \n     the law in the belief that she would lead them to a bigger \n     fish--like me.\n       To compound the Keystone Cop mistakes that had already been \n     made, the IRS then allowed her to leave the jurisdiction of \n     Virginia to go to North Carolina where she was only later \n     sent to jail for embezzling from three other employers in \n     that state. On the surface, it might appear that she acted \n     alone, but that just isn't so. The IRS was her partner in \n     crime--first, acting in concert to destroy my life, and then \n     allowing her to flee the state and victimize others.\n       I looked for answers and was rebuffed at every turn. I \n     suffered a deep depression that lasted a year. I was \n     immobilized and could not get out of bed some days. My \n     neighbors shunned me. My wife, who is an artist, has not been \n     able to pick up a paint brush in four years. My children were \n     taunted at school and told that their father was a gangster \n     and a drug dealer--a Mafioso. I raised my children with a \n     zero tolerance for dishonesty, and now they must hear \n     allegations that I am a tax cheat. I am here to tell you that \n     I am none of those things.\n       Relatively speaking, the trauma that has befallen me is \n     mild, compared to what has happened to my manager. He has \n     suffered severe depression, sought counseling from his \n     pastor, literally been shunned by friends and acquaintances, \n     and has yet to get his life back in order. He has been ruined \n     financially and emotionally, with little or no hope of ever \n     getting his life back to where it was prior to the raids.\n       I'm also here to tell you that we cannot treat our citizens \n     this way--not in America. I have been repeatedly victimized \n     over the\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\n     past four years, primarily by a government tax agency that is \n     funded with my tax dollars. If Americans have a perception of \n     the IRS as the Boogey Man, it is because the IRS itself has \n     promoted that perception through policies that are \n     fundamentally unconstitutional and illegal.\n       This is not a partisan issue--it is a people issue and a \n     freedom issue.\n       I have a lawsuit pending against the IRS, and I will not \n     rest until I have had my day in court. The IRS response to \n     the lawsuit has been to cast doubt on my character by \n     insinuating that they did, in fact, find evidence of \n     wrongdoing, but they chose not to prosecute if. If I was \n     guilty of anything, why would they ``choose'' not to \n     prosecute? While any ``allegations'' will eventually be \n     shown in court to be what they are, i.e., a smoke screen, \n     until I can get into court to prove my case, these \n     ``allegations'' linger in the community where I live and \n     work and continue to compound my frustration.\n       The system does not work for the American taxpayer. The \n     total sense of violation that we have experienced has had a \n     devastating effect on us all. In the wake of all of this, I \n     find there is no system in place to defend me, or others like \n     me. I'd like to believe that someone takes responsibility for \n     what has happened--for what continues to happen every day in \n     this country. If the example we are to set for our citizens \n     is one of no accountability and no remorse, then our form of \n     government--the oldest surviving democracy on the planet--\n     cannot survive much longer.\n       A day doesn't go by that I don't wonder what harassment \n     will occur next. I would like to know why this dark entity \n     known as the IRS has come into my life and refused to leave. \n     So who protects me in the system? Who cares about my \n     constitutional rights? Not the courts. Not the IRS. I am \n     hoping that the buck stops here--with you, Senator Roth and \n     this Committee.\n       I leave you with just three questions, Senators:\n       (1) Why did this happen?\n       (2) What will you do to see that it never happens again to \n     innocent taxpaying Americans? We cannot employ inexperienced \n     and immature people to play God with the lives of our \n     taxpayers--IRS agents who decide that it's a beautiful day to \n     go out and destroy someone's life; and finally,\n       (3) Once this ordeal has ended and I have obtained a \n     verdict in a court of law and a judgment against the IRS, \n     what will you do to assure me that the IRS pays the judgment, \n     rather than continue to beat me into submission through \n     endless appeals and an outright refusal to pay the judgment \n     that I obtain?\n       In this great democracy, we have created this entity to \n     collect taxes which we all agree must exist. However, we have \n     empowered this agency to be subject to no one, to no laws, to \n     no checks and balances, and all of us--including each and \n     every one of you--are afraid of them! Why should we fear the \n     very people we employ?\n       When these hearings began last September, I was told that \n     Senator Roth would conduct these hearings because he has no \n     fear. After my ordeal, I have no fear any longer, but when \n     Americans receive that letter with the logo of the IRS in the \n     upper left hand corner, their pulse rate, heart beat and \n     blood pressure rise. There is a genuine fear. This fear must \n     stop.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to open today's debate by sending messages to \ntwo groups of people.\n  To Mr. Colaprete, to his family, to his manager, to the employees of \nhis restaurant, and to the residents of Virginia Beach whose lives were \nharmed by the IRS, I want to say that I'm sorry. Since the IRS \napparently thinks they do not need to apologize to you, I will. On \nbehalf of myself and the United States Senate, I apologize for the harm \nthat your government has done to you.\n  I also want to say to Mr. Colaprete that it is our intent that this \nnever happens again. The legislation we have before us is specifically \ndesigned to stop the kind of abuse you suffered, and we will continue \nto maintain a vigilant watch over this agency.\n  To the agents at the IRS, who have been out of control, and to the \nmanagement who is protecting those agents, I want to say watch out. We \nare on to you, and we will not let you do this sort of thing to the \nAmerican people.\n  That is our goal here, to provide some protections, some oversight \nthat is free and separate from the IRS, a private citizen entity to \nlook into their procedures and their conduct. It also is to give some \nrelief to the taxpayers who now find quite often that the penalties and \nthe interest far surpass the basic amount that was owed.\n  This action is overdue. I want us to have a strong bill because I \ndon't want us to come back 2 years from now and find out what we did, \nin fact, did not change the culture at IRS. I do believe that the new \nCommissioner, Mr. Rossotti, is trying hard to turn things around, but \nit is not all the agency's fault. The laws that we have on the books \nhave been inadequate. In fact, I am not sure we can fix these laws. We \nmay have to just scrap what we have and start over again.\n  For now, until that is done, we must build in protections against \nthis type of abuse of ordinary citizens and taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4223-5", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to \ntalk about S. 1180, the Endangered Species Act reauthorization bill, \nand why I have decided to cosponsor it at this time.\n  As our colleagues know, this bill was passed by the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee last fall, and it is currently on the calendar, \nready for consideration by the full Senate. I have been slow to \ncosponsor S. 1180 because of some reservations I had--and still have--\nabout the bill. I will talk in more detail about those details in a \nminute.\n  However, I am absolutely convinced that the current Endangered \nSpecies Act is not only a dismal failure at saving species, but is \nactually working against that goal. Furthermore, every day we tolerate \nthis defective law, its unfair and unnecessary burdens increase on \ncitizens and the economy. Yet at the same time, the American people \ncontinue to believe that conserving fish and wildlife species for the \nenjoyment of future generations is the right thing to do. And I \ncertainly agree with that. They want to make changes to the law, but \ndon't want to see the Endangered Species Act thrown out.\n  That is why for the last three years, my colleague and friend from \nIdaho, Senator Kempthorne, has been working mightily to improve this \ncomplex law. He has held hearings, built coalitions, drafted and re-\ndrafted language to correct the problems while still advancing the \ngoals of the Endangered Species Act. I congratulate him, as well as our \nother Senate colleagues who have worked with him to produce this bill.\n  S. 1180 would make some positive reforms in the current system. It \nwould re-focus the process on actually saving species. It would create \nopportunities and benefits for people who are affected by the \ngovernment's actions in these areas.\n\n  For example, the bill emphasizes sound science--instead of politics--\nto guide actions taken to conserve and recover species. It requires \nindependent peer review for listing and delisting decisions, and for \nthe establishment of a biological recovery goal in a recovery plan. \nSpecific time limits would be observed, and States and local citizens \nwould have a larger role in the process.\n  I believe these provisions and others would make significant \nimprovements\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\nin our current process, to the benefit of both our wildlife and our \ncitizenry. While additional corrections could be made, those who \ndrafted this bill believe that a more comprehensive overhaul of ESA is \nnot going to pass this Congress. I tend to agree with that assessment \nand I am also willing to pursue the strategy of trying to pass these \nreforms now as a foundation for further reforms later. That is the \nmessage I would like to send with my cosponsorship of S. 1180 today.\n  Having said all that, Mr. President, I cannot endorse each and every \nprovision within this legislation. I will be supporting amendments that \nwill change or add to the bill in a number of areas.\n  For instance, while I support S. 1180's stated goal of providing \nincentives to promote voluntary habitat conservation by private \nlandowners, I am very concerned about what the bill as a whole will \nfail to do in the area of protecting private property rights.\n  This is no small matter. The right to own and use property goes to \nthe very heart of our American democracy. It was so important to our \nfounding fathers that they enshrined the protection of private property \nin the Constitution's Bill of Rights.\n  It is equally important today. Yet our federal government has \nincreasingly ignored these rights. President Clinton rejected the \nConstitution's guarantee outright when he pledged to veto any \n``compensation entitlement legislation'' intended to strengthen \nAmericans' private property rights. Representatives of this \nadministration have even suggested that the idea of private property is \nan outmoded notion.\n  Let me say to them, how dare they. Nowhere in the administration's \nhostility toward private property rights is there more evidence of that \nthan in their threat to veto an endangered species reform that has that \nin it.\n  Let's take a look at Secretary Babbitt's ``no surprises'' policy, for \nexample. The basic idea is that if landowners surrender control over \nthe use of part of their property for ESA purposes, then the Federal \nGovernment will let them use the rest of it without interference. To \nput it another way, Secretary Babbitt proposes that you pay the \nGovernment for the right to use your own land. By comparison, the \nConstitution of the United States promises that if the Federal \nGovernment wants your land used a certain way, the Federal Government \nhas to pay you for it.\n  Even more outrageous than Secretary Babbitt's program is the fact \nthat many landowners think it is actually a pretty good deal. How \noppressive and tyrannical have ESA regulations become, when citizens \nare willing, even eager, to give up their property and their \nconstitutionally protected right to compensation just to get the \nGovernment off their back, just to get the Government to leave them \nalone.\n  I applaud the goal of S. 1180 in reducing regulatory burdens and \nimproving the certainty and finality of Government action in protecting \nendangered species. It is bad policy to require the American people to \nsacrifice their constitutionally protected rights for any Federal \nprogram, even this one.\n  I would like to see S. 1180 strengthen and protect fifth amendment \nrights to compensation. I will vote for amendments and/or legislation \nthat strengthens our citizens' private property rights.\n  The paramount natural resource issue for Americans in the West is \nsovereignty of our States over water that flows and exists within the \nboundaries of those Western States. It is easy to say that all we need \nto do is remain silent on this issue and it will be OK. In fact, \nhowever, preserving State water sovereignty is not so easy. The reality \nof how Federal water rights are created, or not created, requires that \nwe speak to the question, I believe, in this legislation.\n\n  The appropriation doctrine is the water law of Western States and has \nas its central premise that the first person to claim a water right has \npriority on its use over those water claimants who assert claims at a \nlater date. In the arid West, this principle lies at the very heart of \nour economy. It is the ability to allocate this precious resource--the \nresource of water--that allows us to exist in the West.\n  It is for this reason we westerners become particularly agitated when \nthe Federal Government tries to disrupt this principle or to ``take'' \nour water. Does this legislation create a Federal reserved water right? \nThe answer is no, it doesn't. But it should say that very clearly. And \nI will support an amendment that I hope can pass, which will say very \nclearly that, within the Endangered Species Act reauthorization, it \ndoesn't.\n  With all of those considerations, though, I believe it is important \nthat we move S. 1180. I think it is a positive step forward. As I have \nsaid, I believe it lays the right foundation for further changes in \nCongresses to come. It says to the American people that we are \nconcerned about preserving species of animals, insects, of all things \non this earth, if we can possibly do it. At the same time, there is a \nreasonable right and a reasonable responsibility enshrined within the \nConstitution that we preserve the right of the citizenry to exist also.\n  It is for this reason that this legislation should clearly state the \nCongress' intent. For the record, this Senator does not intend for the \nendangered species reauthorization legislation to create a federal \nreserved water right. This is why I believe S. 1180 must state clearly \nthat no implied or express federal water right is created in this \nlegislation. I will support and vote for such an amendment.\n  With these areas of concern in mind, I am also inclined to support a \nshorter term of reauthorization than S. 1180 provides. As I mentioned \npreviously, it is my goal to build additional improvements on the \nfoundation laid by this legislation. Accelerating the opportunity for \nCongress to re-open the issue would only advance that goal.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me repeat my endorsement for the goals \nthat Senator Kempthorne and the other supporters of this bill set out \nto achieve in reauthorizing the Endangered Species Act. I think the \nbill will make improvements that are critical to ongoing EAS efforts in \nmy state and elsewhere in the nation, and amendments in the areas I \nhave discussed today will enhance those improvements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, to date, our efforts to develop \ncomprehensive, bipartisan anti-tobacco legislation have been stymied by \nthe lack of consensus on a number of major issues.\n  Over the next few weeks, I intend to devote full attention toward \nrefocusing our efforts on a bill which can be enacted this year.\n  To accomplish that goal, it is important that Congress and the \nAdministration reflect on what our objective actually has been--and \nshould continue to be.\n  Last June, the 40 State Attorneys General, public health \nrepresentatives, tobacco company officials, and representatives of the \nCastano group, announced a bold new initiative focused on eradicating \nthe scourge of youth tobacco use.\n  This proposed global tobacco settlement presents Washington with a \nonce-in-a-generation-opportunity to help families and communities raise \na whole generation of youth tobacco-free.\n  Certainly, no one in Congress was bound to the particulars of the \nJune agreement.\n  But, we would not have seen such virtually unprecedented legislative \nconsideration of the tobacco issue in the past 11 months were it not \nfor this settlement.\n  In short, our objective in 1997 was to improve the public health, and \nspecifically the health of our youth, through a constitutional package \nof reforms which relies on a guaranteed stream of revenue from tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Our objective should be the same in 1998.\n  But it appears that it is not.\n  Unfortunately, partisan politics, fear, greed and Washington's pile-\non mentality have caused us to lose sight of this objective.\n  Instead, we are simply trying to ``out-tobacco'' one another. If that \ncontinues, the public interest will not be served, and Big Tobacco will \nwin.\n  As an optimist, I remain hopeful the Congress will succeed this year \nin passing strong, anti-tobacco legislation\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nthat is comprehensive, workable, and Constitutionally-permissible.\n  But as a realist, I also know that the events of the last few weeks, \nin which this issue has become increasingly fractionalized and \npoliticized, make our task that much more difficult.\n  Comprehensive tobacco legislation is now in jeopardy. Not for want of \ntrying, to be sure, but for a lack of consensus on several crucial \nissues.\n  For us to consider comprehensive tobacco legislation, and then to \nfail, would be a terrible loss, a loss for our country, a loss for our \npolitical system, and a loss for the generation of our youth America's \nparents hope to bring up tobacco-free.\n\n  Let me be blunt. Our failure to enact comprehensive anti-tobacco \nlegislation would also be a significant victory for the tobacco \nindustry, an industry which has knowingly marketed harmful products for \ndecades, deliberately targeting our youth in their quest for profits.\n  Let me be equally frank. Passage of just any bill will be a \nsignificant loss for the American people, who should be able to rely on \ntheir legislators to write sound, responsible legislation.\n  In writing a bill, we should not give in to the tobacco industry's \ndemands. We should not give in to their less-than-veiled attempts to \nforce both the Administration and the Congress into abandoning our \nobjectives--addressing the problem of youth tobacco, reforming the \nlegal system to allow for appropriate compensation to claimants, \nenhancing biomedical research with respect to tobacco, improving the \npublic health, as well as helping our farmers transition away from \ngrowing tobacco.\n  At the outset of my remarks, I want to distinguish carefully and \nclearly any substantive concerns I have about the legislation that has \nemerged from the Commerce Committee with my respect and admiration for \nthose who have brought the legislation to this point.\n  First and foremost, I commend the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator McCain. Anybody who knows anything about John McCain knows that \nhe is a patriot and true American hero.\n  As I will lay out, while I do have significant concerns with many of \nthe major details of the legislation that the Commerce Committee has \nput forward--and would have preferred that we could have worked more \nclosely together--I do commend the efforts of all the members of the \nCommerce Committee in moving a bill forward for floor consideration.\n  But before I discuss the policies of tobacco control, I want to sound \na cautionary note about its politics.\n  Pundits report that Democrats are in a ``win-win'' position on this \nissue.\n  As conventional wisdom goes, the minority can keep on moving the goal \nposts of this legislation, proposing more and more harsh amendments, \ndefying Republicans to vote against their ever-changing version of the \nbill.\n  In this way, the Democrats can either foster the perception that they \nare tougher on Big Tobacco by making the bill more and more onerous, or \nthey can tar and feather any recalcitrant Republicans with the charge \nthat Republicans are in cahoots with Big Tobacco. That is pure bunk.\n  Listening to the President's press conference last week, I was \nimpressed by his earnest statement that this not be an election year \nissue. But, as we all well know, any issue raised consistently fewer \nthan six months before an election is an election issue. It cannot be \navoided.\n  All rhetoric aside, the way to accomplish our goal--the reduction of \nyouth tobacco use--is for the Congress and the White House to work \ntogether on a bill which can be enacted and implemented. We are not \nthere yet, despite public protestations to the contrary.\n  A number of key differences in approach are major stumbling blocks to \nenactment of a bill. These barriers include:\n\n\n          Allocating any revenues that are derived from a bill\n\n  The Senate budget resolution calls for all revenues to be devoted to \nMedicare.\n  While the House has not completed work on its version, there are some \nin the House who believe that tobacco revenues should be used for more \ngeneral tax decreases.\n  Others suggest the tobacco revenues be used to help pay for health \ninsurance for low-income people.\n  A fourth approach is embodied in the President's budget, which \nadvances a number of new or expanded domestic spending programs that \nwill be financed with tobacco revenues.\n\n\n               Determining the final cost of the proposal\n\n  The bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee has an initial \nprice tag of $516 billion over the next 25 years, without any \ncalculation of the lookback provision, which naturally could push that \nprice tag much higher.\n  In contrast, the original settlement offered on June 20, 1997 was \n$368.5 billion.\n  Legitimate questions have been raised about the ability of various \nindustry players to pay a sum as high as $500 billion to $700 billion, \nwhich is what, extrapolated out, the Commerce bill could cost in the \nend.\n\n  Let's face it, as much as many would like to penalize this industry, \nwe are penalizing ourselves if we enact a new program predicated upon \nrevenues that won't be there.\n\n\n               Assessing the per pack or per can increase\n\n  A related question is the price per product increase that will result \nfrom the new industry payments.\n  A widely-reported figure is the Treasury Department's estimate that \nthe Commerce bill, for example, will result in a per cigarette \npack increase of $1.10 five years from now.\n\n  As the Judiciary Committee's hearing last week revealed, we do not \nknow the precise methodology the Administration used to make this price \nprojection. Deputy Secretary Summers told the Judiciary Committee last \nweek that he would provide us with the information that I requested, \nbut we are still waiting.\n  We do know that Wall Street experts, like David Adelman of Morgan \nStanley Dean Witter, Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney, and Gary \nBlack of Sanford C. Bernstein, have concluded that the Administration's \nprojections are far too low and that the true retail price of a pack of \ncigarettes--measured in constant 1997 dollars--will be in the \nneighborhood of $5 per pack in year 5, more than a $3 increase.\n  Under this scenario, the price per carton will shoot up $30. This \nincrease is almost twice as high, twice as fast, as the ``up to $1.50 \nper pack'' increase over 10 years called for by the President last \nSeptember.\n\n\n               Ascertaining the effect on law enforcement\n\n  The Treasury Department testified before the Judiciary Committee last \nweek that ``by closing the distribution chain for tobacco products, we \nwill be able to ensure that these products flow through legitimate \nchannels and effectively police any leakages that do take place.'' In \nfact, Deputy Secretary Summers said that with these regulatory \ncontrols, ``we do not expect a large-scale smuggling problem. . .''\n  Law enforcement officials at all levels with whom I have spoken are \nnot so sanguine. These are the officers who will be on the front lines, \npolicing against the violence, hijackings, smuggling, and other related \ncrimes that are inherent in any opportunity for a black market.\n  One officer with whom I spoke termed the Treasury statement \n``laughable.''\n\n\n          Developing a consensus on the agriculture provisions\n\n  One of the most unifying themes in the tobacco debate is the need to \nmake certain that we provide an adequate program to transition American \nfarmers out of tobacco production into other alternatives.\n  There are major divisions, however, on how to structure that program. \nThere are two major approaches in the Senate, one developed by our \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford (the ``LEAF'' Act), the other by \nour colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar.\n  The major difference between these two bills is that the Lugar bill \nterminates the tobacco price support program, while the LEAF bill does \nnot.\n  The final key difference is in determining the extent of the role of \nthe tobacco companies in any final legislation.\n  As many are aware, the Department of Justice has undertaken one or \nmore investigations related to tobacco companies.\n  If there have been violations of the law, they should be prosecuted \nto their\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\nfullest, and it behooves the Department to move forward on its \ninvestigations swiftly and conclusively.\n  But this specter of wrong-doing should not be allowed to cast such a \nshadow over the tobacco legislation that it becomes an excuse for \ninaction.\n  Some have castigated the companies for their departure from \ndirectionless congressional deliberations.\n  I do not believe that Congress needs the approval of the industry to \npass tobacco legislation.\n  As everyone knows, I am no friend of the tobacco industry or their \nproducts.\n  But, having made these points, as a legislator with a deep \nappreciation of the process of building consensus in our democratic \nsociety, I do believe that Congress would be wise to consider the \nperspectives of the tobacco industry in fashioning legislation.\n  This is true for one very fundamental reason: we want a program which \nworks, a program with which this tremendously-resourced, tremendously-\ncreative industry will comply.\n  Perhaps I am just not as smart as those who believe the companies \ncannot contribute anything constructive to the process.\n  When Congress is dramatically affecting a sector of the economy, as \nlong as that industry's products are legal, as long as they have a \nright to perform in our society, then that industry's views should be \nheard, no matter how much we don't like that industry.\n  That should not amount to a veto.\n  No outside group--not the tobacco companies, not the private \nattorneys, not the state attorney generals, not the public health \ngroups, not anyone--should expect or be granted a veto over this \nlegislation.\n  What all affected parties should get is a forum for their views, an \nopportunity to be heard. This is the very essence of democracy.\n  So I must ask those who pride themselves on not sitting down at the \ntable with this industry to reexamine this position.\n  I echo the suggestion that Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore \nmade a few weeks ago, that the President reconvene all of the original \nparticipants in these negotiations. Congress should be part of such \ntalks.\n  It just seems to me that beyond the purely public health issues, \ntobacco legislation has major social, political, and economic \ndimensions that argues for an inclusive process as possible.\n  Some 50 million Americans use these products. Public health experts \nalmost unanimously agree that we should not make them go cold turkey \novernight.\n  There is also the question of political philosophy of whether it is a \nproper role for the government to take away the freedom of adult \nAmericans to consume tobacco products.\n  Moreover, as a conservative, I am generally loath to endorse any type \nof new taxes. I am particularly sensitive about advocating a regressive \nscheme whereby the lower income segments of our society which have \ndisproportionately higher smoking rates are called upon, in essence, to \nfund social programs dictated by the political elites.\n  Tobacco revenue ought not be used to finance an explosion of new \nentitlements, a veritable ``honey pot'' of money to fund a mini Great \nSociety.\n  I am afraid that the President's approach in the budget strays down \nthis path by paying for child care and education initiatives with the \nas yet agreed upon and uncollected tobacco revenues.\n  To put it bluntly, the President has spent the money even before \nCongress has passed a bill.\n  Also from an economic standpoint, I am mindful that several million \ndecent, tax-paying, Americans are dependent, directly or indirectly, on \nthe tobacco industry for their livelihoods.\n  We have wisely, I think, sought to make an accommodation to the \nthousands of tobacco farmer families.\n  Do we not also have some similar responsibility to carefully consider \nthe economic interests of those who work on the loading docks at Philip \nMorris or sell cigarettes at the local gas station or 7-11 Store?\n  Still other of our citizens are shareholders in these firms or may be \ndependent on pension funds with substantial holdings of tobacco \nsecurities.\n  I note that Yale University, home of one of the most absolutist anti-\ntobacconists, Dr. David Kessler, recently voted not to divest its \ntobacco holdings from its endowment investment portfolio. To me, this \nsays a lot.\n  We in Congress and the Administration must take care not to engage in \na game of political one-upsmanship in which we all trip over ourselves \nin the race to show the public who is the toughest on tobacco.\n  We may find that in the quest to punish the black-hatted tobacco \nindustry we will have trampled over the interests and security of a lot \nof ordinary, hard-working Americans.\n  These are very hard questions to answer, but they are questions which \nmust be resolved before Congress can write a tobacco bill.\n  Ten days ago, I received a bipartisan letter from four of the State \nAttorneys General who participated in last year's settlement \nnegotiations.\n  This letter--which I believe is a serious effort to help Congress \nmake the corrections necessary before we consider the Commerce \nCommittee legislation--highlighted three areas of concern, three \nparticular areas in which Congress runs the risk of undermining the \nsettlement's objectives if it continues down the current road.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Colorado Department of Law,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                        Denver, CO, April 24, 1998\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We are pleased to respond to your \n     request for our legal views on pending tobacco legislation. \n     You have specifically asked us about any constitutional \n     concerns and the consequences. There are three key issues of \n     concern to us: 1. the difficulty of accomplishing several \n     provisions of the legislation without the industry's waiver \n     of constitutional challenges; 2. the potential for creating a \n     contraband market; and 3. potential bankruptcy of the \n     industry.\n       We are glad that Congress is now seriously focusing on \n     passing comprehensive tobacco legislation and that full \n     Senate consideration is likely in the near future. We have \n     appreciated the opportunity to work with you, Senator McCain, \n     and others throughout the hearing process and committee \n     consideration of tobacco issues. Your leadership in holding \n     the first Congressional hearings last year addressing the \n     legal complexities of the tobacco settlement was especially \n     helpful. We look forward to continuing to share whatever \n     insight and expertise we have gained from several years of \n     engaging in legal battles with the tobacco industry.\n       The landmark agreement reached on June 20, 1997, was not \n     perfect, but it includes critical themes which should provide \n     the framework for any Congressional action. Tobacco \n     legislation must be comprehensive. It must pass \n     constitutional muster so the war against teen smoking moves \n     to the streets and not the courthouse. And any financial \n     settlement must not bankrupt the industry and produce even \n     greater problems for the nation.\n       As lawyers, we believe that the industry's waiver of \n     constitutional challenges is necessary to accomplish many of \n     the public health goals within the bounds of the \n     Constitution. Losing the voluntary nature of the settlement \n     agreement may have severe legal repercussions. Therefore, the \n     following consequences should be considered:\n\n\n                           no consent decrees\n\n       Consent decrees are essential to ensure long-term \n     compliance by the industry with key elements of the \n     comprehensive package. Consent decrees, by definition, \n     require the consent of all parties to the litigation. If a \n     party does not agree to the terms of a proposed decree, then \n     the court cannot thrust a settlement upon the parties. \n     Theatre Time Clock Co., Inc. v. Motion Picture Advertising \n     Corp., 323 F. Supp. 172, 173 (E.D. La. 1971). Therefore, If \n     any party objects to a term contained within a proposed \n     consent decree, a court cannot order its acceptance. Flight \n     Transportation Corp. Securities Litigation v. Fox and Co., \n     794 F.2d 318, 321 (8th Cir. 1986). Consequently, if the \n     tobacco industry will not enter into the consent decrees, \n     particularly the advertising restrictions, corporate culture, \n     payments, and other enforcement mechanisms of the decree, the \n     lawsuits cannot be settled with assurance. The states will \n     lose those enforcement mechanisms that were contemplated to \n     be included in such consent decrees.\n\n\n                          look-back penalties\n\n       Penalties must have a direct relationship to the harm being \n     prevented. Penalties imposed by the government must be \n     ``rational in light of [their] purpose to punish what has \n     occurred and to deter its repetition.'' Pulla v. Amoco Oil \n     Company, 72 F.3d 648, 658 (8th Cir. 1995). Therefore, there \n     must be a reasonable relationship between the penalties \n     imposed and the harm likely to result from the defendant's \n     conduct as well as the harm that\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\n     has actually occurred. Id. at 659 (quoting TXO Prod. Corp. v. \n     Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443 (1993)).\n       Although the courts have not articulated any precise \n     formula for ascertaining the ``reasonableness'' of penalties, \n     Justice Scalia observed that the touchstone is the value of \n     the fine in relation to the particular offense. Austin v. \n     United States, 509 U.S. 602, 627 (1993) (Scalia, J., \n     concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). If there \n     is no reasonable relationship, the penalties would be \n     considered an excessive fine and would not withstand judicial \n     scrutiny. See generally TXO, 509 U.S. 443; Pulla, 72 F.3d \n     648.\n       The June 20 agreement with the tobacco industry had a \n     formula for the penalties imposed, which linked the actual \n     cost of a youth who begins smoking and the profit received \n     from that youth over the course of his life, to the amount of \n     the penalty. This demonstrates precisely the type of rational \n     relationship required by courts.\n       However, the proposed look-back penalty may not pass \n     judicial scrutiny. At $3.5 billion, the fines are the largest \n     imposed on any industry for any conduct. As originally \n     proposed, the penalties could be suspended if the \n     manufacturers made serious, good faith efforts to curb youth \n     smoking but, unfortunately, failed to successfully change the \n     behavior of teenagers. This approach provided a due process \n     review, rather than imposing penalties through strict \n     liability. Under the current Senate Commerce bill, the \n     companies will be penalized even if they make every \n     reasonable attempt to halt youth smoking.\n       A look-back penalty closely tied to tobacco company \n     behavior, or a penalty voluntarily agreed to by the \n     companies, is constitutionally sound and a valuable mechanism \n     for fighting youth smoking.\n\n\n                 advertising and marketing restrictions\n\n       The District court in Beahm v. U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration, 966 F.Supp. 1374 (M.D.N.C. 1997), held that \n     the FDA's regulations relating to restrictions on tobacco \n     advertising were beyond the authority of the FDA and, \n     therefore, were invalid. This case is currently on appeal to \n     the Fourth Circuit. Although that court has not yet ruled on \n     the validity of existing FDA advertising regulations, even if \n     it should find that those regulations are within the purview \n     of FDA control, the advertising and marketing restrictions \n     set forth in the June 20th agreement may not survive First \n     Amendment review. This is in part because the restrictions \n     envisioned by the June 20 agreement are much more expansive \n     than the FDA restrictions currently being litigated. The \n     total ban on outdoor advertising, black and white only ads, \n     prohibition on Internet advertising, and prohibition on event \n     sponsorship are but a few examples of the marketing and \n     advertising restrictions contained in the June 20 agreement, \n     implemented by the voluntary Master Settlement Agreement, \n     Protocol and consent decree.\n       It has been recognized that the First Amendment ``directs \n     us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to \n     keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to \n     be their own good.'' Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 116 \n     S.Ct. 1495, 1508 (1996). Furthermore, even communications \n     that do no more than propose a commercial transaction are \n     entitled to the coverage of the First Amendment. Id. In \n     recognition of the seriousness of this issue, the Supreme \n     Court has stated that ``when a State entirely prohibits the \n     dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages \n     for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair \n     bargaining process,'' strict scrutiny is applicable. Id. at \n     1506. Consequently, in order to survive judicial review, the \n     government must demonstrate that its restriction on speech \n     was no more extensive than necessary. Id. at 1509. Because of \n     this heavy burden, ``speech prohibitions of this type rarely \n     survive constitutional review.'' Id. at 1508.\n       Although the June 20 agreement with the tobacco companies \n     does not propose a total ban on advertising, its \n     expansiveness may nonetheless cause a reviewing court to \n     apply the strict scrutiny review utilized in Liquormart. As \n     that court recognized, not all commercial speech regulations \n     are subject to a similar form of constitutional review. Id. \n     at 1507. Therefore, when a state regulates commercial \n     messages to protect consumers from deceptive, misleading, or \n     otherwise harmful advertisements, ``less than strict review'' \n     is appropriate. Id. However, because the advertisements \n     forbidden by the June 20 restrictions would have presumably \n     been truthful in nature and the restrictions are being \n     implemented for purposes other than protecting the bargaining \n     process, it seems likely that this less stringent standard of \n     review would be inapplicable. Consequently, the government \n     would have to demonstrate that there were no less intrusive \n     means available to accomplish their goals. As the court in \n     Liquormart recognized, application of this standard usually \n     acts as the death knell for government restrictions. Id. at \n     1508.\n       In this same vein, the restrictions included in the June 20 \n     agreement could probably not be characterized as time, place \n     or manner of expression restrictions, which carry with them a \n     less stringent standard of review. Specifically, such bans \n     are content neutral. See generally Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. \n     77 (1949). Conversely, the bans envisioned in the agreement \n     are obviously content driven.\n       In sum, the expansiveness of the proposed advertising \n     restrictions as well as the high burden that must be met in \n     order to justify such restrictions, raise serious concerns \n     that without the industry's voluntary consent and \n     participation, the advertising prohibitions envisioned in the \n     June 20 agreement may not survive First Amendment scrutiny.\n       Additionally, the June 20 agreement incorporated the FDA \n     regulations, which, if overturned by the Fourth Circuit, \n     would also be unavailable as a regulatory mechanism. While it \n     is true that the industry would have some incentive to limit \n     its advertising and marketing to achieve the look back \n     requirements, if the look back penalties are also found to be \n     legally deficient, their value as an incentive would be \n     eliminated.\n\n\nadvertising restrictions against retailers, distributors, wholesalers, \n                       and advertising businesses\n\n       The June 20 agreement contemplated that the participating \n     companies would police their retailers, wholesalers, \n     distributors, and advertising agencies by contract and by \n     refraining from placing ads with them. These voluntary \n     implementation mechanisms were to be built into the Master \n     Settlement Agreement, Protocol and consent decrees. However, \n     any legislation that could be unconstitutional as to the \n     industry could also be unconstitutional as to the related \n     agents. Therefore, the same First Amendment issues that could \n     preclude the government from instituting blanket prohibitions \n     on advertising by tobacco manufacturers may also preclude \n     prohibitions affecting industry agents.\n\n\n                          document disclosure\n\n       The public depository of documents set forth in the June 20 \n     agreement presumed some level of voluntary participation on \n     the part of the tobacco industry. While documents filed in \n     court, or otherwise made available to the public, can \n     certainly be put in a central public depository, it is \n     questionable that the industry can be required to release \n     documents not otherwise available, including documents it \n     considers privileged or confidential, as well as any future \n     documents or research.\n       Obviously, almost any American business would object to the \n     government seizing its internal corporate documents and \n     opening them for inspection. The depository raises both \n     private property and search and seizure concerns.\n       The Fifth Amendment provides in part: ``nor shall private \n     property be taken for public use, without just \n     compensation.'' U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 5. It has been widely \n     recognized that the property to which this amendment applies \n     is that which ``is made up of mutually reinforcing \n     understandings that are sufficiently well grounded to support \n     a claim of entitlement.'' Nixon v. U.S., 978 F.2d 1269, 1275 \n     (1992) (recognizing that former President had a property \n     interest in presidential papers). Those property interests \n     may be created in a myriad of ways, including uniform custom \n     and practice. Id. at 1276.\n       Accordingly, the documents that were to be deposited by the \n     tobacco companies in a public depository constitute \n     ``property'' for Fifth Amendment purposes. This conclusion is \n     consistent with the district court's decision in Nika Corp. \n     v. City of Kansas City, 582 F. Supp. 343 (W.D. Mo. 1983), \n     wherein it was held that a corporation's documents \n     constituted ``property'' invoking Fifth Amendment \n     protections. See also U.S. v. Dauphin Deposit Trust Co., 385 \n     F.2d 129 (3rd Cir. 1967) (trust company had a property \n     interest in various business records). In Nika the court held \n     that the government could not confiscate particular business \n     documents without providing for a method of compensation for \n     such taking. Id. Although the court found that there were \n     adequate means provided in that case, this clearly \n     demonstrates that corporate documents constitute ``property'' \n     for Fifth Amendment purposes, thereby invoking the necessity \n     for compensation when the government takes such for public \n     purposes. Consequently, there is a strong possibility the \n     tobacco companies could not be compelled to deposit the \n     documents specified in the June 20 agreement without just \n     compensation.\n       Furthermore, if the Fifth Amendment protects the industry \n     from being required to hand over to the government all of its \n     documents, it seems that it would also protect them from \n     being required to pay the costs of the depository, unless the \n     costs are somehow built into other licensing fees.\n       The tobacco companies would almost certainly raise \n     objections based on case or controversy and standing against \n     individuals wishing to challenge a decision by the companies \n     to withhold documents. Under Article III, Sec. 2 of the \n     Constitution, the federal courts have jurisdiction over \n     disputes only where there is a ``case'' or ``controversy.'' \n     Raines v. Byrd, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 2317 (1997). One element of \n     that test requires the complainant to establish that they \n     have standing to sue. Id. This requires the complainant to \n     demonstrate that he has suffered a personal injury fairly \n     traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct * * \n     *.' Id. Therefore, any individual wishing to protest tobacco \n     companies' refusal to disclose documents would have to \n     establish that they were injured by such refusal Presumably, \n     the only means of doing so would be to assert that the \n     refusal negatively impacted their own personal pending \n     litigation with a particular tobacco company. However, this \n     would be difficult to demonstrate because a tobacco company's \n     refusal to deposit documents in a public depository is not \n     the equivalent of refusing to produce those documents in a \n     particular action. Consequently, any individual\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\n     wishing to protest the tobacco companies' refusal to disclose \n     documents might have to wait until their own suit was filed, \n     motions for discovery were made, and a particular tobacco \n     company refused to comply, before they would have standing on \n     this issue. Even then, they might not be able to demonstrate \n     that they were somehow injured by the tobacco company's \n     refusal to place such documents in a public depository.\n       One of the primary benefits to individual claimants of \n     having the industry documents placed in a public depository, \n     aside from having ready access to the documents, is the \n     voluntary agreement of the companies not to challenge the \n     authenticity of the documents when they are offered as \n     evidence in individual trials. The companies are now well-\n     known for fighting vigorous evidentiary battles. If the \n     industry does not enter into the voluntary agreements, one \n     can also assume that they will challenge the introduction of \n     these documents in individual trials, resulting in \n     considerably more expense for the plaintiffs than was \n     envisioned under the June 20 agreement.\n\n\n                               contraband\n\n       As law enforcement officials of the states, we are also \n     concerned about the danger of creating a contraband market \n     for tobacco products. Our children will not be helped by \n     creating a new product line for organized crime, nor by \n     providing a new entry market for drug dealers. Additionally, \n     the adverse health consequences of smoking cigarettes \n     produced in unregulated foreign or clandestine domestic \n     markets are likely to be even more significant than \n     cigarettes produced by the existing U.S. companies.\n       The experience of the states with relatively high tax rates \n     on tobacco products has been studied in some detail. Revenues \n     lost to smuggling cigarettes into these states has been a \n     major concern. This is estimated to be a $1 billion per year \n     problem nationwide. In 1988 California increased its tobacco \n     tax from 18 cents to 35 cents per pack and today the \n     contraband market is estimated to be between 17.2 and 23% of \n     cigarettes sold. Michigan increased its cigarette tax in 1994 \n     from 25 cents to 35 cents a pack. Michigan lost an estimated \n     $144.5 million per year in tax revenue. Washington State \n     increased its tax in 1997 to 82.5 cents per pack, and lost an \n     estimated $110 million a year to smuggling. New York State, \n     with a 56 cent state tax estimates it is losing about $300 \n     million of tax revenue per year due to smuggling. The typical \n     scenario after a state makes a significant increase in its \n     cigarette tax is a decrease in sales in that state, but a \n     marked increase in sales in neighboring states. Smoking rates \n     in the higher-tax state typically remain the same, so the \n     increase in sales reflects purchases to take into the higher-\n     tax state.\n       There is a definite correlation between tax rates and the \n     level of smuggling. For many years, the differential in tax \n     rates on tobacco products was mainly an interstate problem \n     with contraband products being smuggled into those states \n     with the highest tax rates. The problem has now reached \n     international proportions. At first, popular American brands \n     were smuggled into other countries. We are now seeing that as \n     tobacco taxes rise nationwide, foreign manufactured \n     cigarettes and other products are being smuggled into the \n     United States.\n\n\n                               bankruptcy\n\n       Finally, we believe it to be in the best interests of \n     accomplishing the broad public health goals of legislation to \n     avoid bankruptcy of the tobacco industry.\n       Critics of the June 20 settlement have suggested that \n     bankruptcy is not a great risk. This industry has a history \n     of annual domestic profits. For example in 1996 Philip Morris \n     and RJR (76 percent of the market) had domestic profits of \n     $6.3 billion. While it is not possible to determine precisely \n     the market value of the domestic tobacco companies (not the \n     parent companies), it is possible to estimate their market \n     value--if they were sold today. The stock of the Nabisco Food \n     Company, which is 80.5 percent owned by RJR, trades publicly. \n     This allows an extrapolation of the value which the market \n     places on RJR's tobacco operations. That value is $1.184 \n     billion. Part of that is comprised of international \n     operations and part is domestic. Foreign tobacco companies \n     like Imperial and Gallaher trade at price earning rations of \n     10 to 11. If one uses a 10.5 P/E for Reynolds' international \n     earnings, Reynolds' domestic operations have a negative \n     market value of $1.1196 billion. Using similar valuation \n     methods for the other companies, Brown & Williamson is worth \n     a negative $240 million; Lorillard is worth a positive $641 \n     million and Philip Morris USA is positive $3.855 billion. If \n     one were to ignore the fact that foreign tobacco companies \n     trade at P/E's higher than the imputed value of domestic \n     companies and assume identical valuation of domestic and \n     foreign companies, the entire domestic industry could be \n     worth as much as $21.484 billion. On this basis, the total \n     market of the industry (both foreign and domestic) is \n     estimated to be less than $50 billion. Liability to the \n     states alone exceed several hundred billion dollars. The \n     conclusion is obvious--this is an industry that produces \n     significant cash but has questionable inherent value as many \n     industry assets cannot be converted to other uses and have \n     little value outside the tobacco environment.\n       State Attorneys General do not seek financial ruin of any \n     industry. It is our job to bring about compliance with the \n     laws and that is what we seek from the tobacco companies. \n     This is an industry that sells a legal product, employs \n     thousands of people, and provides a living to many more, \n     ranging from farmers to retailers. Our goal has been to hold \n     the industry accountable for its actions, and to provide for \n     significant public health gains. If the current companies are \n     liquidated, new companies can be expected to step into the \n     breach, within or outside this country. We would have \n     virtually no claims against these replacement tobacco \n     companies for past industry practices. Further, foreign \n     tobacco companies (possibly with manufacturing operations \n     abroad) might immediately step in to satisfy US demand for \n     cigarettes. This, of course, could hurt our farming \n     communities and those whose employment depends on this \n     industry.\n       In conclusion, we appreciate your interest and efforts to \n     move comprehensive legislation forward. We are concerned that \n     the fundamental goal of reducing youth smoking may be lost in \n     the current political rhetoric. It's time for action and for \n     comprehensive legislation to achieve this goal now, not after \n     years of additional litigation and debate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gale A. Norton,\n       Attorney General,\n       State of Colorado.\n     Betty D. Montgomery,\n       Attorney General,\n       State of Ohio.\n     Jan Graham,\n       Attorney General,\n       State of Utah.\n     Christine O. Gregoire,\n       Attorney General,\n       State of Washington.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. In brief, the concerns highlighted in this letter from the \nAttorneys General of Colorado, Ohio, Utah and Washington are:\n  (1) The difficulties created by enacting legislation without the \nindustry's voluntary waiver of several constitutional prerogatives.\n  The Generals raise specific legal concerns about attempting to \nlegislate in the absence of consent decrees and other voluntary \nagreements with the industry.\n  These concerns go to several major features of any comprehensive \nbill: advertising and marketing restrictions (including restrictions \naffecting retailers, distributors, and advertisers); look back \npenalties; and document disclosure.\n  We should also take to heart General Mike Moore's observation that, \nin the nearly three years since it was first proposed, the FDA's rule \non tobacco advertising has not gone into effect.\n  We all know the cause: litigation.\n  But by settling the lawsuit, in Mississippi, there is no billboard \nadvertising today, a result that goes far beyond the FDA rule and what \nthe Constitution would permit us to do legislatively.\n  (2) The second concern of the Attorneys General is the untoward \neffect that the potential bankruptcy of the tobacco industry would \nentail. Let me be clear about my position on this.\n  I would like nothing more than for the tobacco industry to pay a \ntrillion dollars. But I also want an anti-tobacco program which works. \nAll of the bills before Congress have in common a serious effort to \ncurtail youth tobacco use. All of the bills rely on industry payments \nto fund those efforts.\n\n  If we bankrupt the companies, or if we drive them offshore, \nultimately no one wins, because we need the industry payments to fund \nthe massive anti-tobacco program the American public wants. Without \nthat funding source, the whole program goes down the drain.\n  If the companies become bankrupt or move offshore, it is a whole new \nball game, and one which we cannot control.\n  It would be more intellectually honest just to ban tobacco.\n  On this subject, the AGs' letter said:\n\n     State Attorneys General do not seek financial ruin of any \n     industry. It is our job to bring about compliance with the \n     laws and that is what we seek from the tobacco companies. \n     This is an industry that sells a legal product, employs \n     thousands of people, and provides a living to many more, \n     ranging from farmers to retailers. Our goal has been to hold \n     the industry accountable for its actions, and to provide for \n     significant public health gains. If the current companies are \n     liquidated, new companies can be expected to step into the \n     breach, within or outside this country. We would have \n     virtually no claims against these replacement companies for \n     past industry practices. Further, foreign tobacco companies \n     (possibly with manufacturing operations abroad) might \n     immediately step in to satisfy U.S. demand for cigarettes. \n     This, of course, could hurt our farming communities and those \n     whose employment depends on this industry.\n\n  (3) The third major point of concern for the Attorneys General is the \npotential for increasing the black market for illegal contraband \ncigarettes.\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\n  A recent case study from Alaska is illustrative. Five months ago, \nAlaska increased its cigarette tax from 29 cents to one dollar. From \nall we know about nicotine addiction, the resulting decrease in sales \ncannot be explained by sudden cessation. Rather, it appears that legal \nsales were replaced in part by black market cigarettes. The Alaskan \nlegislature is considering rolling back some of the tobacco taxes.\n\n  With respect to the issue of contraband the AGs' letter says:\n\n     As law enforcement officials of the states, we are also \n     concerned about the danger of creating a contraband market \n     for tobacco products. Our children will not be helped by \n     creating a new product line for organized crime, nor by \n     providing a new entry market for drug dealers. Additionally, \n     the adverse health consequences of smoking cigarettes \n     produced in unregulated foreign or clandestine markets are \n     likely to be even more significant than cigarettes produced \n     by the existing U.S. companies . . .\n\n  The letter from the AGs notes that the cigarette contraband problem \nis already a $1 billion nationally. For example, the AGs provide an \nestimate that in the state of California--which raised its state \ntobacco tax in 1988 from 18 cents to 35 cents a pack--that today \nbetween 17% and 23% are smuggled. That's about 1 in every 5 cigarettes.\n  The AG's letter goes on to say:\n\n     There is a definite correlation between tax rates and the \n     level of smuggling. For many years, the differential in tax \n     rates on tobacco taxes was mainly an interstate problem with \n     contraband products being smuggled into those states with the \n     highest tax rates. The problem has now reached international \n     proportions. At first, popular American brands were smuggled \n     into other countries. We are now seeing that as tobacco taxes \n     rise nationwide, foreign manufactured cigarettes and other \n     products are being smuggled into the United States.\n\n  I have also received letters from a number of law enforcement \norganizations, whose thousands of members will be expected to provide \nthe first line of defense against these smugglers. These law \nenforcement officers are extremely apprehensive that passage of \nthis legislation will precipitate the emergence of a thriving black \nmarket in cigarettes, posing huge problems for law enforcement at every \nlevel. They say the Commerce bill, in particular, will inevitably lead \nto the creation of a massive black market, giving organized crime a new \nline of business and undermining not only respect for the rule of law, \nbut also the real goal of the legislation, preventing underage tobacco \nuse.\n\n  I might also add that one of the most frightening outcomes of a new \nblack market would be the likelihood that children will find it easier \nthan ever to purchase tobacco products.\n  One of government's principal responsibilities is to help families \nand communities keep children from smoking. A large, lucrative black \nmarket could have the unintended consequences of making parents' job \nharder.\n  It is not too hard to envision unregulated cigarettes being sold on \nliterally every street corner.\n  In response to this concern we have been told by the Administration \nnot to worry because the system contemplated by the Commerce Committee \nbill is a closed system.\n  When our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, asked a series \nof questions about this black market she was repeatedly told about this \npurported closed system.\n  I believe that Senator Feinstein shares my concern about the \ngovernment's ability to design a ``closed system,'' given our \nexperience with guarding the nation's borders and safeguarding our \nchildren in the costly and never-ending battle against illicit drugs.\n  I share Senator's Feinstein's pointed remarks on this issue because \nI, too, simply do not believe that this closed system will prove so \neasy to implement.\n  It seems to me that the real question for policymakers is this. Given \nthese facts, how can we shape a comprehensive national tobacco control \nstrategy that can help prevent the next generation of young Americans \nfrom choosing to use tobacco and help those already addicted to stop?\n  In my view, most of the essential elements for answering this \nquestion can be found in the proposed global tobacco settlement \nannounced last June 20th.\n\n  In return for funding a comprehensive anti-tobacco education and \ncessation program with an unprecedented payment of $368.5 billion \nspread over 25 years, under the agreement the industry would be granted \na measure of financial certainty and predictability by settling a \nseries of pending lawsuits.\n  Now, almost 11 months after that settlement was proposed, it still \nholds forth the best model for comprehensive legislation which can be \nenacted this year.\n  It contains the limited liability provisions which are necessary to \nevoke tobacco industry compliance with the program.\n  The President's most senior representatives have said, both publicly \nand privately, that they would not oppose some version of those \nprovisions in a bill which was otherwise acceptable. It is not the \nbreaking point some assert it to be.\n  The AGs' proposal also avoids some of the pitfalls inherent in \nlegislation currently being discussed. For example, it will pass \nConstitutional scrutiny.\n  At some point, you have to stand up for some principles like the \nFirst Amendment's protection of commercial speech--a principle that, \naccording to virtually every constitutional law expert that has \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee, will be subject to court \nintervention if advertising and promotion restrictions of tobacco \nproducts are written into a federal statute.\n  For example, noted First Amendment practitioner Floyd Abrams has \nstated that attempting to codify the existing FDA rule--currently in \nheld in abeyance pending further judicial proceedings in the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, would run afoul of First Amendment \nprotection.\n  By virtually insisting that the Commerce Committee codify the FDA \nrule, the Administration is risking a protracted Constitutional battle \nover advertising provisions that industry will voluntary go far beyond.\n  Still others point out that, absent industry agreement by contract \nand consent decree, it will be unconstitutional to require so-called \nindustry lookback penalties if certain tobacco reduction targets are \nnot met.\n  Mr. President, these are issues that concern me very much.\n  They are issues which merit serious study, and then concerted action, \nbut they should not be stumbling blocks to enactment of a final bill.\n  I am alarmed.\n  I see the sands racing through the hourglass as we move toward \nadjournment, but I do not see consensus emerging on the shape of \ntobacco legislation.\n  Indeed, I see the Congress increasingly polarized, as members race \ninto either one of two camps: the ``keep-upping-the-ante'' faction, \nthose who will ``pile on'' any punitive bill, or the ``minimalist \napproach'' contingent.\n  The result of this polarity is a paralysis which cannot be breached \nuntil we realize we are jeopardizing our effectiveness through \npoliticization.\n  Surely there is a middle ground, a basis for legislation which \nfocuses on our real target--weaning a generation of kids off of \nnicotine--not on the politics of punishment.\n  These political games not only disappoint those we represent, but \nalso, as I have outlined, punish them as well.\n  We owe our kids, and we owe their parents, hard-working Americans in \nevery state, so much, much more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4226-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4231-S4234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RELEASE OF WINDOWS 98\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am told that this afternoon in New York \nCity Bill Gates and a number of other executives from throughout the \ncomputer and software industries will be holding a press conference \nurging law enforcement officials not to interfere with the release of \nWindows 98.\n  I certainly do not begrudge Mr. Gates or others in the industry to \nmake their views known. That is what makes our democracy work. Indeed, \nI would like nothing more than to see more enlightened debate on this \nterribly important policy issue. But I cannot help but wonder how many \nof these executives are on that stage because they truly want to be. It \nstrikes me as curious that it was only after calls from Microsoft that \nmany of these individuals saw fit to sign letters and make public \nappearances. Indeed, I have been told that some executives in fact hope \nto see the Justice Department pursue further its case against \nMicrosoft, but\n\n[[Page S4232]]\n\nhave chosen to join Mr. Gates on that stage today because they feel \nthey have little choice but do so in order not to jeopardize their \nrelationship with the industry's most powerful and important player. I \nunderstand perfectly well that no one would publicly admit as much, \nbut, given recent developments, I do believe it is a question worth \nconsidering.\n  But, I also think it is timely to review where we stand today as the \nJustice Department considers whether to bring a broader suit alleging \nanti-competitive or monopolistic practices by Microsoft.\n  I first raised the question of Microsoft's seemingly exclusionary \nlicensing practices last November. While we are not privy to all of the \nlicensing and other practices the Justice Department has been \nscrutinizing, over the past few months a number of specific practices \nhave come to light. In particular, we have learned that Microsoft not \nonly tied the shipment of its browser, Internet Explorer, to its \nmonopoly operating system, Windows, but also engaged in a series of \nlicensing practices with respect to computer makers, Internet Service \nProviders, and Internet Content Providers which appear designed not to \nserve consumers but rather to exclude competing browser companies from \nthe marketplace. For a company with a monopoly in the personal computer \noperating system market--and nobody other than Microsoft would dispute \nthat the firm has monopoly power--to use its monopoly power to exclude \npotential rivals clearly raises serious antitrust concerns.\n  Let me point out that such seemingly predatory and exclusionary \npractices raise concerns for even the most conservative, free-market \nantitrust thinkers. Judge Robert Bork, one of the most brilliant and \nhighly respected conservative antitrust thinkers, and author of the \nrenowned ``Antitrust Paradox,'' just yesterday explained in The New \nYork Times why even he is troubled by what he has learned of \nMicrosoft's practices. As Judge Bork wrote:\n\n       [w]hen a monopolist employs practices and makes agreements \n     that exclude competitors and does so without the \n     justification that the practices and agreements benefit \n     consumers, the company is guilty . . . of an attempt to \n     monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. When \n     its own documents display a clear intent to monopolize \n     through such means, the case is cold.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 4, 1998]\n\n                      What Antitrust Is All About\n\n                          (By Robert H. Bork)\n\n       Washington.--Rarely does a prospective antitrust case roil \n     public passion. But since it became known that I represent a \n     company urging the Justice Department to challenge certain of \n     Microsoft's business practices, my mail has certainly livened \n     up. One letter writer complained that I had sold my ``sole.'' \n     His spelling aside, that writer was at least kinder than the \n     one who labeled me senile.\n       There seems to be a widespread impression that the \n     Microsoft controversy should be resolved by an ideological \n     litmus test: liberals are bent on punishing success, and \n     conservatives must defend Bill Gates' company from any \n     application of the antitrust laws. But the question is not \n     one of politics or ideology; it is one of law and economics. \n     And that is why an outspoken free marketeer like me can be \n     found arguing against Microsoft.\n       Indeed, in Congress and among the players, liberals and \n     conservatives, Democrats and Republicans are found on each \n     side of the controversy. What, then, is the complaint of the \n     many companies that are urging action by the Justice \n     Department?\n       These companies--customers as well as rivals of Microsoft--\n     challenge some of Microsoft's business practices as \n     predatory, intended to preserve the company's monopoly of \n     personal computer operating systems through practices that \n     exclude or severely hinder rivals but do not benefit \n     consumers. Microsoft's effort to maintain and expand a market \n     dominance that now stands at 90 to 95 percent violates \n     traditional antitrust principles. Specifically, it violates \n     Section 2 of the Sherman Act, territory visited decades ago \n     by the Supreme Court.\n       The case, from 1951, was Lorain Journal Company v. United \n     States, and the Court's ruling is directly on point. The \n     Journal, in the Court's description of the case, ``enjoyed a \n     substantial monopoly in Lorain, Ohio, of the mass \n     dissemination of news and advertising.'' The daily newspaper \n     had 99 percent coverage in the town.\n       ``Those factors,'' the Court said, ``made The Journal an \n     indispensable medium of advertising for many Lorain \n     concerns.'' A minor threat to The Journal's monopoly arose, \n     however, with the establishment of radio station WEOL in a \n     nearby town. The newspaper responded by refusing to accept \n     local advertising from any Lorain County advertiser that used \n     WEOL.\n       The Supreme Court called that an attempt to monopolize, \n     illegal under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. There being no \n     apparent efficiency justification for The Journal's \n     action--that is, no evidence that it resulted in an \n     operation whose efficiency somehow benefited consumers--it \n     was deemed predatory. To those who say I have altered my \n     longstanding position to represent an opponent of \n     Microsoft, I'm happy to note that 20 years ago I wrote \n     that the Lorain Journal case had been correctly decided.\n       The parallel between The Journal's action and Microsoft's \n     behavior is exact. Microsoft has a similarly overwhelming \n     market share, and it imposes conditions on those with whom it \n     deals that exclude rivals without any apparent justification \n     on the grounds of efficiency. In fact, the case against \n     Microsoft is stronger, for there are many documents in the \n     public domain that make clear that Microsoft specifically \n     intended to crush competition.\n       We may not yet know all of the exclusionary practices, but \n     we do know many. Here's a sampler:\n       Microsoft's operating system licenses have forbidden \n     ``original equipment manufacturers''--makers of personal \n     computers--to alter the first display screen from that \n     required by Microsoft. Microsoft thus controls what the \n     consumer sees. This restriction also hampers consumers' use \n     of competing browsers to search the Internet or to serve as \n     an alternative platform for other programs.\n       Microsoft has restrained Internet service providers and on-\n     line services, which are forced to deal with Microsoft \n     because of its monopoly in the Windows system. For instance, \n     it has forbidden service providers to advertise or promote \n     any non-Microsoft Web browser or even mention that such a \n     browser is available. Netscape and others are denied an \n     important distribution channel to consumers.\n       Companies that provide content on the Internet, to gain \n     access to Microsoft's screen display, have been forced to \n     agree not to promote content developed for competing \n     platforms.\n       When a monopolist employs practices and makes agreements \n     that exclude competitors and does so without the \n     justification that the practices and agreements benefit \n     consumers, the company is guilty, as was The Lorain Journal, \n     of an attempt to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the \n     Sherman Act. When its own documents display a clear intent to \n     monopolize through such means, the case is cold.\n       Netscape and the other companies seeking an end to these \n     practices are not asking the Justice Department to take any \n     action that would interfere in the slightest with Microsoft's \n     ability to innovate. The department is simply being asked to \n     stop Microsoft from stifling the innovations of others. The \n     object is to create a level playing field benefiting \n     consumers. That is what antitrust is about--a view that \n     should require no one to sell his ``sole.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Anyone who knows Judge Bork knows that he would never take \nthe position he has taken were he not convinced that it was 100 percent \nconsistent with the antitrust views he has long espoused.\n  Similarly, Daniel Oliver, former chairman of the Federal Trade \nCommission under President Reagan, just published a piece in the May 4 \nedition of The National Review. Mr. Oliver, long known as a free-market \nproponent who generally opposes all but the most justified government \nintervention in the marketplace, had this to say:\n\n       If ever there was a case that raises consumer-welfare \n     issues, this would seem to be it. Microsoft has a 90 per cent \n     share of a world market; there are reasons to think that \n     share will endure; Microsoft has engaged in restrictive \n     practices; and many of those practices do not appear to have \n     any efficiency justifications that would benefit consumers \n     rather than the company. Where you find a dead body, a bloody \n     knife, fingerprints, and a motive, there may have been a \n     crime.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article as well be printed in the \nRecord, along with a personal letter I received several weeks ago from \nMr. Oliver and from Mr. James Miller, also a former chairman of the \nFederal Trade Commission and director of the Office of Management and \nBudget under President Reagan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the National Review, May 4, 1998]\n\n                      Necessary Gateskeeping . . .\n\n\n   does antitrust law protect consumer welfare, or punish the firms \n                           consumers prefer?\n\n                           (By Daniel Oliver)\n\n       The Department of Justice is pursuing Microsoft on \n     antitrust grounds, and a number of conservative writers and \n     organizations have gone to Microsoft's defense, including the \n     Wall Street Journal, Jack Kemp, Adam Thierer of the Heritage \n     Foundation, Thomas\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\n     Sowell--and National Review. They proclaim that the free \n     market is a better protector of consumer welfare than \n     government; and their visceral distrust of government \n     activity is welcome in this post-the-era-of-big-government-\n     is-over era. But for antitrust cases, which are complex and \n     fact-specific, the head is a better guide than the viscera.\n       The charges against the Justice Department's lawyers are \n     familiar--and all the more persuasive because government \n     lawyers have certainly been guilty of such things in the \n     past. They are accused of arrogant industrial planning, \n     micromanaging, trying to second-guess the market and pick \n     winners, supporting Microsoft's competitors rather than \n     competition, and going off on a leftward regulatory lurch. \n     However, even if all those charges against the Justice \n     Department were true, there could still be a case against \n     Microsoft that would benefit consumers.\n       The central problem the critics of the Justice Department \n     have to deal with is that Microsoft probably has ``market \n     power''--or the ability to threaten consumer welfare. (Market \n     power is determined by looking at market share and a \n     company's ability to maintain it.) Microsoft has \n     approximately 90 percent of the world market for PC operating \n     systems. In a large market--the world--90 percent is huge.\n       But the critics are reluctant to concede the importance--or \n     even the existence--of Microsoft's large market share. One \n     critic claims the appropriate market in which to measure \n     Microsoft's share is the entire $570-billion computer \n     industry, of which Microsoft controls only a small portion. \n     Alternatively, he suggests that the appropriate market is all \n     software, of which Microsoft produces only 4 percent. In \n     antitrust whoever defines the market controls the debate. If \n     you define the market broadly enough, no one company will \n     ever seem to have enough power to harm consumer welfare.\n       Some of the Justice Department's critics maintain that \n     Microsoft's large market share is irrelevant by claiming that \n     barriers to entry into the software business are low, and \n     that we can expect competitors to come along and unseat \n     any incumbent monopolist.\n       The software industry, however, is characterized by \n     extremely low marginal costs. Unlike the second automobile \n     off an assembly line, the second copy of a new software \n     program costs virtually nothing to produce--which gives \n     established companies a tremendous advantage over their \n     competitors. In addition, what economists call ``network \n     effects'' make entry into the software business difficult. \n     The more people there are who use a particular computer \n     system, the more valuable that system will be--and the more \n     difficult it will be for the producer of a new product to get \n     it accepted by the ``installed base'' of consumers using both \n     the established product (the operating system) and the \n     ancillary products (software written for that system). The \n     unprecedented economies of scale resulting from low to no \n     marginal cost for production combined with network effects \n     make the ``natural'' barriers to entry into the software \n     market substantial.\n       The fact is, Microsoft seems to have a monopoly (i.e., \n     market power), and that should be a source of concern to \n     consumers--not because Bill Gates might turn out to be an \n     evil genius, but because he will be inclined to behave like--\n     a monopolist.\n       Microsoft may have earned its monopoly in operating systems \n     by providing a product preferred by most customers. But can \n     we say the same thing about its share of, say, the word-\n     processing market? In 1995, WordPerfect was the most popular \n     word-processing program, with 60 per cent of the market. \n     Today WordPerfect is down to 13 per cent, and Microsoft's MS \n     Word has about 80 per cent. That's a remarkable shift of \n     consumer preferences.\n       How did Microsoft do it? Did consumers find it difficult to \n     run WordPerfect on Microsoft's operating system? Suppose, \n     hypothetically, that Microsoft used its monopoly position in \n     operating systems to make WordPerfect work less perfectly, \n     with the intention, and result, of driving people from \n     WordPerfect to Microsoft's own word-processing product. It \n     shouldn't take a left-winger to spot the consumer harm. \n     Consumers would be denied real choice.\n       The point is not that Microsoft has misused its position, \n     but that if Microsoft is in a position to misuse its \n     position, consumers, and their champions at the Justice \n     Department, should be concerned.\n       The current concern is that Microsoft might use its \n     position in the operating-systems market to: (1) monopolize \n     access to Internet content; (2) monopolize the market for web \n     browsers; or (3) maintain its current share of the operating \n     systems market by making sure that other web-browser products \n     will not, when combined with Internet applications, amount to \n     an alternative operating system. If Microsoft succeeds in any \n     of those endeavors, consumers will be harmed by not being \n     free to choose other products.\n       Bill Gates ``scoffs'' at rivals' charges of anti-\n     competitive behavior and ``bristles'' at the mention of the \n     word monopoly. But the evidence suggests that Microsoft has \n     routinely engaged in sharp-elbow practices that seem designed \n     to preserve or extend its monopoly. Under repeated \n     questioning at a Senate hearing in March, Gates finally \n     conceded--for the first time publicly--that Microsoft puts \n     restrictions in its contracts that bar some of the websites \n     featured in its Internet software from promoting Netscape or \n     being included in Netscape's rival listing. Microsoft has \n     also required computer manufacturers to pay license fees for \n     products even if they didn't install them. Once they have \n     paid for the Microsoft product, they will have less incentive \n     to pay for a competing product. That makes it more difficult \n     for competitors to sell to the computer manufacturers.\n       The Justice Department's action is designed to assist \n     competition and innovation. A software geek with a new idea, \n     or the investors he goes to for seed capital, may rightly \n     fear that, even if he can get to production, his product will \n     be duplicated by Microsoft and then bundled into its \n     operating system. While he might develop property rights that \n     would be protected by the intellectual-property laws, he is \n     not likely to have the cash to assert those rights against \n     monopoly-rich Microsoft.\n       There are three policy options for dealing with monopolies: \n     outlaw all monopolies; allow monopolies to function \n     completely unfettered; or allow monopolies to exist but with \n     some limitations on what they can do. U.S. public policy has \n     selected the third option in the belief that it will produce \n     more consumer welfare than the others.\n       If ever there was a case that raised consumer-welfare \n     issues, this would seem to be it. Microsoft has a 90 per cent \n     share of a world market; there are reasons to think that \n     share will endure; Microsoft has engaged in restrictive \n     practices; and many of those practices do not appear to have \n     any efficiency justifications that would benefit consumers \n     rather than the company. Where you find a dead body, a bloody \n     knife, fingerprints, and a motive, there may have been a \n     crime.\n       Objecting to the Microsoft case is tantamount to saying we \n     shouldn't have any antitrust laws at all. That may not be \n     intellectually scandalous, but it is certainly a minority \n     position, and not the position of the Chicago School or the \n     people who served in the Reagan Administrations--or even one \n     dictated by common sense.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As the two chairmen of the Federal Trade \n     Commission during the Reagan Administrations, whose \n     responsibility it was to enforce the antitrust laws, we want \n     to applaud your investigation into whether those laws are \n     adequate to deal with competition issues in our information \n     technology economy.\n       A number of prominent conservatives have criticized you, as \n     well as the Justice Department which has brought a case \n     against Microsoft, on two grounds: that the free market will \n     protect consumers' interests; and that government \n     intervention will in no event be beneficial.\n       We disagree with these criticisms in the instant case. \n     Although we are and have been extremely skeptical of \n     government intervention in the economy--as is evidenced by \n     the innumerable statements we have made over the years--we \n     believe government does have a role to play in keeping \n     markets free and that the Microsoft situation deserves \n     serious review.\n       Whether Microsoft has ``market power''--a technical term--\n     which raises antitrust concerns is, of course, a separate \n     question. Microsoft clearly plays a dominant role in the \n     market for computer software systems. Moreover, as you \n     discovered--with some difficulty--at the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee hearing on March 3rd, Microsoft appears to have \n     engaged in certain practices designed to restrict the \n     activities of its competitors. On the other hand, Microsoft's \n     dominant role in the PC operating systems market may not \n     imply monopoly power and in any event may evanesce within a \n     few years. This is an empirical matter, and an informed \n     judgement awaits further information and analysis.\n       The purpose of this letter is not to write a brief against \n     Microsoft. It is only say what we think should be obvious: \n     that the Microsoft situation raises serious concerns about \n     the vigor of competition in the market for PC operating \n     systems. After all, Microsoft is not the corner drug store, \n     or the local bakery. It is a world wide company, with a \n     market value greater than IBM and General Motors combined, \n     doing business in this country's, and perhaps the world's, \n     most important industry. The extent of competition in this \n     industry should be of vital concern to your committee as you \n     contemplate the efficacy of the antitrust laws to protect the \n     interests of consumers.\n       Those who profess to be unconcerned by Microsoft's position \n     and behavior may say they are followers of the Chicago School \n     of economics--which is a shorthand way of expressing great \n     skepticism about antitrust enforcement and government \n     intervention into the economy.\n       We share those concerns, as is evidenced--to repeat--by the \n     myriad public statements we have given over many years. But \n     in our judgement, not to be concerned by Microsoft is neither \n     good public policy, nor does such an attitude reflect an \n     accurate understanding of the Chicago School.\n       Finally, we want to address what we think is a strawman \n     issue: that government (the Justice Department and the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee) is only acting in response to the \n     whining of Microsoft's competitors who are attempting to get \n     from politicians what they have been unsuccessful in \n     obtaining in the market place. We know from experience that \n     such protestations are not an accurate\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\n     guide to the competitiveness of the market. But even if the \n     current inquiry is prompted by the efforts of Microsoft's \n     competitors, this motivation bears little relation to the \n     facts of the case. Microsoft either is or is not behaving \n     properly, and the antitrust laws either are or are not \n     adequate for current circumstances wholly independently of \n     what Microsoft's competitors are trying to accomplish.\n       For that reason we applaud your investigation, wish you \n     every success, and offer to help in any way we can.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     James C. Miller III.\n     Daniel Oliver.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. There are those who object that the Government should not \ninterfere with the dynamic hi-tech marketplace. I agree with those who \nespouse a natural, instinctive skepticism toward any Government \nintervention in the marketplace. But enforcement of the antitrust laws \nmay be all the more important if innovation in the most important, \nfast-growing sector of our present and future economy is being \nsuffocated under the thumb of a company both willing and able to \nexploit its monopoly power.\n  The media campaign surrounding the public release of Windows 95 was \naccompanied by a theme song. As I recall, it was the Rolling Stones' \nhit song Start Me Up. For innovators seeking to compete with Bill \nGates, for PC makers who feel that they have little choice but to steer \nclear of any actions that might upset their relationship with \nMicrosoft, and for consumers, beholden to Microsoft for software \nproducts, I wonder whether the theme song for Windows 98 shouldn't be \nanother Rolling Stones hit--Under My Thumb.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4231-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4234-S4235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FARM CRISIS IN NORTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rose yesterday to discuss the farm \ncrisis in my home State of North Dakota. Yesterday, I showed a chart \nthat showed what has happened to farm income in our State between 1996 \nand 1997, and I start today with that same chart because it shows North \nDakota farm income being washed away in 1997.\n  In 1996, we had $764 million of farm income in the State of North \nDakota; in 1997, $15 million--a 98 percent reduction in farm income \nfrom 1 year to the next. If that is not a crisis, I don't know what \nwould constitute one. The total farm income of the State of North \nDakota in 1997 was $15 million. That is divided up among the 30,000 \nfarmers of our State. In other words, the average farmer had a profit, \nor net income, of only $500 for the entire year. That is a crisis.\n  The problems for agriculture go much further, deep into the pockets \nof farm producers. In my State and many other States, the economic \ndifficulty in agriculture means trouble on Main Street. If the pockets \nof farmers are empty, so are the pockets of bankers, grocers, implement \ndealers, cafe and gas station owners--you name it; any Main Street \nbusiness is negatively affected, and so are the workers whose \nbusinesses are affected.\n  About a week and a half ago, a meeting was held on the border of \nnortheastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota, where the farm \ntroubles in our region are the worst. At that meeting, which was held \nby the State Farm Service Agencies, there were agricultural lenders, \nimplement dealers, agricultural suppliers, and other agribusinesses in \nattendance. Today I thought I would share some of the comments made at \nthat meeting by those people who are dependent on the agricultural \neconomy. These comments illustrate the problems we are facing in \nagriculture in North Dakota.\n  The first comments were made by agricultural suppliers--the providers \nof fuel, seed, fertilizer, and other farm inputs. Here is what two of \nthem said at this meeting. The first one said:\n\n       My daughter sells seed to farmers. Earlier she distributed \n     the seed, now she is going around to pick it up.\n\n  That is a very bad sign, when those who are selling seed are going \naround to pick it up after it has been distributed. That means acreage \nis not going to be planted, and it is not going to be planted because \nfarmers can't cash flow. They didn't cash flow last year; they aren't \ngoing to cash flow this year. That is because of this stealth crisis \nthat is occurring out in my State. I am alerting my colleagues, it is \nin my State today; it may be in your State tomorrow. This is a crisis \nthat has no Federal response.\n  The second ag supplier said:\n\n       Yesterday, six farmers wanted anhydrous ammonia fertilizer. \n     I turned four of them away. The question this year is not, \n     ``Do you have a loan?'' but ``Is that check any good?''\n\n  All across North Dakota, those are the kinds of questions that are \nbeing asked.\n  Also at this meeting there were implement dealers. The implement \ndealers also had some interesting comments. One said:\n\n       Last year, all the combines I sold went to senior citizens. \n     That should tell you something about the condition of our \n     young farmers.\n\n  The second implement dealer said:\n\n       In 1974 it took 5,600 bushels of wheat to buy a 250 \n     horsepower four wheel drive tractor. Today it takes 26,000 \n     bushels to buy the same horsepower, and it doesn't cover any \n     more ground than the old one. There just isn't any buying \n     power left in the bushels they produce.\n\n  When asked yesterday, Why are we having this crisis in North Dakota? \nIt flows from a number of factors.\n  No. 1 is low prices.\n  No. 2, it flows from widespread disease as a result of 5 years of \noverly wet conditions.\n  No. 3 is a very weak Federal farm policy.\n  Those are the fundamental causes for the crisis in our State.\n  It is not just the implement dealers at this particular meeting who \nare talking about it. In addition, I have also heard from other \nimplement dealers in recent news articles about the crisis in \nagriculture. Jon Sundby, a farm machinery dealer in Hillsboro, ND, \nsaid:\n\n       A year ago at this time, I think we sold 42 tractors. This \n     year we have sold three.\n\n  Mr. President, that reflects the depth of the crisis that is hitting \nNorth Dakota.\n  Bob Lamp, the executive vice president of the North Dakota Implement \nDealers Association, said:\n\n       At this point, there isn't much of a market for machinery \n     because of the economy.\n\n  Comments from implement dealers and others reflect what is happening \nall across our State. It is not just implement dealers. Ag lenders are \nalso weighing in. They were at this April 23 meeting. About a week and \na half ago that meeting occurred. As anybody in agriculture knows, if \nyou don't have money to operate your farm, you simply can't farm. It is \nrare in my State for producers to farm without loans to cover their \noperating expenses. That is why ag lenders are critically important to \nfarmers.\n  Here is what some of them are saying about our current agricultural \neconomy.\n  One ag lender said at this April 23 meeting:\n\n       Too many are trying to farm this year on credit cards --\n\n  On credit cards--\n\n       That is a recipe for disaster.\n\n  I was just with somebody from the State department of agriculture. He \nhad been looking at farm plans. He saw one farmer who had credit card \nadvances of $130,000--$130,000 on credit cards--to farm. That is a \nrecipe for disaster.\n  A second ag lender said:\n\n       The farmers in trouble are good, honest producers who are \n     suffering in silence. USDA needs to raise loan limits and \n     make interest assistance more widely available on existing \n     loans.\n\n  A third said:\n\n       This is, by far, the worst year ever, even considering the \n     1980s.\n\n  Mr. President, suffering in silence, I found that. I just took a tour \nof my State, held farm meetings all across North Dakota during the 2-\nweek break in April, and what I found was that farm producers are \nshellshocked. They are suffering in silence. They don't know where to \nturn.\n  One recommended that ``USDA needs to raise loan limits.'' He is \nexactly right. The Secretary of Agriculture supports lifting the caps \non commodity loans, but does not have the authority to do it. The \nCongress has the authority. We are the ones who have to make a decision \nto provide some relief.\n  Those loan levels are unusually low. In the 1996 farm bill, caps were \nset on wheat at $2.58 a bushel. There is no one who can farm and make \nit on $2.58 a\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\nbushel. That doesn't cover your operating expenses.\n\n  Were we to simply remove the caps, we calculate the loan rate would \nbe 62 cents higher, $3.20 a bushel. That, too, is inadequate, but it \nwould be a help and it is the one thing we could do quickly to put some \nmoney in the pockets of these farm producers who are otherwise going to \ngo under.\n  I indicated yesterday that we are going to lose 3,000 farmers in \nNorth Dakota this year. We only have 30,000. Ten percent of the people \nare going to go out of business this year, and the situation next year, \nunless we act, is going to be far worse.\n  I very much hope that my colleagues are listening, because this is a \ncrisis. Last year, we had a very visual crisis in North Dakota with the \nfloods, the fires and the most powerful winter storm in 50 years. The \nnews media paid attention. As a result, we received a strong response. \nWell, the disaster continues, but there is virtually no attention being \npaid to it. That is why I say we have a stealth disaster this year. The \nconditions are undermining our agricultural producers in a way that is \nunprecedented. We have never seen such economic hardship on the farm, \nand yet there is almost no Federal response.\n  If we are going to avert disaster, the Federal Government needs to \nrespond; this Congress needs to respond. Why is it? Because Congress \npassed a farm bill that forces farmers to face greater risk and succeed \nor fail based on the whims of the marketplace. It is because Congress \nhas failed to act on the research title of the farm bill and has placed \nin jeopardy not only the future of agricultural research, but stability \nin our crop insurance system and rural development in the Fund for \nRural America. Those items are funded in the research bill. It is \nbecause our crop insurance system is based on a formula which unfairly \npenalizes producers who experience repeated disaster, and it is \nespecially because when our farmers face a disaster in crop production, \nthere is no program to help.\n  As I indicated yesterday, if you have a disaster in agriculture \ntoday, the only help is a low-interest loan. So we are saying to these \npeople at the very time they don't have the money to cash flow, ``Go \ndeeper into debt.'' That is no answer.\n  All of these problems need to be addressed, and they need to be \naddressed as soon as possible. The livelihood of our farmers, our Main \nStreet businesses, our rural infrastructure and the very health of our \nNation depend on it.\n  I have one last comment from an ag lender. This is in North Dakota, \nand he said:\n\n       Agriculture needs to be on the top of the agenda for the \n     President, the Secretary and Congress, but, unfortunately, it \n     doesn't seem to be.\n\n  Mr. President, we have to make it part of the agenda or we are going \nto have a calamity in North Dakota. I say to my colleagues, we are the \nfirst to experience this. Others of my colleagues will probably not be \nfar behind, because if you have a weather disaster, if you have a \nseries of bad years, as we have experienced, you will find there is \nprecious little Federal assistance. That is because of the changes that \nhave been made in the farm bill and other measures taken by Congress.\n  I alert my colleagues, North Dakota may be experiencing this stealth \ndisaster today, but our colleagues are probably not far behind. I urge \nthem to pay attention to this problem. We are an early warning signal, \njust like they used to send the birds down the mine shaft to see if \nthere was air. North Dakota is the little bird in the mine shaft \nwarning the rest of the Nation that we have a badly flawed farm policy \nin place. A 98-percent reduction in farm income in 1 year--98 percent. \nI don't think there is another industry that could survive that kind of \nfiscal calamity. I know our industry cannot.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). One minute, 24 seconds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4234-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4235-S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MANAGED CARE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on another matter, I want to address the \nissue of a young man named Ethan Bedrick. Let me put up Ethan's picture \nso we can see who we are talking about. This is Ethan. Ethan was born \non January 28, 1992. His delivery went badly, and as a result of \nasphyxiation, he has suffered from severe cerebral palsy and spastic \nquadriplegic which impairs motor functions in all of his limbs.\n  You can see him. He is a fighter. Look at that look on his face. He \nis a happy young fellow, even though he faces severe restrictions.\n  He was put on a regimen of intense physical, occupational and speech \ntherapy to help him overcome some of these obstacles.\n  At the age of 14 months, Ethan's insurance company abruptly cut off \ncoverage for his speech therapy and limited his physical therapy to \nonly 15 sessions per year. Mr. President, can you imagine, this little \nboy was damaged at birth, and when he is 14 months old, the insurance \ncompany cuts off coverage for his speech therapy, limits his physical \ntherapy to 15 sessions a year. At 14 months, when the insurance company \nmade these decisions to cut off this young child from the therapy he \nneeded, the change was recommended by an insurance company \nrepresentative performing a utilization review of his case. The \nreviewer cited a 50 percent chance that Ethan could walk by age 5 as a \nminimal benefit of further therapy.\n\n  Further, the reviewer never met personally with Ethan, his family, or \nEthan's team of regular doctors. Upon review, the insurer affirmed its \nposition with a second company doctor, citing a single New England \nJournal of Medicine article on physical therapy and child development. \nThat article was published in 1988, 4 years before Ethan was born.\n  I want to go back to the point here that was made by the insurance \nreviewer. The change was recommended by the insurance company reviewer, \nciting a 50 percent chance that Ethan could walk by age 5 as a \n``minimal benefit.'' Shame on that reviewer; shame on that company. A \n50 percent chance of walking is a minimal benefit? How would they feel \nif it were their child? How would they feel then? A 50 percent chance \nof walking is a minimal benefit?\n  Further, the doctor declared the prescribed therapeutic equipment, \nincluding a bath chair designed for aiding his parents and care \nproviders in his bathing, and an upright walker to allow him upright \nmovement and muscle development, were merely convenience items--\nconvenience items--and costs not to be covered by his insurance. Can \nyou imagine if you were the parents of this little boy and you were \ntold a walker is a convenience item? You were told that a device to \nhelp in the bathing of this multiply handicapped child was a \nconvenience item?\n  The Bedricks, the parents, didn't feel that way. They filed suit. In \n1996, the fourth circuit ruled that the insurer's decision to restrict \ntherapy was arbitrary and capricious because the opinions of their \nmedical experts were unfounded and tainted by conflict. Further, the \ncourt concluded that neither the insurance plan nor corporate \nguidelines require ``significant progress'' as a precondition to \nproviding medically necessary treatments. The court noted, ``It is as \nimportant not to get worse as it is to get better. The implication that \nwalking by age 5 would not be significant progress for this unfortunate \nchild is simply revolting.'' Those are the words of the court, that the \nposition of this insurance company ``is simply revolting.''\n  This is a quote from the attorney for young Ethan. ``The implication \nthat walking by age 5 would not be a `significant progress' for this \nunfortunate child is simply revolting. . . . The delivery of health \ncare services should be based on the promotion of good health and not \nthe margin of profit.''\n  During the time of review and litigation, Ethan lost 3 years of vital \ntherapy, and ERISA, the Employee Retirement Insurance and Savings \nAccount which governs HMOs, left the Bedricks with no remedy for \ncompensation for Ethan's loss of therapy. The Bedricks' ability to give \njustice for what the HMO did to Ethan was erased because of ERISA.\n  I raise this issue today because very soon Congress is going to have \na chance to act and we, in conscience, must insist that children like \nEthan have a fair shot at fair treatment. This little boy, now 6 years \nold, should not be told that a 50/50 chance of being able\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\nto walk is, as described by the insurance company, ``a marginal, \nminimal benefit.'' That simply cannot be what we do in this country to \nlittle boys like Ethan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the story that was just described by my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, is one that occurs all too often across this \ncountry in this new era of managed care. Every day we intend to \ndescribe the circumstances of managed care in this country that require \nus to bring a Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor. Every day we will \ndiscuss this issue on the floor of the Senate, hoping that we will be \nable to persuade those who schedule the Senate to bring the Patients' \nBill of Rights to the Senate.\n  Every person in this country seeking health care ought to have a \nright to know all of their options for treatment, not just the cheapest \noption for treatment. Everyone seeking health care in this country \nought to have a right to show up in an emergency room and get necessary \ntreatment for an emergency medical need. The list goes on. That is why \nwe want to see a piece of legislation called the Patients' Bill of \nRights brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Chair recognizes \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, for 9 minutes 31 seconds of \nthe previously allotted time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4235-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4236-S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for the remaining moments I will speak on \nthe subject of agriculture. I know it is probably something a lot of \npeople do not think about or don't want to talk much about. Family \nfarmers in my State are in trouble. At night when you fly across my \nState in a small airplane and look down, those family farmers have the \nbrilliant yard lights that peek up at you. Each of these points of \nlight represent a family living in the country, trying to make a living \non the family farm.\n  Recently there was an editorial cartoon in the Forum newspaper of \nFargo, ND, showing a truckload of family farmers going down the road \nsurrounded by a landscape of farm problems, including low prices, crop \ndisease, and inadequate programs. The road sign in the cartoon stated, \n``The point of no returns.'' Why? Here is what is happening to the \nprice of wheat. We passed a new farm bill and the price of wheat goes \ndown, and down. Wheat prices are down 42 percent since May of 1996, \nfollowing the passage of the new farm law. The point is that the new \nfarm law pulls the rug out from under family farmers in terms of a \nsafety net and tells the farmers, ``Go to the marketplace to get your \nprice.'' Then the marketplace has a pathetically low price, and farmers \ngo broke.\n  I had a farm meeting in Mandan, ND, and a fellow stood up. He was a \nbig burly guy with a beard. He said his grandfather farmed, his dad \nfarmed, and he has farmed for 23 years. His chin began to quiver, and \nhe began to get tears in his eyes, and he said, ``I can't keep farming. \nI am forced to quit this year.''\n  We have all heard the stories. One by one. I suppose people say that \nis just one farmer. Yet ``one by one'' means that across this country, \nthere are hundreds and thousands of farmers leaving farming. It is \nespecially evident in my State. When farmers can't make a living and go \nout of business, it seems to me that is an enormous step backwards. \nFamily farmers contribute something very important to this country.\n  Family farmers have had to fight several things in my State recently. \nThey had to fight the weather. We went through a winter in which we had \n3 years' worth of snow in 3 months. We had seven blizzards, the last of \nwhich put nearly 2 feet of snow on the ground. It was the worst \nblizzard in 50 years. Farmers had to fight that. Then they had to fight \nlow prices. Then they had to fight a crop disease known as fusarium \nhead blight or scab which wiped out a quantity of their crop. And, then \nthey have to fight a Congress and a farm policy which has been \nconstructed by people in Congress who say it doesn't matter who farms.\n  These folk think agrifactories are fine. They can farm as far as the \nlargest tractor will go, until it runs out of gas, and that is fine \nwith them. It is not fine with me. If we end up with a land of giant \nagrifactories farming America's farmland, we will have lost something \nforever in this country that is very important. As a matter of social \nand economic policy, we ought to fight with every fiber of our being to \nmake sure we have a network of families living out on the farms in this \ncountry's future.\n  I watched one day when somebody came in that door, breathless, and \nwalked to the floor of the Senate on the supplemental appropriations \nbill and offered an amendment for $177 million to be added to star wars \nnational missile defense system. They added $177 million that wasn't \neven asked for. But that wasn't a problem. It was accepted by consent. \nA total of $177 million was added early in the morning. That was OK \nwith this body because it was for star wars. But somehow we don't have \nenough money to provide a decent wheat price for a family farmer who is \nstruggling out there.\n\n  I got a letter from a man and his wife who quit farming recently. The \nletter is from George and Karen Saxowsky, of Hebron, ND. I will read \njust a couple of paragraphs, since I have 2 more minutes. It describes \nfor those who don't know about family farming what this family went \nthrough. She wrote a Christmas letter and described part of what they \nwent through in the storms. She talked about the last blizzard.\n  I will read a couple paragraphs:\n\n       As the storm abated Sunday evening I could hear Glendon \n     yelling and ran to see what was going on now, but couldn't \n     find him. Here, they had found a cow laying on its side \n     drowning in muck. Glendon was laying flat on his belly \n     holding the cows head out of the muck while George was trying \n     frantically to get the tractor down to him. I plowed through \n     four foot deep snow to help--the first tractor got wet and \n     quit. [All during the storm we had distributor caps in the \n     oven drying out!] He got the Bobcat--it quit; he got the next \n     tractor and we made it down there, tore a fence down, put \n     chains on the cow and pulled her out. She died; as did a calf \n     that had been buried in the snow someplace in the ten feet we \n     pulled the cow and we didn't even see, until the snow melted \n     enough, that it was under her; as did those two calves in the \n     basement; as did a calf that had followed its mother to the \n     water fountain, got stuck in the snow and froze to death \n     standing up--we must have walked by that calf fifty times but \n     with the blizzard didn't see it--they get snow covered really \n     fast; as did the cow in the corral with a roof over her head \n     with water and hay right beside her; as did--well, you get \n     the picture. It continued for fourteen days after the storm, \n     every day we lost at least one cow and/or calf. We took them \n     to the vets for autopsies and what-not but it just seemed \n     there was nothing we could do to save them. One day we made \n     it to 5:00 without any dying and thought the curse was broken \n     but by midnight we had lost a cow and a calf. It was a \n     terrible, terrible time, but we lived through it--but not \n     alone. Friends were there for us. On the Friday after the \n     storm one called to tell us to get out of the house and come \n     to town for a Fireman's Dance--we were just too exhausted and \n     depressed--but he was really pushy (he did the same thing for \n     us after last year's cow incident on I-94). We went and \n     visited with other farmer-ranchers who were in the same \n     boat--it really was so helpful and encouraging?\n       We were really dreading the first snow of this winter. Long \n     about October, George started talking about quitting \n     farming--I took it as a mid-life crisis; a one time slide. \n     But he kept talking--and then started making plans. We would \n     put in a crop in '98 and quit in '99. I still thought `this-\n     too-shall-pass' but he just go more serious. In November I \n     started getting calls asking if I would like a job off the \n     farm? I have to tell you, I was so flattered that they even \n     considered me capable of doing what they needed; I had been \n     self-employed for almost 25 years! I turned them down, but it \n     did start the wheels turning. Then, there was an ad in the \n     paper for a job in Hebron with benefits. We talked about it \n     and I applied; they offered me the job and I took it. This \n     was not easy, now we couldn't put a crop in this spring as \n     the job is 40 hours a week including every other Saturday and \n     George can't farm without me.\n       The bottom line is: a 47 year old, 4th generation farmer in \n     this 27th year of farming is quitting farming.\n\n  This is why this farm couple is quitting farming. It is not just \nbecause of the storm and the dead cattle. It is about making a living \nand getting some return for their efforts.\n  North Dakota farmers had a decline of $750 million in farm income in \n1997. Low prices, crop disease, weather. Senator Conrad pointed out \nthat 98 percent of the net income of farmers was washed away by this \nset of problems. And, there is one more problem that farmers face. They \nface a Congress that doesn't seem to care whether there are family \nfarmers.\n\n[[Page S4237]]\n\n  The new farm program pulls the rug out from under our family farmers. \nThey are told to go to the marketplace to get their price. When they go \nthere, the big millers are there and the big grocery manufacturers are \nthere, and the big grain traders are there. They all want lower prices, \nso they drive prices down so when family farmers go to the marketplace, \nthey find pathetically low prices, well below their costs of production \nfor grain.\n  The fact is they lose money year after year because farm prices are \nconsistently below the full economic costs of production. Then they \nsuffer through crop disease on top of it all, and find out the crop \ninsurance program doesn't work. When they turn to the safety net, they \nfind that, no, that has been pulled away. When they ask what is the \nloan rate on a bushel of wheat, they find it is the lowest it has been \nin decades.\n  So the question is: Is somebody here going to start to care about \nwhether we have family farmers or not? Or is the priority here that you \ncan waltz through these doors and offer a couple hundred million \ndollars for star wars, and get plenty of money for things like that; \nbut when it comes to family farmers we don't have enough money for a \ndecent support price to help them stay on the farm?\n  Mr. President, I and others will be talking about this in the coming \ndays. I hope, as we search for some solutions, this Congress will \ndecide family farmers are worth finding solutions for, and that we will \ndevelop a better farm program, one that really works to provide \nprotection for family farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4236-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WE THE PEOPLE . . .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 will touch the lives of hundreds of millions \nof Americans.\n  More Americans pay taxes than vote. The perception of how our \ngovernment treats us--its citizens--is rooted more in our contact with \nthe IRS than with any other U.S. agency or entity.\n  How we are treated by the IRS--and our tax laws--effects our \nperception of whether or not we believe we have a fair shot at the \nAmerican Dream and whether or not we are a government of, by and for \nthe people.\n  During our deliberations this week, we must be mindful of Congress's \ncomplicity in allowing the IRS to become what it has become. The IRS is \nnot Sears & Roebuck--we are its Board of Directors. We write the tax \nlaws, we are responsible for the oversight and it was on our watch that \nthe IRS became the mess we now try to clean up.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that Congress has changed the \ntax code 63 times since 1986, and these changes have created a tax code \nthat costs the American taxpayers $75 billion a year to comply. We do \nso without considering the cost for the IRS to administer it, and \nwithout considering the cost for taxpayers to comply. If you doubt that \nwe have made things difficult I challenge you to take a look at this \nyear's Schedule D on capital gains and losses. A few years back Dave \nBarry noted that we were making progress in our mission to ``develop a \ntax form so scary that merely reading it will cause the ordinary \ntaxpayer's brain to explode.'' He cited Schedule J, Form 118 ``Separate \nLimitation Loss Allocations and Other Adjustments Necessary to \nDetermine Numerators of Limitation Fractions, Year-End \nRecharacterization Balances and Overall Foreign Loss Account \nBalances.'' If that is not complicated enough, I'd suggest he go back \nand take a look at this year's Schedule D.\n  The American public knows that Congress plays a leading role in all \nof this. In a recent poll, 72 percent of Americans blamed Congress for \nthe ills of the IRS, and not the IRS itself.\n  According to a special Harris Poll conducted on April 15th, ``[t]ax \nevasion is believed by most people to be more widespread than \nharassment by the IRS.'' The poll also found that by a margin of 50 to \n33 percent, Americans believe more people ``get away with not paying \nall the taxes they should'' than pay ``all their taxes and are unfairly \nharassed by the IRS.'' Willful noncompliance with our tax laws cost\n\n[[Page S4238]]\n\nthose of us who do comply an estimated $100 billion annually. IRS \nCommissioner Rossotti testified last week that taxpayer noncompliance \ncosts the individual American taxpayer $1,600 annually.\n  Today 85 percent of Americans comply with our tax laws willfully, \nwithout incident. If we do not adequately address the issue of \nnoncompliance, we will be sending the wrong message.\n  It is our responsibility to not only change the culture at the IRS so \nthat those who do comply are treated fairly and with respect, but we \nmust also change the law to allow Commissioner Rossotti the authority \nto make the changes he needs to and to provide the IRS with the proper \nresources to catch those who choose to break the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the overall importance of the bill \nbefore us this week. What we do will have a profound impact on the IRS, \nhow Congress writes tax law and how Americans perceive this body and \nour government.\n  Let us move forward, swiftly and in a cooperative manner, and give \nthe IRS the overhaul it needs, provide the congressional oversight that \nis required, the IRS Commissioner the statutory authority he lacks, and \nthe taxpayers the relief they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I know from the hearings in the Finance Committee held \nby the distinguished chairman, Senator Roth, last September, and over \nthe last several weeks--very, very needed and very, very worthwhile \noversight hearings--that among other things which were focused on in \nthose hearings were the actions taken by the Criminal Investigation \nDivision. I know that there were an awful lot of citizens--in fact, \nevery single member of the Finance Committee--who were outraged \nlistening to some of the stories told about how the strong arm of the \nlaw was used to go after not necessarily innocent but certainly \ntaxpayers that were not a threat to the life and limb of their \nneighbors. There was a substantial amount of force used in all of the \ncases. I don't pass judgment as to whether or not the IRS was right in \nthe claim itself. But there is no question that there are times when \nthe IRS uses more force than is necessary to carry out its function \nunder the Criminal Investigative Division.\n  We hope that the changes in our law and instructions to Commissioner \nRossotti will enable us to reduce and eliminate that kind of excessive \nuse of force. Mr. Rossotti himself has indicated that he is going to \nask former FBI Director William Webster to evaluate the Criminal \nInvestigation Division and come up with a set of protocols that will \nenable them to eliminate the times when they use unnecessary force to \nenforce the law.\n  Let me caution Members who are outraged to be careful when they come \nand propose amendments to that particular section of this law. The \ncaution needs to be based upon our desire, I hope, to keep the streets \nsafe for Americans. It is my judgment that mission No. 1 for a \ngovernment is to protect its citizens. We don't have public safety if \nwe do not have citizens feeling safe when they are walking the streets, \nor when they are engaging in commercial transactions. If that doesn't \noccur, we have anarchy, and citizens not only are going to be quite \nconcerned but they are apt to throw all of us out of office.\n  All of us know that a combination of events has reduced crime across \nthe Nation. Americans like that. They want to feel safe. They don't \nwant to feel they are at risk, having people preying on them for a \nvariety of reasons.\n  The IRS is an important part of our effort to get that done. All \nMembers who are concerned about the Criminal Investigation Division and \nwho may have some changes they want to make in that division, I am \nlikely to support those if it will reduce the incidents of force being \nused against citizens who pose no threat but will oppose those that I \nfear will make it easier for drug dealers, money launderers, and other \nsorts of criminals who are preying on the American people. If Members \ncome to the floor and want to weaken the capacity of the Criminal \nInvestigation Division to keep Americans safe, I will introduce into \nthe Record, as I did in the hearings, 14 examples, and more if \nnecessary, to show this body what the Criminal Investigation Division \nis doing to keep Americans safe. If there is somebody out in America \nwho is a drug dealer or a money launderer, they don't have on their \nforehead ``drug dealer'' or ``money launderer.'' They are apt to look \nnormal. One of the things we very often fail to do is get both sides of \nthe story when we hear stories of abuse.\n  I could bring every single person who is in Nebraska's prison system \nin front of any committee here in Washington, DC, and every single one \nof them will tell you the government abused their rights. There is \nnobody who is guilty in our prisons. They are all innocent. They are \nall abused by the government in some way, shape or form.\n  So let's be careful as we evaluate the Criminal Investigation \nDivision. We have Mr. Webster who has been assigned by Mr. Rossotti to \nexamine their procedure and protocol, but let's be careful that we \ndon't change the law to make it easier for people to prey on Americans \nto get their job done.\n  All of us understand there is an amendment to the Constitution, the \nfourth amendment, that provides us protections against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. I am encouraged that many who have been silent \non this protection that is guaranteed to all citizens are now starting \nto understand that it can be a substantial problem to infringe upon \nthat fourth amendment right. But if a law enforcement entity has \nprobable cause and gets an arrest warrant as a consequence of having \nprobable cause that somebody is violating the law--a drug dealer, money \nlaunderer, and so forth--again, walk down the street. These people \ndon't stand out for you and say, well, there's somebody who is a threat \nto our society. If they have probable cause, if they believe it is \nnecessary to get a search warrant, they don't call that person up and \nsay, hey, Jim, next Wednesday I am going to be over to get the \nevidence, because they know that unless they have the element of \nsurprise, the evidence is going to be destroyed.\n  I believe the legislation before the body today, the variety of \nthings that are being done, will substantially improve the operation of \nthe IRS and will give the American people better service, will shift \nmore power to the taxpayer. In title I, there is a section I may end up \nreading on this floor. I am a cosponsor of the bill. It was originally \nintroduced by John Breaux.\n  The Taxpayer Advocate will be much more independent, have much more \npower, and I guarantee you that the taxpayers will know the \nindependence that the Taxpayer Advocate has; that he will be required \nannually to come to us and say, here are provisions of the Tax Code \nthat are causing the IRS special problems. These are problems and \ndifficulties that we are facing as a result of the laws that you all \npass and make recommendations for changing those laws. So that, again, \nthe goal ought to be to write the law so that the IRS presumes all \nAmericans are law-abiding citizens willing to voluntarily comply. They \njust want to know the size of their tax bill so they can pay it but \nreserve the authority and power of the IRS to go after individuals who \neither intentionally do not want to comply or, worse, are criminals who \nare preying on innocent Americans in a variety of different ways.\n\n  I hope during the deliberations we will have a constructive debate. I \nknow we are waiting for the caucuses to find out what Members are going \nto do with both nongermane amendments as well as germane amendments \nthat could kill the bill. I say, again, the importance of this cannot \nbe overstated. The citizens' confidence in Government of, by, and for \nthe people is at stake. We now have a declining number of Americans who \nbelieve the IRS is getting the job done. It is one of the least popular \nagencies at the Federal level. We have a significant role in creating \nthat unpopularity because we wrote the law to begin with. The law that \ngoverns the IRS has not been rewritten since 1952. It is long since \npassed the time it was necessary to rewrite those laws.\n  I thank Senators Roth, Moynihan, Grassley, Congressman Portman, \nCongressman Cardin, and many others who have been involved in this from \nthe very beginning. It started way back in 1995 when Senator Shelby, \nthe distinguished manager, and I were managing an appropriations bill. \nWe had attempted to fence an appropriation dealing with tax systems \nmodernization in 1994. It failed. We got it fenced\n\n[[Page S4239]]\n\nin 1995. We didn't believe it was enough. We saw the taxpayer money \nbeing wasted. We created in the appropriations bill the National \nCommission for Restructuring the IRS. That Commission deliberated with \nCongressman Portman and 16 other people for well over a year. Senator \nRoth, last year, picked the ball up and had wonderful oversight \nhearings, and did so again this year.\n  It is time to get the bill passed. The House bill passed 426 to 4 \nlast September. The bill that is before us today is a substantial \nimprovement over that bill in what the House has done. I say on behalf \nof 200 million Americans who pay their taxes every single year, let's \nget this thing done as quickly as possible so they can have these new \npowers that they will have under the law and so the IRS Commissioner \nhas the power and authority he needs to manage this agency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Are we on the bill or are we in morning business, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on H.R. 2676, the IRS reform bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in support of the legislation and say to all of my colleagues, \nand to the American public as well, it is very good news that we are \nnow at the point of not talking about it as much as we are actually \ntrying to do something to fix the problem. The problem I speak of is \nthe information that Congress and the Senate have received over the \npast several weeks regarding what I will argue are fundamental abuses \nwithin the Internal Revenue Service and how they treat many American \ncitizens.\n\n  The hearings the Finance Committee held really brought out some very \ndisturbing facts and information about the interaction of the Internal \nRevenue Service with average Americans. We have a tax system in this \ncountry with which most people completely and totally comply. We have \none of the highest rates of compliance of any free nation anywhere in \nthe world. It is something of which we can be very proud.\n  Also, it is interesting to note--and maybe people don't realize--that \nless than 2 percent of American taxpayers are audited each year, \nsubstantially less than 2 percent as a matter of fact, which means most \nAmericans file their tax returns, pay what they owe during the year, \nand at the end of the year that is it in terms of their dealings with \nthe Internal Revenue Service. But still, in all, it seems there is a \nvery disturbing feeling by most Americans that the Internal Revenue \nService, an agency of our own Government, is not only on their side but \nactually is against their basic interests in how they deal with their \nown Government. I know that for a fact. I even feel somewhat \nintimidated by calling the agency myself on behalf of a constituent. \nThe response seems to come back: How dare you call us. We are the IRS \nand you have no business making an inquiry.\n  The other story that goes around is people have pointed out one of \nthe greatest lies ever told is: I'm from the Government and I'm here to \nhelp you.\n  It is like someone who gets a letter from the Internal Revenue \nService; generally it evokes a tremendous amount of fear from the \naverage citizens in this country when they get such a letter. It is \nalways the butt of so many evening television shows, jokes about people \nactually having a fear of their own Government and an actual fear of \nthe agents of our own Government, who are Federal employees, who \nactually work for the citizens of this country.\n  I think the hearings show this is a feeling among far too many people \nin this country. What we are doing is bringing legislation to the floor \nto try to correct some of those abuses and make it work more on behalf \nof American citizens instead of against American citizens.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I was back in Louisiana and someone from my \nState said, ``What do you have coming up this week?'' I said, ``We are \ngoing to have more hearings on the Internal Revenue Service.'' And my \nconstituent said in response, ``My God, you have had enough hearings. \nWhen are you going to do something about fixing the problem? We know \nthere is a problem; when are you going to fix it? Are you going to \nspend the whole year talking about it? We got the message; there is a \nproblem. The question is, What is Congress going to do to attempt to \nfix the problem?''\n  I am pleased to report that is why we are on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate today with legislation that has been reported out in a \nbipartisan fashion. Under the leadership of the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Roth, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Moynihan, we have \nbrought this piece of legislation to the floor. I want to particularly \ncommend Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, who has been on the floor this \nmorning and yesterday outlining this legislation. He chaired a \ncommission which really did a great deal of work prior to the Congress \nbringing up this legislative proposal. His work as commission chairman \nreally was the genesis for bringing about this real effort to reform \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  Some would say, ``Just throw it out, scratch it, do away with it.'' \nThat is all fine and good. I can give a great speech anywhere in the \ncountry talking about abolishing the IRS. But also, it is important to \nfind out, what are you replacing it with? What type of agency do you \nhave to collect the revenues to run the Government?\n  I think people legitimately are concerned. They want the services of \nGovernment. They want the highway trust fund to work. They want the \nhighway program to work. They want Medicare and they want the Medicaid \nprograms to work. They want education to work. They want the services \nof Government, but in order to have that, you have to have some \nmechanism to collect taxes in a fair manner. We should do everything we \ncan to make the system more fair and make it more simple than it is, \nbut eventually we are going to have to have some agency that is going \nto participate in helping collect those taxes under a fair system.\n  I think what we do today is to try to improve that system. We say we \nare going to make it work better, we are going to attempt to eliminate \nthe abuses in the system and abuses by people who work for the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  I would like to concentrate just on one feature of the bill that is \nnow before the Senate, and that is something that I have worked on \nhard--in fact, introduced a separate bill on, to create a National \nTaxpayer Advocate to help taxpayers when they have problems with the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n\n  Back in 1996, in the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights, we established this \nTaxpayer Advocate. The concept was not very complicated. It was, when \npeople have a problem with the Internal Revenue Service, they generally \nare at the mercy of the system. The Government has literally thousands \nof attorneys and tax attorneys and prosecutors to go after individuals, \nbut the individual citizens don't have anyone to represent their \ninterests in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. The National \nTaxpayer Advocate concept was to have someone who was on the side of \nthe taxpayers, to help the taxpayers put together what they need to \nshow what they have done was entirely honest and appropriate.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate did establish this position of a \nTaxpayer Advocate Office, and the function was to assist the taxpayers \nin resolving their problems and to identify areas in which taxpayers \nhave problems in dealings with IRS, and also propose any administrative \nchanges that would help make the system more fair, and identify any \nlegislative recommendations that we in Congress could institute to make \nit more fair and easier for the average taxpayer.\n  The problem with the old law in 1996 was that the Taxpayer Advocate \ndesignated authority, under these assistance programs, to the local and \nregional resolution officers who worked for the Internal Revenue \nService. This really undermined the independence of the Taxpayer \nAdvocate. It is very important, if you are going to have people who \nhelp the taxpayer, that they should not be totally dictated to by the\n\n[[Page S4240]]\n\nInternal Revenue Service itself. It was something that, while it had \nthe right intention, did not work as it should.\n  This legislation contains several very important changes. I am very \npleased to report to our other colleagues that this legislation \ncorrects some of the problems with the original Taxpayer Advocate \nOffice. We are going to make it more independent, which it has to be in \norder to work. We are going to make it more accountable to the \ntaxpayers of this country, who are the people they are there to serve, \nand make it easier for them to resolve disputes between the taxpayer \nand the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The bill, in doing that, replaces the present law's problem \nresolution system with a system of local taxpayer advocates who report \ndirectly to the National Taxpayer Advocate Office and who will be \nemployees of the Taxpayer Advocate Office, independent from the \nInternal Revenue Service's examination, collection, and appeals \nfunction. In other words, they will be working directly for the \nTaxpayer Advocate Office and will be independent of the IRS examination \nand collection offices and appeals office.\n  The National Taxpayer Advocate has a responsibility to evaluate and \ntake personnel actions with respect to any local taxpayer advocate or \nany employee in the Office of the National Taxpayer Advocate. And to \nfurther ensure their independence, the National Taxpayer Advocate may \nnot have been an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service \nduring the 2-year period ending with their appointment and will not be \nable to accept employment with the IRS for at least 5 years after \nceasing to be the National Taxpayer Advocate. That means the people who \nare going to be running this office cannot just have come out of the \nInternal Revenue Service, where their loyalties would be legitimately \nquestioned. And they have to agree they will not go to work for the \nInternal Revenue Service for at least 5 years after they leave this \nposition.\n\n  So what we are creating, I think, is a truly independent National \nTaxpayer Advocate Office, to be on the side of the taxpayer for a \nchange instead of being on the side of the Government, saying they are \ngoing to represent the interests of the taxpayer. There is a conflict \nthere. If you are going to have adequate representation for the \nindividual taxpayer, the person cannot be an IRS employee; they have a \ndifferent obligation of what they are trying to do.\n  So this Taxpayer Advocate Office will not be able to be a previous \nIRS employee and not be able to go to work right after giving up the \njob as a National Taxpayer Advocate. I think that feature is very, very \nimportant, because if you were still an employee of the IRS directly \nunder their responsibility, it simply would not work. If you just came \nout of the IRS, it would not work. And if you knew you were going to go \nto work for the IRS as soon as you finished the job as a National \nTaxpayer Advocate, then you would be looking over your shoulder to make \nsure you didn't make them mad or unhappy in what you did in \nrepresenting America's taxpayers.\n  That conflict has been eliminated by what we have in the legislation \nwhich is now before the Senate. The whole concept is to have a truly \nindependent National Taxpayer Advocate whose one focus will be making \nsure that taxpayers have good representation, are fairly treated, and \nhave someone, for a change, who is really on their side when they have \na conflict with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  It is interesting to note that we go further in this legislation and \nsay that at the initial meeting with any taxpayers seeking assistance \nwith the Office of Taxpayer Advocate, that the local taxpayer advocate \nis required to notify that taxpayer that they operate independently of \nthe IRS office and that they report directly to Congress through the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate. At the discretion of the local taxpayer \nadvocate, he shall not disclose to any IRS employee any contact with or \nany information that they provide to the taxpayer.\n  We are really trying to build some walls between the IRS and the \nTaxpayer Advocate and their work with the taxpayers, the American \ncitizens of this country, to make sure that they, the taxpayers, know \nthe person they are dealing with is independent, has their interests at \nheart, and doesn't have to go report to the Internal Revenue Service \ndistrict director about what he or she has discussed or talked about \nwith the taxpayer who is seeking assistance.\n  In addition, each local office of the Taxpayer Advocate is to \nmaintain separate phones, separate faxes, and other electronic \ncommunications access, and a separate post office address. We are \nreally trying to make it as separate and independent as we possibly \ncan, so that when the average person gets that letter talking about an \naudit or a question that they have, they know there will be someplace \nthey can go without having to incur the expense of hiring outside CPAs \nor outside attorneys and pay them sometimes very high fees just to have \nsomeone help them with their problem. There will be someplace they can \ngo, which will be independent of the IRS, which will have as their \nfirst, second, third, and last mission to help that taxpayer. They can \nbe comfortable there will not be communication or sharing of \ninformation of their discussions with the Taxpayer Advocate with the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  I think this is a very important part of the bill that is before the \nSenate today. Other features in the bill are equally as important, \ncertainly, and I think in the end will go a very long way to assuring \nthe American taxpayers that they have a system that is not out to get \nthem, that is not out to intimidate them, that is not out to embarrass \nthem; that if they are honest taxpayers, they will be treated honestly \nand will be treated fairly and, if they have a problem, there will be \nsomeplace they can go to get honest information and help and assistance \nthat is not directed by the Internal Revenue Service but is being \ndirected by the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate. That is now part of \nthis bill, and I think it is a very important part of it as well.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, as I see other Members \nwho are waiting to speak.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Louisiana. I \nhave done it a couple of times previously. I was pleased to be able to \ncosponsor his legislation having to do with strengthening the Taxpayer \nAdvocate in this bill. If we can keep the nongermane amendments off and \nstick to the business of changing the law to give the taxpayers this \nnew authority and power with this one provision, the Taxpayer Advocate, \nit will be noticed immediately.\n  This Taxpayer Advocate will be truly independent, with separate phone \nnumbers, separate faxes, a separate operation, with the capacity to \norganize taxpayer advocates in each of the 50 States, to operate \nindependently, not only settling problems that taxpayers have but \nbringing to Congress' attention repetitive problems that they identify \nthat they think need to be solved by us either changing the law or \nchanging some other procedures.\n  We have had the Taxpayer Advocate created before under the Taxpayer \nBill of Rights II, when it was created. The change from Taxpayer \nAdvocate to National Taxpayer Advocate is not by accident. I hope \ncolleagues have a chance to look at this particular section of the bill \nas they consider how we are going to proceed this week. Look at the \nlanguage in this particular section and ask yourself the question: Do I \nwant to give the taxpayers in my State this kind of Taxpayer Advocate, \nthis kind of power, this kind of representation? Do I think that they \nwill appreciate the changes they will see in the way IRS operates and \nthe kind of service they get from that IRS? I think Senators will look \nat that and say, ``My gosh, I don't want to slow this bill down. We \nneed to get this thing done. We have waited long enough. We need to get \nthis bill done so these new powers can be felt by the taxpayers in my \nState.''\n  Again, I appreciate very much what the Senator from Louisiana has \ndone. This is one of the most important sections of this bill. It is \nnot in the House bill. Senator Roth, the chairman of our committee, \ntalked many times about the need to make certain we took the House bill \nand made it as strong as we could. I was constantly pressing that\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\nwe move in an expeditious fashion. This is one of several examples \nwhere the House bill has been substantially improved.\n  I hope colleagues, as they look at this bill, will remember we are \ntrying to give the taxpayers in all the States in this Nation new \npower, new authority, and an IRS that will much better serve their \nneeds in a much more courteous and expeditious fashion.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the leader is \nbringing to the floor this week the Internal Revenue Service reform \nbill and giving the Senate the opportunity to act expeditiously on this \nmatter. It is my hope that as soon as we act, there will be a prompt \nconference committee with the House, which has already passed analogous \nalthough not as comprehensive legislation, so that soon the American \npeople will have the benefit of the reforms that are contained in this \nlegislation.\n  We did not get to this point easily. I compliment particularly \nSenators Bob Kerrey and Charles Grassley, who served on the commission \nthat reviewed the IRS from which many of the ideas contained in this \nlegislation have emanated. I congratulate Senators Roth and Moynihan of \nthe Finance Committee for having led us to this point. And I \ncongratulate new Commissioner Rossotti of the IRS, who has brought a \nfire, an energy, to reform the agency from the inside that has \nfacilitated the consideration of these structural changes that will be \ncontained in this legislation.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before I proceed further, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Kate Mahar, Ed Moore, and Maribel Garcia-Romero of my \nstaff be allowed the privilege of the floor for the pendency of the \ndebate on the IRS reform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, I will comment on some provisions which will be \nin the Senate bill that I have had a particular interest in and then to \nalert the Senate to an amendment I will be offering, possibly with \nothers, when we reach the consideration of this bill.\n  This bill follows many months of investigations and hearings by the \nFinance Committee, both in Washington and throughout the Nation. It \nfollows a process in which the committee has first tried to do a \ncareful diagnosis of what was the problem and then consider the \noptions, the prescriptions that might deal with that problem, and then \nincorporate into this legislation that prescription which was \nconsidered to be the most appropriate.\n  I compliment the people who have participated in this process. \nSpecifically, I held a hearing in January in Orlando, FL, where a \nnumber of Floridians had the opportunity to participate in this \nthoughtful process of diagnosis and prescription. I know that Senator \nNickles held a similar hearing in Oklahoma. Other Senators communicated \nwith their constituents through various forums. So this is, in a real \nsense, a product of the people of America.\n  Let me review some of the diagnoses and the pathologies in the IRS \nthat surfaced. One of those was the need to help taxpayers resolve \ntheir debts. What was discovered was that many taxpayers want to \nresolve their IRS debts but the Code imposes so many penalties that \nonce a liability is established, it is very difficult to satisfy that \ndebt.\n  As an example, a Floridian, Carl Junstrom of Tampa, over 10 years \nago, because of misinterpreted advice of an IRS agent, ended up being \nresponsible for $25,000 in taxes. He entered into an agreement with the \nIRS under which he paid $181 a month towards that debt owed. After \nhaving faithfully met that monthly obligation for almost a decade, and \nhaving paid $28,000 towards an original $25,000 indebtedness, Mr. \nJunstrom was informed that he still owed $26,000.\n  How is that possible? The answer is, because the penalty clock kept \nrunning during the pendency of this agreement and, therefore, although \nhe thought he was paying off his indebtedness and, in fact, paid $3,000 \nmore than he originally owed, because of accumulated penalties during \nthat same 10-year period, he ended up owing more than he had at the \nbeginning of the process.\n  What is the remedy? This bill includes a provision that encourages \nthe IRS and the taxpayers to engage in installment agreements by, one, \nassuring the availability of payment plans for taxpayers with \nliabilities of $10,000 or less and, two, eliminating the failure-to-pay \npenalty for periods where the taxpayer is making payments pursuant to \nan installment agreement.\n  In the case of Mr. Junstrom, the penalty clock would have stopped as \nlong as he was making his $181-a-month payments.\n  Another remedy is to adopt proposals to eliminate the differential \nbetween the interest rate the IRS charges individuals and the rate that \nthe IRS pays taxpayers. Previously, there had been a higher interest \ncharged to the taxpayers on a deficit than the interest which the \ntaxpayer would receive if it was found that they were owed a refund. \nThat differential is eliminated in this legislation.\n  A second problem identified was protecting the innocent taxpayer. \nWhat is the problem? One example of the problem is that many \nindividuals filing joint returns find out subsequent to filing those \njoint returns that their spouse has understated income or overstated \ndeductions. Although the individual may have had little or no income \nand little or no knowledge of this, the IRS holds that person \nresponsible for 100 percent of the taxes attributable to the individual \nspouse's action. This typically surfaces after there has been a divorce \nand one spouse, often the husband, has left town. The wife, who usually \nhas custodial responsibility for the children, is still there and is \naccessible, so she becomes the target for the IRS collection activity. \nAbout 50,000 women a year are in that category which is generically \nreferred to as the ``innocent spouse.'' An example is Karen Andreasen, \na Floridian. Her signature was forged on a joint return, but she ended \nup being held liable for her ex-husband's debts.\n  The remedy? The remedy incorporates legislation which Senator D'Amato \nand others, including myself, have introduced as discrete legislation. \nThis generally would adopt an approach recommended by the American Bar \nAssociation which essentially says that each spouse is to pay his or \nher share of the tax liability in proportion to what he or she \ncontributed to the original tax return. If, for example, the return \nrepresented income that was 80 percent the husband's earning and 20 \npercent wife's earning, in a subsequent dispute the wife would be \nlimited to a responsibility of 20 percent of any deficiency. That is a \nvery important provision in this legislation, which will have an \nimmediate benefit, because this legislation applies this new standard \nretroactively to existing open cases for many tens of thousands of \nspouses caught in this vice.\n  Another issue that surfaced was assisting taxpayers in their \nnegotiations with the IRS. What is the problem? The problem is that \nmany taxpayers, especially small businesses and moderate-income \nfamilies, find themselves unable to negotiate with an agency which has \nthe power to seize, levy and garnish wages. An example, Betty Bryant of \nMiami, Florida started a small business to supplement her income as a \nState employee. She actually overpaid her taxes but filled out the form \nincorrectly and ended up with wages being garnished while this matter \nwas in controversy. Another example, Thomas Jones, submitted an offer-\nin-compromise to the IRS. The offer was rejected even though the IRS \nadmitted they couldn't find his file. They rejected his offer even \nthough they didn't have the information upon which to make an \nintelligent judgment as to whether the offer was appropriate or not. He \nalso was not apprised of his right to appeal the rejection of his \noffer.\n  What is the remedy? The Finance Committee includes proposals to \nrequire a review of any IRS decision to reject an offer-in-compromise \nby collection. This will assure that there will be some independent \nparty reviewing the offer in compromise. Moreover, the bill requires \nthat the taxpayer be notified of this right.\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\n  In addition, the bill requires the IRS to suspend collection efforts \nif the taxpayer appeals the rejection of an offer-in-compromise.\n  The committee also approved proposals to expand the IRS Alternative \nDispute Resolution Program. In many jurisdictions, the development of \nalternative dispute resolution procedures has provided a significant \nand frequently much more efficient alternative to traditional \nlitigation. This proposal would build upon a pilot program initiated by \nthe IRS pursuant to the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996. It \nwould allow third-party mediation of cases of tax disputes. It would \nalso establish a pilot program for the use of arbitration in tax \ndisputes.\n\n  The legislation also provides a proposal to require acceptance of an \noffer-in-compromise if the IRS has lost the taxpayer's file.\n  Another area where Senators found deficiencies in the IRS is customer \nservice. What is the problem? Many taxpayers feel they are treated as \ncriminals rather than as customers. The IRS is often unreachable and \ndifficult to pin down on advice they give to taxpayers on how to \nproperly fill out a return. Jim Stamps of Jacksonville provided \ntestimony that it had taken him 4 years to get a letter stating that he \nhad paid off all the taxes that he owed. Without that letter, many \nopportunities that were available to him personally and in business \nwere frustrated.\n  Mr. Junstrom, who I mentioned earlier, the man who had the $25,000 \nbill, paid $28,000 but still owed $26,000, and had requested the IRS to \nsit down with him to explain what he owed. He never was afforded that \nopportunity and continued to receive confusing and conflicting notices.\n  What is the remedy? The bill reported out of the committee includes a \nrequirement that the IRS evaluate employees on their customer service \nas well as on their collection ability. The Finance Committee heard \ntestimony indicating that in the past not only was there almost a total \nfocus of evaluation based on how much money an agent collected, but \nthat those standards became numeric, and if you didn't meet the \nstandard of collections, then you received a downgrade on your \nevaluation.\n  This legislation repeats and expands upon a directive that Senator \nGrassley wrote into the Taxpayer Bill of Rights that made it illegal to \nevaluate an IRS employee based on a numerical standard of how much was \ncollected. But this legislation goes beyond that and says that employee \nevaluation will give emphasis to their customer service as well as \ntheir other responsibilities.\n  The IRS reform bill will also increase accessibility by a very simple \nthing--pick up the telephone book today and look under U.S. Government \nin virtually any community in America and then look under IRS. One \nthing you will see is an 800 number as to where to call to get service. \nThere are two things that you typically do not see. First, you may not \nfind a local telephone number that you can call in the event that the \n800 number is busy, which happens frequently, particularly during \nperiods just before April the 15th. Second, what you don't see is an \naddress so that the taxpayer who wants to go down and actually meet \nface to face with a human being to review their problem will know where \nto call and where to go. This legislation will require the IRS publish \nboth its local telephone number and its local address.\n  The legislation requires the IRS to issue annual statements to \ntaxpayers who have entered into installment agreements, like Mr. \nJunstrom. The statement would include amounts paid, remaining balance, \nand projected pay-off time so that the taxpayer will be in regular \nknowledge of where he or she stands with the IRS.\n  None of us purports that this legislation will solve all of the \nproblems and all the taxpayer complaints with the IRS. And we should \nresist the temptation to oversell this legislation. The IRS will have \nto take many administrative actions to implement these laws and \nundertake other reforms to achieve that goal. Fortunately, I believe \nthe IRS is moving expeditiously to become a more user-friendly agency. \nIt is dealing with a culture which in the past has focused inside the \nagency, what was to the convenience of the agency, like not publishing \nthe address so that taxpayers wouldn't come down to the IRS office and \nask a lot of questions, to an agency that is moving to a culture of \nbeing consumer friendly and saying: Here is where we are, come down and \nwe seriously want to render service to the taxpayer.\n\n  Commissioner Rossotti has implemented a broad range of reforms and \nhas undertaken investigations to get to the bottom of other allegations \nthat have been made about the agency's activities. The IRS has extended \nits hours, implemented problem resolution days, and has stopped \nevaluating collection agents based on the numerical amount of taxes \nthey collect. This legislation will continue that effort. Mr. \nPresident, all of what I have just said is in the bill that we will \nsoon be considering, and I recommend that bill and these provisions to \nmy colleagues.\n  Let me now turn to a provision that is not currently in the bill. It \nis my intention to offer an amendment to ensure that the new IRS \nOversight Board will have at least one member with expertise on small \nbusiness issues.\n  One of the recurring themes of the hearings that we have had is the \nconcentration of problems between taxpayers and the IRS, especially \nwhen that taxpayer was a small businessman or woman--an individual who \nfrequently is relatively new to business, learning what the difference \nwas between an expense deductible item and an item that had to be \namortized over time, a person who frequently did not have access to or \ncould not afford expert professional advice, but a person who was \ntrying to comply with their legal responsibilities.\n  These are not evaders of taxation, they are people who need help, and \nup-to-date information, in order to meet their responsibilities.\n  We are creating in this legislation an oversight board. That \noversight board is intended to provide a new window of enlightenment, \nin both directions, from the public to the IRS, and from the IRS back \nto the public. Under legislation crafted in the Finance Committee, the \ncurrent board would be composed of 9 individuals. Those 9 individuals \nwill include the Secretary of the Treasury, the IRS Commissioner, and a \nrepresentative of the IRS employees. In addition to those 3 named \nindividuals, there will be 6 Presidential appointees. Each of these 6 \nmust possess expertise in at least one of the following areas: \nManagement of large service organizations, customer service, Federal \ntax laws, information technology, organization development, and the \nneeds and concerns of taxpayers.\n  Missing from this list is any specific requirement for expertise in \nsmall business issues--an omission that I consider to be glaring given \nthe fact that small businesses are the backbone of the American economy \nand such a large target of concern for IRS activities.\n  I believe that at least one of the members of the IRS oversight board \nshould have practical experience in small business issues.\n  Let me outline the reasons why I feel so strongly about this, and why \nI will be introducing an amendment to make this part of the IRS reform \nlegislation.\n  Small businesses have more difficulty dealing with the complex \nInternal Revenue Code. Small businesses have relatively less time, \nmoney, and expertise than large corporations. They need an IRS that is \nsensitive to these limitations.\n  Let me explain how I came to this conclusion with a specific example \nthat relates to this bill.\n  In January of this year, I hosted a Retirement Security Summit at the \nUniversity of South Florida in Tampa. One session of that Retirement \nSecurity Summit specifically focused on the issue of small businesses \nand their pension plans.\n  Delegates, small business owners and their representatives discussed \ntheir frustrations and their experiences with the IRS. They told me \nthat many small businesses do not offer retirement plans for their \nemployees because they fear the draconian penalties that the IRS can \nimpose for inadvertent violations of complex pension laws.\n  Mr. President, this is a very serious issue of security for tens of \nmillions of Americans who work for small businesses, the fastest-\ngrowing sector of\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\nour economy, but whose employers do not provide pension and retirement \nprograms.\n  We identified that one of the reasons for that unwillingness to \nprovide these programs is the concern of the consequences of subsequent \nIRS enforcement if the small business finds itself in some technical \nviolation.\n  Several of my Senate colleagues and I began to consider whether \ncongressional action would help solve this problem. We drafted \nlegislation to provide that companies that correct errors prior to \naudit would not be subject to sanction. But before we offered the \nproposal as an amendment to the IRS Reform bill, we wrote to the IRS \ncommissioner, Mr. Rossotti, and asked him if the IRS proposed to change \nthe imposition of penalties for inadvertent errors.\n  Commissioner Rossotti responded immediately, in a matter of days, and \ncommitted to expanding existing self-correction programs and allow \ntaxpayers to rely on those self-correction programs. We were pleased \nwith the quick action of the commissioner in issuing Revenue Procedure \n98-22, which many small businesses have characterized as a common \nsense, reasonable solution to their problem.\n  That process made me realize how difficult it is for many small \nbusinesses to comply not only with the complexities of tax laws as they \nrelate to pension plans, but the whole array of rules that the Internal \nRevenue Code has spawned. It made me further realize that the IRS needs \nto be sensitive to small businesses when it issues regulations and \nenforces the tax laws.\n  Small business owners often have fewer resources, but must still \ncomply with the same complicated Tax Code as large businesses. Small \nbusinesses cannot afford to hire full-time lawyers and accountants to \nmonitor the Tax Code for changes that may apply to them. And small \nbusinesses should not have to wait for Congress to be able to change \nthe law where solutions can be found by administrative action.\n  The myriad of challenges that small businesses face have been \nreflected in the hearings the Finance Committee has held this year on \nIRS reform. Many of the taxpayers who have testified so persuasively \nabout mistreatment at the hands of IRS agents have been small business \nowners.\n  In my opinion, by adding a small business person to the IRS oversight \nboard, we will be able to provide for a more prompt, more sensitive \nunderstanding of the needs of small businesses and the ability of IRS \nto respond internally.\n  Even the IRS has acknowledged the unique needs of small businesses. \nIn testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on January 28 of this \nyear, Commissioner Rossotti proposed reorganizing the IRS into 4 \nunits--each charged with end-to-end responsibility for serving a \nparticular group of taxpayers. He proposed dedicating one of those four \nworking units to small businesses.\n  Mr. President, it is for those reasons that it is my intention, with \nother Members of the Senate, to offer an amendment to this bill, when \nit is before the Senate, to include a representative of small business \nas one of the 6 presidential appointees to the IRS oversight board. I \nbelieve this would be of substantial benefit to the enforcement of our \ntax laws as they relate to the special needs of small businesses.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I want to acknowledge the efforts \nof Senator Kit Bond, who chairs the Small Business Committee. He has \nincluded a similar provision in legislation that he will be \nintroducing.\n  Should the requirement that the oversight board have small business \nexpertise not be incorporated in the bill through Senator Bond's \namendment, I will urge adoption of this targeted amendment that I will \nintend to offer.\n  The amendment is simple, fair, and essential if we are to bolster our \nNation's small businesses. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport legislation to include small business on the IRS oversight \nboard. I ask the managers to let us know when it would be appropriate \nto introduce this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the process \nby which the items in the IRS reform bill have been developed. It has \nbeen thoughtful and it has received the strong, steady support of our \nchairman, Senator Roth, and has led to a set of reforms that I believe \nthe Senate will be very much carrying out the wishes of the American \npeople in adopting.\n  With respect to small business, Commissioner Rossotti stated:\n\n       Another very important group of taxpayers are small \n     businesses, including sole proprietors and small business \n     corporations. There are about 25 million filers in this \n     category. Compared to other individual taxpayers, this group \n     has much more frequent and complex filing requirements and \n     pays much more directly to the IRS, including tax deposits, \n     quarterly employment returns, and many other types of income \n     tax returns and schedules. Providing good service to this \n     group of taxpayers is more difficult than wage and investment \n     filers, and compliance and collection problems are also much \n     greater. Small start-up businesses in particular need special \n     help. By dedicating a fully responsible unit to providing all \n     IRS services for the self-employed and small business, this \n     unit will be able to work closely with industry associations, \n     small business groups and preparers to solve problems for the \n     benefit of all.\n\n  Commissioner Rossotti is right. The IRS needs to focus resources on \nhelping small businesses, and that focus needs to be reflected on the \nOversight Board.\n  The amendment that I propose to offer is also needed because small \nbusinesses play such a central role in our nation s economic strength. \nThe numbers tell the story:\n  Small Business Administration figures indicate that of the 5,369,068 \nemployer firms in 1995, 78.8% had fewer than 10 employees, and 99.7% \nhad fewer than 500 employees.\n  Employers with fewer than 500 employees increased from 4,941,821 in \n1988 to 5,261,967 in 1994, a 6.5% increase.\n  The number of small business owners (as measured by business tax \nreturns) in the United States increased by 57% since 1982.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, America's small \nbusinesses created 11,827,000 jobs from 1992 to 1996. This number \nrepresents the vast majority of all new jobs created during that \nperiod.\n  Small microbusinesses with 1-4 employees generated about 50% of all \nthe net new jobs from 1992-1996, while firms with 5-19 employees \ncreated another 27% of new employment opportunities.\n  The fastest growing of small-business-dominated industries during the \npast several years include restaurants, outpatient care facilities, \noffices of physicians, special trade construction contractors, computer \nand data processing services, and credit reporting and collection.\n  Ninety-four percent of high technology firms have less than 500 \nemployees; 73% have fewer than 20 employees.\n  In my home state of Florida, the productivity of small business is \nastounding.\n  In 1996, Florida had 348,000 businesses with employees. 99% of all \nbusinesses with employees had less than 500 workers.\n  The state also had 412,000 self-employed persons in 1996, for an \nestimated total of 760,000 businesses.\n  In Florida, small businesses created 1,081,000 or the 1,194,000 net \nnew jobs from 1992 to 1996. Very small businesses (less than 20 \nemployees) created 71.7% of the small business growth with 775,000 new \njobs. These numbers reflect the importance of small businesses as job \ncreators.\n  Recent IRS statistics reflect the rapid growth of small businesses. \nThey indicate that net income reported by sole proprietors has doubled \nin the last decade.\n  It is because of these reasons and trends that I urge my colleagues \nto support this effort to give small businesses a voice on the IRS \nOversight Board.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Kit Bond, \nChairman of the Small Business Committee, in this area. He included a \nsimilar provision in his IRS Reform bill.\n  Should the requirement that the Oversight Board have small business \nexpertise not be adopted via a broader amendment, I will urge the \nadoption of this targeted amendment.\n  The amendment I propose is simple, fair, and essential if we are to \nbolster our nation's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support \nit--and ask the managers to let us know when it is appropriate to \nintroduce the amendment. The amendment that I propose to offer will \nextend its benefits in a very significant way to the most important \npart of the American economy, the small business community of this \nNation.\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROTH.

I was asking unanimous consent to speak about an \namendment. I am going to offer an amendment this afternoon following \nthe time set aside for the debate.\n  Mr. ROTH. It is the hope of the manager that upon the passage of 3 \np.m., we will move ahead with the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to discuss his \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just wanted to inform the Senate of my \nintentions today--later on, after this time for debate--to offer an \namendment that would permanently exempt interest payments owed by \ndisaster victims to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  This is a very simple and straightforward amendment. The amendment is \nactually derived from the ``Disaster Victim Tax Extension Act,'' \nlegislation I introduced on April 29, 1998 with Senators Coverdell, \nFrist, McCain, Hutchinson, Smith of Oregon, Graham of Florida, and \nD'Amato.\n  As I stated in a Dear Colleague letter circulated on April 22, this \namendment permanently exempts interest payments for disaster victims \nwho reside in presidentially declared disaster areas and have been \ngranted an extension for their tax filing.\n  The reason for this amendment is very clear:\n  Each year, our country is hit by natural disasters of all kinds--such \nas hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, and ice storms--causing \nextreme hardship for hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  This year, 15 states have already been hit by deadly disasters:\n  Starting March 7, severe storms and flooding struck the state of \nAlabama, damaging nearly 1,200 homes, and the city of Elba in Coffee \nCounty was evacuated as a result of a levee failure. Three deaths were \nattributed to the floods and one person was reported missing.\n  On February 9, twenty-seven California counties were wracked by \nsevere storms.\n  During the period of January 28 through February 6, a series of \nsevere winter storms hit communities in Sussex County in Delaware.\n  Also in February, three southern Florida counties were victimized by \ntornadoes and other violent weather.\n  In February, six counties in Georgia were struck by tornadoes. On \nMarch 20, amid flood recovery efforts, tornadoes and windstorms tore \nthrough northeast Georgia, adding to the overall devastation. Tornadoes \nagain touched down in west Georgia, metro Atlanta, and southeast \nGeorgia on April 9.\n  In February, Atlantic and Cape May counties in southern New Jersey \nwere hit by the coastal storm that lashed the area.\n  On April 16, six Tennessee counties were ravaged by deadly tornadoes \nand other violent weather.\n  And, Mr. President, on March 29, seven counties in my own state of \nMinnesota were hit by deadly tornadoes, damaging thousands of homes and \nbusinesses along an 86-mile path carved through the communities of St. \nPeter, Comfrey, and Le Center.\n  Just days after the March storm, I traveled to the disaster site in \nsouth-central Minnesota to witness the destruction and meet with the \nMinnesotans--families, farmers, and other business owners--forced to \ncope with this tragedy. Mr. President, I've never witnessed devastation \non such a scale. I have heard of tornado-damaged areas being compared \nto ``war zones,'' but had no idea how close that was to the truth. This \nwas indeed a war zone, and the Minnesotans I met with that Friday and \nSaturday were very much its innocent victims.\n  Two of those victims tragically lost their lives.\n  The property damage was widespread. Grain storage bins were leveled, \nthe fronts of homes were sheared off, farm fields were choked with \ndebris, making it impossible to plant, rows of telephone poles snapped, \nbrick houses leveled, countless trees were downed at Gustavus Adolphus \nCollege, and the spire of its church was torn off, vehicles were \nscattered by the winds, some landing in farm fields, the historic Bell \nTower of the courthouse in downtown Saint Peter was destroyed.\n  I am told the March tornadoes were some of the largest and longest in \nMinnesota's history. It's hard to imagine, but the Comfrey and Saint \nPeter tornadoes were a mile and a quarter wide--2,200 yards. That is \nnearly twice as wide as any previous tornado to hit my state, and far \nlarger than the average tornado, which is only 100 yards wide. The \ntornado that destroyed Comfrey created a damage zone of 77 square \nmiles. Just how large is that? Larger than the entire city of San \nFrancisco, which is contained within 75.2 square miles.\n  The estimated total dollar value of insured losses caused by the \nsouth-central Minnesota tornadoes has reached $175 million, exceeding \ninsured losses incurred in my state during the floods one year ago. \nMinnesotans have come together to clean up and begin the rebuilding, as \nwe always do when our neighbors need help, and I'm impressed with their \nspirit in facing this disaster. Still, it's going to take many months, \nperhaps years, before life returns to normal in those towns caught in \nthe tornadoes' paths.\n  Minnesota's experience is, unfortunately, not unique. Deadly natural \ndisasters occur every year. Lives are lost, homes are demolished, \nproperty is destroyed, businesses are ruined, and\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\ncrops are wiped out. The survivors of these disasters need our help to \nget their feet back on the ground.\n  Federal disaster assistance has been effective. In fact, almost all \nof the major disaster sites have been subsequently designated as \npresidentially declared disaster areas and are eligible to receive \nfederal disaster assistance.\n  However, there is one hurdle Congress must remove. Residents in \npresidentially declared disaster areas can often get an extension to \nfile their tax returns. However, interest owed cannot be exempted by \nthe IRS. The IRS charges an 8 percent interest rate for taxes owed, \neven if disaster victims get an extension for tax filing. So this is \nadding insult to injury.\n  Exempting interest payments owed to the IRS requires congressional \naction. Many states, like Minnesota, immediately grant exemptions for \ninterest payments on state taxes when disaster areas are declared. \nAlthough Congress has granted such federal waivers in the past, they \nmust be done legislatively each time a disaster occurs, and appropriate \nvehicles are not always available. This creates one more uncertainty \nfor disaster victims.\n  My amendment would once and for all remove this barrier and give \nresidents of presidentially declared disaster areas an interest payment \nexemption on any federal taxes owed. Under my amendment, the exemption \nis effective retroactively to tax year 1997, so that all of this year's \ndisaster victims will be covered for their late filing.\n  Mr. President, this may seem like a small matter, but for disaster \nsurvivors in Minnesota, Georgia, Alabama, California, Delaware, \nFlorida, New Jersey, Tennessee, and every state devastated by events \nentirely and utterly out of their control, every dollar counts in their \nefforts to begin to repair and to rebuild their lives. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to make sure that we put in place \npermanently an exemption so the IRS will not charge interest on taxes \nthat are due and that are not paid on time because of extensions due to \ndisasters.\n\n  Again, it may seem like a small matter, but to those people who have \nexperienced these disasters, it is a lot.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I will be sending \nthis to the desk as soon as the chairman's time on his debate has been \nconcluded.\n  I thank you very much.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me speak about the same issue which my colleague \nhas spoken about. As I talk to other Senators, I think we are going to \nhear the same thing that Senator Cleland from Georgia, I say to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, was saying--that in his State it is \nthe same issue. In my State of Minnesota, it is the same issue. I have \nessentially the same amendment that Senator Grams has. I think we can \nall join in one effort. That is the way it should be. What we are \nsaying--and what my colleague said happened in St. Peter really put it \nbest--I make this appeal to colleagues. This is just a matter of, I \nguess, just trying to help people out. People have enough on their \nminds. There has been such devastation.\n  The last time around when we dealt with the devastation of the \nflooding in Minnesota and a number of other States, we were able to get \nnot only an extension on the filings of the IRS tax forms but also, in \naddition, an extension on the actual payment. Along with that, we had \ncongressional action which led to a forgiveness on the interest for \nlate payments. But that did not automatically exempt. So this effort \nthat a number of us have been working on is a terribly important \namendment.\n  I think both Senators from Minnesota and other Senators from other \nStates who have been hit with these disasters just in the last several \nmonths this year would provide some help to people. That is what it is \nall about--providing help to people. It is my hope--in talking with \nother Senators and we had a discussion in the caucus at lunch as we \nlook at whether or not it is a relevant amendment--it is certainly my \nbelief this meets that test. This deals with a specific provision \nalready in this bill that deals with the forbearance on interest \npayments and, therefore, I think it would meet the test of relevant \namendments. I know that will be one of the questions that will be \nraised by my colleagues.\n  I join in with Senator Grams and with Senators from other States, all \nof whom really feel we want to try to get this done, and we want to try \nto get this done on this bill. We will have a chance later on to come \nout here and speak about our amendments, although I think the floor \namendments will essentially merge into one amendment. I make an appeal \nto colleagues--Democrats and Republicans, Republicans and Democrats \nalike--to please give us your support. This is very important to the \npeople in our State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will be offering, after the 3 o'clock \ntimeframe, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring \nand Reform Act. I commend the chairman of the committee and the members \nof the committee who have done so much good work in crafting a measure \nthat I think is a strong measure that will do much to resolve the \nquestions many citizens of America have about whether the IRS is \ntreating them fairly, whether they are getting a fair shake.\n  I have talked with a lot of people in my State, and I can tell you \nthat there are a very large number of people in the IRS who have the \nconfidence of the private sector folks, the taxpayers, and their \nrepresentatives who work with them.\n  Coming from Missouri, we can say that the overwhelming number of IRS \nagents who are dealing with the public are dealing on a fair, \nevenhanded basis. But we have had examples brought forth in the Finance \nCommittee of abuses that are clearly outrageous. Something needs to be \ndone to shape up the system so that a rogue agent cannot give the \nentire agency a bad name and that a rogue agent cannot impose or \ninflict upon a taxpayer burdens and penalties and requirements that are \nnowhere in the statutes.\n  I will be offering an amendment which changes the proposed structure \nfor the advisory board. I believe if you are going to have an advisory \nboard, if you are going to put the IRS into some kind of board, then \nyou need to do the job all the way. It is clear from the hearings and \nfrom the testimony that there is significant support for saying the IRS \nought to be run by a board, it ought to have an insulation from \npolitical influence--it should be kept free from direct interference by \nthe White House or even guidance out of the Treasury in terms of \nenforcement of the laws. Not tax policy. Tax policy is rightly one in \nwhich we expect the Secretary of the Treasury and the President to \noffer advice, counsel, and work with the Congress on carrying out the \npolicy.\n  But given the example of audits which at least raise the question of \nwhether they have been conducted or directed by political influence, I \nthink the only safeguard for the American people is to make the board a \nfull-time professional board composed of five members--four from the \nprivate sector plus the Commissioner of IRS--and give it the full \nauthority to run the day-to-day operations of the IRS. It would have a \nconsultative role in developing tax policy. But let's take a look at \nit. We have full-time boards that conduct some agencies with very \nsensitive responsibilities--the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \nFederal Communications Commission. These are boards which run agencies \nwith very important economic powers over the economy and over citizens \nin the economy. To the extent that we have entrusted powers to them, we \nsee that they are able to provide a buffer between political influence \nand the work of the agency.\n  On the other hand, if you are concerned about reforming an agency and \nyou find that the agency is out of control, as the committee has found \nthe IRS to be, then how can you expect a\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\npart-time advisory board to get the job done? Nobody has been able to \ncite me an example where a part-time advisory board came in and got \ncontrol of the agency. The purpose of a part-time advisory board is to \ngive advice which can be accepted or ignored, and, from the hearings, \nwe have seen that a part-time advisory board type of advice is not what \nthe IRS needs.\n\n  I think the time has come, if we are going to fulfill the mandate \ngiven to us by our constituents to do something about the IRS, to \nreform it, then we ought to set up a full-time board so the members do \nnot have to split their time between private activities--between their \nown jobs and their own responsibilities--and looking over the IRS on a \nday-or-two-a-month basis. It just does not make any sense.\n  As a former chief executive of my State, I know that agencies can run \na unit of Government and they can do so without political interference. \nIn my experience, sometimes agencies of State government were too \nimmune to interference or guidance or leadership from the Governor. But \nif the question here is to make sure that there is not improper \ninfluence on tax audits and tax investigation targets, the only way to \ndo the job and to do it properly is to put the management and the \nauthority over the work of the IRS in the control of a board with full-\ntime members on an equal footing with the Commissioner so that they can \ninsulate the IRS from any political influence. I believe this is a very \nlogical step to ensure that the reformed IRS meets the standards we \nwould all expect to see for this agency. If we are going to go for a \nboard, let's go big time. Either go for an independent, full-time board \nwith executive authority or get back up on the porch and let the \nexisting agency run itself.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to discussing this amendment when the \ntime ripens for its consideration in the Chamber. I appreciate the \nchairman and the manager on the other side bringing to the floor a very \ngood bill. I believe this provision will make it an even better bill, \nand I look forward to debating it, I hope this afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I assume that we are on the IRS \nrestructuring legislation; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are here today in the second day of \ndebate on this legislation to discuss a very important issue, and that \nis the restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service. As my colleagues \nknow, I have worked very hard on this issue--serving on the National \nCommission on Restructuring of the IRS and joining Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska in introducing the first piece of comprehensive legislation \nthat would comprehensively restructure the IRS. In addition, Senators \nReid, Kerrey and I introduced the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights III earlier \nthis year.\n  There are real problems in dealing with the IRS, and there are real \nproblems at that agency, as shown in the Senate Finance Committee \nhearings--which were so ably chaired by Senator Roth from Delaware, the \nchairman of that committee--and not only the recent ones which were \nprobably the most shocking, but also starting last September with \nhearings that brought out horror stories.\n  These hearings about the horror stories were about our Government's \ntreatment of taxpayers. Every time I go home I hear from constituents \nwho tell me about their firsthand experiences with the IRS. Rarely are \nthey good. For this reason, it is not good enough to just try. We have \nto succeed in this reform.\n  I would like to tell you what I learned about this issue in the \nRestructuring Commission's hearings and deliberations that took place \nduring the fall of 1996 carrying over to the first 9 months of 1997, at \nthese hearings and our deliberations there--but also, as I have already \nalluded to, the Finance Committee hearings which also were a very good \nbasis for this legislation. Then we have all had some of our own \nstudies of this issue as well. This is what I have learned: The IRS \nroutinely abuses taxpayers, and the rules the IRS lives by are unfair \nto the taxpayers and not according to the rule of law.\n  The structure of the IRS was not set up with its consumer, the \ntaxpayer, in mind. The IRS functions without accountability. The IRS \nagents are not held accountable for their acts. This breeds a culture \nof abuse and a culture of coverup, and this is where we stand today. We \nhave a chance to fix this culture. We have one chance to enact real, \nsolid, IRS reform. We in the Senate are supposed to be in the business \nof improving people's lives. We must pass real, solid and lasting IRS \nreform. We must set up a system that makes the IRS accountable for its \nactions, and then we in the Congress, who have constitutional \nresponsibilities of oversight, have, over the next several months, with \nintensity, but on an ongoing basis, a responsibility to make sure that \nwe continue the oversight work that has been done. We bear some \nresponsibility in the Congress for an out-of-control agency. But I \nthink with proper congressional oversight we will make sure that this \ndoes not happen again.\n  This legislation before us now makes many strides towards fixing the \nIRS. For starters, it strengthens oversight of the IRS. It creates an \nIRS Oversight Board. This Board will be  made up of nine individuals \nwho will oversee the administration, the management, the conduct, the \ndirection and even the budget of the IRS. The IRS Commissioner and a \nrepresentative of the National Taxpayers Employees Union will also \nserve on this Board. The union representative is especially important. \nOur IRS Restructuring Commission had a union representative on it. Bob \nTobias, the president of the NTEU, was instrumental in the Commission's \nwork. The Commission would not have made recommendations for such \nstrong reforms and made them by such a strong majority if it were not \nfor his involvement. Working with him, I learned that the union also \nwants strong reforms within the IRS.\n\n  Another important provision of this bill that increases IRS oversight \nis the creation of a new Treasury Inspector General who will be devoted \nexclusively to IRS matters. This office will have all the powers and \nauthority granted under the Inspector General Act, resources dedicated \nspecifically and only to the IRS oversight, and independence from being \nin the Treasury Department rather than being at the IRS.\n  This bill also takes an important step in helping Congress' oversight \nefforts and in making sure that the public and press can assist us in \nthese efforts. This bill requires a new Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration to randomly audit 1 percent of all IRS documents that \nthe IRS redacts before it releases those documents. In our \nRestructuring Commission hearings we learned that the IRS uses its \nprivacy privilege to hide its own wrongdoing from us in the Congress \nand, hence, from the public and also from the press. This is illegal, \nbut more important it is deceitful. This bill requires that a small \npercentage of documents be audited to ensure that the IRS can't hide \nbehind laws designed to protect the taxpayers.\n  These provisions, although great, are still not enough. In addition, \nCongress must continue its diligent oversight efforts. The IRS is \nimportant to us now, but will it be important to us even 5 years from \nnow? Or will we be focused on another issue of the day then? We need to \ncommit to have strong, thorough oversight hearings on an ongoing basis.\n  This bill also gives taxpayers important new rights. It helps \ntaxpayers know their rights and to navigate the tax collection system. \nI believe that Americans are smart people. If you give Americans enough \ninformation, and if you treat Americans fairly, they can usually take \ncare of themselves.\n  This bill empowers taxpayers with important new rights and puts the \ntaxpayers on a more equal footing with the IRS. I say a more equal \nfooting. I think it would be intellectually dishonest for me to say \nwith the passage of this legislation that we have totally leveled the \nplaying field, which the\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\ntaxpayers ought to expect and which I hope I am surprised some day and \nI can say that we have, but I don't want to categorically say that \ntoday.\n  This bill also has innocent spouse reforms so that innocent spouses \nare treated exactly as they are, and that is they are innocent.\n  This bill limits the seizure authority of the IRS. It allows \ntaxpayers to sue the IRS if its agents are negligent in violating the \ncode and the constitutional rights of our citizens. It prohibits the \nIRS from contacting third parties without prior notification to the \ntaxpayer. It requires that the IRS exhaust all collection options, \nincluding installment agreements, before seizing a business or a \nprincipal place of residence.\n  I could go on and on, but the point is that the bill before us is \nstrong, comprehensive reform. This bill is stronger than its House-\npassed companion, and we can all thank Chairman Roth and the Finance \nCommittee generally--but without his leadership, it would not have \nhappened--for making this strong, because we do need to pass this \nlegislation. We need to insist that the conference report be equally as \nstrong. And then we need to get it on the President's desk as soon as \npossible.\n  The American people deserve to be treated with respect, especially by \ntheir own Government. The American people deserve this bill, and the \nAmerican people deserve to be represented by Senators who have the \ncourage and foresight to not only enact this legislation, but after it \nis enacted, to see, through the constitutional responsibilities of \noversight, that it is actually carried out.\n  When this legislation is passed, I want to be able to say to the \nAmerican people, ``We're on the road to eliminating the culture of \nintimidation within that agency.'' I want to be able to say to the \nAmerican people, ``On April 15th next that you're treated by the IRS \nwith the same courtesy, with the same accurate information and with the \nsame timely response that they expect out of you, the taxpayer, on \nApril the 15th.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, Senator Grassley not only was on the \nNational Commission on Restructuring the IRS, along with myself and \nCongressman Portman and Congressman Cardin on the House side, but long \nbefore I ever became interested in this issue, Senator Grassley, along \nwith Senator Pryor--indeed, Senator Grassley may want to offer some \nhistorical reflections on this--has been involved with trying to change \nthe law and put the law on the side of the taxpayers, to give them more \nrights.\n  I believe, I say to the Senator, the first taxpayers' bill of rights \nlegislation was enacted, was it 1994? I ask the Senator from Iowa, the \nfirst taxpayers' bill of rights--I know Taxpayers' Bill of Rights II \nwas 1996.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think the first one would have been in 1988 or 1989.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator from Iowa and Senator Pryor were partners in \ndeveloping that legislation. Did the two of you work together on the \nTaxpayers' Bill of Rights II?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Both of those pieces of legislation were landmark bills. \nThe reason they were landmark bills is they laid a foundation upon \nwhich we are building this legislation. All of title III, which adds \nadditional powers to what the taxpayers will be granted, was added as a \nconsequence of evaluating whether or not the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights \nII has gone as far as we want to go.\n  I say that because a lot of colleagues have come up and said, ``Well, \ndoes this legislation go too far; does it give taxpayers so many new \nrights that the IRS will not be able to do their job?'' which is to \ncollect taxes? ``Is there any power left in the IRS?'' And the answer \nis yes.\n  All through this we have been conscious of the need to balance, and \nwhat we have been able to do is look at the impact of Taxpayers' Bill \nof Rights II. We can see additional authority needs to be granted to \ntaxpayers. I think it is an admirable balance, and it would not have \nbeen possible to get it done without Senator Grassley's longstanding \ninterest and understanding and leadership on this issue. I publicly \nthank him for making certain that we extend additional rights without \nundercutting the authority of the IRS to do what we have asked it to \ndo.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska very \nmuch for his kind remarks and for the background of the Taxpayers' Bill \nof Rights I and II, but most importantly for his thoughtful leadership \non the Commission, because that was 1 year of very hard work for \nSenator Kerrey. He gave it the attention that this problem deserves. \nThe strong piece of legislation that has gone through the House of \nRepresentatives and now strengthened by the Senate Finance Committee \nunder Senator Roth's leadership would not have been possible without \nthe digging and leadership that Senator Kerrey has shown.\n  Mr. KERREY. Now let's do trade.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We will do trade. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Likewise, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about ``pay and \nchase'' today. ``Pay and chase'' is a Pentagon term used to describe \nanother misguided policy. With pay and chase, the Pentagon pays the \nbills first and then tries to track down the receipts later on. \nSometimes they find them; sometimes they don't And sometimes, they \ndon't even bother to look. This is not a good policy. It is un-\nbusinesslike, and it's dangerous.\n  Under current law, payment is not due until a valid receipt is in \nhand. A certified receipt tells you that the goods and services have in \nfact been delivered.\n  So, to me, pay and chase is a mystery. Why, Mr. President, would \nanyone--in or out of government--want to pay a bill without a receipt? \nThat defies understanding. It makes no sense. Unfortunately, this is \nexactly what the Pentagon bureaucrats are urging Secretary of Defense \nCohen to do.\n  Today, pay and chase is unofficial policy. It's practiced but not \nauthorized by the law. But the Pentagon bureaucrats want Secretary of \nDefense Cohen to change that and make it O.K.--with the law.\n  Secretary Cohen made his request in a letter to the Senate dated \nFebruary 2, 1998.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have his letter printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am forwarding for your consideration \n     draft legislation that, if enacted, would be entitled the \n     ``Department of Defense Reform Act of 1998.'' This bill is \n     intended to form the core of the Defense Reform Initiative \n     (DRI). I request prompt action by the Congress on this \n     proposal.\n       The DRI is an exciting, sweeping reform of the ``business'' \n     of the Department of Defense. It will affect the Department \n     from its corporate headquarters at the Pentagon to each \n     service member and his or her family throughout the world. \n     While aspects of our reforms can and already are being \n     accomplished within existing statutory authorities, the \n     proposed bill is crucial to implementing many of the most \n     important and far-reaching reform elements that will make the \n     Department more business oriented. The DRI will give us the \n     authority to use those practices that our American industry \n     counterparts successfully have used to become leaner and more \n     flexible in a world of increasing change and flexibility.\n       Re-engineering the Department. We will re-engineer by \n     adopting the best private sector business practices in \n     defense support activities. For example, we propose to \n     incorporate state-of-the-art business procedures in our \n     travel system. Section 301 would streamline our household \n     goods transportation so that simplified ``Do-it-Yourself'' \n     (DITY) moves would be available to every service member. \n     Section 401 would authorize streamlined procurement payment \n     practices so that our civilian contractors would get prompt \n     and accurate payments for their goods and services. Section \n     403 would enable all Federal agencies more freely to use \n     private sector practices in the sale of surplus personal \n     property, alone or in conjunction with current Government \n     reinvention and streamlining initiatives, and to foster more \n     expedient and efficient disposals of property.\n       Consolidation. Next, we will consolidate organizations to \n     reduce unnecessary redundancy and to move program management \n     out of Pentagon corporate headquarters and back into the \n     field. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and defense \n     agency personnel will be cut, as will personnel in Department \n     of Defense field and related activities. Section 202 supports \n     this initiative by extending current force drawdown \n     authorities through September 30, 2003. Section 107 would \n     clarify that I can make organizational changes as the \n     National Defense University in order that I can move parts of \n     organizations into that structure when appropriate.\n       In addition to cutting the size of staffs, the DRI will \n     establish a number of new organizational arrangements. Among \n     these is a Threat Reduction & Treaty Compliance Agency \n     created to address the challenges of weapons of mass \n     destruction. Section 102 supports this initiative by \n     eliminating the requirement for an Assistant to the Secretary \n     of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense \n     Programs. Sections 104 through 107 support another \n     important consolidation initiative--establishing a \n     Chancellor for Education and Professional Development to \n     raise the quality of civilian training and professional \n     development to world-class standards. Part of our \n     consolidation effort will enhance the role of the National \n     Guard and other Reserve elements in domestic emergency \n     responses. Sections 501 through 503 support this effort by \n     making our Reserve component and National Guard members \n     more available and an even closer member of our family.\n       Competition. We will compete many more functions now being \n     performed in-house, which will improve quality, cut costs, \n     and make the Department more responsive. While this \n     initiative will apply throughout the Department, some \n     candidates for competition include civilian and retiree \n     payments, personnel services, surplus property disposal, \n     national stockpile sales, leased property management, and \n     drug testing laboratories. Section 402 would permit use of \n     contractor employees of a contractor whose system is being \n     tested, to provide the analytic and logistic support in those \n     cases where contractor impartiality is assured.\n       Elimination. Finally, we will eliminate excess \n     infrastructure. Since the end of the Cold War, the Department \n     of Defense has reduced its military forces significantly, but \n     infrastructure cuts lag behind. The defense budget has been \n     reduced by 40 percent, and military personnel will have \n     declined by 36 percent by 2003. At the same time, after four \n     rounds of base closures, the Department's domestic base \n     structure is only 21 percent slimmer. Consequently, we need \n     to make more infrastructure reductions. Money is wasted on \n     keeping open excess installations. These resources can better \n     be directed to support the warfighter. Title VII of our bill \n     would authorize two additional rounds of base closures. Each \n     round will provide annual savings of $1.4 billion.\n       The DRI would increase direct spending annually by less \n     than $10 million during fiscal years 1999-2002; therefore, it \n     is subject to the pay-as-you-go (paygo) requirement of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. This proposal \n     should be considered with other proposals in the President's \n     Fiscal Year 1999 Budget that together meet the paygo \n     requirement.\n       Enactment of this proposal, together with our other \n     management and structural changes, dramatically will enhance \n     our ability to improve organizational efficiency while making \n     more effective use of the Department's financial and \n     personnel resources. I urge the Congress to enact this \n     legislation promptly so that we can pursue these crucial \n     management reforms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Making pay and chase official policy is just one small \npiece of Secretary Cohen's Defense Reform Initiative or DRI package. \nSecretary Cohen's pay and chase proposal is embodied in section 401 of \nthe DRI.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have section 401 printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Section 401. Authority for Statistical Sampling To Ensure Receipt of \n                          Goods and Services.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 141 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 2405 the \n     following new section 2406:\n\n     Sec. 2406. Statistical sampling procedures in the payment for \n       goods and services before verification\n\n       ``(a) Verification After Payment.--Notwithstanding section \n     3324 of title 31, in making payments for goods or services, \n     the Secretary may prescribe regulations that authorize \n     verification, after payment, of receipt and acceptance of \n     goods and services. Any such regulations shall prescribe the \n     use of statistical sampling procedures for verification and \n     acceptance purposes. Such procedures shall be commensurate \n     with risk of loss to the Government.\n       ``(b) Protection of Payment Officials.--Provided that \n     proper collection actions have been executed, a disbursing or \n     certifying official, who relies on the procedures established \n     pursuant to this section, is not liable for losses to the \n     Government resulting from the payment or certification of a \n     voucher not audited specifically because of the use of such \n     procedures.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for such \n     Chapter 141 is amended by inserting after the item relating \n     to section 2405 the following:\n\n``2406  Statistical sampling procedures in the payment for goods and \n              services before verification.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Section 401 pay and chase proposal has three parts.\n  First, Section 401 would authorize DOD to pay bills without \nreceipts--with no dollar limit.\n  Second, Section 401 would require only random after-the-fact \nverification of some receipts.\n  Third, disbursing officials would be relieved of all responsibility \nfor erroneous or fraudulent payments that could result from this \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, this is a terrible idea. Section 401 says it's OK to \npay bills without receipts. Just do it--$50,000; $500,000; $1 million; \n$10 million; or $100 million. The sky's the limit. It doesn't matter \nhow big the bill is. Just pay it! And if you make a mistake, that's OK, \ntoo. Not to worry.\n  Nobody can be held accountable for erroneous or fraudulent payments. \nThis proposal could not have come at a worse time. All reports from the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) clearly \nindicate that DOD's internal controls are weak or non-existent.\n  Not only do weak or non-existent internal controls make for easy \nembezzlement, they invite it. And it seems like embezzlers are on a \nrampage. That's the subject of a recent article entitled ``Embezzlement \nGrowth is Dramatic.'' The article was written by Mr. Gary Strauss and \nappeared on page 1 of USA Today on January 13, 1998.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Jan. 13, 1998]\n\n                  Embezzlement Growth is ``Dramatic''\n\n                           (By Gary Strauss)\n\n       Wendell Doman wasn't your typical embezzler. A Mormon and \n     father of seven, Doman didn't steal from corporate coffers to \n     fund a wild spending spree, trophy mistress, gambling or drug \n     addition. Instead, the 37-year-old chief financial officer of \n     New Age music company Narada Media was thinking long term.\n       Sure, he spent $37,000 on a BMW he judiciously kept away \n     from the office. And there was the $243,500 Minneapolis home \n     to which he moved after quitting Milwaukee-based Narada in \n     February. But the bulk of the $1.13 million federal \n     prosecutors say he stole was squirreled in Vanaguard's Growth \n     and Income stock mutual fund.\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\n       It's unclear how many Wendell Domans lurk in the offices of \n     Corporate America. Only a fraction of embezzlement cases are \n     reported--the prime reason the Justice Department has \n     difficulty gauging the white-collar crime that can be among \n     the most troubling for businesses.\n       But judging from anecdotal accounts from prosecutors, \n     insurers and fraud specialists, 1997 may go down as a record \n     year for corporate embezzlement.\n       ``There's been a dramatic increase in embezzlement across \n     the board, everything from small mom-and-pop shops to major \n     corporations,'' says Chris Franklin, who manages embezzlement \n     claims for Chubb, a major provider of fidelity insurance, \n     which covers businesses' embezzlement losses.\n       High six-figure and low million-dollar thefts such as \n     Doman's are increasingly common, says Tom Harrington, head of \n     the FBI's economic crimes squad in the agency's Philadelphia \n     office. ``I talk to my counterparts all across the country. \n     The amounts being embezzled are growing.''\n       The FBI estimates 15,700 workers were arrested for \n     embezzlement in 1996, up almost 25% since 1993. But the FBI \n     numbers probably account for just 10% of embezzlers, says \n     Frank Hagan, a criminology professor at Pennsylvania's \n     Mercyhurst College and co-author of White Collar Deviance, to \n     be released next year. ``These numbers aren't accepted by \n     criminologists because embezzling is grossly under-\n     reported,'' he says.\n       Most companies are too embarrassed to report such white-\n     collar crimes for fear of appearing inept, spurring more \n     employee theft or angering sharesholders, clients or \n     customers, says Sharon Parker, who's prosecuted numerous \n     white-collar crime cases as an assistant U.S. attorney in \n     Indiana. Nor are companies legally bound to report \n     embezzlement. Only banks are required to notify authorities.\n       Yet based on a recent, first-of-its kind survey of 2,600 \n     fraud investigators. U.S. businesses lose more than $400 \n     billion annually to fraud, nearly a third of that from \n     embezzlement, says Joseph Wells, head of the 20,000-member \n     Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.\n       ``This reality is a problem, particularly among mid- and \n     upper-level managers,'' says Wells, author of Occupational \n     Fraud and Abuse. Wells cites decentralized operations, mid-\n     level management layoffs, rising computer use and a booming \n     economy.\n       The flourishing cottage industries of fraud investigation, \n     forensic accounting and white-collar criminal defense law \n     underscore embezzlement's growth.\n       ``Business is booming,'' says Howard Silverstone, a \n     forensic accountant with Lindquist Avey Macdonald \n     Baskerville, a financial fraud investigator. ``It's up 300%-\n     400% since the start of the decade. And the cases we hear \n     about are just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the time, it's \n     luck that this kind of crime is even discovered.''\n       Hard statistical evidence aside, embezzlers are getting \n     more brazen.\n       At his recent sentencing on federal wire-fraud charges, \n     Doman contended he was entitled to keep about $206,000, the \n     earnings on the stolen money in his Vanguard account. U.S. \n     District Judge Charles Clevert scoffed at Doman's request, \n     sentenced him to 33 months in prison and ordered him to pay \n     Narada $1.34 million. Doman, serving time in a federal prison \n     in Oxford, Wis., could not be reached.\n       Wednesday, former Los Angeles Times editorial business \n     manager Charles Boesch was sentenced to four years in prison \n     federal charges of embezzling almost $780,000 over four \n     years.\n       Prosecutors say Boesch, 53, took the money--intended as \n     payments to freelance writers--over four years by submitting \n     bogus invoices for payment to accomplices, including his \n     former son-in-law.\n\n\n                             undone by time\n\n       Doman and Boesch's thefts look like chump change compared \n     to the $12.5 million Francis Vitale Jr. stole from specialty \n     chemicals maker Engelhard over nine years.\n       Vitale, Engelhard's former vice president of strategic \n     development and corporate affairs, used the money to \n     accumulate one of the world's most extensive collections of \n     rare and antique clocks. Most of the collection was housed at \n     his Spring Lake, N.J., antique clock shop. It was auctioned \n     for $8 million to repay Engelhard's insurer.\n       At Engelhard, where he earned a six-figure salary and was a \n     member of the management committee. Vitale was ``extremely \n     well-respected'' until a routine audit uncovered the thefts, \n     says corporate spokesman Mark Dresner.\n       Vitale had sole discretion to approve international \n     marketing expenses, so he was able to fabricate more than 150 \n     invoices for his clock shop's purchases into bills Engelhard \n     ``owed'' for expenses. Vitale, 53, is to be sentenced \n     Thursday.\n       It's not uncommon for embezzlers to go undetected for \n     years, largely because managers have few supervisors holding \n     them accountable, says Silverstone, the forensic accountant.\n       That's precisely what happened at Day-Lee Foods, a \n     Japanese-owned meat-exporter in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. In \n     what may be the largest U.S. embezzlement case ever reported, \n     Chief Financial Officer Yasuyoshi Kato stole $95 million.\n       Until the scheme was uncovered by federal tax investigators \n     in March, Kato stole by issuing company checks to himself for \n     seven years. He covered the missing funds by securing \n     corporate loans to Day-Lee from California subsidiaries of \n     Japanese banks, according to court filings.\n       Kato, who earned $150,000 a year, had sole control over \n     Day-Lee's finances. That also enabled him to pay earlier \n     loans by arranging even more loans.\n\n\n                           doing the cha-cha\n\n       Prosecutors contend Kato went through money like water, \n     buying beachfront condominiums, citrus ranches, even a \n     nightclub named Club Cha-Cha. Money also went to his ex-wife, \n     who bought a rare car dealership, jewelry and animal \n     menagerie that included miniature horses and sharks.\n       In October, Kato was sentenced to 63 months in prison. Day-\n     Lee's parent, Nippon Meat Packers, estimates losses, \n     including interest on the loans at $100 million.\n       What motivate embezzlers? Usually any one of a number of \n     vices, although experts paint a portrait of a compulsive, \n     obsessive person in a position of power.\n       Insiders at Engelhard joke about Vitale's clock fetish.\n       Attorneys involved in the Doman case point to a \n     conservative, tightly wound CPA who was paying nearly a third \n     of his $75,000 salary to support his ex-wife and children. \n     Doman also may have felt a sense of entitlement. According to \n     court records, he felt his bosses had reneged on a purported \n     offer of a 5% stake in the company before it was to be sold.\n       Kato's attorney, John Yzurdiaga, says Kato was merely \n     trying to satisfy his ex-wife's insatiable spending appetite.\n       But, notes Chubb's Franklin, the pilferer could be anyone. \n     ``We've seen cases where daughters have ripped off their \n     father's firms,'' he says. ``You can't trust anybody.''\n       In virtually all cases, there are systemic problems, such \n     as lax internal controls, that make it all too easy to steal, \n     says Bart Schwartz, CEO of fraud investigator Decision \n     Strategies/Fair-fax International. ``In a booming economy, \n     everyone's looking at business opportunities. They aren't \n     looking internally,'' he says. ``That can allow schemes to go \n     on for years.''\n       Increasingly, companies are initiating countermeasures. \n     Barnes & Thornburg, a 200-member South Bend, Ind., legal \n     firm, formed a white-collar unit a year ago. They've advised \n     clients to implement compliance programs and improve internal \n     accounting procedures, such as requiring more than one \n     employee to sign checks, says unit chief George Horn.\n       But even Barnes & Thornburg wasn't immune. Longtime partner \n     Ernest Szarwark was indicted in July for mail fraud. He's \n     charged with stealing $500,000 over eight years by taking \n     fees clients paid him and not submitting them to the firm. He \n     also wrote himself checks from the firm's trust account.\n\n\n                       where there's a will . . .\n\n       Ronald TerMeer, on probation after spending 18 months in \n     prison for embezzling $225,000 from Ohio-based Huntington \n     National Bank, says even with beefed up controls, greedy \n     employees will try to circumvent the system.\n       ``You can probably always find a way to steal. But it \n     usually takes someone with obsessive, compulsive behavior to \n     embezzle,'' says TerMeer, the bank's former controller. ``In \n     my case, it was compulsive gambling and alcohol addiction.'' \n     TerMeer has written a self-published book: From Doing Federal \n     Time, A Handbook for Businessmen Who are Facing Federal White \n     Collar Criminal Charges.\n       Experts fear corporate embezzlement is likely to become \n     more pervasive and the thefts even greater.\n       ``Individuals believe they can perpetrate these crimes and \n     get away with it,'' says Chuck Owens, chief of the FBI's \n     financial crimes unit. ``Corporate insider fraud will remain \n     a substantial problem. There's a fairly high greed level out \n     there.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is what the article says.\n  ``Lax internal controls'' are the cause for ``a dramatic increase in \nembezzlement across the board.''\n  ``Lax internal controls'' will be laxer-if Section 401 goes through.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no magic in a receipt.\n  A receipt is not a leakproof defense against fraud--mainly because a \nreceipt is so easy to forge.\n  A receipt by itself is not much of a weapon.\n  It is just one weapon in the controller's arsenal.\n  To be an effective weapon, a receipt must be coupled to other control \ndevices--like separation of duties.\n  Unfortunately, at the Pentagon, receipts don't necessarily go hand-\nin-hand with the other control mechanisms.\n  I learned that lesson in my examination of several DOD fraud cases:\n  The Lugas case at Reese AFB, Texas; the McGill case in Norfolk, VA; \nand the Krenik case in the Pentagon.\n  In these cases, there was no separation of duties.\n  For example, I discoverd that Mr. Krenik's duties literally covered \nthe waterfront. He was involved in every phase of the cycle of \ntransactions from beginning to end. He: developed requirements for \ngoods and services,\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nwrote purchase orders, steered contracts to favored vendors, received \nand accepted deliveries, certified contract performance by signing \nreceiving reports like the DD-250, and submitted invoices to the \nfinance office for payment.\n  In Mr. Krenik's organization--the 7th Communications Group--there was \nno separation of duties. In that environment, it was so easy for Mr. \nKrenik to fabricate phony invoices and receipts and get paid.\n  He said it was a piece of cake. It was just too easy.\n  This is what Mr. Krenik said after being apprehended:\n\n       I saw how others had manipulated the DD-250s [receipts], so \n     I thought I could do that also. . . . It was so easy to \n     generate fake billings and open the Post Office box.\n\n  I fear that Mr. Krenik was led into temptation by lax internal \ncontrols.\n  With separation of duties, it would have been very difficult--if not \nimpossible--for him to do what he did. More scrutiny by others would \nhave greatly increased the probability of detection. That fear alone is \nsometimes enough to deter fraud.\n  With duties properly separated, the goods are delivered to a central \nwarehouse. After a receipt is certified by an independent warehouse-\nperson, the goods are then turned over to the customer or user--someone \nlike Mr. Krenik.\n  In the right circumstances, a certified receipt can be a powerful \nweapon, and I want the certified receipt to be a powerful weapon in the \nDOD Comptroller's arsenal.\n  I want receipt verification to be at the top of the checklist of \nthings to do before making a payment.\n  Above all, I do not want to see this body gut DOD's internal \nfinancial controls--or what remains of them--in the name of ``defense \nreform.''\n  Section 401, as written, would gut DOD's remaining internal controls.\n  Knowing that DOD's internal controls are already weak or non-\nexistent, the GAO and the IG oppose Section 401, as written.\n  Section 401 would eliminate what's leftover, and it ``ain't'' much.\n  And the crooks are hard at work. We know that for a fact because \nthere is a new case at Dayton AFB, Ohio.\n  Though we don't yet have all the details on the case, it looks like a \ncarbon copy of the Krenik case--fraudulent invoices and receiving \nreports valued at nearly $1 million.\n  Dayton happened, despite Air Force assurances to the contrary.\n  The Air Force assured me on July 18, 1997, in no uncertain terms, \nthat a Krenik-style operation could never happen again.\n  The Air Force said it had ``more internal controls to prevent this \ntype of action from happening again.''\n  I hate to say it but Dayton was happening as those words were being \nplaced on paper.\n  Weak or non-existent controls combined with heightened embezzlement \nactivity do not argue for Section 401.\n  So why push pay and chase now?\n  Pay and chase is a bad idea. It would make DOD's accounts more \nvulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  They are already far too vulnerable.\n  What we need to do now is strengthen internal controls not weaken \nthem.\n  We need to make the certified receipt the potent anti-fraud weapon \nthat it should be.\n  DOD should not be authorized to make payments without receipts.\n  And those responsible must be held accountable for erroneous and \nfraudulent payments--as they are today.\n  As I see it, there are two ways to handle Section 401:\n  (1) remove it entirely from the DRI package; or (2) modify it.\n  Mr. President, I am ready to work with the Armed Services Committee \nin developing a mutually acceptable modification to Section 401.\n  It can be done, and I could help the Committee do it.\n  There is a way to do it that will serve the best interests of the \ntaxpayers and the Armed Forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for not to exceed 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4247-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MICROSOFT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, was on the floor this morning once again \nafter his letter of last Friday denouncing Microsoft's use of its First \nAmendment rights to defend itself against an unwarranted attack by the \nDepartment of Justice and a handful of state Attorneys General.\n  At one level, at least, he went beyond the remarks in his letter with \nthe totally unsubstantiated claim that the many C.E.O.'s who joined \nwith Microsoft last week and again today to plead with the Department \nof Justice not to inhibit or to postpone the marketing of Windows' 98 \nwere somehow or another coerced into taking this position. As a \nconsequence the Senator from Utah not only questions the right of men \nand women leading major American corporations to speak out on behalf of \ntheir products, but also insults them by saying they acted outside of \ntheir own freewill. Mr. President as I have said, there isn't the \nslightest evidence for this proposition.\n  These C.E.O.'s were and are defending the right of a magnificent and \ninnovative American corporation to keep on innovating, to keep on \nproviding newer and better products for the people of the United \nStates, and for that matter, for the people of the world.\n  The Senator from Utah buttressed his position by quoting from Judge \nRobert Bork, who has had a dramatic late-life conversion from free \nmarket principles to support willing government intervention in perhaps \nthe most dynamic of all of our free markets. While the Senator from \nUtah defended Judge Bork's objectivity in this, he failed to note that \nthe judge has recently been hired by Netscape and by others.\n  Now, Judge Bork's historic position is perhaps quoted best in just \ntwo lines from his book ``The Antitrust Paradox,'' in which he says \n``the responsibility of the federal courts for the integrity of virtue \nof law requires that they take consumer welfare as the sole value that \nguides antitrust decisions.'' The sole value that guides antitrust \ndecisions should be consumer welfare. Mr. President, in this entire \ndebate, we haven't heard a breath, a whisper, or a sentence about \nconsumer welfare.\n  This is a campaign by Microsoft's unsuccessful competitors to limit \nMicrosoft's competitive ability to benefit consumers. Consumers aren't \ncomplaining, competitors are.\n  Judge Bork has dramatically changed positions from that of a consumer \nadvocate to an advocate of government control. I must confess, Mr. \nPresident, that there is precedent for his position. There are \nantitrust cases that might justify some sort of move of this nature by \nthe Department of Justice. In 1945 in a decision relating to ALCOA, the \nSupreme Court determined that ALCOA's ``superior skill, foresight and \nindustry,'' were exclusionary of less efficient forms. In 1953, in a \ncase involving the United Shoe Machinery Company, it was decided that \nUnited's long line of superior shoe machines and low leasing rates \nillegally excluded higher cost rivals. Now if that is the theory of \nantitrust under which Judge Bork is operating, Senator Hatch is \noperating and the Department of Justice is operating, let them say so. \nLet them say that they don't want innovation, that they don't like the \nnew developments, and that they do not want advancing technology.\n  But, Mr. President, the whole fight in this case is over whether or \nnot we are going to permit the next generation of operating systems to \ngo to market. It is that that is at issue, and only that.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in this connection, Senator Hatch ended his \nremarks with a line from the Rolling Stones. In the interests of \nfairness and impartiality, I think that we ought to try another one. \nWhen I hear Senator Hatch defending Janet Reno and lawyers of the \nJustice Department I figure he has been listening to ``Sympathy for the \nDevil'' a little too much lately. There is another Rolling Stones song \nthat describes what Microsoft does for it's customers: a little hit \ncalled ``Satisfaction.'' Microsoft has been satisfying their customers \nfor 20 years and that's what they ought to continue to do. To the \nSenator from Utah and everyone at the Justice Department who wants to \nstand between Microsoft and its customers, all I can say is, fellas, \n``you can't always get what you want.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4250-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4251-S4252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate on \nH.R. 2676 continue for debate purposes only until 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, so it gives me special joy that we have at last turned the \nSenate's full attention to revamping the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Should we have acted earlier? Of course, we should have. The House \noverwhelmingly passed its version of this bill months ago by a vote of \n426 to 4, and so the reason that we have delayed, frankly, is \ninexplicable given this bill enjoys such broad-based support in both \nChambers of the Congress.\n  The Finance Committee unanimously reported this bill out for action \nin March, and so I am no less encouraged, however, that we are only \nthis week acting on the bill. As you know, we had a subsequent set of \nhearings which spoke to and gave voice to additional problems with the \nInternal Revenue Service, and that had something to do with the delay. \nI think the American people would have liked to have seen us pass the \nlegislation before the tax filing date in April. Nonetheless, we are \nhere today in May to pass this bill, and I am hopeful that we will do \nso.\n  Also, I am very pleased by the way that we have in the interim, since \nthe beginning of these hearings and investigations, put in place a \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service who has demonstrated his \nwillingness to act. I am thankful, also, that in the additional \nhearings that we had in the Finance Committee, any additional \ninformation that came out will provide that Commissioner with the \ninformation he will need to take immediate action to, one, uncover \nabuses, two, rectify them, and three, to protect those good employees \nin the IRS who have been trying to help with the reform of that agency.\n  Over the last 8 months, I, along with a number of my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee, have heard horror story after horror story about \nthe abuses inflicted on taxpayers by unsupportable activity within the \nIRS. We were all outraged by the stories of armed raids on innocent \ntaxpayers' property, unauthorized and unnecessary audits of working-\nclass families, and excessive fees and penalties charged to taxpayers \nwho are just trying to pay their tax bills on time and in a responsible \nmanner. The tales told at those hearings were appalling, but, frankly, \nthey were nothing new to the American taxpayers who know too well what \ncan happen when an agency with the powers of the Internal Revenue \nService goes out of control.\n  Unfortunately, these stories were not the first that we had heard \nabout these abuses. In fact, if anything, the Congress was called upon \nto act precisely because of the taxpayers and citizens who were raising \nthe point with all of us as elected officials and demanding action from \nus. So, finally, we now have an opportunity to respond to them. The \ncalls that we had in my State of Illinois were from Illinoisans who had \nbeen verbally abused or harassed by auditors, people who had grown \nfrustrated with not being able to get a simple answer to a simple \nquestion, or a nice answer to a simple question. All of those things, I \nthink, reach critical mass. And finally the Congress is going to act on \nthis matter. I think it is not a moment too soon. We all have a \nresponsibility and a duty to correct the abuses and an obligation to \nput the ``service'' back into the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n  I would like to point out that it has been some 40 years in the \nmaking since Congress has considered significant reforms to the IRS. \nWith this bill we therefore have a historic opportunity to overhaul \nthis agency and to transform it into an efficient, modern, and \nresponsive agency that is focused on doing its job and not abusing the \nAmerican people. The IRS interacts with more citizens than any other \nGovernment agency, or, frankly, any other private sector business. It \ncollects fully 95 percent of the revenue which is needed to fund the \nnational Government. It is, therefore, unfortunate that it has become \none of the most feared and most hated agencies in the country.\n  But the blame, frankly, does not lie solely with the IRS. My mother \nused to have an expression: ``When you point one finger, you have three \nfingers pointing back to yourself.'' I think, frankly, that Congress \nbears a significant amount of the blame for not exercising its \nappropriate and responsible role in oversight of the agency, but also \nfor creating the chaotic tax collection system that we now have. I \nthink, indeed, Congress bears the greatest blame for creating a Tax \nCode that is burdensome and is so complicated that the transaction \ncosts to ordinary citizens are very often overwhelming. People who \nshould otherwise be able to file a simple tax return find themselves \nfrightened into going and paying tax preparers simply because the Code \nis so complex that they are afraid they can't make their way around it.\n  In addition to the awful state of affairs at the IRS, our tax system \nhas also presented a series of tax loopholes for dishonest citizens. \nYou have the worst of both possible worlds. You have on the one hand \ncomplications that honest citizens have a hard time finding their way \naround, and loopholes that dishonest citizens find too readily.\n  Last week, it was announced that a ``tax gap'' existed, which is the \namount of nonpaid taxes that people avoid by taking advantage of the \nloopholes or the complications in the Code. That tax gap amounts to \nsome $195 billion a year. In other words, honest citizens pay $1,600 a \nyear per year forever in the taxes they pay because of tax avoidance. \nWhile our hearings did not go far enough in talking about this issue of \ntax compliance, it certainly, I think, heads in the right direction if \nwe can restore some sense of fairness, and if we can restore some sense \nof confidence with the American people in the operation of this agency.\n  Mr. President, additionally I hope that after we have passed this \nbill we will also begin to address the issue of tax complication. Just \nlast month, some 120 million Americans sent out some form of tax return \nto the IRS. Of these taxpayers more than 40 percent of them filed \neither the short tax form known as the 1040EZ or the 1040 long form. \nThese two forms--one of which is only one page long--are designed to be \nsimple and easy to complete. But each year, again, millions of \nAmericans paid millions of dollars to tax preparers to fill out these \nforms because they are afraid of making a mistake and facing the wrath \nof an IRS, which, frankly, is not known to be very user friendly. I \nhope that we will address the issue of tax compliance or tax \nsimplification as we address the issue of reform of the agency, because \nwhile these two things are related they are not the same thing, and I \nthink it would be a huge mistake to think that with the passage of this \nlegislation we would have cured the underlying problem with the \ncomplexity and with the confusion that the Tax Code itself causes.\n\n  Unfortunately, we frankly have been moving in the wrong direction in \nregard to tax simplification or getting rid of the complexities. For \nexample, in last year's Balanced Budget Act, which was, of course, \nhailed as providing significant tax relief to the American people, the \nBalanced Budget Act added over 1 million new words and 315 new pages to \nthe Internal Revenue Code. The capital gains computation form alone \ngrew from 19 lines to 54 lines. So anybody who filled out their tax \nforms in April knows how much more difficult we have made the Code by \ntrying to tinker and trying to give tax relief here and tax relief \nthere.\n  The result is tax complexity that is, frankly, overwhelming. The \naverage taxpayer will spend some 9 hours and 54 minutes preparing just \nthe 1040 form for the tax year 1997. The total burden on all taxpayers \nfor maintaining records, preparing and filing their tax returns, is \nestimated to be in excess of 1.6 million hours this year. That is kind \nof a funny number and incomprehensible. But when you consider how\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nmany people have to put in that kind of time, it really is a staggering \nuse of energy and time by the American people that, frankly, could be \nput to better use if we had a more simple and fair Tax Code.\n  I believe, frankly, the system we have now is outrageous. Having the \nadditional headache of figuring out the complex forms dealing with rude \nand cranky workers at the IRS and possibly facing audit is really \noverwhelming. That is what has led to this day and brought us to the \npoint of reforming and changing the system.\n  Mr. President, I think we took the first step toward positive change \nlast October when the President nominated and we confirmed Mr. Rossotti \nto oversee the IRS. Commissioner Rossotti has already begun the process \ntowards changing the way business is done over there. During his short \ntenure he has already been quick to respond to problems that are \nidentified. He has proved that he is not afraid to make the hard calls \nat the IRS. Since his appointment in late October, Commissioner \nRossotti has made several major administrative changes that will help \ntaxpayers break through some of the red tape at the IRS.\n  In December, Commissioner Rossotti announced the establishment of \ninterim procedures requiring higher level management approval of \nseizures of property for nonpayment of Federal taxes. The issue of \nseizures was really one of the high points of the abuses that we heard \nbecause they are so dramatic and so obvious. In January, Commissioner \nRossotti announced broad-sweeping changes designed to modernize the \nService. This ``modernization'' was tailored to emphasize customer \nservice as well as production within the agency. Then, in February \nCommissioner Rossotti announced internal changes to address the \ninnocent spouse problem, and just this past month he announced the \nappointment of William Webster to head the IRS' review of the Criminal \nInvestigations Division. I think we should all applaud his willingness \nto implement some meaningful changes and his interest in moving forward \nquickly on an issue which, frankly, has been very long in the coming.\n  The solution does not lie solely in mending the day-to-day \nadministrative operations of the IRS, however. Indeed, this body shares \na great responsibility in ensuring that we are responsive to the needs \nof taxpayers by passing laws that will put the ``service'' back in \nInternational Revenue Service. I believe that this bill is a major step \nin that direction.\n  In addition to giving Commissioner Rossotti the additional statutory \nauthority he needs to continue restructuring the management of the \nagency, this bill also contains several administrative changes. A new \noversight board is established that will have the responsibility of \nreviewing and approving the operational functions of the IRS and \nreviewing the practices and procedures of the IRS. The IRS is given \ngreater flexibility in hiring and firing IRS employees, and electronic \nfilers are encouraged to continue filing electronically by removing \nbarriers.\n  This legislation, however, also provides taxpayers with a plethora of \nexpanded rights and protections, including provisions that will allow \ntaxpayers to enjoy expanded ability to sue the IRS when the IRS \nblatantly and intentionally disregards the law; a provision that will \ngive the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to provide up to $3 \nmillion annually in matching grants to low-income taxpayer clinics; and \na provision that will eliminate the penalty for failure to pay taxes \nwhen a taxpayer is paying those taxes under an installment agreement. \nThe rules for computation of interest have been simplifies. For those \ntaxpayers who are audited, the bill will include procedures to insure \nthat due process is afforded prior to the seizure of any property and \nit will require that the IRS set up a process so that any lien, levy, \nor seizure will have to be approved by a supervisor. Taxpayers would \nalso be given greater access to installment payment agreements with the \nIRS, greater access to information about the appeals and collections \nprocess, and greater access to statements regarding the payments and \nbalance owed in installment agreements.\n  In addition, several of provisions that I helped craft, and that I \nbelieve will give taxpayers further protection, have also been included \nin this partisan legislation. For example, taxpayers who successfully \ndefend themselves in disputes with the IRS will receive increased \nreimbursements for legal fees and other expenses incurred. In our \nhearings we heard from several attorneys who believes that the IRS \nshould pay more reasonable damages when the IRS erroneously pursues an \ninnocent taxpayer. I believe it is only fair that we not leave the \ntaxpayer holding the bill when the IRS audits them unfairly.\n  Finally, this legislation will also give greater protection to other \nindividuals who are often overlooked by the tax law. For example, new \nprotections for innocent spouses are included in the bill. The change \nwould make couples who file joint returns liable only for taxes based \non the income of the husband or wife instead of the total liability for \nall of the couple's taxes.\n  There are several other provisions that I believe will also serve \nuseful to many taxpayers. Among them is a so called technical \ncorrection that will ensure that more farmers are eligible for the \ninheritance tax relief that was approved last year by Congress and a \nprovision that would protect computer software writers from having \ntheir ``source code'' information arbitrarily accessed by the IRS. I \nsupport the amendment, it is unfortunate that the unintended \nconsequences of complexities we've recently added to the Tax Code come \nto be remedied by such technical corrections.\n  All of these changes are needed to amend the current operation of the \nIRS, but there is still much more to do to address the desperate \ncondition of our tax system as a whole. This bill presents a vital \nfirst step in that process.\n  In closing, I would like to by commending Senators Roth and Moynihan \non their leadership in the Senate Finance Committee on this bill. I \nwould also like to the Kerry Commission for finally getting us to this \npoint.\n  I would have preferred to have completed fundamental reform of the \nIRS prior to the April 15th deadline that 140,000,000 taxpayers have to \nmeet, but as the saying goes, ``better late than never.'' I remain \nencouraged that fundamental reform of our tax system as a whole is \naround the corner, and I look forward to completing action on this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, \nand in doing so beginning the process of reforming our tax system in a \nmanner that is fair and efficient for all Americans.\n  I commend the commission, the Kerrey commission. Senator Kerrey is on \nthe floor. I want to commend him for his work in this regard. He has \ndone a great deal to bring us this far. I want to commend the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for his work in giving us a \nbipartisan bill. I want to register my strong support for this \ninitiative. I think this bill shows Congress at its best, when we are \nfunctioning in the oversight capacity over these agencies that I think \nthe Founding Fathers intended us to do. This oversight is so vitally \nimportant to restore confidence not just in the Internal Revenue \nService but in our Government as a whole.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4251-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4252-S4349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WORKFORCE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1385, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1385) to consolidate, coordinate, and improve \n     employment, training, literacy, and vocational rehabilitation \n     programs in the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form for closing remarks \nprior to final passage.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jana \nO'Leary, who is an intern in my office,\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\nbe allowed to be in the Chamber for the duration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate is resuming consideration of \nthe Workforce Investment Partnership Act, S. 1186. This legislation \nincorporates job training, vocational education, and adult education.\n  Last Friday, the Senate began debate on S. 1186. Amendments by \nSenators DeWine, Domenici, Lautenberg, and Ashcroft were adopted and \nmade a part of this substitute. We have only today to have the final \nvote on the legislation, and we have 1 hour equally divided for that \npurpose.\n  The legislation before this body today is one of the most important \nproposals we will consider this year. S. 1186 proposes a streamlined, \npractical, business-oriented approach to job training which empowers \nStates with the ability to transform the current patchwork of programs \ninto a comprehensive system. The purpose of this bill is to better \ncoordinate and to consolidate in certain circumstances 90 federally \nfunded programs and promote joint partnerships between education \nleaders in the business community in developing a workforce development \nsystem that is first rate.\n  Perhaps the best illustration of why we need to revamp our workforce \nsystem can be clearly seen on a weekly basis in the want-ad sections of \nthe newspapers throughout the Nation. There are presently 190,000 \nunfilled positions in the technology field. The reason for the \ndifficulty in filling these positions is not because of low \nunemployment numbers but because of the lack of skilled workers. Many \nof these jobs do not require 4 years plus postsecondary education. In \nfact, if we had the proper high school vocational education system, \nthese could be filled by students graduating from high school. They \nrequire an excellent vocational education system and the ability to \npursue technical education following high school graduation or receive \nthis education as high school students.\n  One of the most fascinating facts to come out of the Senate Labor \nCommittee's hearings on the workforce is that Malaysia has replicated \nour tech-prep model. In other words, we have presently a model system \nwith a few schools using it which, if duplicated throughout this \ncountry, could provide us with what we need today. The unusual thing is \nthat in this country it takes us a long time to replicate anything \nthrough our school systems. Malaysia came over here, studied our Tech-\nPrep Program, and went back to Malaysia and implemented it overnight--\nagain, moving them into a position to improve their competitiveness and \nperhaps exceed our own competitiveness.\n  That is the kind of challenge we have now had delivered to us by our \ncompetitors in the international markets. It is up to us to take the \nsteps necessary to ensure that we can meet the international \ncompetition which we are facing and not have 190,000 jobs out there \nbegging because we cannot provide the skilled workforce.\n  Fifteen years ago, ``A Nation At Risk'' was published and warned us \nabout this problem. This report posed the question as to whether the \nUnited States would have an adequately trained workforce to meet the \nglobal challenges of the 21st century. Fifteen years later, here is \nwhat we have. According to the latest census information, 22 percent of \nthe population in the United States aged 25 and over have completed \nless than 12 years of schooling. These are the kinds of problems with \nwhich we are faced. A most recent national adult literacy survey \nindicated that 44 million adults have literacy difficulty. This means \nthat over 20 percent of adults in this country have trouble using \nreading, writing, and computation skills to say nothing of qualifying \nfor jobs that are available, for which we should have the workforce. \nThe same is true in my State of Vermont. All States have this very \nserious problem.\n  With the statistics I just mentioned, the United States is still the \nmost productive country in the world, but we are losing our edge to \nother industrialized nations such as Japan and Germany as well as other \nrapidly developing countries such as Taiwan, Korea, and China. Recent \ninternational exams have demonstrated that notwithstanding this warning \nwe had 15 years ago, we have not made significant headway in being able \nto meet the challenge of that competition and to provide the workforce \nfor those 190,000 jobs that are going begging right now.\n\n  Over the past 25 years, the standard of living for those Americans \nwithout a 4-year postsecondary degree has plunged. In the next decade, \nwe are in danger of being surpassed as the world's foremost economic \npower if we do not begin to redefine our priorities at the national, \nState, and local levels.\n  This is an excellent bill, Mr. President. Senator DeWine, my good \nfriend from Ohio, who was in charge of the subcommittee that developed \nthis bill, along with Senator Wellstone, has produced a wonderful bill. \nIt is going to do a great deal to bring us forward as we face the \nproblems of the Nation and the problems of our national \ncompetitiveness.\n  Mr. President, at this point I will be happy to yield the floor. \nSenator Wellstone, I believe, desires to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague, \nSenator Kerrey, from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1186, the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act. This is an initiative that I have been involved with \nsince my days as Governor of Nebraska from 1983 to 1987, and it is \nsomething I am proud to see come to fruition in the Senate.\n  All of us understand that in today's global economy, this kind of \nlegislation represents an important step in helping individual \nAmericans achieve their shot at the American dream.\n  One of the most satisfying efforts for me is to help, as a public \nofficial, some individual acquire the skills they need to earn a good \nwage so that they can support themselves and their families. \nInvestments such as vocational education, job training, and adult \neducation play a major role in this effort. But in order to be more \neffective, these programs need to be streamlined and coordinated in \nsuch a way that they work together to provide individuals the \ninformation and resources they need to be successful in a job market \nthat demands an increasingly higher skill level.\n  In 1994, along with Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, I introduced \nlegislation to consolidate 91 job training programs into a single \nauthorization called the Workforce Development Act. The bill also \nsought to reconnect job training, training-related education, and \nactual jobs. It also provided States greater flexibility in designing \njob training systems.\n  Mr. President, I take great pleasure and am pleased that these \nconcepts represented in this legislation are also incorporated into S. \n1186. S. 1186 also encourages statewide partnerships consisting of the \nbusiness community, the education community, the Governor, and local \nand State elected officials. A key responsibility in this partnership \nis the development of a State plan. The legislation also encourages \none-stop customer service centers which will provide a central point of \nentry to job training programs.\n  In the last few years in my State of Nebraska, Congress has increased \nits commitment to preparing individuals for the workforce. We have seen \nin our State an increase in Federal funding for job training of \napproximately $1.5 million since 1996; for vocational education, we \nhave seen an increase of about $700,000; and for adult education, about \n$460,000.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call this to the attention of my \ncolleagues. I suspect, if they are like me, sometimes these program \nnames get confusing, and I wonder whether or not they have any impact.\n  In Nebraska, the $6.276 million allocation of Federal job training \nfunds in 1997 provided 4,000 of my citizens with the skills they need \nto become more productive and to earn a higher living and satisfy the \nmarket demand, as the Senator from Vermont identified. There are many \njobs out there that are unfilled simply because we cannot find people \nwith skills. Mr. President, 4,000 of those jobs were filled; 4,000 of \nthose people are happier.\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\n  In addition, vocational and applied technology education grants \nassisted 70,000 secondary students and 47,800 post-secondary students \nwho now have higher skills, a technical education they otherwise would \nnot have had. They are going to get a shot at the American dream. They \nare going to be happier. They are going to be healthier. As I said, \nthere are very few things that are more gratifying than having an \nindividual say to you, ``Thank you for helping me get a shot at the \nAmerican dream,'' and 17,340 adults in a single year were assisted in \nmy State as a consequence of the $1.7 million in addition education.\n  This is an investment with an excellent return. The legislation will \nnot only help more individuals achieve the American dream but will also \nhelp our Nation become the best educated, most productive country in \nthe world as we enter the 21st century. The Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act represents a good bipartisan effort to increase \nopportunities for American citizens. I look forward to seeing it move \nthrough Congress, and I congratulate and thank sincerely the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, \nand the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Senator Wellstone, as \nwell as the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator DeWine. On behalf of \nthe tens of thousands of Nebraskans who will receive the benefits of \nthis program, I thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask if, after 10 minutes, I might be \nso notified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Chairman \nJeffords for his leadership. He had a lot to do with this piece of \nlegislation. We did a lot of work on the Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining, but Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy were absolutely \ncritical to bringing this piece of legislation finally to the floor and \nkeeping all of us together. Senator DeWine--it was really a labor of \nlove working with him. He has just put all of himself into this piece \nof legislation. He has done a great job.\n  I would also like to thank a couple of other people: On Senator \nKennedy's staff, Jeff Teitz, who is out on the floor with me today, for \nhis work, and Brian Ahlberg who works with me and has put hundreds of \nhours into this, as have a number of other very talented people.\n  I am not going to go into all of the specific provisions. I really \nwant to take some time to thank some people who helped out. But let me \njust say, S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, is an \nimportant piece of legislation. The President correctly observed that \nthe bill is ``essential to widening the circle of opportunity for more \nAmericans and keeping our economy growing steady and strong.''\n  My concern all along has been that over the past couple of years \nthere has been some discussion about cutting funding for job training \nprograms. That would be the worst thing in the world for us to do. I \nthink what we have now done, in a bipartisan way, is we brought people \ntogether around to job training that really takes root at the community \nlevel. We are talking about a program that is more streamlined. We \ndecentralize it. There are accountable job performance measures, as \nthere should be. The Governors have a key role to play, but they are in \npartnership with local communities. And at local levels of government, \nwhether they be county or city, you have key decisionmakers as well.\n\n  The private sector is an essential part of this, as should be the \ncase, because a lot of these jobs that will be created will be in the \nprivate sector. We are talking about, you know, that goal that I think \nis the most important goal for most families in our country, which is \nto earn a decent living and to be able to raise your children \nsuccessfully. This is all about doing that.\n  In addition, we have kept separate funding for adults and youth and \ndislocated workers. We don't have a straight block grant program; we \nkeep our priorities at the national level. I think we should do that.\n  The out-of-school youth initiative is extremely important, targeting \nfunds to youth in high-poverty areas, both urban and rural. Please \ncolleagues--and I don't think too many colleagues make this mistake, \nbut quite often when we talk about ``youth'' or ``lack of jobs'' or \n``young people dropping out of schools'' or ``inadequate housing'' or \n``inadequate education'' or ``affordable child care'' or ``affordable \nhealth care,'' we think about these issues as urban issues. These \nissues are every bit as important to rural America. The problems are \nmore hidden but they are no less real. The nice thing about the out-of-\nschool initiative is that it is already paid for. Congress has already \nprovided $250 million in an advance appropriation.\n  I want to take special note of the contribution of Hennepin County \nCommissioner Peter McLaughlin, who testified at one of our subcommittee \nhearings.\n  I want to also take note of our important national job training \nprograms that we have renewed. The Job Corps Program, we have the \nHubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center in Saint Paul, which is one of the \nbest performing centers in the country. Last year, we had Ralph \nDiBattista and Dave McKenzie, the current director--Ralph was a former \ndirector--at a hearing on youth training. They were joined by Susan \nLees, who is an impressive young trainee at the center, on her way to \nbecoming an auto technician at the Ford dealership.\n  The bill also renews current Native American programs and migrant and \nseasonal farm worker programs.\n  And finally the veterans program--I want to say to the veterans \ncommunity, we heard from you loud and clear. You wanted to have a \nseparate focus on veterans programs, a separate funding stream. We have \nsome additional provisions by way of eligibility to make sure that gulf \nwar veterans, some of whom are really struggling, will be well served; \nas well as homeless veterans.\n  We have also built into this bill the continuation of Concentrated \nEmployment Programs, rural CEPs. That is to say, in rural areas where \nthere is high concentration of unemployment and poverty, we have a \nspecial focus to make sure the job training is out there.\n  I think--and many colleagues have worked on this but I get to say it \non the floor of the Senate, with some pride--this is a very Minnesota-\nlike program. The one-stop centers, we have been doing that in our \nState. The idea of decentralization, of trying to build good \npartnerships between the Governor and the local community, trying to \nbuild good partnerships between the public and private sector with a \nfocus on good job training, good skills development, and job \nopportunities for people. Job opportunities for people--I can't really \nthink of anything more important for us to be focusing our attention \non.\n  So, I want to make it very clear that I am very, very proud of this \npiece of legislation. I thank my colleagues again--Senator DeWine, \nSenator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy as well.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, 23 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't see other Senators on the floor \nright now. I might just highlight some amendments to this piece of \nlegislation, to make maximum use of time.\n  There are five amendments to the bill which we have agreed to accept. \nThe first is one by Mr. DeWine. It is the vocational rehabilitation \nbill. It is extremely important. I think what Senator DeWine has done \nis basically provided a set of improvements to this piece of \nlegislation. It is an amendment that I strongly support.\n\n  There is an amendment by Senator Lautenberg which gives units of \nlocal government which are currently service delivery areas under the \nJob Training Partnership Act, and which have a population of 200,000 or \nmore, an automatic right to appeal to the Secretary of Labor a decision \nby a Governor not to continue that area as an SDA. That also is an \namendment which I support.\n  There are two other amendments by Senator Ashcroft which I will my \ncolleague, the chairman, Senator Jeffords, to speak to if he chooses.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. On my time, I will.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I won't use anymore time. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, let me just make a few more comments. I believe \nSenator DeWine will be here shortly. As was pointed out, there are \nthree bills which are combined in this bill, and I want to talk a \nlittle bit about vocational rehabilitation.\n  It is extremely important that as we move forward, we do more and \nmore for our disabled community to give them every possible opportunity \nto compete for jobs and to demonstrate their capacity to help our \nNation's workforce. We place these programs together, although we \nmaintain separate streams of funding to ensure that each of these \nprograms in adult education, vocational education, job training, and \nvocational rehabilitation will not feel at all threatened that money \nwill be taken from them.\n  It is important at the same time that we recognize the great capacity \nof people with disabilities to come into the workforce if they are \ngiven the opportunity. By placing them in the same bill, it is \nimportant to demonstrate that they are ready and willing to take \nadvantage of the opportunities in the workforce in many places which \nthey have been denied.\n  Also, as I mentioned earlier in my statement, the problems we have \nwith the adult workforce is literacy, to a large extent. As the demands \nbecome higher and greater on our workforce, we are recognizing that we \nneed more people to move into the workforce to take the jobs that are \navailable. Thus, it is incredibly important that we coordinate adult \neducation along with vocational education.\n  That is the purpose of this bill, to get everybody to work together \nto improve the workforce of this Nation to meet the competition of \nnations overseas. While I am pleased with the progress we have made, I \nbelieve that we have moved forward on this bill to do everything \npossible we can to make ourselves more competitive.\n  I will now talk a little bit about a report released by the National \nCenter for Research and Vocational Education which gave a good overview \nof training in European nations. I think it is important that my \ncolleagues understand the kind of competition we are getting in Europe, \nand I will say the same is true and maybe even more so in Asia.\n  This report highlights the importance of a cohesive partnership \nbetween educators and employers. Employers in Europe are active \nparticipants in the governance of work-related education and training \nin Australia, Great Britain, France and Germany.\n  Another significant finding of the report is that European nations, \nsuch as the Netherlands and Denmark, are attempting to develop a \ntechnical education system which can survive as either a bridge to \nadditional vocational training or pursuing college-level courses.\n  Although we are not Europe, we are beginning to make some progress. \nWith the passage of S. 1186, that progress will only continue to grow.\n  I am also hopeful that passage of the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act will eliminate many of the misconceptions that exist \nregarding vocational education, adult education and training. Some \nperceive vocational education as a second-rate education for students \nwho cannot otherwise succeed in the so-called traditional academic \npath. Nothing--and I say nothing--could be further from the truth. In \nfact, the opposite in many cases is the situation now.\n\n  Vocational education courses hold appeal for all students. In my home \nState of Vermont, over 4,500 students participate in vocational \neducation courses of which 12 percent are adults. A strong technical \neducation system is the best kind of training. As has been pointed out, \nas we move forward in our lives, the need for vocational education or \nskills training is going to increase. We are going to change jobs five, \nsix, seven times during our lives as we move into the next century, and \nwe are going to need training continuously.\n  The same is true now with our society. However, we just do not have \nthe appropriate training available. We need to coordinate, we need to \nget together and figure out how we can provide the skills that are \nnecessary.\n  If employment and training programs are to succeed, a simple, \nintegrated workforce development system must be established that gives \nStates, local communities, employers and students both the assistance \nand the incentives to participate in our global economy. S. 1186 is a \ngood step in responding to this need. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe passage of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act.\n  Before turning to others who may want to speak on this legislation, I \nagain thank my colleagues and coauthors of the bill, in particular \nSenators Kennedy, DeWine and Wellstone. In particular, I thank the \nEmployment and Training Subcommittee chaired by Senator DeWine, who has \ndone an outstanding job in putting together this bill. Senator \nWellstone, the Employment and Training Subcommittee ranking member, has \nalso done a tremendous job in drafting key provisions of this bill. \nSenator Kennedy and I have been working for many years on this effort, \nand we are pleased to have Senators DeWine and Wellstone as our \npartners.\n  I also thank the staff of Senators Wellstone, Kennedy and DeWine, and \nthe staff of the Congressional Research Service and legislative counsel \nhave worked tirelessly on this bill.\n  In addition, I also thank the administration for their hard work. The \nbusiness community led by the National Alliance for Business, the \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers are also \nto be commended for their efforts and for their support.\n  I express my appreciation to the Chief State School Officers and \nother educational organizations who offered constructive comments \nduring the drafting of S. 1186.\n  Most of all, I thank my home State of Vermont for serving as an \ninspiration for this legislation. Almost 1 year ago, I held a hearing \nin Vermont on workforce development. Over 100 Vermonters attended and \noffered various perspectives which have been incorporated in this bill.\n  Also, I thank the State of Mississippi. I went down to the State of \nMississippi and found that they had one of the most innovative \nvocational education systems that I have had the chance to observe. \nThey are dedicated there and doing a fine job.\n  In fact, I noted that their unemployment rate was going down, even \nthough they were losing hundreds of jobs to Mexico. Why? Because of the \nbusiness community seeing the state of their vocational training and \ntheir ability to train for the skills necessary for the jobs that are \nlocating in Mississippi. Thus, they are losing low-wage jobs and \nreplacing them with high-wage jobs. We have, therefore, taken a close \nlook at the Mississippi system and have made sure our bill models their \ninitiative. So I commend those in other States and certainly my own \nState of Vermont which I mentioned, who have tried to make efforts but \nthey have been hindered to a certain extent by the problems with our \npresent system, the inability to coordinate.\n\n  This bill is designed to try and provide that coordination, to ensure \nthat all of this country can move now to make sure that we are ready \nfor the future. We established the goals to make sure by the next \ncentury we would have moved past our educational difficulties to the \ngreatest extent possible, to make sure that our young people would be \nready to enter the workforce, to make sure we provided them the skills \nnot after high school but in high school, as well as to make sure this \nNation would be competitive in the year ahead.\n  I yield to my good friend, Senator DeWine, who deserves maximum \ncredit from our side for his productive work in giving us a bill today \nwhich we can be proud of, which we can vote for with great confidence. \nWe will improve this Nation's workforce.\n  I yield to Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Jeffords for the work he \nhas done on this bill. It is a real bipartisan bill, as we have pointed \nout many times on this floor; Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Jeffords, myself. It is a bill that will truly change the \nstatus quo, a bill that will really make a difference.\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\n  We will be voting on this bill in about half an hour. This \nlegislation, S. 1186, will fundamentally reform our Nation's currently \nfragmented, duplicative and many times ineffective job training \nprograms. I believe this bill will transform them into a coordinated, \naccountable, and flexible workforce investment system.\n  Before the Senate votes, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the \nreasons why the Workforce Investment Partnership Act does enjoy such \nbipartisan support. One of the most historic, if not the most historic \naccomplishments of the 105th Congress was the legislation that \nrevolutionized the American welfare system. In passing a bill to end \nwelfare as we knew it, we were empowering the States and local \ncommunities to seek a better way to make work, not welfare, the way of \nlife for millions of disadvantaged Americans.\n  The bill we are considering this evening, S. 1186, is a very \nimportant extension of that basic welfare reform, continuing the \ndevolution of Federal power to where it rightfully belongs--States, \nlocalities--and most importantly, the individuals who are voluntarily \nseeking training assistance.\n  This bill, S. 1186, recognizes the leadership of States and \nlocalities which have show innovation and initiative over the last few \nyears, even in the midst of many times onerous Federal barriers and \nobstacles. By eradicating outdated rules and regulations, we can remove \nthe barriers that have stymied people in the past. We can empower \nStates and local communities by giving them the tools, the tools and \nthe flexibility that they need to implement real reform, reform that \nwill allow them to provide truly comprehensive training services.\n  This bill, S. 1186, also promotes free market competition. The \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act establishes an effective and \naccountable workforce development system, ensuring that training leads \nto meaningful, long-term employment.\n  Under this bill, training services will be held accountable to high \nstandards. This means they will have to prove training leads ultimately \nto meaningful, unsubsidized employment, showing how many people were \nplaced, at what cost, and how many people remained employed 6 months, a \nyear or 18 months later. That is true accountability. That is the true \nmeasure of whether job training works or does not work. Does the person \nhave a job 6 months or 12 months later, and what kind of a job is it.\n  S. 1186 also has bipartisan support because it eliminates government \nbureaucracy and promotes personal responsibility. The Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act would provide training assistance through \nindividual training accounts or vouchers in order to allow the \nindividual seeking assistance to have a say themselves about where, how \nand what training they will receive. These programs should be tailored \nto individual needs, not to Washington bureaucrats and what Washington \nbureaucrats think is best.\n\n  This bill provides program coordination and simplification. The \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act incorporates nearly 70 categorical \nprograms, eliminating numerous Federal requirements and mandatory set-\nasides. This bill authorizes and expands a modified work-flex program \nwhich allows States to approve requests for waivers of Federal \nstatutory and regulatory requirements submitted by their local \ncommunities. The bill provides States with the option to submit a \nunified plan or a single-State plan for the numerous programs \nincorporated into the legislation.\n  Further, this bill removes income eligibility requirements. States \nwill be allowed to provide all adults who voluntarily seek assistance \nthe comprehensive services available through the one-stop customer \nservice system--services such as job search, placement assistance, \nskill assessment, and case management.\n  Just like welfare reform, job training reform depends on \nparticipation of the business community, the local business community. \nThis bill not only allows for business community involvement, but \nbusiness community leadership, as well. The private sector must outline \nits employment needs and assist in the design of training programs so \nthat individuals that receive training assistance obtain long-term, \nmeaningful employment.\n  To summarize, job training reform is needed. It is needed because we \ncan no longer afford the Washington-knows-best attitude that created \nthe current maze of training and related programs. With a few notable \nexceptions, the evidence on the one-size-fits-all approach reveals far \nmore failures than successes. However, because of Congress' inability \nto enact reform in the past, States and localities have begun the task \nof creating their own comprehensive systems which meet the unique needs \nof their States and local communities.\n  Frankly, they have been frustrated. They have been frustrated by the \nFederal laws and regulations which prevent them from developing more \nresponsive and more effective workforce investment systems. This bill, \nthe Workforce Investment Partnership act, is designed to reform the \nFederal Government's role in providing job training assistance to \nAmericans. For too long, that role has been to foster confusion, \nfrustration, and complication. With this bipartisan bill, we offer a \nnew foundation and a positive framework for success. Instead of rules \nthat tie the hands of States and localities, this bill provides the \ntools, the tools to empower them to develop comprehensive work force \ninvestment systems that address the needs of job seekers and employers \nalike.\n  This morning's Cleveland Plain Dealer, in an editorial, I think, gets \nit exactly right. ``A Bill That Works. Consolidation could produce job-\ntraining programs that do their own jobs better.'' ``A Bill That \nWorks.''\n  This bill is a road map, a road map to a better system. If we are to \nachieve the goals we have set--stronger economy, a better trained \nworkforce, true and meaningful welfare reform--we need to begin that \njourney today.\n  I want to thank all my colleagues who have worked so hard to pass \nthis important bill. I also want to thank all the concerned individuals \nand groups who have offered their support, including the National \nAlliance of Business, City of New York, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nCouncil of Chief State School Officers, Society for Human Resource \nManagement, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nCleveland Growth Association, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the National Association of Private Industry Councils, \nthe National Association of Counties, the American Vocational \nAssociation and the National Association of State Directors of \nVocational Education Consortium. All of these groups have worked to put \nthis bill together. We have a comprehensive bill that brings about the \nreform that we all need.\n  In summary, we will be voting in a little over 20 minutes on a bill \nthat will fundamentally reform job training in this country. This \nreform is long overdue. It is a reform that will bring about more \naccountability. We will be able to measure success and failure better. \nIt is a bill that will give more authority to the local communities. It \nwill be a bill that will empower the recipients to have more choices in \nregard to the job training that fits their needs. And it will work. It \nwill work because we are incorporating, as never before, the local \nbusiness community--not just in the implementation of the plan, but \nrather in the design of the plan. The one thing that we have seen as we \nhave held hearings across this country, time and time and time again, \nis how important it is to include the local business community because, \nultimately, they are the consumers, along with the people who need the \njobs and the people who need the job training. They are all the \nconsumers. It doesn't do any good to design a job training program and \ntrain someone for a job and that job does not exist in the local \ncommunity. That is why the enclosure and inclusion of the business \ncommunity, making them a part of this process from the very beginning, \nis such an essential part of this bill.\n\n  Let me again thank Chairman Jeffords for his work on the bill, along \nwith Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, and the other members of the \ncommittee. This bill was passed out of our committee by a unanimous \nvote. Several of my colleagues have already noted on the floor that \nthis is a committee that has a very wide divergence of points of view. \nThis committee has many members that have opinions that many times do \nnot always\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nagree. But the fact that we were able to pass this bill unanimously out \nof the committee, I think, shows its bipartisan support and also shows \nthat the status quo was not acceptable, and this bill makes a \nsignificant change and improvement in that status quo.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        PRE-VOCATIONAL TRAINING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \nissue of pre-vocational training in the context of this legislation. In \nMarch, I introduced S. 1709, the Job Preparation and Retention Training \nAct of 1998, which would have authorized a new Labor Department program \nproviding grants to community-based organizations which would provide \nessential pre-vocational training to individuals who have not \nsuccessfully entered the workforce.\n  In my floor remarks on March 4 upon introduction of S. 1709, I noted \nthat one such community-based organization, Opportunities \nIndustrialization Centers of America, Inc., has found that the average \nhourly wage of trainees prior to pre-vocational training was $3.70, but \nafter such training, these same participants started earning an average \nof $8.00 an hour, with a placement rate of 85 percent into gainful \nemployment.\n  After consultation with Chairman Jeffords, I have decided not to \noffer my bill as an amendment to the comprehensive job training bill \nbefore us, based on assurances that in Conference, he and Chairman \nDeWine will work with me to ensure that pre-vocational training is more \naccessible to individuals who are not prepared to fully benefit from \nthe training and skills development provided in S. 1186.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his work on \njob training and educational issues, both in this context, and as \nChairman of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over such \nprograms. I will endeavor to work with him on enhancing the issue of \npre-vocational training in conference with the House and welcome his \ninput on this critical issue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 1186--the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act and to applaud the Labor and Human \nResources Committee for the bipartisan manner in which the legislation \nwas developed.\n  In the last Congress the opportunity for reform of employment and \ntraining programs was lost due to partisan bickering and the insistence \non a reform structure which I believe jeopardized the investment in \nskills training--and in particular the investment in the retraining of \ndislocated workers.\n  This bill builds on the success of the dislocated worker program and \nadds other elements which will improve the program. These include \nestablishing One-Stop centers as the framework of the new workforce \ndevelopment system which will improve dislocated worker access to \nquality information and services, and the proposed skill grants--or \nIndividual Training Account system--which will enable them to make \ninformed choices about training opportunities with qualified vendors.\n  Despite our improving economy, there are always workers who will lose \njobs because of economic change. We owe these workers the tools to get \nback on their feet, through rapid response to plant closings and mass \nlayoffs, job search assistance and retraining for new jobs. I am \nparticularly pleased that this bill includes rapid response and labor-\nmanagement committees which have been important tools under the current \ndislocated worker program. This program, where formula grants to states \nand localities are supplemented by National Reserve Account to allow \nthe Secretary of Labor to respond to emergencies, has been successful \nin helping hundreds of thousands of workers each year to make mid-\ncareer changes.\n  The current dislocated worker program served approximately 540,000 \ndislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who \ncompleted the program during that year, 71 percent were employed when \nthey left the program, earning on average 93 percent of their previous \nwages, and for workers who had received retraining, the wage \nreplacement was 95 percent.\n  The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor \nconducted an audit of JTPA Title III retraining services to determine \nhow successful retraining was in helping dislocated workers to return \nto work. The conclusion of the April 1995 report was: ``The purpose of \nTitle III is to return dislocated workers to productive employment. In \nthis context, the program was successful. Program participants were \nreemployed, remained in the workforce, and regained their prior earning \npower.''\n  In my own state of Washington, we have experienced layoffs in the \ntimber and aerospace industries and the assistance provided by Title \nIII of JTPA has been essential to meeting the needs of affected \nworkers.\n  The success of the program is illustrated by the experience of one \ndislocated worker, Mr. David Hamilton of Valley, Washington. He had a \nsteady income working in the logging industry, but only for six to \neight months each year. This created a difficult financial situation \nwhen employment was not available. In July 1995, he was laid off from \nAccord Logging.\n  He decided to investigate career options in the cross-country truck \ndriving field. He learned of the opportunities available through JTPA \nand began actively seeking financial assistance for training. With only \na tenth grade education, his employment opportunities were limited. He \nknew that he needed a GED, but his assessment test also indicated a \ndeficiency in basic math skills. With his unemployment benefits nearly \nexhausted, he held steadfastly to his hope of entering the truck \ndriving industry. He pursued his education and training through the \nColville Job Service JTPA Title III program. His determination to \nobtain a Commercial Drivers License increased as he passed his physical \nand Wonderlic tests (in lieu of a GED). He met the program \nqualifications for Title III funding and completed his training on \nFebruary 23, 1997, with excellent grades. He was immediately placed \nwith G & G Trucking and was driving cross-country the following Monday. \nG & G agreed to assist him with the financing needed to purchase a \ntractor. Within six months he became an owner-operator. As an owner-\noperator, he will earn between $12 and $18 per hour. He now has a \nreliable source of income and greater financial security.\n  The success of Mr. Hamilton and other dislocated worker program \nparticipants is why I am so pleased that S. 1186 is designed to assure \nthat funding for dislocated workers will be maintained. This is an \nimportant improvement over last year's bill and I thank the authors of \nS. 1186 for their attention to this critical item.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from Mr. Rick Bender, President of Washington State's \nLabor Council. I have been working with Chairman Jeffords to address \nTitle III in the bill which provided training funds only after labor \nconsultations have been performed. I am hopeful that the Department \nwill work with respective labor organizations to continue this \nsuccessful communication. Washington State has developed a Community \nBased Rapid Response policy that quickly meets the various needs and \nconcerns of dislocated workers. Mr. Bender has been at the forefront of \nthis effort and provides a compelling argument to continue this \nconsultation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Washington State\n\n\n                                       Labor Council, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                      Seattle, WA, March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: The Workforce Investment Partnership \n     Act (S. 1186) is ready to come to the floor of the US Senate \n     for action. The Act, as written, is missing a crucial \n     provision of benefit to Union members.\n       The current JTPA Act provides that, ``. . . any program \n     conducted with funds made available under Title III which \n     will provide services to a substantial number of members of a \n     labor organization will be established only after full \n     consultation with such labor organization.'' (Sec. \n     311(b)(7)). This provision is ominously absent from the new \n     bill.\n       The new legislation will cause irreparable harm to our \n     Union members who suffer layoff through plant closure due to \n     the failure to require labor consultation when planning \n     services for them.\n       The language quoted above has enabled the Washington State \n     Labor Council, AFL-CIO, to assist its affiliates in demanding \n     appropriate levels of service for their members who are \n     facing long term layoff. The ability to demand that funding \n     be pulled from bad\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\n     retraining programs has been key to the success of Labor's \n     active participation in workforce employment and training \n     programs in Washington State.\n       The Washington State Labor Council presently operates a \n     contract with Washington State Employment Security to provide \n     Rapid Response services to our union members whose plant(s) \n     may be closing or downsizing. By actively invoking this \n     language, we make the workforce development system move \n     towards a customized approach toward service and training \n     design, which takes the needs of working men and women and \n     their families into account. Without this language in the \n     bill service and training design will take the convenience of \n     service agencies into account, not our members' needs.\n       Any assistance you can provide to insert this crucial \n     provision into S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership \n     Act, will be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Rick S. Bender,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the \nbipartisan chorus in support of the Workforce Investment Partnership \nAct. I commend the sponsors for their excellent work. Senators \nJeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone have done an outstanding job \nof crafting legislation that is long overdue. For too long American \nworkers have had to struggle through a complex system of dozens of \ndifferent job training and educational programs to get the skills they \nneeded to enter, or reenter the job market. Today, the Senate takes \nconcrete steps to streamline the current system so that getting the \nhelp they need will be easier for the workers of America.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act simplifies the search for a \njob by encouraging communities to establish a ``one stop shopping'' \nlocation. Localities will have one location where an individual can go \nto get help finding a job or search out skill training opportunities. \nAt this location all of the options will be laid out, and the choice \nwill be up to the worker.\n  Inherent in this idea is that there will be no wrong door. No longer \nwill a person be told, ``We can't help you here because you don't \nqualify for these programs. Maybe they can help you down the hall.'' \nThat sort of bureaucratic run around results in inefficiency and \nfrustrates the very people we are trying to help.\n  This job training reform bill focuses on shifting power back to the \nstates and local communities. Government, business, labor, and \ncommunity groups will collaborate on strategies that fit the economic \nsituation of the individual state and locality. The Senate version of \nthis bill also takes the important step of allowing states to keep \nreforms they have made that are working. Wisconsin has made many \nchanges to its job training system on its own initiative that have been \nground- breaking and very successful. I am pleased the Committee \nrecognizes that there is no need to replace programs that are already \ndoing the job and meeting the goals set forth in this legislation.\n  I am also pleased we maintain our commitment to helping at risk \nyouth. This bill ensures that providing opportunities for kids on the \nedge will continue, and that the funds will move quickly to those who \nneed it most. I hope that the Conference Committee can quickly complete \nits work so that the $250 million set aside in last year's budget for \nOut-of-School Youth will become available before the July 1 deadline. \nThese kids need our help to become productive citizens and contribute \nto society. If Congress fails to complete action before July 1, these \nyoung people will be forced to wait even longer for our support.\n  In today's global economy, our people are our greatest resource. With \nthe rise in information and technology, the nations that are the most \ncreative, most innovative, and most inventive will have the edge. The \nUnited States currently has the lead in these sectors and this bill \nwill help our people maintain their advantage through continuing their \neducation and updating their skills. Our nation's continued prosperity, \nand the prosperity of our workers, hinges on a well-trained workforce. \nThis bill helps ensure that our current economic growth will continue \ninto the future and be shared by all Americans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1579, the \nRehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, of which I am proud to be an \noriginal co-sponsor. I would like to commend Senators Jeffords, DeWine, \nKennedy, and Wellstone, for making reauthorization of the \nRehabilitation Act a priority, and for including this legislation as an \namendment to the Workforce legislation.\n  The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program provides $2.2 \nbillion in formula grant assistance to States to help individuals with \ndisabilities prepare for and engage in gainful employment. Since \nestablished by the Smith-Fess act 75 years ago, state vocational \nrehabilitation programs have served some nine million people. This \nprogram promotes economic independence for people with disabilities, \nand the numbers reflect that.\n  In 1992, Congress made major changes to the Act, namely, increasing \nconsumer participation, streamlining processes, and reducing \nunnecessary paperwork. In the bill before us today, we have built on \nthe '92 amendments. The bill preserves and strengthens the themes of \nthe '92 amendments, while fine-tuning and aligning the Act with other \nworkforce reforms.\n  The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 strengthen the role of the \nconsumer throughout the vocational rehabilitation process, particularly \nin the development of the individual's employment plan. This \nreauthorization reduces unnecessary burdens on State VR agencies by \nstreamlining the State plan; indeed, the bill reduces the 36 State plan \nrequirements in current law to 24. The bill also refocuses the State \nplan on improving outcomes for individuals with disabilities by \nrequiring States to develop, jointly with the State Rehabilitation \nCouncil, annual goals and strategies for improving results.\n  Access of Social Security beneficiaries to VR services is \nfacilitated, and unnecessary gatekeeping is eliminated, by making SSI \nand SSDI beneficiaries presumptively eligible for services under the VR \nStates Grants program. This change will eliminate the need for the VR \nagency to determine on a case-by-case basis whether individuals \n``require'' VR services in order to gain employment. Under this bill, \nif a person receiving SSI or SSDI walks through the door of a VR \nagency, that person will be presumed eligible for VR services. As the \nAdministrator of the Iowa VR agency explained to me, ``now we don't \nhave to spend time and money determining whether an individual on SSI \nor SSDI is eligible for services. Instead, we can focus our resources \nwhere they should be focused--on assisting our consumers in obtaining \nemployment.''\n  Of particular interest to me and to Senator Dodd are the changes to \nSection 508 of the Act, which pertain to electronic and information \ntechnology accessibility. This section will make it easier for \nindividuals with disabilities who are federal employees to obtain the \nassistive technology they need in order to do their jobs.\n  Finally, this bill widens employment opportunities for people with \ndisabilities by establishing linkages with larger statewide workforce \nsystems. I would like to point out, however, as Senators Jeffords, \nDeWine, and Kennedy already have, that vocational rehabilitation \nagencies will not be required to spend any of their federal allotment \non activities other than those that help provide jobs for people with \ndisabilities.\n  In sum, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 bring us closer to \nthe goal of fostering independence for people with disabilities by \nproviding them with the services they need in order to enter the \nworkforce. I would like to thank Senators DeWine, Jeffords, Kennedy, \nWellstone, and Dodd, and the Clinton Administration, for their \nleadership in developing this bill in a bipartisan manner. I also would \nlike to commend all the staff members who worked on this bill. Without \ntheir tireless efforts, we would never have been able to bring this \nimportant reauthorization to the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I share the widespread support for this \nimportant legislation. This bill would consolidate and reauthorize job \ntraining and vocational education programs. This bill enables states to \ncreate a unified plan for all social services related to job training \nand vocational and adult education.\n  Job training and vocational education are vital programs which \nprepare individuals to compete in today's changing global economy. An \nestimated 346,000 high-tech jobs are going\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nunfilled nationwide. The increasing shortage of highly trained workers \nthreatens our nation's economic growth and our productivity. This \nmeasure will help address these short-comings and prepare more of \nAmerica's workers, and thus America's businesses, for the Twenty-first \ncentury.\n  We live in a capitalist society with a free market economy. Employers \nseek to hire the best qualified job candidates. S. 1186 simply provides \na means to help individuals acquire the skills necessary to compete. \nThe acquisition of these skills will best help individuals thrive as \nour economy continues to grow. Too many of our citizens have been left \nbehind the growing economy of the past years, and this measure will \nhelp them keep up with the new economy.\n  I believe that S. 1186 also supports our commitment to move \nindividuals from welfare to work. Job training prepares individuals to \ncompete in the marketplace, and remain free from government assistance. \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, I support this bill.\n  One important part of this legislation is the reauthorization of the \nprograms under the Carl D. Perkins Vocation and Applied Technology \nEducation Act. I have heard from constituents across my state that \nthese programs are a very critical component of our vocational and \ntechnical education system.\n  As we in the Congress work to help our nation prepare for the Twenty-\nfirst century, there are few challenges more fundamental to our success \nthan ensuring that our work force has the education and training \nnecessary to compete in the global economy. More and more jobs require \ntechnical skills, training that is not offered in our traditional four-\nyear colleges. Our vocational and technical schools, accordingly, are \nabsolutely essential for the students and workers of today. Technical \nskills lead to higher wages for workers and more competitive \nbusinesses. That is why the federal-state-local partnership for \nvocational and technical education, which has been very successful to \ndate, must be continued.\n  The highest priority for the moment is to get the reauthorization of \nthe Perkins Act programs through the Senate and into conference. The \nlegislative session this year is very short, and we cannot afford to \ndelay passage of this bill any further. That said, however, there are a \nnumber of provisions of this bill which need improvement.\n  Foremost among the needed changes, in my view, is that the Senate \nshould accept what the House has proposed in terms of a separate bill \nfor vocational-technical education. This difference is very crucial, \nfor it is essential to preserve the independent mission and funding \nstream for vocational education.\n  For some time, it appeared that the Senate bill was headed in the \nwrong direction, removing the separate designation for vocational and \ntechnical education and placing these programs into the mix of the \noverhaul of our job training and retraining programs. That would have \nbeen a serious mistake, and I am pleased with the improvements that the \nmanagers of this bill have agreed to offer to this legislation.\n  Among the expected changes is an assurance that funding appropriated \nfor vocational-technical education programs will be directed to school-\nbased programs and not diverted to other areas. Additionally, the \namendment is expected to ensure that governance for vocational \neducation will remain at the state and local level, and that a strong \nfocus will remain on professional development for teachers and \nadministrators.\n  The House, on the other hand, has proposed a separate legislative \nauthorization for the Perkins Act programs. Despite the forthcoming \nchanges to the Senate bill, I urge the Senate conferees to accept the \nposition of the House with respect to reauthorization.\n  Today, however, I believe that we should send this bill to the \nconference committee, where I hope that the remaining issues can be \nresolved, and I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n\n\n                  Workforce Investment Partnership Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the time has come for the Senate to take \nappropriate steps to ensure that our work force is equipped to meet the \nchallenges we will face in the next century. Today, high-skill, high-\nwage jobs are being created faster than they can be filled. This is not \nbecause of a labor shortage. Instead we are suffering from a ``skill \nshortage.'' Not enough workers in this country possess the skills \nnecessary to fill these jobs. In order to keep our economy strong and \ngrowing, our people must receive the education and training they need \nto become productive employees in the 21st century.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997 (WIPA) is the first \nstep in providing the education and training job seekers need to \ncompete for high-wage jobs. This bill would consolidate many narrowly-\nfocused federal vocational education, adult education and job training \nprograms that currently provide a disjointed approach to job training \nand job placement. Through the establishment of ``one-stop'' customer \nservice centers, job seekers will have a central point of entry to job \ntraining programs. These one-stop centers will also offer ``individual \ntraining accounts'' allowing job seekers to choose their preferred type \nof education and job training programs to better accommodate their \nindividual skills or interests. Finally, one-stop centers will provide \napplicants and employers alike with a centralized source of information \nabout training and employment opportunities available in the area.\n  WIPA's goal of streamlining our many training programs bears great \nsimilarity to legislation I introduced in January, 1997, called the \nWorking Americans Opportunity Act. Reforming and improving our nation's \njob training system has long been a Democratic priority. I am glad to \nsee strong, bipartisan support for WIPA and look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to enact this \nimportant legislation.\n  The passage of this legislation is of particular importance to the \npeople of South Dakota, where we have recently experienced large scale \nlayoffs in Huron with the closing of the Dakota Pork processing plant, \nand in Lead with cutbacks at the Homestake Gold mine. People in my home \nstate have been drastically affected by these layoffs. It is my hope \nthat these programs will enable them to receive the training they need \nto compete for the high-wage jobs of tomorrow.\n  I believe it is very important that any investment we make in \neducation and training produces positive, measurable results. That's \nwhy I am pleased this bill ensures that each training provider and \nagency administering state and local programs is held to a higher level \nof accountability than in the past. These agencies will be responsible \nfor monitoring and reporting job placement, job retention and average \nearnings for program graduates. If a program is not performing up to \nacceptable standards, it will no longer be eligible to receive public \nfunding.\n  It is of particular importance that we act quickly on this bill. \nUnless it is signed into law by June 1, the Department of Labor will \nnot be able to implement Youth Opportunity Grants. This grant program \ninvests money in poverty-stricken areas to help youth who have left \nschool to get year-round jobs. Appropriations for these grants are \ncontingent on the authorization of the Workforce Investment Partnership \nAct. This worthwhile program deserves a chance to be implemented as it \nwas intended.\n  By working in a bipartisan way to reform vocational education and job \ntraining programs, I believe that we can, during this Congress, create \nopportunities for American workers that will help to keep our economy \nstrong for the next century.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for HR 1385, \nthe Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This bill is the result of \nseveral years of hard work and bipartisan cooperation by Congress on \nbehalf of our nation's workforce and employers.\n  Our present job training system has become overly bureaucratic, \nfragmented and duplicative without adequate accountability or \nassessment measures. Currently, the federal government administers 163 \nseparate programs, scattered across 15 agencies, at a cost of more than \n$20 billion a year. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act addresses \nthese problems by consolidating and reforming the nation's federal \nvocational education, job training, and adult literacy programs.\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\n Bluntly, this bill reduces Federal bureaucracy and unnecessary \nrequirements.\n  This legislation builds upon the monumental welfare reform bill of \n1996 by giving our states and communities the appropriate tools for \nproviding individuals with the education, skills and training necessary \nto obtain meaningful, long term employment. This is something which our \ncurrent system has been unable to consistently and effectively provide \nfor our workforce. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will \nprovide individuals with an opportunity to increase their skills while \nobtaining a job. This will help millions of Americans attempting to \nmove themselves out of the welfare system. If the historic welfare \nreforms made in 1996 are to work we must have an effective system of \njob training and vocational and adult education.\n  Over and over again, I hear from employers in my home state of \nArizona who are concerned about the lack of individuals qualified to \nfill their rapidly growing high-tech and high-paying positions. And I \nknow this isn't just a problem in Arizona. This is a problem throughout \nour entire country. Nationally, the number of unfilled high-tech jobs \nis about 350,000. We cannot allow this trend to continue. If we do \nallow this trend to continue, we will be killing our ability to compete \nin the global market and remain ahead of our international competitors.\n  An important aspect of this legislation is the flexibility and \nfreedom it provides to the individual states for developing and \ndesigning their own tailored-made workforce development systems. Under \nthis bill, states and local communities, can tailor their programs to \nbest suit their unique populations and employment needs.\n  Another important aspect of this legislation is that it contains \nreauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act for seven years. The \nRehabilitation Act is the country's only Federally supported program \nwhich provides job training and placement services for people with \ndisabilities. Too many disabled individuals are falling between the \ngaps in the existing vocational systems which is why the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act links the vocational rehabilitation system \nto the new workforce systems of each state. This will result in \nproviding better jobs for more of our nation's disabled individuals.\n  The success of our nation in this increasingly globalized, \ncompetitive economy depends upon a highly skilled workforce, and a \ncomprehensive, sophisticated system of work preparation, training, and \nretraining. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is a positive step \ntoward accommodating these needs. Again, I am pleased to support this \nbill which will create a more efficient and effective job training \nsystem for our country.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997 that we are voting on \ntoday in the Senate. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will \nreform vocational education, adult education and job training programs, \nprovide more accountability within these programs, and improve delivery \nto our citizens. Education and training are two of the most important \ninvestments a government can make in its citizens. It is as important \nas ensuring the physical health of its citizens because education and \ntraining, and the robustness of a nation's industry, are primary \ndeterminants of the economic health of the country. Education and \ntraining also determine individuals' ability to reach personal goals. \nProviding people with quality education and training moves people off \nthe welfare rolls, increases upward mobility, increases incomes, and \nprovides our industry with a more skilled workforce.\n  We are in the enviable situation now of having only 4.7 percent \nunemployment in the United States. The high-tech industry tells us it \nhas as many as 190,000 unfilled jobs. There are jobs available. The \nchallenge is to match the worker's skill with industry needs. There are \ntwo challenges to providing workers with the necessary skills. The \nfirst is to make sure our children coming out of school have the basic \nskills they need for today's workforce, and then, to realize that \nlearning, education and training are lifelong pursuits and do not stop \nonce you join the workforce.\n  It is clear we need to do more in both these areas. A good education \nshould be our long term goal. But, as my esteemed colleague Mr. Kennedy \nmentioned last week, right now we have over three million young men and \nwomen between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country who did not \ncomplete high school and are not enrolled in school.\n  After interviewing a diverse group of employers and college \nprofessors, Public Agenda found profound dissatisfaction with the way \npublic schools are preparing students. More than 60% of employers and \nthree quarters of professors said they believe that a high school \ndiploma is no guarantee a student has learned the basics, and nearly 7 \nout of 10 employers said the high school graduates they see are not \nready to succeed in the workplace. These young people will need \nremedial education and training in order to join the workforce.\n  But young people are not the only ones who need help. The program in \nS. 1186 focus on the unemployed, dislocated, disadvantaged and \nseriously underemployed whose industry may be downsizing, whose \nemployer may be moving offshore, who lack a sufficient education, who \nare coming off of welfare, or who haven't kept pace with technological \nskills needed for today's rapidly changing workplace. To remain \ncompetitive in today's workforce, workers must be more flexible in \nterms of changing careers and upgrading their skills. S. 1186 \nrecognizes the importance of lifelong learning and enables people to \nreceive the education and training they need at any point in their \nlife.\n  This bill provides the ties between education and job readiness. It \ndoes this by consolidating dozens of narrowly focused programs and \nreplacing the present fragmented system with an integrated workforce \nsystem. It integrates adult education and literacy instruction with \noccupational skill training and professional development. It integrates \nvocational and academic studies. Importantly, this legislation brings \nthe business community into the process by creating industry-led policy \nmaking boards that develop strategies for a comprehensive workforce \ninvestment system in each State. Involving business is essential to \nensuring that training programs are based on local employment needs and \nconditions.\n  Another innovation of The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is \nthat it establishes ``individual training accounts'' to give job-\nseekers more choice in selecting the type of education and training \nprograms they want. The bill also encourages the creation of ``One-Stop \nCustomer Service'' centers which provide a central resource for all job \nseekers, not just those that qualify for Labor Department programs, to \nget information on training and employment opportunities available in \nthe local area.\n  In Connecticut, we have already seen the benefits of implementing \nsome of these changes. We are starting to implement the One-Stop \nCustomer Service centers. We have streamlined JTPA and TANF, the \nwelfare-to-work program. We have moved the job component of TANF from \nthe Department of Social Services to the Labor Department where the \njobs are--where it belongs.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is one piece of the solution \nto improving our nation's workforce. We still need to improve our \neducational system, attract more students into the maths and sciences, \nand make lifelong learning and skill upgrades a part of everyone's \nlife. America is beginning to move in this direction. President Clinton \nintroduced the Hope Scholarship that will encourage lifelong learning. \nSome states and industries are beginning to cooperate to create worker \ntraining programs that serve regional industry clusters; Senator \nSarbanes introduced, and I am proud to be cosponsoring, S. 2021 to \nstimulate this cooperation among companies to develop regional skills \nalliances that provide training for jobs that are waiting in the \nparticipating companies. More companies are working closely with local \ncommunity colleges and universities to match academic programs with \nworkforce needs. We need to support all these different pieces because \nthey fit together to provide our citizens with the tools they need to \nnot just keep up but to move ahead and realize their goals.\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n  I applaud the work of Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Wellstone, and their staffs in drafting the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act and I appreciate all the hard work that went \ninto it. I support this worthy legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act, offered by Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords \nand other members of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training on \nwhich I serve. I would like to take a minute here to express my reasons \nfor supporting the bill and explain why this is a good piece of \nlegislation.\n  Our mission in this area was most clearly put before us by the \nGeneral Accounting Office. In their testimony to the Senate Labor \nCommittee they showed that our current system for delivery of job \ntraining and vocational education is broken. The 163 programs across 15 \nagencies result in a disjointed and uncoordinated system that is a very \ninefficient use of the taxpayers' money. I have said that we probably \nneed an education program just to teach people how to figure out how to \nfind federal job training assistance. We need to simplify the process \nand this bill fixes many of the problems that the GAO outlined.\n  This legislation is built around the idea that we need more \nflexibility for state education and labor programs to work. It builds \non local needs and interests, ensuring a fair partnership between \nbusiness and educators. Importantly, it maintains strong program \nobjectives while at the same time, allowing individuals to make \ndecisions about their own training programs through a voucher system.\n  The goals of the vocational education program are clear--to prepare \nkids for what happens after high school. Not all kids are college-\nbound. Not all kids should be college-bound. Those who are not, should \nhave an opportunity to follow educational programs that are relevant to \ntheir interests. This bill gives States greater flexibility to design \nprograms that will target the unique needs of their students.\n  The goals of the job training programs are also clear--to prepare \npeople for their jobs in a rapidly changing workplace. Business \ncooperation and input is critical for that. Flexibility for state and \nlocal partnerships is also important so they can tailor programs to \nmeet local needs. This bill accomplishes that flexibility and increases \nlocal empowerment.\n  My home State of Wyoming has made a lot of progress in this area. Our \nGovernor, Jim Geringer, has taken a strong interest in developing a \ncoordinated system of education and employment, with an emphasis on \nindividual responsibility. Two years ago, he called for a state-wide \nconference on the issue. The focus was how to help Wyoming's people \nmeet ever-changing workplace needs and how we could help not only our \nkids, but our adults, find and keep valuable jobs without having to \nleave the State.\n  One of the biggest problems we identified in Wyoming was that the \nfederal system was fragmented, had too many narrow categories of \neligibility, duplicated effort and had confusing accountability \nrequirements. The bill before us today will resolve these problems. It \nwill improve delivery by enabling states to develop coordinated \neducation and training programs. It gives States the program \nobjectives, but allows them to design their own measurement systems. \nMost importantly, this bill lets the people in my State focus federal \ndollars where Wyomingites think they should go.\n  One part of the bill that I strongly support are changes that have \nbeen made to the Labor Market Information system. Here we have been \nable to move towards a state-based data system and ensure that state \nneeds get a priority with the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. In the past, the Bureau has paid little attention to state \nstatistics agencies. This is another issue of local control where \npeople in our states know more about what labor information is \nimportant to local needs.\n  I want to take a minute to address a few of the specific concerns \nthat have been raised about this bill. First is the difficulty raised \nby the National Governors Association about coordination with local \nworkforce boards. This does not pose a problem in my state because we \ndo not have any population centers that would qualify for separate \nlocal grants. Our State Workforce Board will serve the entire state. On \nthis issue, however, I would say that it is important for State \nGovernment to be able to coordinate these activities. I also believe \nthat local government knows best when it comes to the needs of local \ncommunities. This bill strikes a sound balance between these two \nefforts.\n\n  The second concern I have heard is that ``unified plans'' will allow \ngovernors to transfer education money into training. Again, it is my \nposition that local and state government is most responsive to and \nknowledgeable about local needs. If educators are unable to justify \ncertain spending in the face of greater needs in training areas, then \nlocal government should be able to make that decision. That works both \nways. Training advocates will have to show the importance and relative \nvalue of their programs. This bill provides a great opportunity for \nstate and local governments in Title 5, which provides an option for \nunified plans. Not surprisingly, this part has caused the most \ndifficulty for ``big government'' types at the Departments of Labor and \nEducation.\n  A third concern I have heard is that this bill will give the \nSecretary of Education increased powers over the content of state \neducation plans. I want to point out that I am very sensitive to that \nquestion. It is one of the first tests I apply in my review of any \nproposal that affects K-12 education. Local and state control must be \npreserved. With that in mind, it is important to note that the concerns \nare not unfounded.\n  This legislation directs the Department of Education to consult with \nstates in developing performance measures to evaluate state programs. \nThe measures relate to student mastery of academic and vocational \nskills, as well as placement and retention in education and later in \njob situations. States will then negotiate with the Department to \ndetermine expected levels of performance--tailored to meet State \ndifferences--but according to the index developed by the Department. \nThe question is--Is it more intrusive than current performance \nrequirements under the Carl Perkins Act?\n  Under the Perkins law, States must submit plans that include \ndescriptions of how they will meet certain federal objectives. But \nthere is one big difference. Carl Perkins empowered state boards to \ndevelop the performance measures. States only had to show they were \nmaking progress according to their own defined measurements. I am very \nconcerned about allowing the Department of Education into the \ndevelopment of these measurements. I do not believe the federal \ngovernment is genuinely capable of setting standards for mastery of \nacademic and vocational skills for our kids. That role belongs to \nelected school boards and state government--not to appointed federal \nofficials.\n  The good Senator from Missouri, Senator John Ashcroft, has expressed \nreal concerns about this part of Title 1 of the bill. While I strongly \nsupport the majority of this legislation, I would prefer to see the \nperformance provisions that were included in the House bill, end up in \nthe final version. I do intend to push for the House version in \nconference.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to say that this is a good bill. As \nwith any legislation, though, it is not perfect. There are some parts I \nwould prefer to see removed or changed. But on the whole, this bill is \na remarkable improvement over the chaotic maze of existing job \ntraining, vocational education and adult education programs. It is a \nstep forward for local and state control of these efforts. It is a step \nforward in simplifying delivery of these services and making them more \nresponsive to changing needs. And it is a step forward for personal \nchoice and for accountability.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act of 1997. As a member of the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources, I am very proud that we have produced this \nbipartisan legislation. As a United States Senator, one of my \npriorities for Maryland is to work hard to keep our economy strong. \nThis bill represents a real step\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\nforward in maintaining a robust economy for America.\n  I support this bill for three reasons. First, it represents a \ncomprehensive reform of vocational, adult education and job training \nprograms. Second, it provides for the essential element of \naccountability. Finally, it streamlines the delivery service system \ninto ``One Stop Customer Service.''\n  This legislation consolidates many of the narrowly focused programs \nwhich exist for job training and adult education. In the past, these \nprograms have really represented no system at all. The patchwork of \nrules, requirements and bureaucracy did nothing but confuse the people \nthese programs were designed to help. The Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act incorporates nearly 70 of these programs into a \nsimplified plan. Allowing states the option to submit a ``Unified \nPlan'' makes the most sense for streamlining and simplifying the \nsystem.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that accountability in training is \nessential. Programs must deliver what they promise. In exchange for \ngiving States the flexibility they need to design and achieve \nstrategies for reform, it is reasonable to retain some Federal control. \nTaxpayers deserve a dollar's worth of service for a dollar's worth of \ntaxes. The standards for measuring state performance provide that \naccountability.\n  In my state of Maryland, we currently have forty-one One-Stop career \ncenters with more on the way. These ``user-friendly'' services are \ncritical to helping people entering into employment training and \nplacement. Providing core functions in one, easy customer service \nsystem is truly the focal point of the legislation we are voting on \nhere today. One Stop centers have been proven effective both in \nMaryland and nationwide. I am very pleased to see the progress these \ncenters have made and that they are the cornerstone of the Workforce \nAct.\n  This legislation, Mr. President helps our citizens who are ready, \nwilling and able to work. By giving the States and business communities \nmore flexibility in designing their training programs, we are giving \nour citizens an opportunity for a new beginning. It gives them a new \nbeginning to become more productive members of our workforce. It gives \nthem a new beginning to get off the welfare rolls and earn the self-\nrespect they deserve by earning their own money and taking care of \nthemselves.\n  The future of our country means making sure that our workforce is \ntrained and ready to face the challenges of the 21st century. This \nmeans the federal government taking responsibility for getting our \npeople off welfare and providing real solutions for getting them \ntrained and helping them find work. By empowering our citizens with \nreal life tools for success in the workforce we can achieve real reform \nof the current system. I am proud to serve on the committee that \nstepped up to the plate and showed the American public that we are \nready to fight for our workforce.\n\n\n                   High Schools at Community Colleges\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about my \namendment to the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998 and to \nmake a few comments about the overall bill.\n  Simply put, my amendment allows consortia applying for a Tech-Prep \nthe additional option of using the money to locate high schools at \nCommunity Colleges. The Tech-Prep section already seeks to create \nconsortia of local schools, post-secondary schools, and employers to \nform a cohesive link between the entities.\n  My amendment merely goes one step further and simplifies the process \nby allowing grants to be used for the placement of high schools at \ncommunity colleges. The idea is not without precedence, in fact the \nMiddle College Consortium is a national network of twenty two high \nschools located on college campuses.\n  Mr. President, I think the fundamental question becomes what is \neducation? I believe education is far more than books, classrooms, and \nteachers, it is about learning and preparing for life. I want to \nmention several points I have heard from students and employers that \nreinforce my belief.\n  A high school student stated to me that often he and his classmates \nare simply bored in class and that creative learning concepts must be \nput forth. Amazingly, an employer stated that only one in forty \napplicants were qualified for even an entry level position. All of us, \nbusinesses and individuals are paying taxes and I think it is only fair \nthat we expect some kind of return in terms of our schools producing \nqualified graduates.\n  Is there a one size fits all solution? Of course not, because not \neveryone wants to pursue the same career path. However, my amendment \nenables those desiring to pursue a vocationally based career yet \nanother option and tool to help ensure their success.\n  I am very pleased that an integral part of a Tech-Prep Program is a \nfocus on math, science, reading, writing, communications, economics, \nand work-place skills. Also Tech-Prep Programs integrate the academic \nand vocational instruction with work-based learning.\n  My amendment ensures this by requiring a consortium to contain a \nbusiness partner. Industry will have the opportunity to take an active \nrole in ensuring graduating students possess the tools and knowledge \nthat they will need to succeed in the local workforce. The business \npartner will also act as a gateway for student and teacher internships \nand also provide students a head start in obtaining a job.\n  Mr. President, there is one point I want to make absolutely clear: \nstudent attendance at a high school at a Community College will be \nvoluntary. However, many high school students have already decided to \npursue a vocationally based career and are even now taking those kind \nof classes. My amendment is aimed at those students in an effort to \nensure they will succeed.\n  Community Colleges often have more resources, like vocational \nfacilities and business partnerships, than a traditional high school. \nStudents choosing to participate will become acquainted with the \ninstructors, facilities, and application process for admission, and a \nnatural path to at least a two year degree will be created.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is about creating yet another option so \nour children will be empowered with every available resource to \nsucceed.\n  Now I would like to make a few remarks about the Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act of 1998. First, I would like to compliment Senators \nJeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone for all of their work on this \nbill. Second, I am very pleased the Senate will shortly vote on this \nvery important piece of legislation to reform the Federal job training \nand education related programs.\n  Like many Federal programs, current job training and education \nrelated programs are a maze of overlapping and duplicative programs. \nThe bill incorporates close to 70 programs under three titles: Adult \nEducation, Vocational Education, and Job Training.\n\n  The streamlining of the current voc-ed programs into a manageable \nsystem will allow for the delivery services in the most effective \nmanner possible. By delivering services in the most effective manner we \ncan accomplish two important things: a prepared workforce and a \nbusiness community that is confident in the workforce.\n  I believe one of the keys to the bill is the transfer of power from \nWashington to the individual states. States will have the flexibility, \nauthority, and means to design a vocational educational system that \nbest meets the needs of the state because decisions will be made by \nstate officials and not Washington. By eliminating multiple Federal \nrequirements and mandatory set-asides, states obtain that flexibility.\n  States will also have the option to submit a unified plan or a single \nState plan for all of the education and training programs incorporated \nin the bill. Again, this is another example of providing states with \nthe ability to design programs that best meet their needs.\n  The Bill also greatly simplifies the process for individuals seeking \nto obtain voc-ed services through a ``no wrong door'' approach. This \n``one-stop customer service system'' will allow individuals to receive \ncomprehensive information about the availability, eligibility, and \nquality of the programs at one location or via a computer network.\n  Mr. President, I also want to say how pleased I am that Senator \nDeWine's amendment will reauthorize the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As \nmy colleagues\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\nare aware, the Rehabilitation Act is our country's primary Federally \nfunded job training program for disabled individuals. I believe the \nreauthorization takes on even greater importance since the \nauthorization for the act expired in September of 1997.\n  Among other things the reauthorization will: link the Rehabilitation \nAct and the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998; streamline \ncurrent vocational rehabilitation systems to increase efficiency and \naccess; and improve the delivery of services to individuals with \ndisabilities by providing more choice and a greater number of quality \njobs.\n  Again Mr. President, the changes I have just mentioned create more \noptions and allow for the best possible delivery of services.\n  And that is exactly what my amendment and the overall bill are all \nabout: creating more options and providing for the best possible \ndelivery of services.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield 3 minutes of our \ntime to the Senator.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Senator. I just need about 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on S. 1186, the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998. This bill will \nconsolidate vocational education, adult education and Federal \nemployment training programs. I generally support this effort. However, \nI do have some concerns regarding the treatment of current veterans' \nemployment and training programs.\n  This Nation has a long history of providing assistance to our \nveterans, dating from colonial days. Since World War I, several laws \nhave been enacted to address veterans' employment problems. Such \nlegislation has reaffirmed and strengthened the federal government's \nrole in promoting wider employment and training opportunities for \nveterans. The Federal government has a legitimate role in veterans' \nemployment issues since it is the action of the Federal government that \ngives an individual the status of ``veteran.''\n  Currently, the primary programs to assist veterans are those \nadministered by the Department of Labor, through the Veterans' \nEmployment and Training Service (VETS). These include the Disabled \nVeterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) and the Local Veterans' Employment \nRepresentative (LVER), which are grant programs to the States, and will \ncontinue in their present form.\n  The current provisions of Title 38 of the United States Code were \ndesigned to address services provided to veterans in a traditional Job \nService delivery system. However, this system is changing. We now see a \nwide variance in delivery system design, configuration, and service \ndelivery providers. Some states are contracting with private business, \ncommunity agencies, or other units of government. Other states are \nfocusing on electronic services.\n  This changing environment makes it difficult to guarantee that \ngovernment is providing maximum employment and training opportunities, \nwith priority of service for veterans.\n  To maximize these opportunities and to protect that priority, the \nVeterans Employment and Training Service is required by Federal law to \npromote and monitor participation of veterans in federally funded \nemployment and training programs.\n  Because of the national interest in veterans' programs, I supported \nlanguage in this bill that (1) authorized a veteran representative to \nthe Statewide Partnership; (2) required the State plan to assure \ncoordination with veterans programs; (3) provided assurances in the \nState plan that veterans will be afforded services under the employment \nand training subtitle ``to the maximum extent practicable''; (4) \nrequired performance reporting on workforce investment activities \nprovided for veterans; and (5) included dislocated Department of \nDefense civilians, contractor personnel, and members of the Armed \nForces as eligible participants in National emergency grants.\n  While these provisions help provide visibility of veterans programs \nat the national and state level, I am concerned that veterans \nemployment and training programs are not represented at the local \nlevel. The bill does not provide for a veterans representative on the \nlocal workforce investment partnership. This partnership has the \nresponsibility of setting policy for the local area and ensuring that \nlocal performance measures are met, that needs of employers and job \nseekers are met, and is responsible for continuous improvement of the \nsystem. Furthermore, the local partnership develops and implements the \noperating agreements for the one-stop customer service centers.\n  I can support this arrangement in principle, where local business, \nlabor and government leaders develop and oversee a plan to meet local \ncommunity needs. However, where veterans programs are included in the \none-stop center, veterans should have representation. This will ensure, \nif it becomes apparent that veterans are being underserved in any given \nlocal workforce investment area, that steps will be taken to address \nand correct the disparity.\n  I encourage those Senators who are conferees to consider carefully \nthe commitment our veterans made to the Nation, and the commitment this \nNation has made to its veterans. I urge the conference to adopt \nlanguage that will (1) ensure that maximum employment and training \nservices are made available and provided to veterans; (2) require State \nand local plans to include information to track services to veterans; \n(3) include veteran representatives on local partnerships; and (4) \nprovide that nothing in this Act shall be construed to repeal or modify \nany special rights or privileges for veterans including priority of \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I believe these modifications to the bill will \nstrengthen this measure and protect the interests of our veterans. I \nlook forward to working with the bill managers and with other \nconferees.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of \nsupport from the Business Roundtable be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Business Roundtable,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1998.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Labor & Human Resources Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Business Roundtable commends you and \n     Senators DeWine, Kennedy and Wellstone for your leadership in \n     developing S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. \n     We hope the Senate will act promptly to approve this \n     important bipartisan legislation to reform America's \n     workforce programs.\n       S. 1186 is, in most respects, in accord with the principles \n     for reform of job training programs we submitted to the Labor \n     and Human Resources Committee late last year. The bill \n     promises to transform the present fragmented approach into a \n     comprehensive workforce development system to meet the needs \n     of employers and job seekers.\n       Specifically, the bill would create a basis for program \n     consolidation through joint planning; establish business-led \n     partnerships at the state and local levels; and, most \n     importantly, strengthen accountability by using performance \n     standards to measure the effectiveness of programs in \n     achieving continuous improvement. It would commit states and \n     local areas to maximize the return on investment of federal \n     funds in workforce activities.\n       Employers have an important stake in the reengineering of \n     federal workforce programs. US competitiveness rests on the \n     skills of American workers. We look forward to working with \n     you and other members of the Committee to ensure that the \n     final compromise reached with the House of Representatives \n     continues to reflect business community principles for \n     reform.\n           Sincerely,\n     George M.C. Fisher,\n       Chairman & CEO, Eastman Kodak Co.; Chairman, Human \n     Resources Task Force, The Business Roundtable.\n     Lawrence Perlman,\n       Chairman & CEO, Ceridian Corp.; Chairman, The Working Group \n     on Workforce Development, The Business Roundtable.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we approach a new century with a \nglobally competitive economy that increasingly puts pressure on many \ndomestic industries, I believe it is critical that Congress recognize \nand address a serious\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nneed in our nation's workforce: the need to provide increased access to \ntraining for incumbent workers at small businesses.\n  As the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources are aware, many states have seen \nworkers displaced as long-standing local businesses have been downsized \nor closed. In Maine, we have endured dramatic shifts in our labor force \nas footwear manufacturers, textile manufacturers, and paper mills have \nbeen closed, and workers have been forced out of long-standing jobs \nthat had been the cornerstone of their communities. This shift in long-\nstanding industries is occurring not only in Maine, but across the \nnation as cities, towns, and communities attempt to stay one step ahead \nof the changing demands of the global job market.\n  These displacements have demonstrated time and time again that the \nonly certainty in the workforce is uncertainty--and the most important \nattribute that any worker can have when a job is in jeopardy is to have \na broad base of training and skills. For only with a wide array of \nskills can any worker be truly confident that they have the knowledge \nand abilities necessary to rapidly adapt to today's changing work \nenvironment on-the-job--and the changing business environment that is \ndriven by global competition. Therefore, I believe it is critical that \nwe increase access to training for American workers and bring them some \npeace of mind that they will be ready for the changing skills demand--\nand the changing job market--that tomorrow will bring.\n  In light of this need for increased training and skill development, I \nam particularly concerned about the plight of individuals who work at \nsmall businesses because--among all workers--these individuals are the \nleast likely to receive training. I have had the opportunity to view \nthis problem firsthand, and discuss it with individuals who have \nstudied the problem extensively, as co-chair of the bipartisan Senate \nManufacturing Task Force and as a member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee.\n  Over and over again I have heard of the inability of workers at small \nbusinesses to have access to training--and the reason for this lack of \naccess is clear: many small businesses simply do not have the financial \nresources necessary to provide training to their workers.\n  Therefore, in response to the gaping training needs of workers at \nsmall businesses, I have offered legislation that is designed to \ndirectly address the inability of small businesses to afford training. \nSpecifically, my legislation--S. 1170, the Working American Training \nVoucher Act--would provide $1,000 training vouchers to one million \nworking men and women at small businesses across the United States.\n  The legislation was crafted from the premise that we should not wait \nuntil a worker has been laid-off from their job, or a company shuts its \ndoors and shutters its windows, to take steps to help the American \nworker receive adequate training. Rather, we should take steps to \nensure that our nation's workforce is confident of their future and \nfeels prepared to address the rapid changes that are occurring both in \nthe global economy and on-the-job--especially as new technologies are \nintroduced in the workplace that require an ever-expanding base of \nskills.\n  Increasing access to training for incumbent workers at small business \nwill not only address this need, but I think we would all agree that \nthe best way to reduce the impact and cost of unemployment is to take \nsteps to keep those who are already employed on-the-job.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine has properly \nrecognized a serious need in the American workforce, and one that I \nhope will be strongly addressed by the Congress. Incumbent workers \nnationwide--and particularly those at small businesses--must be \nprovided with increased access to training, and I commend her for \nraising this issue at this time, and for offering legislation that is \nintended to address this tangible need.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in recognizing the \nneed for increased access to training for incumbent workers, and \nappreciate the efforts of my colleague, Senator Snowe, for heightening \nawareness on this issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Kennedy. Mr. \nPresident, while my legislation has not yet been acted on, I believe \nthe legislation now before the Senate--S. 1186, the Workforce \nInvestment Partnership Act (WIPA) provides us with an excellent \nopportunity to address the training needs of incumbent workers at small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, as has been outlined on the floor of the Senate today, \nthe WIPA restructures and streamlines federal job training programs to \nimprove the delivery of these services to millions of Americans in \nneed, including disadvantaged adults and dislocated workers. For \ncrafting a bill that improves the delivery of job training services \nnationwide, I would like to commend the authors of this legislation: \nthe Chairman of the Labor and Employment Subcommittee, Senator DeWine; \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords; \nthe Ranking Member of the Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy; and the \nRanking Member of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, Senator \nWellstone.\n  While I am very supportive of this legislation, I urge that \nprovisions be added and modifications made during the upcoming House-\nSenate conference on the bill to improve access to training for \nincumbent workers at small businesses. Specifically, I urge that the \nSenate conferees look for opportunities to improve such access during \nthe consideration of the newly-created training vouchers in Section \n315; the transfer authority of job training monies by local \npartnerships in Section 306; the demonstration and pilot projects in \nSection 367; and any other section in which increased flexibility of \njob training monies would lead to improved access to training for \nincumbent workers at small businesses.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, because of my shared interest in \nproviding increased access to training for incumbent workers, I look \nforward to working with my colleague, Senator Snowe, to address the \ntraining needs of incumbent workers, particularly those in industries \nthat are vulnerable to the ups-and-downs of our economy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support efforts to improve \ntraining opportunities for incumbent workers, but would emphasize that \nit must not be done at the expense of individuals who have already been \ndisplaced from their jobs. Therefore, I look forward to working with \nthe Senator from Maine on this issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Kennedy, for your \ninterest in this important issue. I look forward to working with you as \nS. 1186 moves through the legislative process, as well as on S. 1170, \nthe Working American Training Voucher Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1385, the \nWorkforce Investment Partnership Act. I really believe this bill would \nprovide the infrastructure necessary to reform our Federal job training \nsystem. Currently, Federal job training programs are a hodgepodge of \nrules, regulations and requirements, which reflect duplicative agency \nresponsibilities. This unfortunate situation deters employees with good \nintentions from seeking assistance for those in need. For the past 8 \nmonths, my colleagues in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee \nhave been working diligently to reform this ineffective system.\n  H.R. 1385 is an ideal bill, a bipartisan bill that will consolidate \ndozens of programs within the Federal system of vocational and adult \neducation, vocational rehabilitation, and job training programs.\n  It will give states and local governments the flexibility to design \ntraining programs that best meet the needs of their communities. It \nencourages ``One-Stop Customer Service'' centers where applicants and \nemployers may go to inquire about different training and employment \nopportunities that are available.\n  In the State of Hawaii, efforts are already underway to streamline \nvarious workforce-related organizations and\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\nprograms into a comprehensive system that encompasses economic \ndevelopment, workforce, and education priorities. The Hawaii State \nLegislature recently consolidated five Hawaii Department of Labor and \nIndustrial Relations advisory policy bodies into a single agency, the \nHawaii Workforce Development Council.\n  This council is similar to entities in 30 other states.\n  Many of our states have begun the process of consolidation, and it is \ntime that the Federal government provide them with the direction and \nthe resources necessary to complete this process.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator DeWine, Jeffords, Kennedy, and \nWellstone for their efforts in bringing forward this bipartisan \ncompromise for Senate consideration. H.R. 1385 will target Federal \nfunds to those individuals who need it most and to those programs that \nare proven to be effective. I believe this bill will provide the \ninfrastructure necessary to reform our Federal job training system.\n  The time is now to reform this system, and I am pleased to express my \nsupport for this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield 15 seconds to \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I mentioned to staff and other Senators \nbut I didn't share the comments on the floor, and I didn't mention the \nreally fine work of Mark Powden and Dwayne Sattler. I appreciate their \nwork. I mentioned some people who I had a chance to work with. I forgot \nto mention others. I was feeling guilty.\n  I thank the Senator for the 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, as was stated by the Senators from Ohio, Vermont, and \nMinnesota, in just a few moments we are going to vote on this \nlegislation, which will make such a very, very important difference for \nmillions of Americans.\n  I want to express my very deep sense of appreciation for the really \nexcellent work that has been done by the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator DeWine, and our friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, and \nthe chairman of the full committee, Senator Jeffords.\n  These are complex issues and involve a variety of different interests \nand various constituency groups. But we all have a common purpose and a \ncommon goal; that is, to try to make sure that America has the best \ntrained workforce we could possibly have as we move into the 21st \ncentury.\n  The process has not been easy. It has been an issue which our \ncommittee has over a very considerable period of time wrestled with. In \n1970s, we attempted improving the CETA job training program. There were \nmany, many problems in that program. In the early 1980s, we moved in a \ndifferent direction. That direction was the Job Training Partnership \nAct, which attempted to refashion and shape our job programs with \ngreater emphasis on private sector employment. It was the only domestic \nprogram that passed between 1980 and 1984. In many respects, it has \nworked well. But, the enormous technological changes we have seen in \nthe workplace require new training initiatives. Since the early 1990s, \nwe have been working to develop the most effective approach.\n  Now I am very, very hopeful that those hours and days of hearings, \nand the very solid work that has been done by the Committee will result \nin passage of this landmark legislation. I hope it will now not only \nreceive the overwhelming support of the Members of this body, but also \nthat we can move ahead into the conference and reach an agreement \nworthy of all our support. 1998 should be the year that workforce \nlegislation is enacted into law. It would mean so much for millions of \nAmericans in need of educational and career training opportunities.\n  We have had a fairly contentious Congress so far. But this, I think, \nhas been an extraordinary example of the legislative process working. I \nthink it is a real tribute overall to our chairman, Senator Jeffords, \nwith his leadership.\n  We are designing legislation for a workforce that will have probably \nseven or eight different jobs during their careers. Thirty years ago, \nif a person worked in the Fall River Shipyard in Massachusetts, his \nfather worked there and his grandfather worked there before him, and he \nspent his entire career there. But now we know that for new entries \ninto that workforce, they are going to have seven different jobs.\n  With the global economy, we are going to find there are going to be \nnew industries that are highly successful. There will be other \nindustries that will be facing consolidation. We will have downsizing. \nWe will have expansion. New skills that will be necessary. Individual \nworkers will need access to training to update their skills throughout \ntheir working lives.\n  This legislation will provide the opportunity to get that training. \nIt is really a very, very important new concept and new idea, and one \nthat I think can really ensure that our workforce is going to be the \nbest in the world.\n  We are talking about included in this legislation programs for \nindividuals who are dislocated workers and others who are disadvantaged \nadults and youth. We are talking about individuals with disabilities \nwho want to be able to work and pull their fair share. We are talking \nabout at-risk youth. We are also dealing with adult literacy, and \nvocational education programs. Together, these programs will prepare \nthe workforce of tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, this is really, I think, a major achievement. I am \nenormously grateful to my staff: to Jeffrey Teitz, who has done an \noutstanding job on the workforce and education issues; and to Connie \nGardner, who has done an extraordinary job on vocational \nrehabilitation. Jeffrey Teitz, along with Sherry Kaiman of Senator \nJeffords' staff, Dwayne Sattler of Senator DeWine's staff, and Brian \nAhlberg of Senator Wellstone's staff, worked for over a year to fashion \nthe consensus legislation which we are considering today. I am proud of \ntheir work. I also want to recognize Patricia Morrissey of Senator \nJeffords' staff on vocational rehabilitation.\n  All of us who are in support of this legislation believe it will make \nAmerica have the best educated and the best trained workforce in the \nworld; and that those families who participate in these programs will \nhave the great opportunities open to them. It will enable them to \nrealize their own American dreams. I hope my colleagues will support it \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. President, while employment training legislation has not received \nthe same level of public attention as some other issues on this year's \nagenda, very few bills will have a greater impact on more Americans \nthan the Workforce Investment Partnership Act.\n  The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been \ngreater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is \nsteadily widening. For those who enter the workforce with good academic \ntraining and well-developed career skills, this new economy offers \nalmost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic \nproficiency in language, math and science and who have no career \nskills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment.\n  An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the \nmodern economy. Our nation's long term economic vitality depends on the \ncreation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job \ntraining and career development which is open to all our citizens. \nSchools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults \nand out of school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills \nwhich will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated \nworkers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological \nchange deserve the chance to pursue new careers. Individuals with \ndisabilities need the opportunity to fully develop their career \npotential. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will \ndetermine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act, unanimously approved by the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee will provide employment training \nopportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge \nof\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nthe changing workplace by enabling men and women to acquire the skills \nrequired to enter the workforce and to upgrade their skills throughout \ntheir careers. It will provide them with access to the educational \ntools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get ahead.\n  The legislation is the product of a true bipartisan collaboration. I \nwant to publicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine \nspirit of bipartisanship which has made this effort possible. Senator \nWellstone and I appreciate it. The resulting legislation will, I \nbelieve, truly expand career options, encourage greater program \ninnovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, \neducation and state and local government.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy \naccess to state of the art employment training programs which are \ngeared to real job opportunities in the community through a single, \ncustomer-friendly system of One Stop Career Centers. The cornerstones \nof this new system are individual choice and quality labor market \ninformation.\n  No training system can function effectively without accurate and \ntimely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market \ninformation is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. \nThis legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and \ntimely information about what area industries are growing, what skills \nthose jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive \nbusiness community and organized labor participation are encouraged in \ndeveloping a regional plan based on this information. Once a career \nchoice is made, the individual must still select a training provider. \nAt present, many applicants make that choice with a little or no \nreliable information. Under this bill, each training provider will have \nto publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, \nand average earnings of graduates.\n  Because of the extensive information which will be available to each \napplicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a \ntraining provider will be possible. The legislation establishes \nindividual training accounts for financially eligible participants, \nwhich they can use to access career education and skill training \nprograms. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be \nlimited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job \nopportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets \nestablished performance standards, the individual will be free to \nchoose which option best suits his or her needs.\n  There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more \nimportant than providing at-risk, often out-of-school, youth with \nmeaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our \nteenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in \nthe 21st century economy. I am particularly pleased with the commitment \nwhich the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men \nand women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on \nteenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few \nconstructive employment opportunities. Each year, the Secretary of \nLabor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs \ndesigned to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The \nprograms will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and \nworksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage \nbroad based community participation from local service agencies and \narea employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the \ntechniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest \nrisk.\n  This legislation also provides for the continuation of JobCorps and \nthe Summer Jobs Program as essential elements of a comprehensive effort \nto help disadvantaged youth gain valuable training and work experience.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles \nreauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. \nBoth programs will continue to be separately funded and independently \nadministered. We have incorporated them in the Workforce Act because \nthey must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to \nprepare people to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace.\n  Students who participate in vocational education must be provided \nwith both strong academic preparation and advanced employment skills \ntraining. Recognizing this core principle, the legislation supports \nbroad-based career preparation education which meets both high academic \nstandards and teaches state-of-the-art technological skills.\n  Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27% of the adult \npopulation who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. \nLearning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to \ncareer advancement. A leading authority on this issue, Professor \nRichard Wade of the City University Graduate Center in New York, has \ncalled adult literacy ``America's Silent Scandal'', and he's right. \nThis legislation will increase access to educational opportunities for \nthose people most in need of assistance and enhance the quality of \nservices provided.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for \nmillions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global \neconomy. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the remainder of the time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nbill. It is a tremendous step forward in helping this Nation meet \ninternational competition. I praise the staff on both sides for making \nit possible for us to come here in this great love fest that we have \nhad in the Chamber. Having voted it out of the committee unanimously, I \nhope that this body would see fit to do the same.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

TRADITIONALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--With respect to the programs authorized in \n     titles II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) Racial profile.--The racial profile of America is \n     rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white \n     Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and \n     ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, \n     14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for \n     Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, \n     the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three \n     of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-\n     American.\n       ``(2) Rate of disability.--Ethnic and racial minorities \n     tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately \n     high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American \n     Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general \n     population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times \n     more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to \n     be significantly disabled.\n       ``(3) Inequitable treatment.--Patterns of inequitable \n     treatment of minorities have been documented in all major \n     junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As \n     compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-\n     American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system \n     is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a \n     larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without \n     being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training \n     than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is \n     spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.\n       ``(4) Recruitment.--Recruitment efforts within vocational \n     rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, \n     continuing education, and in-service training must focus on \n     bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in \n     order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role \n     models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly \n     changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.\n       ``(b) Outreach to Minorities.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For each fiscal year, the Commissioner \n     and the Director of the National Institute on Disability and \n     Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as \n     the `Director') shall reserve 1 percent of the funds \n     appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized \n     under titles II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this \n     subsection.

BYRD CASTS 15,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I both want to join in \nonce again commending and recognizing the tremendous record that \nSenator Byrd of West Virginia has made to the U.S. Senate. Senator Byrd \njust cast his 15,000th vote--15,000th vote.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  He continues to hold the Senate record of total number of votes cast. \nTherefore, out of the 1,843 Senators past and present, he is No. 1 in \ntotal number of votes cast. He broke the record when he cast his \n12,134th vote on April 27, 1990. As an aside, Senator Thurmond is No. 2 \non the all-time list at 14,863 votes.\n  These Senators set a torrid pace that the rest of us probably would \nnot even want to try to replicate.\n  Thank you, Senator Byrd, for the example and the tremendous record \nyou have set.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of colleagues, both Republican \nand Democrat, I, too, rise to congratulate our distinguished colleague \non this remarkable achievement.\n  Just to remind Senators, Senator Byrd began building this unsurpassed \nrecord more than 39 years ago. On January 8, 1959, Senator Byrd cast \nhis first vote in the U.S. Senate. Fittingly, it was a vote on Senate \nprocedure. On April 27, 1990, Senator Byrd cast his 12,134 vote, \nearning him the record for greatest number of rollcall votes in Senate \nhistory. On July 27, 1995, he became the first Senator in history to \ncast 14,000 votes, and now he has built on his record number of \nrollcall votes to be the first person in Senate history to cast 15,000 \nvotes.\n  To place this record in some historical context, Senator Byrd cast \nthe first of his 15,000 votes with Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon \nJohnson here in the chamber with him. When he cast his first vote, \nHawaii had not yet become a State, and the United States had not yet \nput a man in space.\n  Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this record is Senator Byrd's \nlifetime attendance record. Over 39 plus years, Senator Byrd has stood \nin this well or voted from his chair on 98.7 percent of the votes cast.\n  Every one of my colleagues knows the day-to-day pressures of Senate \nlife. We all attend countless hearings and meetings with constituents. \nWe travel thousands of miles to our States and within our States and \nsometimes attend overseas fact-finding missions like the one just \nreturned from Bosnia. Sometimes these commitments do not match the \nuncertain schedule of the Senate.\n  But for more than 39 years, Senator Byrd has managed to run the \nSenate as Majority Leader. He has chaired the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. He has studied and written volumes on the history of the \nSenate.\n  He has earned his place as the unrivaled expert on Senate rules. And \nhe has become perhaps the most popular political figure in West \nVirginia history, all while making nearly 99 out of 100 rollcall votes \non the Senate floor.\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\n Not just votes on important treaties or landmark legislation, but \ncountless Monday and Friday votes and late night rollcalls on routine \nprocedural motions.\n  Mr. President, future historians will write about Senator Byrd's \nremarkable impact on this chamber as an orator, a parliamentary expert, \na Senate historian, a legislative tactician, and a remarkable leader.\n  He has achieved a number of records in both West Virginia and Senate \nhistory. He has held more legislative offices than anyone else in the \nhistory of his State. He is the longest-serving Senator in the history \nof his State. And he has held more leadership positions in the U.S. \nSenate than any other Senator in history.\n  For all his grand achievements, Senator Byrd has performed the most \nbasic requirement of a Senator more times than any other Senator in \nhistory. But we recognize and respect the senior Senator from West \nVirginia for the quality as well as the quantity of his service in the \nSenate.\n  During his 15,000 Senate votes, Senator Byrd has been here observing \nhistory, participating in history, and now occupies an important new \nplace in the history of this institution.\n  Again, I commend him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I trust that my colleagues will indulge me \njust for a few minutes. I thank the majority leader and the minority \nleader. I am grateful to the two leaders, Mr. President, for their \ngenerous expressions of praise and affection. I thank all of my \ncolleagues for the many courtesies that they have extended to me over \nthese, now going on, 40 years in this body.\n  Majorian, who became Emperor of the West in 457 A.D., referred to \nhimself as ``a prince who still glories in the name of `Senator.''' \nThat is the way I feel about it. I am grateful to the good people of \nWest Virginia for trusting me with this honor for nearly 40 years now. \nI carry this title with great pride.\n  Sometimes my constituents say to me, ``Do you ever get used to it?'' \nas they look about this marvelous building, and the truth of the matter \nis that I haven't gotten used to it. Each time I walk through these \ndoors, I feel a sense of great pride in being a Member of the United \nStates Senate, and a sense of satisfaction in knowing that I have tried \nto do my best, and that the people of West Virginia have recognized \nthat, and that they have continually shown their faith and confidence \nin me.\n  There have only been 1,843 men and women who have graced these desks, \nand those in the old Senate Chamber down the hall, those on the floor \nbelow, those in Philadelphia, and those in New York City where the \nfirst Senate met in 1789--1,843 Senators.\n  These 15,000 votes that we have just heard about, if we allow 15 \nminutes per vote, and if we allow the average number of 148 days per \nsession, as has been the case over the past 10 years, and allowing for \n8-hour days, it would require constant consecutive votes expanding over \n3 years and 24 days to cast these 15,000 votes, back to back, doing \nnothing other than voting. Three years and 24 days. I am thankful for \nthe opportunity to have cast these votes.\n  But it isn't the number of votes that really counts so much; it is \nthe substance of each vote and the quality of judgment that is brought \nto bear in reaching a decision thereon. There have been a few votes \nthat I regret having cast. But, in regard to the overwhelming majority \nof votes, I would not change them if I had the opportunity to do so.\n  And so I trust that I can help other Senators from day-to-day to feel \ngreat pride in their having been selected by the people of their States \nto serve in this great body. It is the highest legislative office in \nthe land. I do not consider a Senator as someone who serves under any \nPresident. Senators serve with Presidents. The Presidency is the \nhighest office in the executive branch. I respect the Presidency \nalways, whether the holder of the office is a Democrat or Republican. \nBut a United States Senator has no superior in any other office of \nGovernment. That is the way we should feel about it. After all, this \nSenate is the pillar upon which the Constitution really rests, because \nit was on July 16, 1787, when the Great Compromise occurred, and out of \nthat compromise came the United States Senate--the forum of the States. \nIt is the only forum in the Nation in which the States themselves are \nrecognized on the basis of equality. And each Senator is fortunate that \nhis or her constituents have chosen him or her to represent them in \nthis great forum of the States.\n  The other night I was proud to look around and see all Senators \nsitting in their seats as they arose to answer the rollcall. After that \nrollcall was announced, several Senators came to me and expressed the \nfact that they had been greatly impressed by the dignity and the \nperformance of the Senate as it voted on that occasion, which was a \ngreat occasion, an outstanding one. But I suppose that what touched me \nmost was afterward, when I started to leave the Chamber, a number of \nthese pages came up to me and one said, ``Gee, that was cool''; another \nsaid, ``that was great.'' Still another said, ``I couldn't keep the \ntears from rolling down my cheek as I watched the Senators cast their \nvotes.'' The pages were genuinely touched by the dignity and \nperformance of the Senate on that day.\n  The people of the United States watch this Senate every day. They see \nus if we are milling around in the well. Legislators in State \nlegislatures are accustomed to voting from their seats. Many of you \nhave been members of the State legislatures. So have I. Those members \nremain in their seats and they vote there.\n\n  We may sometimes forget that the world is watching us. But the people \nin whom sovereignty resides are watching. They see us.\n  As the premier legislative body of the Nation, it seems to me that we \nshould all take great pride in this institution and realize that we are \nthe people who, perhaps more than any others in Government, set the \nstandards. Who else sets the standards? Where have all our heroes gone? \nBabe Ruth used to be my hero. Lou Gehrig was my hero. In 1927, Babe \nRuth broke his previous record with 60 home runs. But where do our \nyoung people go now to find their heroes? Back in my days the baseball \nplayers didn't spit in the face of the umpire, or choke the coach. We \nlooked up to those athletes. We had our heroes. Perhaps we Senators can \nfill the place of heroes for our young people so they can have someone \nto whom they can look and emulate.\n  I am proud of all of my colleagues. I have often remarked about the \nhigh intelligence of the Members of the Senate. I hope we will be \nreinspired to serve with high purpose knowing that we have no \nparticular right to this office except the fact that the people of our \nStates trust us for a limited time with it. And, in that limited time, \nit is my desire that we do our best, and that we set a high standard of \nperformance so that the American people will regain their confidence in \ngovernment.\n  If I might be pardoned for taking a few more minutes, Pyrrhus was a \ngreat Greek general. Hannibal said that he was one of the three \ngreatest generals of all time--Pyrrhus. He defeated the Romans at the \nBattle of Heraclea in 280 B.C., and he paid a great price, from which \nwe get the term ``a Pyrrhic victory.'' He knew he was going to have to \nfight the Romans again because they weren't conquered, by any means. So \nPyrrhus sent Cineas, the philosopher, to the Roman Senate. And Cineas \nwent with jewelry, and exquisite robes and other gifts, hoping to \ncorrupt the Roman Senate, and, persuade the Romans to become an ally of \nhis.\n  After Cineas had observed the Roman Senate, he reported to Pyrrhus \nthat the Roman Senate was no mere gathering of venal politicians, no \nhaphazard council of mediocre men, but in dignity and statesmanship, \nveritably it was an assemblage of kings.\n  About 175 years later, Jugurtha, a Numidian prince, came to Rome and \nconnived in the assassination of a Roman leader. He was ordered to \nleave Rome. He walked through the gates of Rome and upon several \noccasions paused to look back. Suddenly, he exclaimed, ``Yonder is a \ncity that is up for sale, and its days are numbered if it finds a \nbuyer.'' The Roman Senate had deteriorated to that extent in one and \nthree quarters centuries.\n  I don't believe this Senate's days are numbered. But it is going to \ndepend upon the Members of the body--not the number of votes that they \nwill cast but the quality of the Senators, their high purpose, their \ndedication.\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\n  I salute my colleagues and thank them for all of their kindnesses to \nme.\n  Now I am off to my second 15,000.\n  As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, ``The rule of joy and the law of duty \nseem to me all one.''\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while Senator Byrd is here, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to make just a few remarks, daring to \nventure into the lion's den because of the eloquence that Senator Byrd \nbrings to his thought and to his speech.\n  I have been a long-time admirer of Senator Byrd. I have been here 16 \nyears. As I looked around the room, I noted that there were only six \nothers who had been here as long as I have, which gives me a relative \nsenior status, although the Chamber wasn't filled, and I regret that it \nwasn't because I know that everybody responds the same way as I do when \nSenator Byrd speaks. You always learn something of quite an incredible \nnature, and we are always in awe of his intellect and his memory.\n  I will never forget my earliest days here when I went in to visit \nSenator Byrd because I was anxious to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee. And Senator Byrd gave me a treatise on English kings, \nreaching back, I think, somewhere before William the Conqueror. I am \nnot going to try to duplicate anything that Senator Byrd said by way of \nrecall, but I remember that that was in the 1000s, I guess. And I \nlistened while Senator Byrd talked about Ethelberht and all of those, \nand how each one succeeded the other and how each one died and how long \neach one served. I walked out shaking my head, and I said, ``What is \nthere about this man that enables him to remember so much for such a \nlong period of time?''\n  Senator Byrd cast his 15,000th vote this day, and he is our Babe \nRuth, there is no doubt about that, having accomplished things that \nnone other before him ever accomplished. But it is not just the votes. \nAs the Senator said, it is the quality; it is the kind of votes that we \nare casting.\n  I asked Senator Byrd before he stood up to make his remarks did he \nhave any regrets. And he repeated publicly what he said to me \nprivately--there were a few. But I think he probably remembers darned \nnear every vote that he has cast. He certainly remembers those that \nwere of major magnitude.\n  There are a few of us in this room, Senator Byrd, who are not going \nto cast 15,000 votes. I would like to do it, but I may have to do it \nfrom some place on high. Not only do we treasure Senator Byrd's \npresence here, but for me one of the great honors of having served in \nthis body, and I consider it a tremendous honor; I come from immigrant \nparents. They came early in the century as little children, but their \naspirations were limited, never suspecting, though always believing \nthat it could happen to their son, that I would have the distinction of \nserving in this body.\n  Senator Byrd reminds us that only 1,840-some have ever served here \nsince the founding of this country. And when I opened my desk top, I \nsaw that one of the names in there was Truman, Missouri, and wherever I \nmoved, Senator Byrd, I have always taken that desk with me. So there is \nso much honor and so much grace that falls our way, but one of the \ngreat honors for me has been to serve with you, Senator Byrd, master of \nall about the Senate. I don't think anyone ever loved the body with the \nsame depth of interest, not just affection, as Senator Byrd has shown \nus in his years here. It is always an uplifting experience to listen to \nSenator Byrd talk about the Senate and to bring us to our dignity by \nasking us once in a while to sit down and cast our vote from our seats. \nIt is for me, relatively seasoned, a refresher about the dignity of \nthis body and the removal from the squabble and the hostility that \nsometimes has occasion to rise here. It doesn't make it any less of a \ndistinction or a privilege to serve here, but every now and then, \nSenator Byrd, I thank you for bringing us back to our senses about \nwhere we are in this great Nation of ours and how fortunate we are to \nhave known one another.\n\n  But you, Senator Byrd, have, I think--I come out of the computer \nbusiness--probably been a model for those who wanted to construct a \ncomputer that would have vast memory, quick response, and developed \nintelligence, not artificial at all but real, and I salute you on this \n15,000th vote to say that I know, for as long as I serve in this body, \nyou will continue to inspire and encourage all of us, and I thank you \nfor the contribution you have made to the country and to me as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey for his overly gracious and more than charitable remarks. I am \ngrateful for them. I hope that he will never have cause to have a \nsecond thought about what he has just said. I hope that I can justify \nhis faith and his confidence and his high estimation of me and my work \nhere. May I say that I won't ever forget his kind words. I am grateful \nfor them. I am glad to be in the Senate with Senator Lautenberg. He has \nbeen my friend, he is my friend, and he will always be my friend.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I say thank you again, Senator Byrd, for \nyour vote and for your comments. They are always very enlightening.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4349-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4351-S4353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been working \nthroughout the day to get an agreement that will allow us to come to a \nfair and reasonable conclusion to the IRS restructuring and reform \nbill. We have been able to work out, I think, a fair agreement, and I \nwould like to propound that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that with respect to H.R. 2676 all amendments \nbe relevant to the bill except amendments to title VI must be both \nrelevant and cleared by both the managers and leaders, one amendment \noffered by the chairman that pays for the cost of the legislation, with \nno second-degree amendments in order, one amendment offered by Senator \nKerrey that also pays for the legislation, with no second-degree \namendments, and it not be in order prior to the conclusion of debate on \nthe chairman's ``pay for'' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not object, but I rise to make a \npoint that I would hope it would be appropriate at this time to reserve \nthe right, but I do not intend to object.\n  I understand that oftentimes my colleagues work long and hard to \ncraft legislation that they believe is in the best interests of their \nconstituents and the people of this country, and that we do not always \nhave the freedom and luxury for whatever the reason to offer such \nlegislation. Indeed, I have been working with a number of my \ncolleagues, Senator Feinstein and others, on a piece of legislation \nthat I think is absolutely essential and should not be delayed; that \nevery day it is delayed causes anguish for women throughout this \ncountry, for families without this country when they are denied basic \ntreatment in terms of their medical needs. And I am talking about those \nwho face cancer, breast cancer in particular, who are forced to leave a \nhospital because their insurance policy limits the length of stay and/\nor they are denied basic treatment, reconstructive surgery. And, \nindeed, just within the past 6 weeks we have had two cases that have \ncome to my attention personally in my State, but it is happening \nthroughout this country, where medical plans deny them these basic \nrights, the right to reconstructive surgery after a radical mastectomy.\n  I have taken the time and impinged upon and imposed upon the time of \nthe two leaders here because I feel strongly\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\nabout this, because this is taking place. I believe it is an \nunwarranted and unintended consequence that brought this upon us, by \npassage of the ERISA law, which keeps States from putting on these \nreasonable conditions. It says, basically, a woman should be entitled \nto this kind of coverage. Unfortunately, there are some who say we \nshould not have mandates. It is unfortunate that we might have to, and \ndo have to, mandate in this case because there are millions and \nmillions of American women who do not have this basic protection and \nright.\n  I am fully intending to, and I said to my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee that I would, offer this legislative proposal that would see \nto it that this grievous situation is rectified. I intended to do it \nhere on the IRS reform bill, because this is a bill that will pass. \nThis is a bill that is necessary. This is a bill that my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, have worked on long and hard. And it will be \nsigned into law.\n  I also know that if we ever get an opportunity to bring the Women's \nHealth and Cancer Rights Act to this floor it will pass overwhelmingly.\n  For a number of reasons we have not been able to do that. The two \nleaders have indicated to me, and have asked me to withhold, because \nthere are other laudable, and I am sure very worthy, amendments that my \ncolleagues have agreed not to put forth. They have assured me they will \nseek to give us an opportunity--Senator Feinstein and myself and the \nother 20 cosponsors--to bring up this amendment. It is not a costly \namendment but will save lives. It will save families. It will ensure \nthat women get the proper kind of care they can and should be getting. \nIt is unfortunate that we need this kind of legislation. They will \nattempt to give us an opportunity of some 2 hours this Tuesday to bring \nforth this legislation.\n  On that basis, I will not object. But I have to tell my colleagues, \nit is a year and a half now. There is a lot of pain. A lot of people \nhave been denied that which they should have had. A lot of people have \nbeen forced to go to appeals, to appeal through the boards that \nadminister many of these programs, their self-insured programs, to get \nthis basic right. I don't think that we want to, nor should we, \ncontinue this nor countenance this any longer.\n  On the assurance that we are going to attempt and really make a good-\nfaith effort to bring this to the floor Tuesday, I will withdraw any \nobjection and go along. I thank my colleagues for recognizing the \nplight of families in America in attempting to work with us in a way \nthat collectively we can solve that problem.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Having reached this agreement, there will be no further \nvotes this evening.\n  After Senator Daschle makes his comments, I do want to respond and \ncomment on the fact that, frankly, Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave had to hold back and be cooperative. This was not easy to reach. \nBut this is a very important piece of legislation that has been crafted \nin a bipartisan way. If we didn't get this agreement, we could have \nbeen working on it for days and weeks and it would have wound up \npushing everything down the line, many bills that we do want to  do and \ncan do.\n\n  So I appreciate the cooperation and I appreciate that Senator Daschle \nhas had to work very hard. I could start naming Senators on this side \nand he can start naming Senators on that side who had good and valid \namendments. But I think we did the right thing. After the Senator \ncomments, I would like to respond further to Senator D'Amato's \ngenerosity and very responsible action and talk about what we are going \nto try to do to be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has spoken well about \nthe difficulty of this agreement. This was, I told him, one of the more \ndifficult, if not the most difficult we have had in some time. I could \nname 30 Senators on this side of the aisle who have very important \namendments, who are very concerned about the lack of an opportunity to \noffer these amendments on this bill or on other bills. So I, first, \nthank them for their cooperation and for their support in allowing us \nto move forward, as we are tonight. I believe there must come a time \nwhen this pent-up demand to offer some of this legislation has to be \naddressed. I will be speaking with the majority leader about that as we \ngo through the schedule for the next couple of weeks.\n  I might say, a major factor--and I have indicated this to the \nmajority leader--in our ability to reach this agreement was his \nassurance that we were also going to take up, in a timely way, some \nother very critical pieces of legislation this agreement allows us to \ntake up. First and foremost is a crop insurance and research bill that \nI have assured my colleagues will be taken up, if at all possible, this \nweek. We don't know how long the amendment process will take. But the \nmajority leader has assured me it is the next bill. So I thank him for \nthat and, as I have indicated to him privately and I will say again \npublicly, that was a major consideration. Another was our strong desire \nto get on with the consideration of the tobacco bill. The majority \nleader has assured me that we will do that as well.\n  So we have an array of matters that must be addressed. It was in \nkeeping with our understanding of the workload this month that a lot of \nour Democratic colleagues were willing to concede the recognition of \nthe importance of this particular agreement.\n  Let me address what I hope is not a misunderstanding. I don't know of \nany particular agreement with regard to the bill referred to by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, except to say that I am very \nsympathetic with what he is attempting to do. Many of our colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle will wish to be heard on that bill and will wish \nto offer amendments. So I will work with the majority leader to \nschedule some time for us to consider this bill, and we will do our \nbest to accommodate all Senators as they are called upon to debate and \noffer their amendments. But we will negotiate in good faith and attempt \nto come up with the best agreement we can.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. Just to inform both the Democratic leader and the \nmajority leader, it would be Senator Roth's intention and my intention \nat 9:30 to take up both of the funding amendments and to have two back-\nto-back rollcall votes at 10:30, or close to that, unless we yield time \nback, so you and other colleagues can plan.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I only have two final points, Mr. President. The first \nis that this is the 6-month anniversary of the passage of this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. We cannot afford to wait \nany longer. We must pass this bill. The urgency is recognized by this \nagreement. I appreciate that very much.\n  The final point is that there are a number of Senators who, in good \nfaith, will be offering amendments they truly believe are relevant. I \ndon't know how one defines the relevance of amendments, but I hope we \ncan work with our Parliamentarian and with the Presiding Officers to \naccommodate our colleagues, as relevance is contemplated and defined. \nThis is a very important matter for a lot of Senators. This is a rare \nvehicle that they will have to offer legislation. I am hopeful we can \naccommodate as many Senators as possible with relevant amendments.\n  Again, I thank all cooperating Senators and appreciate, once more, \nthe chance to resolve this matter with the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to say, before Senator Kerrey \nleaves the floor, that the time that he outlined so both Senators could \nexplain what is in the amendments that would pay for the costs of these \ncorrections at IRS sounds fine. If we could have votes by 10:30 in the \nmorning, I don't see any problem with that, two back to back at 10:30.\n  Let me say to Senator D'Amato, once again, I appreciate his \ncooperation here, and it is not the first time he has cooperated this \nyear on a lot of issues. But on this issue in particular, I know how \nstrongly he feels about it and I am absolutely satisfied that he is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\nget a vote on this issue, and he should get a vote on this issue, and I \nam going to work with him to make that happen in a reasonable way.\n  I will work with you to try to see if we can get an agreement to \nbring this up next week. It is going to take work on your part and on \nmy part. Senator Daschle has a number of Senators who have views, or \namendments even, on this. That is a problem, because it could very \neasily get totally out of control and have the whole world caving in on \nit. But we will work on that.\n  If, for some reason, that does not work out, every bill that comes \nalong will be a prospect for an amendment, for the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If the majority leader might yield at this point just \nfor an observation? I want my colleagues to understand that we are \ngoing to vote on this one way or the other. I am committed to it. I \nhave, on a number of occasions now, so as to provide the opportunity \nfor this body to do its business--no one Senator, including this \nSenator, should put himself or herself above the interests of the body. \nI have attempted to respect that. I mean that. I have not attempted to \ndelay.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say, you certainly have. You have been very \nresponsible and you have been very cooperative, but you also made very \nclear your determination on this amendment. I understand that, and I am \ngoing to try to help you find a way to get it done.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Good, because I will wait for something all my \ncolleagues want, and we may be here a long time. I don't think that is \ngoing to serve anybody's interest. I would like everyone to join in. If \nthey can make this bill a better bill truly in that spirit, then let's \ndo it. If it is just to weight it down and sink it, that is not \nsomething I am going to take as being responsible, and we will talk to \nthat.\n  Everybody has a right to do what they want out here in the open. \nPeople can judge whether they are being responsible or not. I hope in \nthat spirit, because we have done a lot of good things together, I \nremind my colleagues on both sides, it is in that spirit I would like \nto approach it. I thank the majority leader for understanding and the \nminority leader. I look forward to working with them both.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4351-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. \n1703(c), and section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. \n1641(c). This report discusses only matters concerning the national \nemergency with respect to Sudan that was declared in Executive Order \n13067.\n  1. On November 3, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13067 (62 Fed. Reg. \n59989, November 5, 1997--the ``Order'') to declare a national emergency \nwith respect to Sudan pursuant to IEEPA. Copies of the Order were \nprovided to the Congress by message dated November 3, 1997.\n  The Order blocks all property and interests in property of the \nGovernment of Sudan, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled \nentities, including the Central Bank of Sudan, that are in the United \nStates, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or \nhereafter come within the possession or control of United States \npersons, including their overseas branches. The Order also prohibits \n(1) the importation into the United States of any goods or services of \nSudanese origin except for information or informational materials; (2) \nthe exportation or reexportation of goods, technology, or services to \nSudan or the Government of Sudan except for information or \ninformational materials and donations of humanitarian aid; (3) the \nfacilitation by a United States person of the exportation or \nreexportation of goods, technology, or services to or from Sudan; (4) \nthe performance by any United States person of any contract, including \na financing contract, in support of an industrial, commercial, public \nutility, or governmental project in Sudan; (5) the grant or extension \nof credits or loans by any United States person to\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nthe Government of Sudan; and (6) transactions relating to the \ntransportation of cargo. The Order also provided a 30-day delayed \neffective date for the completion of certain trade transactions.\n  2. Executive Order 13067 became effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern \nstandard time on November 4, 1997. On December 2, 1997, the Department \nof the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued \nGeneral Notice No. 1, interpreting the delayed effective date for pre-\nNovember 4, 1997, trade contracts involving Sudan if the preexisting \ntrade contract was for (a) the exportation of goods, services, or \ntechnology from the United States or a third country that was \nauthorized under applicable Federal regulations in force immediately \nprior to November 4, 1997, or (b) the reexportation of goods or \ntechnology that was authorized under applicable Federal regulations in \nforce immediately prior to November 4, 1997. Such exports or reexports \nwere authorized until 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time, December 4, \n1997, and nonfinancing activity by United States persons incidental to \nthe performance of the preexisting trade contract (such as the \nprovision of transportation or insurance) was authorized through 12:01 \na.m. eastern standard time, February 2, 1998. If the preexisting trade \ncontract was for the importation of goods or services of Sudanese \norigin or other trade transactions relating to goods or services of \nSudanese origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan, \nimportations under the preexisting trade contract were authorized until \n12:01 a.m. eastern standard time, December 4, 1997.\n  3. Since the issuance of Executive Order 13067, OFAC has made \nnumerous decisions with respect to applications for authorizations to \nengage in transactions under the Sudanese sanctions. As of March 12, \n1998, OFAC has issued 55 authorizations to nongovernmental \norganizations engaged in the delivery of humanitarian aid and 77 \nlicenses to others. OFAC has denied many requests for licenses. The \nmajority of denials were in response to requests to authorize \ncommercial exports to Sudan--particularly of machinery and equipment \nfor various industries--and the importation of Sudanese--origin goods. \nThe majority of licenses issued permitted the unblocking of financial \ntransactions for individual remitters who routed their funds through \nblocked Sudanese banks. Other licenses authorized the completion of \ndiplomatic transfers, preeffective date trade transactions, and the \nperformance of certain legal services.\n\n  4. At the time of signing Executive Order 13067, I directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury to block all property and interests in \nproperty of persons determined, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, the \nGovernment of Sudan. On November 5, 1997, OFAC disseminated details of \nthis program to the financial, securities, and international trade \ncommunities by both electronic and conventional media. This information \nincluded the names of 62 entities owned or controlled by the Government \nof Sudan. The list includes 12 financial institutions and 50 other \nenterprises.\n  5. OFAC, in cooperation with the U.S. Customs Service, is closely \nmonitoring potential violations of the import prohibitions of the Order \nby businesses and individuals. Various reports of violations are being \naggressively pursued.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from November 3, 1997, through May 2, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Sudan are reported \nto be approximately $425,000, most of which represent wage and salary \ncosts for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureaus of Economic and Business \nAffairs, African Affairs, Near Eastern Affairs, Counsular Affairs, and \nthe Office of the Legal Adviser), and the Department of Commerce (the \nBureau of Export Administration and the General Counsel's Office).\n  7. The situation in Sudan continues to present an extraordinary and \nunusual threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. The declaration of the national emergency with respect \nto Sudan contained in Executive Order 13067 underscores the United \nStates Government opposition to the actions and policies of the \nGovernment of Sudan, particularly its support of international \nterrorism and its failure to respect basic human rights, including \nfreedom of religion. The prohibitions contained in Executive Order \n13067 advance important objectives in promoting the antiterrorism and \nhuman rights policies of the United States. I shall exercise the powers \nat my disposal to deal with these problems and will continue to report \nperiodically to the Congress on significant developments.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, May 5, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4353-5", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4354-S4356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ENTITLED ``THE STATE ON SMALL BUSINESS''--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 120\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Small Business.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to present my fourth annual report on the state of small \nbusiness. In short, the small business community continues to perform \nexceptionally well. For the fourth year in a row, new business \nformation reached a record high: 842,357 new firms were formed in 1996.\n  The entrepreneurial spirit continues to burn brightly as the \ncreativity and sheer productivity of America's small businesses make \nour Nation's business community the envy of the world. My \nAdministration has worked hard to keep that spirit strong by \nimplementing policies and programs designed to help small businesses \ndevelop and expand. We have focused our economic strategy on three \npillars: reducing the deficit, opening up markets overseas, and \ninvesting in our people through education and technology. Our efforts \nwith respect to small business have been concentrated in a number of \nspecific areas, including directing tax relief to more small \nbusinesses, expanding access to capital, supporting innovation, \nproviding regulatory relief, opening overseas markets to entrepreneurs, \nand strengthening America's work force.\n\n\n                 A Balanced Budget and Taxpayer Relief\n\n  When I took office, the Federal budget deficit was a record $290 \nbillion. I determined that one of the best things we could do for the \nAmerican people, including small business, would be to balance the \nbudget. Because of our hard choices, the deficit has been reduced for 5 \nyears in a row. By October 1997, the deficit had fallen to just $22.6 \nbillion--a reduction of $267 billion or 90 percent. These lower \ndeficits have helped to reduce interest rates, an important matter for \nall small businesses.\n  Small business owners have long recognized the importance of this \nissue. At each of the White House Conferences on Small Business--in \n1980, 1986, and 1995--small businesses included on their agenda a \nrecommendation to balance the Federal budget. With passage of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, I signed into law the first balanced \nbudget in a generation. The new budget will spur growth and spread \nopportunity by providing the biggest investment in higher education \nsince the GI bill more than 50 years ago. Even after we pay for tax \ncuts, line by line and dime by dime, there will still be $900 billion \nin savings over the next 10 years.\n  And at the same time we are easing the tax burden on small firms. My \nAdministration and the Congress took the White House Conference tax \nrecommendations seriously during deliberations that led to the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997. The new law will direct billions of dollars in tax \nrelief to small firms over the next 10 years. Small businesses will see \na decrease in the estate tax, an increase to 100 percent over the next \n10 years in the percentage of health insurance payments a self-employed \nperson can deduct, an updated definition of ``home office'' for tax \npurposes, and a reduction in paperwork associated with the alternative \nminimum tax.\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\n  Significant new capital gains provisions in the law should provide \nnew infusions of capital to new small businesses. By reducing the \ncapital gains tax rate and giving small business investors new options, \nthe law encourages economic growth through investment in small \nbusinesses.\n\n\n                           Access to Capital\n\n  For so many small business owners, gaining access to capital \ncontinues to be a very difficult challenge. The U.S. Small Business \nAdministration (SBA) plays a key role as a catalyst in our efforts to \nexpand this access. The SBA made or guaranteed more than $13 billion in \nloans in 1997. Since the end of fiscal year 1992, the SBA has backed \nmore than $48 billion in loans to small businesses, more than in the \nprevious 12 years combined. In 1997, the SBA approved 45,288 loan \nguarantees amounting to $9.46 billion in the 7(a) guaranty program, a \n23 percent increase from 1996, and 4,131 loans worth $1.44 billion \nunder the Certified Development Company (CDC) loan program.\n\n  Included in the 1997 loan totals were a record $2.6 billion in 7(a) \nand CDC loans to more than 10,600 minority-owned businesses and another \nrecord $1.7 billion in roughly 10,800 loans to women-owned businesses. \nOver the last 4 years, the number of SBA loans to women small business \nowners have more than tripled, and loans to minority borrowers have \nalso nearly tripled.\n  The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, the SBA's \npremier vehicle for providing venture capital to small, growing \ncompanies, produced a record amount of equity and debt capital \ninvestments during the year. The program's licensed SBICs made 2,731 \ninvestments worth $2.37 billion. In 1997, 33 new SBICs with combined \nprivate capital of $471 million were licensed. Since 1994, when the \nprogram was revamped, 111 new SBICs with $1.57 billion in private \ncapital have entered the program.\n  And in the past year, the SBA's Office of Advocacy developed a \npromising new tool to direct capital to dynamic, growing small \nbusinesses--the Angel Capital Electronic Network, or ACE-Net. This \neffort has involved refining Federal and State small business \nsecurities requirements and using state-of-the-art Internet technology \nto develop a brand new nationwide market for small business equity.\n\n\n            government support for small business innovation\n\n  As this report documents, small firms play an important role in \ndeveloping innovative products and processes and bringing them to the \nmarketplace. Federal research and development that strengthens the \nnational defense, promotes health and safety, and improves the Nation's \ntransportation systems is vital to our long-term interests. Our \nGovernment has instituted active policies to ensure that small \nbusinesses have opportunities to bring their innovative ideas to these \nefforts.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business \nTechnology Transfer (STTR) programs help ensure that Federal research \nand development funding is directed to small businesses. In fiscal year \n1996, more than 325 Phase I and Phase II STTR awards totaling $38 \nmillion went to 249 small businesses. Also in 1996, the SBIR program \ninvested almost $1 billion in small high technology firms. The program \nhas touched and inspired individuals like Bill McCann, a blind--and \nonce frustrated--trumpet player who used SBIR funding to help start a \ncompany that designs software to automatically translate sheet music \ninto braille. Today, Dancing Dots Braille Music Technology is rapidly \nexpanding the library of sheet music available to blind musicians.\n  Other initiatives include the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology's (NIST) Advanced Technology Program, enabling small high \ntechnology firms to develop pathbreaking technologies, and NIST's \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, which helps small manufacturers \napply performance-improving technologies needed to meet global \ncompetition. Two of the SBA's loan programs--the 7(a) and 504 loan \nprograms--currently assist 2,000 high technology companies. And the \nSBA's ACE-Net initiative is especially designed to meet the needs of \nthese dynamic high technology firms.\n  Because they give small firms a footing on which to build new ideas \nand innovative products, these efforts benefit not only the small firms \nthemselves, but the entire American economy.\n\n\n                           regulatory relief\n\n  A pressing concern often identified by small businesses is unfairly \nburdensome regulation. My Administration is committed to reforming the \nsystem of Government regulations to make it more equitable for small \ncompanies. In 1996, I signed into law the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act, which strengthens requirements that Federal \nagencies consider and mitigate unfairly burdensome effects of their \nrules on small businesses and other small organizations. A small \nbusiness ombudsmen and a new system of regulatory fairness boards, \nappointed in September 1996, give small firms new opportunities to \nparticipate in agency enforcement actions and policies. Because \nagencies can be challenged in court, they have gone to extra lengths to \nensure that small business input is an integral part of their \nrulemaking processes.\n\n  Many agencies are conducting their own initiatives to reduce the \nregulatory burden. The SBA, for example, cut its regulations in half \nand rewrote the remaining requirements in plain English. All of these \nreforms help ensure that the Government maintains health, safety and \nother necessary standards without driving promising small companies out \nof business.\n\n\n                        opening overseas markets\n\n  Key in my Administration's strategy for economic growth are efforts \nto expand business access to new and growing markets abroad. I want to \nopen trade in areas where American firms are leading--computer \nsoftware, medical equipment, environmental technology. The information \ntechnology agreement we reached with 37 other nations in 1996 will \neliminate tariffs and unshackle trade in computers, semiconductors, and \ntelecommunications. This cut in tariffs on American products could lead \nto hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.\n  Measures aimed at helping small firms expand into the global market \nhave included an overhaul of the Government's export controls and \nreinvention of export assistance. These changes help ensure that our \nown Government is no longer the hurdle to small businesses entering the \ninternational economy.\n\n\n                       a 21st century work force\n\n  American business' most important resource is, of course, people. I \nam proud of my Administration's efforts to improve the lives and \nproductivity of the American work force. We know that in this \nInformation Age, we need a new social compact--a new understanding of \nthe responsibilities of government, business, and every one of us to \neach other.\n  Education is certainly the most important investment we can make in \npeople. We must invest in the skills of people if we are to have the \nbest educated work force in the world in the 21st century. We're moving \nforward to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000, \nand to raise standards so that every child can master the basics.\n  We're also training America's future entrepreneurs. The SBA, for \nexample, has improved access to education and counseling by funding 19 \nnew women's business centers and 15 U.S. export assistance centers \nnationwide. And we are encouraging businesses to continue their \nimportant contributions to job training. The Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 encourages employers to provide training by excluding income spent \non education for employees from taxation.\n  We are taking steps to improve small business workers' access to \nemployee benefits. Last year, I signed into law the Small Business Job \nProtection Act, which, among other things, makes it easier for small \nbusinesses to offer pension plans by creating a new small business \n401(k) plan. We make it possible for more Americans to keep their \npensions when they change jobs without having to wait before they can \nstart saving at their new jobs. As many as 10 million Americans without \npensions when the law was signed can now earn them because this law \nexists.\n  Given that small businesses have created more than 10 million new \njobs in the last four years, they will be critical in the \nimplementation of the welfare to work initiative. That means the SBA \nmicroloan and One-Stop Capital\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\nShop programs will be uniquely positioned to take on the ``work'' \ncomponent of this initiative. The work opportunity tax credit in the \nBalanced Budget Act is also designed as an incentive to encourage small \nfirms, among others, to help move people from welfare to work.\n  A small business starts with one person's dream. Through devotion and \nhard work, dreams become reality.

The report and my recommendations \nare in response to the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, \nPublic Law 90-542, as amended. The Pemigewasset River study was \nauthorized by Public Law 101-357.\n  The study was conducted by the National Park Service with assistance \nfrom a local study committee. The National Park Service determined that \nthe 32.5-mile study segment is eligible for designation based upon its \nfree-flowing character and outstanding scenic, recreational, geologic, \nfishery, and botanic values. However, in deference to the wishes of \nlocal adjoining communities, six of seven of whom voted against \ndesignation, and the State of New Hampshire, I am recommending that the \nCongress not consider designation at this time. If the local \ncommunities and/or the State should change their position in the \nfuture, the question of designation could be reevaluated.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to designate the Federal building in Juneau, Alaska, \nas the ``Hurff A. Saunders Federal Building''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   hurff a. saunders federal building\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill dedicate the Juneau, Alaska Federal building in honor of Hurff \nSaunders who passed away in 1996. Hurff was a lifelong Alaskan who \ntouched the lives\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nof countless people in Southeast Alaska and played an important role in \nAlaska's history both as a territory and as a state.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Hurff was a federal government civil \nengineer in charge of the construction of the Juneau federal building. \nTypical of Hurff's efforts, the Juneau federal building project was \ncompleted on time and under budget. In addition, Hurff helped to \ncorrect many of the navigational charts for Southeast Alaska thereby \nassisting the United States Navy and the Coast Guard in safely carrying \nout their missions in southeast Alaska during World War II.\n  I am privileged to have known Hurff and his family quite well. \nHurff's wife Florence was one of my teachers as a young boy growing up \nin Ketchikan. Hurff and Florence were wonderful people, who left a long \nand lasting impression on those around them.\n  Mr. President, I have received copies of a number of resolutions, \nincluding one passed by the City and Borough of Juneau, all requesting \nthat the Juneau federal building be dedicated in Hurff's memory. Many \nother Alaskans who also knew Hurff have taken the time to write and to \nshare their support.\n  Hurff was a dedicated public servant who touched the lives of many \nAlaskans. Naming the Juneau federal building in his honor would be a \nfitting and lasting tribute to his memory.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nlegislation and supporting resolutions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2032\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF HURFF A. SAUNDERS FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       The Federal building in Juneau, Alaska, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Hurff A.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect \nto penalties for crimes involving cocaine, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      the powder cocaine mandatory minimum sentencing act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Powder Cocaine \nMandatory Minimum Sentencing Act,'' along with Senator Allard and other \nSenators whose names I will be submitting in a moment.\n  This legislation will toughen sentences for drug dealers caught \npeddling powder cocaine.\n  I believe it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on \ndrugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all \nAmericans, and our children in particular, that the sale of illegal \ndrugs is dangerous, wrong, and will not be tolerated.\n  As the father of three young children, I am deeply disturbed by \nrecent trends in drug use. Indeed, since 1992 Washington has been \nlosing important ground in the war on drugs. Let me cite just a few of \nthe alarming facts:\n  Over the past five years, the average number of federal drug \ndefendants prosecuted has dropped by almost 1500 cases from the 1992 \nlevel. And the average number of drug convictions has gone down by a \nsimilar amount since 1993.\n  The drug interdiction budget was cut by 39 percent from 1992 to 1996 \nand drug surveillance flights were cut in half.\n  The impact on our kids has been serious. In the last six years, the \npercentage of high school seniors admitting that they had used an \nillicit drug has risen by more than half.\n  Incredibly, 54 percent of the Class of 97 had used an illicit drug by \ngraduation.\n  For 10th graders during that same time, drug use has doubled.\n  And--perhaps worst of all--nearly 20 percent of our 8th graders use \nillegal drugs.\n  Faced with this bad news, this year the Administration finally \nsubmitted a comprehensive long range National Drug Strategy to \nCongress.\n  Unfortunately, it took them nearly five years to take this step. And, \nas the numbers show, our children have been paying the price.\n  What is more, when it comes to one crucial part of the war on drugs--\npunishing drug pushers--the Administration wants to move us in the \nwrong direction. It would make the mandatory minimum prison sentences \nfor crack cocaine dealers 5 times more lenient than they are today.\n  The President would raise, from 5 to 25 grams--that is, from about 50 \nto about 250 doses--the amount of crack a person could sell before \ntriggering a mandatory 5 year sentence. And he would raise from 50 to \n250 grams the amount of crack a person could sell before triggering a \nmandatory 10 year sentence.\n  This would have the effect of lowering sentences for all those who \ndeal crack--even though just 2 years ago the President vetoed a similar \nproposal, explaining ``I am not going to let anyone who peddles drugs \nget the idea that the cost of doing business is going down.''\n  The President says we need to reduce crack dealer sentences because \nthey are too tough compared to sentences for powder cocaine kingpins. I \nagree. It doesn't make sense for people who are higher on the drug \nchain to get lighter sentences than those at the bottom. But going \neasier on crack peddlers--the dealers who infest our school yards and \nplaygrounds--is in my judgment the solution.\n  Crack is a cheap drug and highly addictive. Tough sentences for crack \ndealers has forced many of them to turn in their superiors in the drug \ntrade, in exchange for leniency. Softening these sentences will remove \nthat incentive and undermine our prosecutors.\n  I might add, in my State of Michigan, if we were to soften these \nsentences, it would create a considerable disparity between the \nmandatory minimums under the State law and the mandatory minimums under \nthe Federal law. My prosecutors and local law enforcement officials are \nvery concerned about this because it would, in effect, mean that a lot \nof drug dealers they are pursuing will begin making deals with and \nnegotiating with Federal prosecutors in order to avoid the tough \nsanctions the people of Michigan have attempted to put into effect.\n  I believe there's a better way. We must reject President Clinton's \nproposal to lower sentences for crack dealers. Instead, let's make the \nsentences for powder cocaine dealers a lot tougher.\n  I agree with the Administration's view that the differentiation \nbetween crack and powder sentences is too sharp and should be reduced. \nBut I do not agree with its conclusion that therefore we should lower \nsentences for crack dealers.\n  We can instead accomplish this entirely by increasing sentences for \ndealing powder cocaine.\n  For the sake of our children, I urge President Clinton to abandon his \nplans to lower sentences for crack dealers and instead support \nlegislation for tougher sentences on powder dealers.\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\n  Powder sentences are too low. Powder is the raw material for crack, \nyet sentences for powder dealers were set before the crack epidemic, \nwithout accounting for powder's role in causing it.\n  Moreover, we occasionally see a large powder supplier get a lower \nsentence than the low-level crack dealer who resold some powder in \ncrack form, simply because the powder dealer took the precaution of \nselling his product only in powder form.\n  That is a genuine disparity that should be remedied, although without \neliminating the differential altogether.\n  That differential should remain, Mr. President, because, as both the \nPresident and the Sentencing Commission recognize, crack is more \naddictive, more available to minors, and more likely to result in \nviolence than is powder cocaine, and hence its sale should continue to \nbe punished more harshly.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Powder Cocaine Mandatory \nMinimum Sentencing Act.\n  This legislation reduces from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder \ncocaine a person must be convicted of selling before receiving a \nmandatory 5 year minimum sentence.\n  By so doing it changes the quantity ratio for powder and crack \ncocaine from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1, the same ratio proposed by the \nAdministration and within the range recommended by the Sentencing \nCommission. But this legislation reduces that ratio by getting tougher \non powder dealers, not by giving a break to crack dealers.\n  We owe it to the thousands upon thousands of families struggling to \nprotect their children from the scourges of drugs and drug violence to \nstay tough on the criminals who prey on their neighborhoods.\n  At this critical time it would be a catastrophic mistake to let any \ndrug dealer think the cost of doing business is going down.\n  More importantly it will be nearly impossible to succeed in \ndiscouraging kids from using drugs if they learn we are lowering \nsentences for any drug dealers.\n  Protecting our kids means staying tough on those who peddle drugs and \nsending a clear message to our young people that we will not tolerate \ncrack dealers in our neighborhoods.\n  President Clinton had it right two years ago when he said:\n\n       We have to send a constant message to our children that \n     drugs are illegal, drugs are dangerous, drugs may cost your \n     life--and the penalties for dealing drugs are severe.\n\n  Unfortanately, President Clinton's new plan to reduce sentences for \ncrack dealers does not live up to this obligation. It sends our kids \nexactly the wrong message and it does not do any favor to anybody \nexcept drug pushers.\n  In contract, the legislation I am introducing today is faithful to \nthis obligation. It achieves a reduction in the disparity between crack \nand powder cocaine sentencing in the right way, through legislation \nmaking the sentences for powder cocaine dealers a lot tougher.\n  By enacting the Powder Cocaine Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act we \ncan send our kids the right message. We will not tolerate crack dealers \nin our neighborhoods, and we will make the sentences on powder cocaine \ndealers a lot tougher.\n  Success in the drug war depends above all on the efforts of parents, \nschools, churches, and medical community, local law enforcement \nofficials and community leaders. And they are doing a great job in the \ndrug fight. But the Federal Government must do its part too.\n  Washington has to renew the war on drugs. We must provide needed \nresources, and we must reinforce the message that drugs aren't \nacceptable and that drug dealers belong in prison--for a long time.\n  Our kids deserve no less.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  At this time, I yield to the Senator from Colorado who, under the \nunanimous consent that we just proposed here, will now take the floor \nand speak on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my good friend, the \nSenator from Michigan, for his very hard work on this particular issue. \nHe was working on the issue before I was elected to the Senate and is \nrecognized for his efforts to try to control the use of illegal drugs. \nHis national reputation precedes my meeting him here in the Senate, so \nthe question is, How did I get involved in this particular issue? I got \ninvolved in this issue because I do hold a lot of town meetings in the \nState of Colorado, the State which I represent. In the inner-city areas \nof the Denver metropolitan area, the issue of discrepancy sentencing \nbetween powder cocaine and crack cocaine was brought up by the minority \ncommunities. There were a few members who felt the crack cocaine \npenalties should be less. But, by far, the majority of members in those \nmeetings felt we needed to make tougher powder cocaine penalties \nbecause the crack cocaine penalties were working.\n  I also heard some concern from within the judiciary of the State of \nColorado about the discrepancy between crack and powder cocaine. So \nthat is how I got involved in the issue. Then I had introduced some \nlegislation to deal with this issue. I had an opportunity to sit down \nwith the Senator from Michigan and we have worked out a provision in a \nnew bill that I think is the right answer. It does toughen the \npenalties on powder cocaine, brings it more in line with crack cocaine. \nIt is a position I support. It is a position I believe the voters of \nColorado and the people of Colorado, even in the minority communities, \ndo support.\n  Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most longstanding \nand racially sensitive disputes in the criminal justice system. \nSenators Abraham, Hatch, Feinstein, Kyl, and I are introducing a bill \nto lessen the disparity between criminal penalties of selling crack and \npowder cocaine.\n  Under current law, a seller of 5 grams of crack cocaine receives the \nsame mandatory 5-year prison term as a seller of 500 grams of powder \ncocaine. I believe this is inexcusable.\n  The disparity between penalties has been scrutinized by the U.S. \nSentencing Commission, Congress, and the Clinton administration for the \nlast several years. Recommendations by the administration and U.S. \nSentencing Commission have called for lessening the penalties for crack \ndealers, bringing them closer to the lax penalties applied to powder \noffenders.\n  Our legislation rejects the administration's harmful solution. \nLowering the penalty for crack to make it equal to powder cocaine \npenalties goes against our Nation's conviction to send a strong message \nto drug dealers: If you sell drugs, you are going to have to face \nserious consequences.\n  The Powder Cocaine Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act increases the \nmandatory penalties for dealing powder cocaine to 50 grams receiving a \n5-year minimum sentence, bringing it closer to crack's stiff sentence \nof 5 grams for a minimum of 5 years.\n  The disparity ratio of powder to crack cocaine will be a 10-to-1 \nratio under our bill instead of the 100-to-1 ratio. This is the same \nnumber ratio recommended, by the way, by the commission and by the \nadministration. This correction goes a long way in reforming the unjust \ndisparity that we see now.\n  Critics of current law remind us that cocaine dealers carry powder \ncocaine, leaving customers the risk of converting to crack. The very \ncore of the drug crisis in the United States begins with the arrogance \nof drug traffickers who have found a way to ``work the system.'' Our \nbill will destroy the ease drug dealers now enjoy as they choose to \ntraffic their drug in powder form alone. No longer will the penalty \nprice for dealing powder be a bargain for drug traffickers. The safe \noption for dealing cocaine will no longer exist.\n  During the 1980s, Congress legislated steep consequences for crack \ncocaine. The crack epidemic was plaguing our Nation with high crime \nrates and unprecedented statistics of addiction, and it warranted \nseveral drastic legal reforms. We saw the destruction wrought on entire \ncommunities by this cheap and highly addictive form of cocaine and \nrealized that tough penalties were needed to restrict its availability.\n  These tougher sentences were needed, but the problem we are seeing \ntoday is that powder cocaine sentences were set before the crack \nepidemic began. They don't reflect the influence powder has had on \ncrime and drug trafficking.\n  It is time to admit that the penalty for powder cocaine must change. \nThe\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\nnotion that powder cocaine is not dangerous is simply false. A Rocky \nMountain News reporter was killed 2 years ago when an heir to one of \nColorado's largest fortunes, high on powder cocaine, plowed his sports \ncar into the reporter's car. Ask the wife and son of this young \nreporter if they think the penalty for powder cocaine should be 100 \ntimes less than that of crack.\n  Law enforcement officials, including drug enforcement detectives in \nboth Denver and Washington, DC, have encouraged me to pursue passage of \nthis legislation. The National Headquarters for the Fraternal Order of \nPolice issued a statement several weeks ago saying:\n\n       The current disparities in the sentencing are unjust and do \n     not provide law enforcement with the tools they need to \n     restrict the sale of powder cocaine.\n       The overwhelming majority of violent crime in this country \n     is drug related. We need to do more to get and keep dealers \n     of drugs, whatever the form, off the streets. Your bill will \n     help us do it.\n\n  The U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, Henry Solano, \nsupports this legislative concept saying:\n\n       The law enforcement community learned years ago that the \n     strong sentences meted out to crack cocaine dealers has had a \n     significant deterrent effect on the production and \n     distribution of crack.\n       Senator Allard's proposed penalty for powder cocaine will \n     likewise restrict the flow of powder cocaine in this country.\n\n  In light of the numerous proposals introduced to correct this \nproblem, I encourage my colleagues to contemplate the alternatives and \nconsider how justice is served in this matter. Maintaining the current \nratio is allowing a wrongful disparity in penalties to continue. It is \ntime to act to correct this injustice. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the powder cocaine mandatory minimum sentence bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just have one or two additional \ncomments to make before yielding the floor.\n  In the process of putting together this legislation which we \nintroduce today, I had the occasion to speak to a number of people in \nthe law enforcement community in our State, as well as individuals who \nhave been touched in some way or another by the crack cocaine epidemic. \nThere are two or three points I would like to enter into the Record at \nthis point, in conjunction with our legislation, that are drawn from \nsome of the comments I have heard.\n  One of them I have already mentioned, and that is the concerns local \nlaw enforcement people have that if we change the crack minimum \nmandatory threshold at the Federal level, it will create a problem in \nour State, and probably in a lot of other States where there are very \ntough mandatory minimums for crack dealing, because it will give people \nwho are criminal defendants the option of going into the Federal system \nto avoid tough State-level penalties. I don't think we want to do that.\n  Second, it was pointed out to me that the 5-gram trigger which \ncurrently exists for crack is very appropriate for the simple reason \nthat most drug dealers who at least deal in crack cocaine do so in very \nsmall quantities; that there are very, very, very few crack cocaine \ndealers who are ever dealing in quantities such as 25 grams where they \ncan be found in possession of and dealing at that level. In fact, what \nhappens is that they essentially hide their crack cocaine stash in \nlocations that are very hard to trace to the dealer and carry around \nquantities in the 5-gram level, which is why the mandatory minimum is, \nin fact, only appropriate.\n  A third point that was made to me is the fact that by having this \ntough mandatory minimum in place at the Federal level, as well as in \nour State, at the State level, we have been very successful, through \nthe safety valve process that exists in the Federal legislation, in \ngetting people at the lower end of the drug chain, the crack dealer at \nthe 5-gram level confronted with the possibility of a very severe \nprison sentence, to begin cooperating with authorities in exchange for \nthe benefits to be received under the safety valve, to, in fact, begin \nto allow law enforcement to pursue people further up the drug chain.\n\n  Increasing the threshold for the crack mandatory minimum, as the \nadministration has proposed and consistent with the sentencing \ncommission's recommendations, will affect very dramatically, it is \nbelieved by at least the law enforcement people in my State, the level \nof cooperation people will have, because in individual transactions \nthey will be dealing below that 25-gram level and, therefore, not \nconfronted with the 5-year mandatory minimum threat, consequently, not \nnearly in the same position of jeopardy as is the case today. It means, \nin fact, that we might have less cooperation, less ability to pursue \nthe people who are the drug lords rather than those who are at the \ndealer level.\n  Finally, again, I want to talk, as I said, about some of the contact \nwe have had with the people who are victims. When we have talked to \nthose people to the extent we have, it doesn't really matter--Senator \nAllard alluded to the racial disparity and it is a very significant \nissue that we are trying to address with our bill--but I have not found \npeople, regardless of their race, whose children have been touched by a \ncrack cocaine dealer who don't want to see the person responsible \nsuffer consequences.\n  Their families are suffering consequences, their school yards are \nsuffering consequences, their neighborhoods are suffering consequences. \nThey believe that the people behind it --whether it is the peddler in \nthe school yard or the kingpin selling the powder cocaine--ought to \nsuffer the consequences, as well.\n  The way to do that, in my judgment, Mr. President, and the reason \nSenator Allard and I are here today, is to make it tougher on the drug \nkingpins and make it no easier on anybody involved in this heinous \nactivity. We hope our colleagues will join us in this legislation.\n  We think the arguments for it, as we have attempted to lay it here \ntoday, should be ones that are persuasive as they have been persuasive \nto us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2034. A bill to establish a program to provide for a reduction in \nthe incidence and prevalence of Lyme disease; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                the lyme disease initiative act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Lyme Disease \nInitiative Act of 1998, companion legislation to a bill being \nintroduced today by Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey. \nThe objective of this bill is to put us on the path toward eradicating \nLyme disease--a disease that is unfamiliar to some Americans, but one \nthat those of us from Connecticut and the Northeast know all too well.\n  Almost everyone in my state, including myself, has seen the \ndevastating impact that this disease can have on its victims. Lyme \ndisease can cause serious health problems, both physical and \npsychiatric, and can ruin a family's life. Some damage due to the \ndisease, especially memory loss and other brain damage, is permanent.\n  And we have also seen that, in many ways, efforts to educate people \nabout this disease and to find a cure have come up short.\n  The number of cases reported to the CDC increased from 500 cases in \n1982 to 16,000 cases in 1996. And some reports suggest that these cases \nonly represent the tip of the iceberg--that there are in fact tens of \nthousands more cases that have gone unreported or undiagnosed, due in \npart to the lack of a standardized diagnostic test.\n  Studies indicate that long term treatment of infected individuals \noften exceeds $100,000 per person--a phenomenal cost to society. \nBecause Lyme disease mimics other health conditions, patients often \nmust visit multiple doctors before a proper diagnosis is made. This \nresults in prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, and costly \nand futile treatments. But an even greater price is paid by the victims \nand their families--we can put no price tag on the emotional costs \nassociated with this disease.\n  But there is hope. We are close to the approval of vaccines to \nprevent this disease--perhaps as soon as next spring. And combined with \na strong commitment to public education, we can hope that the numbers \nof new families affected by this terrible disease will finally begin to \ndiminish.\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\n  But we can't let down our guard. We can't let the promise of a \nvaccine to prevent Lyme disease distract us from seeking more effective \nways to diagnose an treat those individuals who are already infected.\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative is a $100 million federal initiative \nwhich will, for the first time, establish prominent, coordinated, \nfederal role in Lyme disease research, treatment, and education. \nVarious agencies within the federal government have made a good start \nin addressing Lyme disease concerns. These efforts have been hampered, \nhowever, by a lack of interagency coordination, inconsistent funding, \nand limited agency staff attention. The Lyme Disease Initiative will \ncorrect these problems.\n  First, my bill calls for a 5 year plan to be established by the \nSecretary of Health and Human and Services, in coordination with the \nSecretary of Defense and outside experts, to advance the treatment of \nand a cure for Lyme disease. This legislation also sets out four \ncritical public health goals for advancing Lyme disease research \nefforts which include: the development of standardized diagnostic \ntests; a review of current systems for reporting cases; a study on how \nto improve the accuracy of diagnoses; and a campaign to educate \nphysicians how to properly diagnose and treat Lyme disease.\n  Other major provisions of the bill include establishing a Lyme \nDisease Taskforce to provide advice and expertise to Congress and \nfederal agencies on all areas of Lyme disease policy; requiring that \nannual reports be submitted to Congress on the progress of NIH, CDC, \nand DoD with respect to the goals and programs funded in this bill; an \nauthorization of $100 million over five years to ensure sufficient \nresources for critical, scientific research; and a request to the FDA \nrapidly and thoroughly review pending Lyme disease vaccine \napplications.\n  Summer is just around the corner. My hope is that the Lyme Disease \nInitiative Act of 1998 will help to ensure a future where children and \ntheir families can engage in outdoor activities without the fear of \ncontracting this dreaded disease.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lyme Disease Initiative Act \n     of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States is \n     increasing more rapidly than most other diseases. The Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that, since \n     1982, there has been a 32-fold increase in reported cases.\n       (2) For 1996, such Centers determined that 16,455 cases of \n     the disease were reported.\n       (3) There is no reliable standardized diagnostic test for \n     Lyme disease, and it is therefore likely that the disease is \n     severely underreported. The disease is often misdiagnosed \n     because the symptoms of the disease mimic other health \n     conditions.\n       (3) Lyme disease costs our Nation at least $60,000,000 a \n     year in direct medical costs for early, acute cases. The \n     costs of chronic cases of the disease, as well as the costs \n     of lost wages and productivity, are many times higher.\n       (4) Many health care providers lack the necessary knowledge \n     and expertise--particularly in non-endemic areas--to \n     accurately diagnose Lyme disease. As a result, patients often \n     visit multiple doctors before obtaining a diagnosis of the \n     disease, resulting in prolonged pain and suffering, \n     unnecessary tests, and costly and futile treatments.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS; FIVE-YEAR PLAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (acting as appropriate through the Director of the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention and the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health) and the Secretary of Defense \n     shall collaborate to carry out the following:\n       (1) The Secretaries shall establish the goals described in \n     subsections (c) through (f) (relating to activities to \n     provide for a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of \n     Lyme disease).\n       (2) The Secretaries shall carry out activities toward \n     achieving the goals, which may include activities carried out \n     directly by the Secretaries and activities carried out \n     through awards of grants or contracts to public or nonprofit \n     private entities.\n       (3) In carrying out paragraph (2), the Secretaries shall \n     give priority--\n       (A) first, to achieving the goal under subsection (c);\n       (B) second, to achieving the goal under subsection (d);\n       (C) third, to achieving the goal under subsection (e); and\n       (D) fourth, to achieving the goal under subsection (f).\n       (b) Five-Year Plan.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Secretaries shall establish a plan that, for the 5 fiscal \n     years following the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     provides for the activities to be carried out during such \n     fiscal years toward achieving the goals under subsections (c) \n     through section (f). The plan shall, as appropriate to such \n     goals, provide for the coordination of programs and \n     activities regarding Lyme disease that are conducted or \n     supported by the Federal Government.\n       (c) First Goal: Detection Test.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a), the goal \n     described in this subsection is the development, by the \n     expiration of the 18-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, of--\n       (A) a test for accurately determining whether an individual \n     who has been bitten by a tick has Lyme disease; and\n       (B) a test for accurately determining whether a patient \n     with such disease has been cured of the disease.\n       (d) Second Goal: Improved Surveillance and Reporting \n     System.--For purposes of subsection (a), the goal described \n     in this subsection is to review the system in the United \n     States for surveillance and reporting with respect to Lyme \n     disease and to determine whether and in what manner the \n     system can be improved (relative to the date of the enactment \n     of this Act). In carrying out activities toward such goal, \n     the Secretaries shall--\n       (1) consult with the States, units of local government, \n     physicians, patients with Lyme disease, and organizations \n     representing such patients;\n       (2) consider whether uniform formats should be developed \n     for the reporting by physicians of cases of Lyme disease to \n     public health officials; and\n       (3) with respect to health conditions that are reported by \n     physicians as cases of Lyme disease but do not meet the \n     criteria established by the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention to be counted as such cases, \n     consider whether data on such health conditions should be \n     maintained and analyzed to assist in understanding the \n     circumstances in which Lyme disease is being diagnosed and \n     the manner in which it is being treated.\n       (e) Third Goal: Indicator Regarding Accurate Diagnosis.--\n     For purposes of subsection (a), the goal described in this \n     subsection is to determine the average number of visits to \n     physicians that are made by patients with Lyme disease before \n     a diagnosis of such disease is made. In carrying out \n     activities toward such goal, the Secretaries shall conduct a \n     study of patients and physicians in 2 or more geographic \n     areas in which there is a significant incidence or prevalence \n     of cases of Lyme disease.\n       (f) Fourth Goal: Physician Knowledge.--For purposes of \n     subsection (a), the goals described in this subsection are to \n     make a significant increase in the number of physicians who \n     have an appropriate level of knowledge regarding Lyme \n     disease, and to develop and apply an objective method of \n     determining the number of physicians who have such knowledge.\n\n     SEC. 4. LYME DISEASE TASK FORCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, there shall be established in \n     accordance with this section an advisory committee to be \n     known as the Lyme Disease Task Force (in this section \n     referred to as the Task Force).\n       (b) Duties.--The Task Force shall provide advice to the \n     Secretaries with respect to achieving the goals under section \n     3, including advice on the plan under subsection (b) of such \n     section.\n       (c) Composition.--The Task Force shall be composed of 9 \n     members with appropriate knowledge or experience regarding \n     Lyme disease. Of such members--\n       (1) 2 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, after consultation with the Director of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (2) 2 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, after consultation with the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health;\n       (3) 1 shall be appointed by the Secretary of Defense;\n       (4) 2 shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, after consultation with the Minority Leader \n     of the House; and\n       (5) 2 shall be appointed by the President Pro Tempore of \n     the Senate, after consultation with the Minority Leader of \n     the Senate.\n       (d) Chair.--The Task Force shall, from among the members of \n     the Task Force, designate an individual to serve as the chair \n     of the Task Force.\n       (e) Meetings.--The Task Force shall meet at the call of the \n     Chair or a majority of the members.\n       (f) Term of Service.--The term of service of a member of \n     the Task Force is the duration of the Task Force.\n       (g) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the membership of the Task \n     Force shall be filled in the manner in which the original \n     appointment was made and shall not affect the power of the \n     remaining members to carry out the duties of the Task Force.\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\n       (h) Compensation; Reimbursement of Expenses.--Members of \n     the Task Force may not receive compensation for service on \n     the Task Force. Such members may, in accordance with chapter \n     57 of title 5, United States Code, be reimbursed for travel, \n     subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred in \n     carrying out the duties of the Task Force.\n       (i) Staff; Administrative Support.--The Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services shall, on a reimbursable basis, provide to \n     the Task Force such staff, administrative support, and other \n     assistance as may be necessary for the Task Force to \n     effectively carry out the duties under subsection (b).\n       (j) Termination.--The Task Force shall terminate on the \n     date that is 90 days after the end of the fifth fiscal year \n     that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5.

DEFINITION.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the term ``Secretaries'' means--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting as \n     appropriate through the Director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention and the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) National Institutes of Health.--In addition to other \n     authorizations of appropriations that are available for \n     carrying out the purposes described in this Act and that are \n     established for the National Institutes of Health, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Director of such \n     Institutes for such purposes $9,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 1999 through 2003.\n       (b) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.--In \n     addition to other authorizations of appropriations that are \n     available for carrying out the purposes described in this Act \n     and that are established for the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, there are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Director of such Centers for such purposes $8,000,000 for \n     each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2003.\n       (c) Department of Defense.--In addition to other \n     authorizations of appropriations that are available for \n     carrying out the purposes described in this Act and that are \n     established for the Department of Defense, there are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Defense for \n     such purposes $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1999 \n     through 2003.\n\n     SEC. 8. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Food and Drug \n     Administration should--\n       (1) conduct a rapid and thorough review of new drug \n     applications for drugs to immunize individuals against Lyme \n     disease; and\n       (2) ensure that the labeling approved for such drugs \n     specifically indicate the particular strains of Lyme disease \n     for which the drugs provide immunization, the duration of the \n     period of immunization, and the reliability rate of the \n     drugs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2035. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to establish \nguidelines for the relocation, closing, or consolidation of post \noffices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n           the community and postal participation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nand Postal Participation Act of 1998. This legislation aims to preserve \nthe fabric of downtown American communities by giving citizens a say in \nPostal Service decisions to close, relocate or consolidate post \noffices.\n  Mr. President, the Postal Service is near and dear to the people of \nthe United States. Since its establishment over 200 years ago with \nBenjamin Franklin as the first Postmaster General, the Postal Service \nhas dutifully delivered the mail to generations of Americans. In many \ntowns across the U.S., the post office is still the center of the \ncommunity, the very anchor of what we fondly refer to as ``small-town \nAmerica.'' Nowhere is that more true than in my own state of Montana. \nIn Livingston, people meet to collect their mail and talk about what \nflies are hatching on the Yellowstone River. In Red Lodge, folks come \ntogether at the post office not only to collect their mail but to \ndiscuss last weekend's track meet. And in Plains, Montana, the place \nwhere people receive their mail is as important a meeting-spot as it \nwas when the first post office opened there more than 115 years ago.\n  But sadly, Mr. President, America has seen a rash of post office \nclosings, relocations and consolidations in recent years. From \nCalifornia to Connecticut, Montana to Maine, the Postal Service has \nproposed closing post offices located in the very heart of their \ncommunities. When the post office goes, often the central business \ndistrict goes with it. And, more important, the local gathering place \ndisappears.\n  Mr. President, today Senator Jeffords and I are introducing \nlegislation to change that. With passage of the Community and Postal \nParticipation Act, downtown communities will have an increased say in \ntheir future. They will have input into Postal Service decisions that \naffect their communities, and they will be allowed the chance to offer \nalternatives to Postal Service changes. Under current law, communities \nhave little say when the USPS decides to pull up stakes. Our bill would \nchange that by: allowing those served by a post office to receive at \nleast 60 days' notice before the USPS decides to relocate, close or \nconsolidate a post office; giving those affected by the closing a \nchance to respond to the proposed changes by offering an alternative to \nthe USPS proposals; providing for a public hearing before a final \ndetermination is made; allowing those affected by the relocation, \nclosing or consolidation to appeal to the Postal Rate Commission (PRC); \nand requiring the USPS to comply with applicable zoning, planning or \nland use laws.\n  Mr. President, I believe that with mutual cooperation, the interests \nof communities and the Postal Service can be served. The nature--indeed \nthe very name--of this legislation is participation. I am confident \nthat with its passage our communities and this important American \ninstitution may begin a new era of cooperation for the good of all \ninvolved. And we can put the community back in the Postal Service.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join Senator Jeffords and I \nin passing this important legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2035\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that my \ncolleague Senator Baucus and I are introducing titled the, ``Community \nAnd Postal Participation Act of 1998'' (CAPPA).\n  Coming from a small town in Vermont, I understand the importance \ndowntowns or village centers play in the identity and longevity of a \ncommunity. Downtowns are where people go to socialize, shop, learn what \ntheir elected representatives are doing, and gather to celebrate \nholidays with their neighbors.\n  One of the focal points of any downtown area is the community's post \noffice. Post offices have been part of downtowns and village centers as \nlong as most cities and towns have existed. These post offices are \noften located in historic buildings and have provided towns with a \nsense of continuity as their communities have changed over time. The \nremoval of this focal point can quickly lead to the disappearance of \ncontinuity and spirit of a community and then the community itself.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will enable the inhabitants of small \nvillages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides \nthat their local post office will be closed, relocated, or \nconsolidated. Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is \nnecessary. A few stories from my home state of Vermont will answer this \nquestion and hopefully lead to quick passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, \nVermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the \nsmall village center for a new building outside of town. By the time \nthe community was aware of the project, plans were so far along--the \nnew building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the \npost office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully \ninvestigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in \ncontrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, ``we \ncertainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more \nto get our mail.'' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented \nthat as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of \ncommunity are woven and reinforced. ``It may be intangible, but its \nreal, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation \nof the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like \nPerkinsville.''\n  In 1988, the post office in the Stockbridge Vermont General Store \nneeded to expand. The store owner tried to find money to rehabilitate \nan 1811 barn next to the store to provide the needed space, but was not \nsuccessful. In 1990, the post office moved into a new facility located \non the outskirts of Stockbridge on a previously undeveloped section of \nland at the intersection of two highways. People can no longer walk to \nthe post office as they once were able to do when it was located in the \nvillage center. The relocation of the Stockbridge post office \nunfortunately removed one of the anchors of the community.\n\n  These are not isolated examples. I ask unanimous consent that a \ndescription of Postal Service activities related to the relocation of \npost offices in the Vermont towns of Fairfax, Ascutney, Taftsville, and \nHuntington be included for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Vermont\n\n\n                          Fairfax and Ascutney\n\n       Formerly located in an historic building at the center of \n     Fairfax village, the Postal Service sought larger quarters \n     and moved out of town to a new development known as the \n     ``Fairfax Commons Shopping Center.'' Could the facility have \n     been accommodated in the village center? Possibly, if the \n     Postal Service had worked with the community, but no such \n     steps were taken.\n       In Ascutney, the Postal Service may vacate its existing \n     site on the village's Main Street to move around the corner \n     toward Exit 8 of the Interstate, to a new building which will \n     share the same floor plan as the Fairfax shopping center \n     facility. Prescription of stock requirements and layouts\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\n     leaves little room for creative adaptation of spaces in \n     existing buildings in existing village centers.\n\n\n                               Taftsville\n\n       When the Postal Service advertised to lease a new, larger \n     space for the Taftsville Post Office, housed for 65 years in \n     the general store, people in town voiced their opposition. \n     One resident wrote a letter to the Editor of the New York \n     Times that focused attention on the issue. In a compromise \n     praised by locals, an addition to the rear of the store was \n     built to house expanded postal facilities. Village residents \n     care about preserving village post offices as centers of \n     community life, and will work to find solutions, if given the \n     chance.\n\n\n                               Huntington\n\n       Development plans were well underway to move the post \n     office out of Huntington village to a new building before the \n     general public was aware of the proposal. When residents \n     found out, many voiced objection and they identified a \n     larger, historic building in the village that could serve the \n     Postal Service's need for expanded space. Plans are now being \n     developed to help fund the purchase and rehab of the building \n     for post office and other commercial use. Residents note that \n     lack of early notification polarized the community and slowed \n     progress of the proposed in-town solution.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, post office relocations are not only \noccurring in Vermont, but all across the country. My colleagues will \nquickly discover similar examples in their own states where the removal \nof the post office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown \narea, deprived citizens without cars of access, and contributed to \nurban sprawl.\n  The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in \na community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing or \nconsolidation of a post office. This community voice has been lacking \nin the current process. This bill does not give the citizenry the \nultimate veto power over a relocation, closing or consolidation. \nInstead, the bill sets up a process that makes sure community voices \nand concerns are heard and taken into account by the Postal Service.\n  Additionally, this act will require the Postal Service to abide by \nlocal zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal \nbuildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the \nability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has \nlead to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety \nstandards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such \nas storm water management.\n  Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are \ncenters of social and business interaction. In communities where post \noffices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become \nintegral to these communities' identities. I believe that this \nlegislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal \nService, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. \nI urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and I in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

BYRD RECEIVES 1998 LEADERSHIP AWARD\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Congressional Awards Foundation \nrecently held their third annual benefit. At that event, several award \nwinners spoke of their dedication to this program that promotes \nvolunteerism, personal development, physical fitness, and active \ncommunity involvement by our nation's young people.\n  At the benefit, one of our colleagues, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, \nwas honored. A lifetime of public service and his own commitment to God \nand Country was noted by the Congressional Awards Foundation with the \npresentation of their 1998 Leadership Award.\n  The Congressional Awards are near and dear to many a Wyomingite's \nheart because our state was the first to present these awards and \nrecognize the importance of our young people's contribution to the \neffort to make our communities better places to live. The program has \nsince become a great success and recognized the efforts of many special \npeople along the way--like Senator Byrd.\n  When he was presented with his Leadership Award, Senator Byrd had \nsome important things to say about his youth, his childhood, and about \nthose things that helped to mold him, shape him and make him what he is \ntoday. There is a great deal of food for thought there, which is why I \nwanted to share those remarks with my colleagues.\n  I was particularly interested in his comments about heroes and about \nthe role models we looked up to when we were youngsters. Unfortunately, \nas Senator Byrd notes in his speech, the kind of people we drew our \ninspiration from back then seem to be few and far between nowadays.\n  Still, there is reason for hope. There are still those people, like \nSenator Byrd, who exemplify the qualities of leadership, strong \npersonal character, and a sense of values and principles, that inspires \nothers to greatness. These are the kinds of examples we need to provide \nour children.\n  As Senator Byrd points out so well in his speech, ``Each of us has a \nchance through our personal example to inspire some youngster to \ngreatness. And that is a gift far too precious to squander.''\n  It is clear from Senator Byrd's many years of public service, and \nespecially from his service in the Senate, that he has not squandered \nthat precious gift. There is no doubt that he has inspired many to \ngreatness by his example.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Byrd's remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n          Statement of Senator Robert C. Byrd, April 29, 1998\n\n       I am honored to be here tonight before this very \n     distinguished audience, and delighted to have been selected \n     to be the recipient of the 1998 Leadership Award.\n       When I was a boy growing up in southern West Virginia, I \n     loved to read history. I think one of the reasons why I loved \n     it so much was that it provided me with heroes. I thought \n     maybe, if I worked hard enough, I could be as brave as Nathan \n     Hale, or as wise and honorable as George Washington. I had \n     other heroes as well. I wanted to play baseball like the \n     Sultan of Swat, Babe Ruth. I dreamed about piloting a plane \n     like Charles Lindbergh.\n       People in my own small community inspired me too. The old-\n     time fiddle player, who, incidentally, happened to be the \n     father of a pretty blonde girl that I later married, \n     encouraged me to learn more tunes and practice hard. My \n     English teacher instilled in me a desire to learn to write \n     and to speak as well as she. For me, heroes fueled a desire \n     to work on my own personal development--to take whatever \n     talents God gave me and make them better. The fact that there \n     was another person--a great general, a president, an aviator, \n     a good fiddle player, who had achieved something \n     extraordinary--something I wanted to achieve--gave me the \n     confidence to ``go for it'', and the inspiration to work to \n     polish my own skills.\n       Sometimes I look around at our country today and I feel \n     sorry for our young people. Where have all the heroes gone? \n     The idols of today's youngsters seem to be rock stars or rap \n     stars who sing lyrics and push messages that are the very \n     antitheses of everything that used to typify our values in \n     this country. Athletes have always been heroes to young \n     people. But the athletes in my day did not strangle their \n     coaches or spit in the face of the umpire. They tried to \n     exhibit the best sort of sportsmanship because they knew that \n     they were heroes to thousands of young fans.\n       Well, what about public service, then? Are we here in \n     Washington providing our young people with heroes or even \n     role models to inspire them? I think many of us try to do\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\n     that, at least on a small scale, perhaps within our own \n     states. But in general, on a larger scale, I think we miss \n     the mark. In my view, politics today is often too harshly \n     partisan. Of course, politics has always been, and always \n     will be, partisan. That is nothing new. But, I am talking \n     about the kind of partisan warfare that dominates, and \n     subjugates everything, including the public good, to the goal \n     of political victory for one side or another. It sends a bad \n     message. I wish for less of it.\n       Public service is an honorable calling, demanding hard \n     work, sacrifice, and dedication from those who shoulder the \n     responsibility. And it is good for us to keep in mind that to \n     those young people whom we hope to involve in public service \n     through programs like the Congressional Award, we are among \n     the heroes they look to for inspiration.\n       Programs like this one can be enormously successful in \n     encouraging community involvement and a caring attitude about \n     the problems of others in our young people. But, the living \n     examples we set, all of us right here in this room, through \n     our public statements, our demeanor, the way we live our \n     lives, and the respect that we show for each others' views \n     also make a tremendous impact. Each of us has a chance \n     through our personal example to inspire some youngster to \n     greatness. And that is a gift far too precious to \n     squander.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4367-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4368-S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE Y2K PROBLEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in yesterday's Wall Street \nJournal Edward Yardeni, chief economist and managing director of \nDeutsche Morgan Grenfell, wrote that there is 60 percent chance that \nthe year 2000 (Y2K) computer bug will cause a recession and that the \nU.S. may experience a $1 trillion drop in nominal GDP and a $1 trillion \nloss in stock market capitalization. A trillion dollar drop. I do not \nknow if these predictions will come true, but I do know the millennial \nmalady is real.\n  In his op-ed, Mr. Yardeni encourages States to follow the advice of \nBank of England governor Eddie George, who says the British government \nshould freeze all regulatory and legislative changes that would burden \nthe computers of financial institutions already struggling to fix their \nY2K problem. In a similar gesture, Commissioner Rossotti has asked that \nprovisions in the IRS restructuring bill be delayed until after the \nyear 2000. This delay would allow the IRS to solve the year 2000 \nproblem before changes to the tax code are implemented. The \nCommissioner has sent us a six-page letter detailing how he would phase \nin such changes. Commissioner Rossotti knows what he is talking about, \nand I hope we will listen to him.\n  This past Sunday, May 3, 1998, the front page of the Washington Post \ncalled attention to another important aspect of Y2K--the legal blame \ngame. At issue: who should pay the cost of the millennium bug. If a \ndate-related computer failure prevents an airline from flying, for \nexample, who will make up the millions of dollars in lost ticket \nrevenue? Should the airline just swallow the cost itself, or are its \ncomputer and software suppliers liable? How about individual \nprogrammers? Or the insurance companies that cover those parties?\n  The article states that there are pending lawsuits on Y2K and that \nthe suits are the first in what legal specialists predict could be a \nwave of litigation that eventually could prove more expensive and time-\nconsuming than the worldwide effort to fix the problem in the first \nplace. According to the article, preliminary estimates for litigation \nand settlement costs range from $100 billion to $1 trillion. As a \nmember of the recently established Special Committee on the year 2000 \ntechnology problem, I hope that we will have the opportunity to take a \ncloser look into the legal issues surrounding the Y2K problem.\n  These articles illustrate the serious and far-reaching effects of the \nmillennium bug. I have referred to Y2K as the ``13th labor of \nHercules.'' People have begun to realize the magnitude of this problem. \nWe must all work together to ensure the proper functioning not only of \nour Government, but of the economy.\n  I ask that yesterday's Wall Street Journal op-ed, ``Y2K--An Alarmist \nView'' and the Washington Post's story, ``Year 2000 Bug Could Bring \nFlood of Lawsuits'' be printed in the Record. The material follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 4, 1998]\n\n                         Y2K--An Alarmist View\n\n                          (By Edward Yardeni)\n\n       Concerns about the Year 2000 Problem--often called \n     ``Y2K''--have focused on the cost and difficulty of finding \n     and eliminating the software glitch in time. Most older \n     mainframe computer software systems, many personal computers \n     and millions of embedded semiconductor chips could \n     malfunction or even crash on Jan. 1, 2000, simply because \n     they read only the last two digits of the year, and may \n     interpret it as meaning 1900. But I believe most people are \n     not yet aware of the magnitude of the problem we face.\n       A survey released in March by the Information Technology \n     Association of America indicates that 44% of responding \n     companies have already experienced Y2K-related failures under \n     operating conditions, and 67% report failures under test \n     conditions. The entire Y2K problem will not be solved. We \n     must prepare for the possibility of business failures and the \n     collapse of essential U.S. government services, including tax \n     collection, welfare payments, national defense and air \n     traffic control.\n\n\n                           situation worsened\n\n       I am a Y2K alarmist, having previously predicted a 40% \n     likelihood of recession in the wake of Y2K computer crashes. \n     Despite many warnings, the situation has only worsened: The \n     recession odds are now up to 60% in my estimation, and there \n     is even a possibility of a depression. The time has come to \n     mobilize against Y2K as if for a war. While we work to \n     minimize government and business exposure to Y2K, we must \n     also begin preparing to soften the inevitable disruptions \n     that will occur when the millennium bug bites.\n       Our global and domestic markets for financial securities, \n     commodities, products and services depend completely on the \n     smooth functioning of the vast information technology \n     infrastructure. Information technology has helped create \n     modern versions of the division of labor, like just-in-time \n     manufacturing, outsourcing and globalization. Imagine a world \n     in which these systems are either impaired or completely \n     broken. Suddenly, people will be forced to do without many \n     goods and services that cannot be produced without \n     information technology.\n       The likely recession could be at least as bad as the one \n     during 1973-74, which was caused mostly by a disruption in \n     the supply of oil. Information, stored and manipulated by \n     computers, is as vital as oil for running modern economies. \n     If information is harder to obtain, markets will allocate and \n     use resources inefficiently. Market participants will be \n     forced to spend more time and money obtaining information \n     that was previously available at little or no cost.\n       How much could GDP fall? In the U.S., it dropped 3.7% from \n     peak to trough during 1973-74. We should prepare for a \n     similar fall in 2000. Furthermore, a 2000 recession is bound \n     to be deflationary. The U.S. may experience a $1 trillion \n     drop in nominal GDP and a $1 trillion loss in stock market \n     capitalization.\n       Why am I so sure that we will fail to have all our \n     information-technology systems ready and that the disruptions \n     will be severe enough to cause a major global recession? \n     Fixing and responding to Y2K requires a cooperative and \n     collective approach, which has yet to be adopted by \n     businesses and nations facing the millennial malady.\n       There is currently no global Y2K battle plan. Each company \n     and government agency is responsible for fixing Y2K on its \n     own. Even worse, there is no global campaign to increase \n     awareness of Y2K, and very few national efforts to alert the \n     public. Preventing disaster will depend on launching a \n     centralized international effort to direct several crucial \n     damage-control initiatives.\n       British Prime Minister Tony Blair plans to put the Y2K \n     matter before the Group of Eight at its May meeting in \n     Birmingham, England. This should be an occasion for concerted \n     action. An international Year 2000 Alliance must emerge from \n     the meeting--which should include all 29 members of the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development--to \n     deal comprehensively with the worldwide Y2K problem.\n       U.S. government reports indicate that the Pentagon has a \n     ``tight schedule for meeting its massive Y2K challenge,'' and \n     the situation in other nuclear countries is no better. The \n     military leaders of the G-8 states, especially the U.S. and \n     Russia, must jointly assess the risk of an accidental nuclear \n     missile launch or a provocative false alarm. They must \n     rapidly develop a fail-safe joint communication and \n     intelligence network to eliminate any such risks.\n       The international alliance should establish Y2K ``sector \n     alliances'' to deal with the bug on an industry-by-industry \n     basis. The top priority should be to ensure the world-wide \n     supply of electricity, water and other utilities. Contingency \n     plans for rationing utility use should be prepared.\n       Nothing should divert government or business resources from \n     fixing the millennium bug. The Y2K Alliance should encourage \n     states to follow the example of Bank of England governor \n     Eddie George, who says the British government should freeze \n     all regulatory and legislative changes that would burden the \n     computers of financial institutions already struggling to fix \n     their Y2K problem. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien is \n     informing his cabinet that Y2K should be their top priority.\n       The Y2K Alliance should consider requiring all nonessential \n     employees to stay home during the first week of January 2000. \n     Financial markets might have to be closed during\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\n     this period. This global Y2K holiday would give information-\n     technology personnel an opportunity to stress-test their \n     systems with a slow ``reboot,'' rather than under peak load \n     conditions. They could first test the integrity of basic \n     utility services. Then they could bring their own systems \n     on-line in a phased sequence that can pinpoint weak links.\n       The Year 2000 Alliance should further require all members \n     to fund a Y2K emergency budget with an initial minimum \n     balance of $100 billion. This money should be spent on both \n     last-ditch efforts to repair or replace key computer systems \n     around the world and to implement contingency plans once the \n     weakest links have been identified. The funds may also be \n     needed to purchase strategic stockpiles of fuel, food and \n     medicine.\n       The alliance should direct and supervise current efforts by \n     governments and companies to fix or minimize their Y2K \n     problems. Currently, each organization with a Y2K liability \n     establishes a triage process to identify ``mission-critical'' \n     systems. But there are no objective standards to determine \n     what is mission-critical. As a result, Y2K fixers are free to \n     reclassify mission-critical systems as noncritical.\n       For example, the number of U.S. government mission-critical \n     systems dropped from 8,589 to 7,850 in just the three-month \n     period ending Feb. 15; much of the reclassification was done \n     by the Department of Defense. As the deadline approaches, the \n     pressure will only increase for organizations to define down \n     their systems, making it seem they have made greater \n     progress. Only improved monitoring and verification can \n     prevent such dangerous fudging.\n\n\n                          Cooperative approach\n\n       Those responsible for dealing with Y2K must decide whether \n     to fix their noncritical systems or to let them fail in 2000. \n     But without a cooperative or collective approach, it is \n     likely that some entities will kill supposedly noncritical \n     systems that are actually mission-critical to some of their \n     external, and even internal, dependents.\n       Therefore we need to know if the products, services, \n     information, incomes and payments we rely on have been doomed \n     by the triage decisions of those who provide them. If so, we \n     might already be toast in 2000 and not know it in 1998 or \n     even in 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 1998]\n\n              Year 2000 Bug Could Bring Flood of Lawsuits\n\n                       (By Rajiv Chandrasekaran)\n\n       The year 2000 is still 20 months away, but the legal blame \n     game already has begun. At issue: who should pay the costs of \n     the ``millennium bug,'' a glitch that has left computers all \n     over the world unable to recognize dates after Dec. 31, 1999.\n       Near Detroit, a grocery store is suing a cash register \n     manufacturer whose machines can't accept credit cards that \n     expire in 2000. In Ohio, a firm that makes accounting \n     software is being hauled into court by a Connecticut computer \n     company. And in New York, a well-known law firm is \n     spearheading a class action lawsuit against the developer of \n     popular computer virus-blocking technology.\n       The suits are the first in what legal specialists predict \n     could be a wave of litigation that eventually could prove \n     more expensive and time-consuming than the world-wide effort \n     to fix the glitch in the first place. The cost of hiring \n     programmers and buying new computers is forecast by industry \n     analysts to be $300 billion to $600 billion. The price tag \n     for lawyers' fees and compensating people for any failures \n     that occur, through no one knows how many there will be, \n     could reach $1 trillion, according to some new estimates.\n       ``We used to think that programmers would be the ones to \n     profit from this,'' said Lou Marcoccio, a research director \n     at the Gartner Group consulting firm. ``Now it's becoming \n     clear that lawyers stand to gain the most here.''\n       Lawyers have started attending seminars on how to bring and \n     defend Year 2000 cases. Law firms eager to get in on the \n     action have set up Internet sites and sent out mass mailings \n     to attract clients.\n       ``There'll be as many, if not more, lawyer-driven cases as \n     there will be customer-driven ones,'' said Kirk R. \n     Ruthenberg, a partner in the Washington office of \n     Sonnecschein Nath & Rosenthal who teaches a seminar on Year \n     2000 legal issues.\n       Corporate executives complain that people already are so \n     afraid of being sued that they can't get a straight answer \n     from their banks, suppliers or vendors on whether their \n     computer systems will be ready to function in the new \n     century. Requests for information about readiness are routed \n     through lawyers--not technicians--who send out boilerplate \n     language saying the company is working hard and is highly \n     confident its systems will be ready.\n       At the same time, insurance companies are furiously \n     rewriting policies and seeking legislative changes to protect \n     them from what they expect to be a wave of claims--and finger \n     pointing--when computer systems fail.\n       If a date-related computer failure prevents an airline from \n     flying, for example, who will make up the millions of dollars \n     in lost ticket revenue? Should the airline just swallow the \n     cost itself, or are its computer and software suppliers \n     liable? How about individual programmers? Or the insurance \n     companies that cover those parties?\n       Preliminary estimates for litigation and settlement costs \n     range from $1200 billion to $1 trillion, a figure advanced by \n     the Lloyds of London insurance company and the Giga \n     Information Group, a consulting firm in Cambridge Mass.\n       That could rival legal fees and settlements associated with \n     such products as breast implants, asbestos or tobacco. Andrew \n     S. Grove, chief executive of computer chip maker Intel Corp., \n     recently predicted that ``this country is going to be tied \n     down in a sea of litigation'' over the next decade because of \n     the Year 2000 problem. ``It's going to put the asbestos \n     litigation to shame,'' Grove said.\n       The big explosion of such suits probably won't start until \n     next year, industry specialist said. But Marcoccio, who \n     monitors Year 2000 work at 375 large law firms, said he knows \n     of about 200 disputes that already have been settled out of \n     court. ``Most of them were resolved for substantial sums, \n     between $1 [million] and $10 million per settlement,'' he \n     said.\n       No Year 2000 case has yet been decided by a court, but \n     legal observers and technology companies are watching closely \n     the first class action suits, all of which have been brought \n     by the high-profile New York law firm of Milberg Weiss \n     Bershad Hynes & Lerach. A win by Milberg, the nation's most \n     prolific filer of class action suits accusing companies and \n     executives of securities fraud, could lead to quick flood of \n     similar suits experts said. Even a loss wouldn't necessarily \n     dissuade further legal action, they said--only a change in \n     lawyers' litigation strategy.\n       Milberg's first case was filed in December on behalf of \n     Atlas International Ltd., a New York computer equipment \n     vendor, which charged Software Business Technologies Inc. of \n     San Rafael, Calif, with breach of warranty, fraud and unfair \n     business practices. Milberg alleges that SBT is improperly \n     forcing customers, including Atlaz, to buy a pricey new \n     version of its accompanying software to correct the date \n     glitch instead of providing a free ``patch'' to fix the \n     problem.\n       ``They knowingly sold them a product that was materially \n     defective and failed to disclose that,'' said Salvatore J. \n     Graziano, a Milberg lawyer representing Altaz, which is \n     seeking more than $50 million from SBT. ``Our position is \n     that the upgrades should be given free.''\n       A lawyer representing SBT said that after the suit was \n     filed, the company started offering a free software ``patch'' \n     to fix the problem in versions of its software used by Atlaz. \n     But he acknowledged that the repair won't work for other, \n     earlier editions of SBT's software. ``The engineering task of \n     going back and altering all the old [software] code is \n     substantial,'' said David M. Furbush, an attorney \n     representing Atlaz.\n       Milberg's other two class action suits--one against Ohio \n     accounting software firm Macola Inc. and the other against \n     anti-virus software maker Symantec Corp.--make similar claims \n     for the same reason: The companies are requiring users to pay \n     for new versions of software that are Year 2000-compliant.\n       Despite the recent lawsuits, software companies don't \n     appear to be backing down from the upgrade charges. In \n     January 1997 only about 1 percent of software vendors were \n     charging for Year 2000 upgrades, Marcoccio said. By this \n     January, 29 percent were, he said. ``They see the year 2000 \n     as a way to sell new software, to make money,'' he said. ``It \n     can be a risky strategy.''\n       A spokesman for Symantec, which makes the popular Norton \n     AntiVirus software, said that people who use virus-checking \n     software should be buying updates anyway to get the latest \n     protection. ``You need up-to-date products to scan for \n     viruses,'' said spokesman Richard Saunders, who added that \n     the Milberg suit ``is without merit.''\n       In all three of the Milberg cases none of the plaintiffs \n     has yet suffered actual Year 2000-related computing problems.\n       Produce Palace in Warren, Mich., already knows what that's \n     like. Its cash registers will not accept credit cards that \n     expire in the year ``00'' or beyond. If a cashier swipes such \n     a card through the magnetic reader on a register, it can \n     cause the store's entire computer system to crash, said Brian \n     P. Parker, the store's lawyer.\n       ``Imagine a Saturday afternoon and the registers go down in \n     all 10 aisles,'' Parker said. ``It's been chaotic for them.''\n       After unsuccessfully trying to fix the problem, the store \n     sued the cash register maker, TEC America Inc., and its \n     distributor, All American Cash Register Inc. Last month \n     Parker said a mediator recommended that the Produce Palace be \n     compensated $250,000. The store has not formally decided \n     whether to accept the settlement; Parker said he expects the \n     case to go to trial. A TEC America spokesman would not \n     comment on details of the suit.\n       Lawsuits against technology companies may be only the first \n     step in a years-long stream of litigation. Specialists \n     predict that by late 1999, when some businesses start to \n     experience system failures, a second round of chain-reaction \n     lawsuits will ensue among all sorts of companies.\n       An auto parts maker that fails to get raw material because \n     of a Year 2000 failure at a supplier might sue the supplier. \n     The automaker that relies on the parts maker to stock its \n     assembly line might then sue the parts company, because it \n     has failed to deliver its parts on time and cost the \n     automaker sales.\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\n       Investors who see a company's stock price slide because of \n     Year 2000-related expenses and system failures could mount \n     class action suits, claiming that corporate officers failed \n     to adequately inform shareholders of the problem. ``Both \n     breach of contract suits between businesses and shareholder \n     suits will be rampant,'' said Jeff Jinnett, a lawyer with the \n     New York firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae.\n       Hoping to stem such lawsuits, a coalition of technology \n     firms and other businesses in California have urged the state \n     legislature to pass a bill that would immunize companies from \n     Year 2000 suits if they warn customers of the problem and \n     offer free upgrades. The bill was defeated by a key committee \n     last month after strenuous opposition from the state's trial \n     lawyers.\n       But state officials across the country are moving quickly \n     to protect themselves against litigation. Bills that would \n     limit state agencies from liability if their computers suffer \n     date-related failures recently have been signed into law in \n     Virginia, New Hampshire and Georgia.\n       A final wave of litigation, experts said, will begin in \n     2000 and involve insurance companies, as defendants seek to \n     force their insurers to cover their legal fees and any \n     damages they are ordered to pay. The cost to the insurance \n     industry could reach $65 billion, said Todd A. Muller, an \n     assistant vice president at the Independent Insurance Agents \n     of America, a trade group in Alexandria.\n       ``There's going to be a huge impact on the insurance \n     industry,'' Muller said. ``Because the industry has deep \n     pockets, we expect [trial lawyers] to do everything possible \n     to drag us into these disputes.''\n       Insurance industry executives said they expect businesses \n     to file claims under various types of common corporate \n     policies, including property insurance, general liability \n     insurance, and directors' and officers' liability insurance. \n     Property insurance claims, for example, could result from \n     actual physical damage caused by a Year 2000 malfunction, \n     such as fire sprinklers that accidentally go off, experts \n     said.\n       The insurance industry is moving quickly to prevent such \n     suits by revising policies to exclude Year 2000-related \n     claims on the grounds the peril wasn't known to exist when \n     the policies were created, and as a result, premiums never \n     were collected for such coverage. The Insurance Services \n     Office Inc., which authors generic policy language used by \n     most large insurers, already has gotten regulators in 40 \n     states to approve such exclusions, said Christopher Guidette, \n     an ISO spokesman.\n       At the same time, insurers are arguing that the problem was \n     entirely predictable, and therefore isn't coverable, because \n     insurance is only for the unpredictable.\n       ``This is a foreseeable event. People have known for more \n     than 98 years that this was coming. . . . We're not going \n     to be the bank of last resort to pay for this,'' said \n     Steven Goldstein a spokesman for the Insurance Information \n     Institute, a trade group in New York.\n       But whatever steps the insurers take, predicts Muller, \n     ``when their claims are denied, people are going to go to \n     court.''\n       Lawyers who have gone after companies over asbestos and \n     breast implants already have started preparing litigation \n     strategies for the date glitch.\n       ``Insurance sells itself as a public-service operation,'' \n     said Eugene R. Anderson of Anderson, Kill & Olick in New \n     York, who has won dozens of cases against insurers. ``They \n     are the safe hands, the rock of Gibraltar, the good \n     neighbors. When there's a problem they can't just say, `Oh \n     well, we don't cover that.' It's contrary to the very idea of \n     insurance.''\n       Unlike in breast implants and asbestos cases, some lawyers \n     said the lack of ordinary human victims in Year 2000 \n     litigation could make it tougher to ask a jury for multi-\n     million-dollar damages. Others caution that the scope of the \n     litigation will rest on the number of systems that actually \n     fail, a figure impossible to determine today.\n       But there is broad agreement that no matter how severe the \n     glitch eventually proves to be, a cadre of lawyers will find \n     reason to sue. ``There's too big of a jackpot here,'' \n     Marcoccio said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4368-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ``CINCO DE MAYO''\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and \nremember the importance of this day, known as ``Cinco de Mayo'' to the \nRepublic of Mexico and to millions of Mexican-Americans. Many in this \ncountry may not realize it, but after 40 years after achieving \nindependence from Spain, in 1862 Mexico was again subjugated to \nEuropean colonial domination, this time by the French. In that year, \nNapoleon sent a massive military force to Mexico to unseat President \nBenito Juarez to install a Hapsburg, Maximilian, as monarch of Mexico.\n  After capturing the port city of Veracruz, the French continued their \nmarch toward Mexico City. But the proud Mexicans did not give in \nwithout a fight. On this day in 1862, on a small battlefield near \nPuebla, a hastily assembled, ill-equipped Mexican force of \npredominantly Mestizo and Zapotec Indians bravely battled against a \nforce of Napoleon's renowned professional French Army. Against all \nodds, the Mexicans actually routed the French, and the ``Batalla de \nPuebla'' became a rallying cry and watershed event for eventual Mexican \nindependence.\n  The Mexicans who fought on that fateful day embodied the spirit of \nfreedom and patriotism that eventually drove Mexico to victory and \npaved the way for the economic and political advances that continue in \nthat nation to this day. It is in that same spirit that we in the \nUnited States, who have our own proud history of achieving \nindependence, celebrate and recognize the Batalla de Puebla and the \nsignificance of this day.\n  In addition to signifying a military victory, the Cinco de Mayo \nholiday, particularly as recognized in the United States, is also a \ncelebration of Mexican and Mexican-American culture and history. In \nmany cities throughout the U.S., this celebration centers around grand \ncultural fiestas that include traditional Mexican song, dance, and \ncuisine. Much as we recognize the Fourth of July not only as an act of \nindependence from Britain, but also as a cornerstone of our cultural \nidentity as Americans, many Mexican-Americans view Cinco de Mayo as a \ncommon cultural thread and history that they share.\n  Mr. President, I would like to join all Americans and all Mexicans in \nthis recognition of a very proud and colorful Mexican history. The \nMexicans who fought and died on that battlefield near Puebla in 1862 \nembodied the ideal to which all human beings, regardless background or \nstatus, aspire--the inalienable right of self-determination. Cinco de \nMayo is therefore a chance for communities on both sides of the border \nto remember how important a gift freedom is, how difficult it is to \nachieve, and how vigilant we must all be to preserve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4370-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO JEAN BROWN, UPON HER RETIREMENT AS HEAD OF LEADERSHIP \n                               GREENVILLE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, I voted in favor of the conference \nagreement on the FY 1998 Supplemental Appropriations Bill which funds \nthe necessary costs of ongoing U.S. military operations in Bosnia and \nSouthwest Asia and provides relief for those affected by the \ndevastating natural disasters which swept through the United States in \nrecent months.\n  Mr. President, frankly, I have to applaud the conferees on this bill. \nThey did not include in the conference bill much of the pork-barrel \nspending that was contained in the individual House and Senate bills. \nIn addition, the conferees wisely agreed to the House position to \noffset the domestic spending in\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nthis bill with other non-defense reductions, designating only the $2.8 \nbillion in must-pay defense funding as emergency spending. This defense \nand disaster supplemental appropriations bill will cost the American \ntaxpayer only $3.6 billion.\n  Now that is not to say, Mr. President, that this bill is pork-free. \nIn fact, this bill contains $52.3 million in low-priority, wasteful, \nand unnecessary spending. Even though the bill is a step in the right \ndirection, it still wastes millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  Eliminating pork-barrel spending is key to realizing the federal \nbudget surpluses that are projected for the next several years. Paying \ndown our national debt is vital to our nation's long-term economic \nhealth, and providing greater tax relief to all Americans will improve \ntheir quality of life and help sustain our robust economy. In addition, \na balanced federal budget coupled with a sustained strong economy will \nenable us to protect Social Security and Medicare for current and \nfuture generations.\n  If we do not curb pork-barrel spending, future anticipated budget \nsurpluses will not occur, and this historic opportunity to reduce our \nfederal debt will pass us by.\n  Mr. President, again, the amount of wasteful spending in this bill is \nless onerous than in most other bills I have seen. However, I still \nmust object strenuously to the inclusion of $52.3 million in earmarks \nand add-ons in conference agreement. We cannot afford pork-barrel \nspending, even in the amount contained in this bill, because the \ncumulative effect of each million wasted is a million dollars in debt \non which we must pay interest.\n  Some of the more egregious items earmarked in this bill include:\n  $14 million for a tree assistance program. This amount is an increase \nof $9.3 million and $5.3 million over what was proposed by the House \nand Senate respectively.\n  $1 million to conduct ``transit investment analysis'' in Hawaii.\n  $4 million for maple sugar producers.\n  $222,000 for boll weevil eradication loans.\n  $20 million for the implementation of the Capitol Square perimeter \nsecurity plan.\n  $7.5 million for repairs to the Capital Dome.\n  $1 million to increase the emergency preparedness of the State of \nAlabama.\n  $1.5 million for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record at \nthis point a list of the projects contained in this measure that meet \nat least one of the five objective criteria which I have used for many \nyears to evaluate spending bills.\n  On Friday, May 1, I sent a letter to the President urging him to use \nhis line-item veto authority to eliminate these low-priority, \nunnecessary, and wasteful programs from the bill.\n  Mr. President, even the relatively small amount of pork-barrel \nspending in this bill undercuts our efforts to keep the federal budget \nin balance and ensure we are spending the taxpayers dollars wisely, as \nthey have entrusted us to do. Pork-barrel spending robs funds from \nother worthwhile programs and prevents us from further reducing taxes \nand paying down our national debt.\n  In the upcoming FY 1999 appropriations season, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to ensure \nthat we do not waste taxpayers dollars on projects that are low-\npriority, wasteful, or unnecessary, and that have not been evaluated in \nthe appropriate merit-based review process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4370-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNITION OF BOB LENT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngood friend of mine and of the working men and women of Michigan, Bob \nLent. Bob is retiring at the end of June, 1998, from his position as \nDirector of UAW Region 1.\n  Bob Lent has been a UAW member for nearly 50 years, when he began \nworking in 1949 at the Dodge Main plant in Hamtramck, Michigan. After \nserving in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, Bob went to work as a \nmillwright apprentice and skilled tradesman at the Chrysler 9 Mile Road \nPress Plant. It was here, as a member of UAW Local 869, that he began \nhis rise into the leadership of the UAW. He served in a number of \nleadership positions in Local 869, including alternative chief steward, \ntrustee chairman, vice president and president. From here he was \nappointed to the Region 1B staff, where he rose to the position of \nassistant director in 1982. In 1983, Bob was elected Regional Director \nat the UAW's 27th Constitutional Convention in Dallas, Texas.\n  Bob is something of a legend in labor circles for his commitment to \nthe working men and women of Region 1. But he is almost equally well-\nknown for his remarkable ability to remember the most minute details of \nevents that happened years before. Of course, in his line of work, a \nmemory like that can be an incredible asset to bring to the bargaining \ntable. But it can also be the source of amusement, and occasionally \nembarrassment, when Bob relates who said what to whom at a dinner which \ntook place ten or fifteen years ago.\n  Knowing Bob as I do, I have no doubt that retirement will not slow \nhim down, and that he will continue to serve his community in a number \nof ways. I am sure that his wife, Earline, will keep him at least as \nbusy as his commitments to the United Way of Pontiac-Oakland County, \nthe Detroit-area United Foundation, the NAACP and the Wayne State \nUniversity Labor Advisory Committee. And I also know that the men and \nwomen of the UAW can count on Bob to continue to stand with them in \ntheir ongoing efforts on behalf of the working people of our nation.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues join me in extending \ncongratulations and best wishes to Bob Lent, Director of UAW Region 1, \non the occasion of his retirement. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4371-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO ANNIE MALONE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, every year in St. Louis, Missouri, \nMay Day is especially important in paying tribute to what can be \nachieved through collective action. This year, the Annie Malone \nChildren and Family Service Center, as well as, the St. Louis African \nAmerican community will celebrate May Day on May 17. The first of these \ncelebrations occurred more than eighty years ago and since that time \nthey have continually grown. The celebration serves as a reminder of \nall that has been endured and the prosperity that it now reflects.\n  Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center began its service \nmore than 100 years ago. Its predecessor was the St. Louis Colored \nOrphans' Home and was established in 1888 by a group of prominent women \nconcerned about the welfare of neglected and orphaned children. The \npresident of the Board of Directors from 1919 to 1943 was Annie Malone. \nIn honor of her loyalty and dedication to the goals of the institution, \nit was renamed for her in 1946. Through the years, the Center has \ncontinued to expand its services and programs to meet the needs of a \nchanging society, but the mission, ``to improve the quality of life for \nchildren, families, and the community utilizing education, social \nservices, and developing positive values and self esteem,'' has \nremained the same.\n  Annie M's has several programs including residential treatment, \ntherapeutic services/family crisis center and its evaluation and \ndiagnostic services. The programs have helped to make the quality of \nlife more complete, fulfilling and successful for African Americans in \nthe St. Louis Community. I salute the contributions made by Annie M's \nbeneficial programs and join the community in paying tribute to the \nwoman that helped in their growth and success, Annie Malone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4371-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4371-S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 30th the people of Israel \ncelebrated their nation's fiftieth anniversary and people around the \nworld commemorated the realization of a dream of a Jewish state first \nenvisioned by Theodor Herzl in 1897. Today, with characteristic \ncourage, intelligence and determination, Israelis face the many \nchallenges that lie ahead.\n  With the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the ethnic violence \nthat has rocked parts of Europe and Africa,\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nthe term ``nation building'' has taken on new significance as we near \nthe end of the millennium. National borders that were static during the \nCold War have changed and in some countries the institutions necessary \nfor a functioning government have crumbled. We need only look as far as \nIsrael to realize what can be accomplished with a vision and the will \nto fulfill it.\n  In 1948, 600,000 Jews emerged from the Holocaust to forge a nation \ncommitted to the ideals of democracy and the prosperity of its people. \nHaving survived the genocide that has since been burned into the \nworld's collective memory, the founders of the Jewish state embarked on \na mission to unite a people speaking over 100 languages and dispersed \nfor 2,000 years in 140 countries. At the time it seemed like an \nimpossible challenge, yet today it is a reality that represents one of \nthe greatest, most breathtaking accomplishments of this century.\n  The founders of Israel did not recognize the obstacles before them as \nlimitations but as opportunities. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion used \nto say that a man who does not believe in miracles is not a realistic \nperson. Yet, not even he imagined what could be accomplished in just 50 \nyears.\n  Despite the toll taken by six wars and innumerable terrorist attacks, \ndespite the difficulties inherent in resurrecting an ancient language \nand absorbing 2.6 million immigrants, the people of Israel have created \na nation at the forefront of technology, industry, art and academics. \nThey have created a nation that embodies democratic principles and \npractices. They have served as a staunch ally of the United States in \nthe most dangerous region of the world.\n  On May 15, 1948, when President Truman first declared our nation's \nsupport for the free state of Israel, I was eight years old. On that \nday my father sat me down and, with great emotion, told me what a \nhistoric event it was, how important it was to Jews around the world \nwho were struggling to rebuild their lives, reaffirm their identity and \nheal their communities after years of suffering. His words rang true \nand they left a lasting impression.\n  Since then I have traveled to Israel many times. I have had the \nprivilege to know as friends former Prime Ministers Rabin and Perez, \ntwo extraordinary courageous leaders. I have seen how the Jewish people \nhave never shied away from adversity, but have faced it fearlessly and \nwith a commitment to overcome. But despite all they have accomplished, \nmuch work remains. Many of us will not be here to mark Israel's 100th \nanniversary. I fervently hope, however, that those who are here to \ncelebrate will be able to recount to their own children and their \ngrandchildren the events that led to a lasting peace for all the \ncitizens of this small but powerful nation.\n  Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the people of Israel and \nreaffirm the bond that President Truman first established in \n1948.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4371-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE CHARLES C. BROWN, JR.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the outgoing \nchair of the YMCA of the USA National Board of Public Policy Committee \nand a fellow Pennsylvanian, Judge Charles C. Brown, Jr.\n  For the past three years, Judge Brown has steered the public policy \ninitiatives of the YMCA of the USA through good and bad times. As a \nresult, the YMCA of the USA now enjoys a strong and credible standing \nin the public policy arena. Under Judge Brown's leadership, the YMCA \nhas earned the respect of other nonprofit organizations, administration \nofficials, senators, and congressmen alike. Sadly, this month Judge \nBrown will step down as chair of the YMCA of the USA National Board of \nPublic Policy Committee.\n  During his tenure as chairman, Judge Brown was instrumental in \nshaping a new direction for the YMCA movement. The quintessential \nprofessional and team builder, the Judge--as he is respectfully called \nby his colleagues--was never satisfied to let the nation's largest \nyouth-serving organization remain on the sidelines of public policy \nadvocacy. Through Judge Brown's vision and guidance, the YMCA of the \nUSA developed legislation which was introduced in Congress to expand \nyouth development programs; held three national conferences to educate \npolicy makers on the role and impact of YMCA programs; took the lead in \ncoordinating a national coalition to support school-age child care \nprovided by nonprofit organizations like the YMCA; helped shape and \ndirect national legislation on juvenile justice; and became a leading \nnational resource on the state of America's children, youth and \nfamilies. Although one of these achievements would have been impressive \nin and of itself, the Judge insisted on a comprehensive, integrated \nadvocacy role for the YMCA. For these and many other reasons, Judge \nBrown's leadership will be sincerely missed by the YMCA of the USA \nNational Board of Directors.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important to recognize Judge Charles \nC. Brown's contributions to one of the nation's oldest and most \nrespected organizations, the YMCA. As he prepares to pass the reigns of \nleadership, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's \nbest wishes for continued success to Judge Brown and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4372-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATIONS TO THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my \ncongratulations, on the occasion of the Centennial of the oldest social \nwork training program in the nation, to the Columbia University School \nof Social Work. Evolving from a summer program organized by the Charity \nOrganization in New York, the School of Social Work has a long history \nof pioneering research, informed advocacy, and exceptional professional \ntraining.\n  It is a remarkable accomplishment that social workers have played key \nroles in every major social reform movement, from settlement houses to \nlabor reform, to the New Deal, to civil rights and voter registration. \nMany of the things we take for granted today--Social Security, child-\nlabor laws, the minimum wage, the 40-hour work week, Medicare--came \nabout because social workers saw injustice, acted, and inspired others.\n  Throughout the century, Columbia's faculty, students, and alumni have \nworked tirelessly to address both the causes and symptoms of our most \npressing social problems. National movements, such as the White House \nConference on Children and the National Urban League, have emerged from \nprojects undertaken by the School's faculty and administrators in \ncooperation with professional and community organizations. The entire \nnation has benefited from the research and work of people such as \nEveline Burns (Social Security); Mitchell I. Ginsberg (Head Start); \nRichard Cloward (welfare rights and voter registration); Alfred Kahn \nand Sheila B. Kamerman (cross-national studies of social services); and \nDavid Fanshel (children in foster care).\n  As the School, and indeed the social profession, move into their \nsecond centuries, they will be challenged to respond to social change, \nnew social problems, family change, and evolving societal commitments. \nNow more than ever, we will need well-trained and dedicated social \nworkers to work with troubled children and families, organize \ncommunities for change, conduct cutting-edge research, administer \nsocial programs, and alleviate society's most intractable problems.\n  It is with appreciation and admiration that I extend my best wishes \nto the Columbia University School of Social Work on its Centennial and \nlook forward to its future activity and achievement. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4372-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4372-S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF FAMILIES FOR HOME EDUCATION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in observance of Home Education Week, \nMay 3-9, I rise to pay tribute to the eight regions of Families for \nHome Education (FHE), in my home State of Missouri, for their \nexcellence and continuing efforts to better the home education system. \nI have always recognized the importance of family involvement in the \neducation of our youth and applaud the efforts of home educators to \nmake a difference in the lives of their families.\n  In today's complex society it is especially significant to have \nguidance in\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\nthe development of our children and their continuing education. Through \nadult mentors, home schoolers develop, not only a close relationship \nwith their families, but also acquire the much needed interpersonal \nskills through involvement in civic and community organizations in form \nof apprenticeship opportunities.\n  The support home schooling receives helps to cultivate its success \nthrough family participation in our communities. My home State of \nMissouri especially relishes the high quality of home education and the \nstrong family values it teaches. I commend the energies of FHE and the \nfamilies that help make it possible. I wish FHE continued success and \ngrowth in future years. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4372-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Sirmalis, Commander of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center \n(NUWC) in Newport, Rhode Island, is receiving the Distinguished \nExecutive Award. Vice President Gore will take part in this ceremony.\n  Having worked with John Sirmalis for many years, I can say with \ncertainty that he is a most worthy recipient of this prestigious award. \nDr. Sirmalis has served our nation and our Navy admirably during a \ndistinguished career. Widely recognized as the Navy's foremost \nauthority on undersea weapons systems, Dr. Sirmalis has helped bring \nabout improvements in methodologies for developing and testing undersea \nwarfare (USW) systems and components. In particular, John has \nimplemented a program to identify submarine technology opportunities \nfor the year 2010, leading the Navy to shift its focus from traditional \nantisubmarine warfare to find responses to new and more complex \nmilitary threats.\n  Dr. Sirmalis' outstanding work at NUWC/Newport has contributed to the \nevolution of a facility that is widely recognized as a center of \nexcellence within the Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD). NUWC \nhas consistently sustained a high level of technical productivity, as \nit has become a leader in the use of commercial-off-the-shelf \ncomponents and open system architecture. These attributes are today \nmore important than ever at a Defense Department that is greatly \nconstrained by tight budgets.\n  It was certainly no surprise to me that during the defense base \nrealignment and closure (BRAC) process, NUWC/Newport was designated one \nof the Navy's four principal research ``mega-centers.'' I look forward \nto NUWC/Newport continuing to maintain its important contribution to \nour national security under the leadership of Dr. Sirmalis. So my \nheartiest congratulations to John Sirmalis on receiving the \nDistinguished Executive Award. All Americans are well-served by the \noutstanding performance of this genuine public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4373-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HIGHER EDUCATION REPORTING RELIEF ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have become a \ncosponsor of S. 1724, the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. As \nmany of my colleagues know, this bill would repeal the reporting \nrequirements imposed on colleges and universities when Congress enacted \nthe HOPE scholarships and the Lifetime Learning Tax credit last year.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contained many important provisions \nfor American families, particularly in the area of education. As a part \nof this bill, Congress created several new initiatives to make college \nand higher education more affordable for students throughout our \ncountry. The Hope and Opportunity for Postsecondary Education (HOPE) \nscholarship provides students with a 100% tax credit for up to $1,000 \nof their tuition costs for higher education and a 50% credit for the \nnext $1,000 spent on their tuition. This credit can be claimed by the \nstudent, their spouse, or parents if they are still a dependent. \nAnother program created by Congress to ease the financial burden of \nhigher education for our working families is the Lifetime Learning Tax \nCredit.\n  Both of these programs are helping make college and postsecondary \neducation more affordable. Unfortunately, when Congress created these \nnew education programs, we inadvertently levied very costly and \nburdensome reporting requirements on our educational institutions. \nBeginning in the 1998 tax year, schools are required to compile and \nissue annual reports on their students for the Internal Revenue \nServices. Under the new law, schools are now responsible for providing \ndetailed information on all their students, including name, address, \nSocial Security number, attendance records, academic information, \ntuition data, along with the amount of qualified student aid.\n  Preliminary studies indicate that the cost to our nation's \nuniversities and colleges to comply with the new reporting requirements \nwill range from $125 million to $150 million for just the first year. \nThe three colleges in my home state of Arizona expect that this new \nrequirement will cost them approximately $400,000 to begin the \nreporting system, which will turn into an annual expense of $200,000 \nfor each of the institutions.\n  This reporting requirement is costly and counterproductive. At a time \nwhen Congress and the Federal government are trying to make college \naffordable, contain costs, and make higher education more accessible to \nmillions of students, we are subjecting schools to excessive and \nunnecessary reporting requirements. According to the Commission on the \nCost of Higher Education, a primary factor contributing to escalating \ntuition costs is excessive government regulation and reporting \nrequirements.\n  This is why I am cosponsoring Senator Collins' bill, the Higher \nEducation Reporting Relief Act, which repeals the requirement for \nschools to report personal information on their students to the IRS. \nInstead, the new HOPE scholarships and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit \nwill be treated like all other existing tax credits. The individual \ntaxpayer will be responsible for providing the IRS with the pertinent \ninformation on their tax returns and maintaining appropriate records to \nsubstantiate their claims.\n  This important piece of legislation prevents the limited resources of \nour colleges and universities from being wasted on unneccesary \nadministrative costs and allows them to focus on our students and their \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4373-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4373-S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DANIEL SMITH\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDaniel Smith, for his unyielding support for and commitment to the \nNortheast Dairy Compact. With the help of Dan Smith the Dairy Compact \nhas become an instrument of balance that is critical to the needs of \nboth farmers and consumers in the New England region, as well as a \nmodel of success for the rest of the country.\n  A carpenter by trade, Dan Smith, for more than ten years unselfishly \ncommitted himself to the crafting and building of the Northeast Dairy \nCompact Commission. Dan's dedication to the survival of New England's \nsmall farms and his desire to finish the job has benefited all those \nwho value the strong agricultural communities in New England. With a \nbachelors degree from Dartmouth College and a law degree from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, Dan served as law clerk to the Honorable \nFrederic W. Allen, Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. As legal \ncounsel for the Vermont State Legislature, Dan carefully drafted the \nDairy Compact legislation. He then worked as Executive Director for \nDairy Compact Committee, nurturing the Compact legislation through each \nof the six New England state legislatures, resulting in overwhelming \nsupport in each of the states. After six years of traveling throughout \nNew England educating legislatures and building support for the \nCompact, Dan turned his efforts to Washington, D.C. and to the \nratification of the Northeast Dairy Compact by the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, few initiatives in my memory have sparked such a \nvigorous policy debate as the Dairy Compact. Dan worked closely with me \nand my staff to develop and execute the many strategies that helped \npass the Compact. The passage of the Compact was a long shot in the \nminds of many, but I knew that with Dan Smith's commitment we would \nsucceed. I am proud to\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\nhave sponsored the Compact on behalf of all my colleagues from the New \nEngland delegation. Adoption of the Compact could not have happened in \nCongress without the help of Dan Smith, and without the years of \ndedicated work from a veritable army of Compact supporters throughout \nNew England.\n  This tribute reflects that with the success of the Dairy Compact we \nrecognize the commitment to and importance of our dairy farmers. The \nDairy Compact holds great promise for the New England region to \npreserve the viability of agriculture and to protect a special way of \nlife\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4373-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COUDERSPORT, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th \nanniversary of Coudersport, PA. Today, I rise to discuss the \nestablishment, growth, and achievements of this town.\n  Coudersport was named for Mr. Coudere, a European investor in the \nCeres Land Company which owned 175,000 acres in this area of \nPennsylvania. Established in 1848, the town had only 48 buildings and \nabout 200 residents. After it was approved as the seat of the Potter \nCounty government, the village slowly grew. Just before the Civil War, \nCoudersport's population nearly doubled. Anti-slavery sentiment ran \nstrong in this town. Residents held fundraisers to benefit abolitionist \ncauses. Reminders of the town's rich history still stand. Six of the \noriginal 48 buildings are still inhabited. Today, the population of \nCoudersport stands at 2,854, and it is still the hub of Potter County. \nAlthough Coudersport has changed with the times, it never lost its \nsmall town charm.\n  Mr. President, the people of this town are proud of their history and \ntheir traditions. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nCoudersport on its 150th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4374-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INNOVATION AND GLOBAL LEADERSHIP\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, we talk a lot around here about \ninnovation, competitiveness and global leadership. The vast majority of \nus agree that these values are important and worthy of concern.\n  Those of us who see the inherent limitations of government know that \npromoting innovation and U.S. economic competitiveness is largely about \ngetting government out of the way and letting the free market work its \nwill.\n  Unfortunately, playing out today is yet another episode of government \ndoing things to business rather than getting out of the way. Microsoft \nCorporation, one of America's most successful companies, has come under \nattack by the Clinton Justice Department at the urging of its \ncompetitors.\n  The Justice Department's newly aggressive Antitrust Division is \nwaging a slick, media-intensive antitrust campaign against Microsoft. \nThe Justice Department claims to be acting in the name of promoting \ncompetition despite the fact that the computer industry is the most \ndynamic, open and competitive business sector the U.S. has ever \nwitnessed. Prices are falling, innovation is thriving and consumers are \nempowered as never before.\n  But in their wisdom, Clinton antitrust lawyers and bureaucrats have \ndecided that the heavy hand of government will improve innovation and \nhelp consumers.\n  Frankly, I am fearful that this is the government's first attempt to \nbegin regulating America's high tech industry. In my opinion, this \nwould be a disaster.\n  Despite the artful and high-minded rhetoric coming from Clinton \nAntitrust lawyers and their few industry cheerleaders, it is \ninconceivable to me that government regulation will improve innovation \nand consumer welfare.\n  And it is clear that the computer industry agrees. On April 30, 1998, \nfor example, twenty-six computer companies wrote to Joel Klein, the \nAssistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, expressing their \n``strongest possible concern'' about the effect on the U.S. economy of \nthe government's campaign against Microsoft. The companies who signed \nthe letter ranged from such industry leaders as Intel Corporation, \nCompaq Computer Corporation and Dell Computer Corporation, to smaller \ncompanies such as Insight Enterprises, Inc. of Tempe, Arizona and \nElsinore Technologies, Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina.\n  I am concerned that, in addition to threatening the freedom to \ninnovate and consumer choice, this aggressive pursuit of Microsoft may \nthreaten U.S. global leadership in the software and computer industry. \nWhen Congress crafted the antitrust laws, the world was a different \nplace. Most markets were not global. Capital was not mobile. Our focus \nwas largely domestic. In today's economy we must concern ourselves with \nthe global implications of policy decisions.\n  I respect that within clear and narrow limits, basic antitrust laws \nare necessary to preserve free markets. But from where I sit, the track \nrecord of the Antitrust Division is hardly stellar.\n  For example, in 1969 the Justice Department opened a case against IBM \nthat lasted 13 years. But by the time the government dropped the case, \nIBM had experienced a serious erosion of its market share at the hands \nof new computer startup companies, including--ironically--Microsoft. \nThe marketplace and consumers had their say, not government.\n  Mr. President, is this an outcome we want for Microsoft? Is the idea \nto sap Microsoft's vitality through litigation so that its competitors, \nwhether domestic or foreign can play catch-up?\n  Another case involved the Schwinn Bicycle Company. Once a proud and \nsuccessful American manufacturer of bicycles, it found itself the \nsubject of an antitrust prosecution in 1967. The case opened the door \nto foreign companies, and a weakened Schwinn ultimately declared \nbankruptcy in 1992. Again, is this the model for Microsoft?\n  Business historian Alfred D. Chandler attributes an antitrust consent \ndecree against RCA as precipitating the decline of the U.S. electronics \nindustry. The subsequent rise of the Japanese electronics industry is \nnow well known.\n  The push to regulate the software industry under the guise of \nantitrust law should concern us all. It is government regulation by any \nother name; and like the cases above, will prove shortsighted. Who can \ntake comfort in the thought of a federal judge deciding which features \nwill go into software products? We have tried this before and no one \nshould welcome a repeat.\n  America is the leader in software and computer innovation because \ngovernment has stayed out of the way. The creative process and \ninnovative genius marked by the software industry is fragile. The heavy \nhand of government regulation, whether direct or at the hands of \nantitrust lawyers and judges, threatens the innovations of tomorrow and \nthe U.S. global leadership of today.\n  Mr. President, somewhere today, there is a 22 year old, working in \nhis garage on a new product. Ten years from now--he or she may be \nAmerica's richest individual. We don't know. But what I do know is that \nI don't want to deny him or her the right to be creative. To start a \ncompany and to give the big companies a run for their money. But if we \ngo down the road of regulating this industry, I am certain that we will \ncall to a close a very prosperous era for the U.S. I don't think we \nwant our vibrant economy washed away because some people at the Justice \nDepartment had nothing else better to do with their time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4374-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4374-S4375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n``WE THE PEOPLE . . .

John Drisko, the Congressional District \nCoordinator, and Maine State Coordinator Pam Beal also each have \ncontributed a great deal of time and effort to help Old Orchard Beach \nHigh's team.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that these students as well as others who \ncompeted from across Maine have increased their knowledge on the topic \nof our nation's governing document, the Constitution. One of the most \ncritical components of a democracy is a knowledgeable citizenry. If our \nyoung people are to grow up to fully participate in their government, \nthey must have a sound understanding of both the rights and \nresponsibilities that come with citizenship in this great country.\n  This program, ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution'', is one innovative way in which we can help provide that \nunderstanding. Students, in a simulated Congressional hearing, answer \nquestions, make arguments and defend positions on a variety of \ncontemporary and historical constitutional issues. I am proud that my \nstaff in Maine has been involved in this program over the years.\n  Again, I am pleased to congratulate the students of Old Orchard Beach \nHigh School.

Dr. Lloyd Pelfrey has been \nPresident of Central Christian College of the Bible (CCCB) in Moberly, \nMissouri, for the past twenty-five years. Dr. Pelfrey will be honored \nthis year at the College's Commencement exercise this coming May 8.\n  CCCB first opened its doors in September of 1957. Lloyd started \nteaching at CCCB the same day it opened. He has held several positions \nincluding Professor of Old Testament, Academic Dean, Dean of Faculty, \nExecutive President, Acting President and President. As the fourth \nPresident in the history of the school, he has served the longest of \nany other President of the College. He became an ordained minister in \n1953 and co-founded the Missouri Christian Convention and the Missouri \nOperation for Vigourous Evangelism (MOVE), an organization which \nestablishes new churches in Missouri. Lloyd serves on the National \ncommittee of the North American Christian Convention.\n  During his tenure at CCCB, Lloyd boasted several accomplishments \nincluding construction of the Memorial Building, increased awareness of \nthe need for a Development Department as an integral part of the \ncollege, development of an Admissions Department, accreditation of the \ncollege with Accrediting Association of Bible College, first \nfundraising banquet with Paul Harvey as speaker and the implementation \nof a major capital campaign.\n  Commending Dr. Pelfrey for his many years of service to CCCB, I am \nglad to say that the State of Missouri is enriched with his wisdom and \nleadership.

Mr. President, I spent much of the recent recess \ntalking to constituents in my state about drug problems. It is clear to \nme after a field hearing, numerous town meetings, and many \nconversations that the public is deeply concerned about the drug issue. \nThis impression is confirmed by recent pools. Again and again, the \npublic have indicted an abiding concern about the presence of drugs in \nour society. Parents, community leaders, and young people have \nrepeatedly indicated that the availability and use of illegal drugs is \namong the most important issues affecting them. They expect the \ngovernment to help them in fighting back. They expect our policies and \nprograms to support community efforts to keep drugs off the streets, \nout of our schools, and away from our kids. But what do they find?\n  I am sorry to say that the Clinton Administration is simply not \nmaking a convincing case that it is serious about the war on drugs. If \nI had doubts about this before, events of the last several days have \nremoved them. I learned during recess that the Administration was \nplanning to endorse needle exchange programs. I found it hard to \nbelieve that this could be true, but I learned otherwise. Indeed, on 20 \nApril, Donna Shalala, the HHS Secretary, issued a statement saying that \nneedle exchange programs were a good thing. That they stopped the \nspread of AIDS and did not encourage drug use. She encouraged \ncommunities to embark on programs giving needles to drug addicts. She \ndid not go so far as to say that the Administration would back up this \ndetermination with federal dollars--a small blessing. But she has now \nput the authority of the Administration behind this idea. Exactly what \nis this idea? It is startling simple: The Administration has announced \nthat it will now facilitate and promote others to facilitate making \ndrug paraphernalia available to drug addicts in our communities.\n  It will now use the voice of the Federal Government to facilitate \ndrug use. What next, handing out the drugs themselves to addicts?\n  This is voodoo science backing up Cheech and Chong drug policy. It is \nmaking the federal government a Head Shop.\n  How does the Administration justify such a decision? It hides its \nmove behind junk science. Secretary Shalala's argument is ``The science \nmade me do it.'' At best, this is a half-truth. While there is science, \nof a sort, that claims that needle exchange programs work, there is no \nconsensus science that establishes this as remotely the case. Still, we \nare being asked to endorse this vast experiment on the public based on \na trust-me argument. This is not acceptable. It is irresponsible and \nrisky.\n  In order to understand what is at issue here, let me start at the \nbeginning. One of the most effective delivery systems for illegal drugs \nis intravenous injection using needles. This is one of the most common \nmethods for taking heroin and it also can be used in taking cocaine and \nmethamphetamine. The addict uses injection because it means getting \nhigh quicker. The whole purpose of using needles is to facilitate drug \nuse. Major addiction, which is risky business all by itself, also often \nleads to other, destructive behaviors. One of these is sharing the \nneedles used for injection.\n  Basically, what this means is that a number of addicts pass around or \nget together and share the same needle for numerous injections. In the \nage of AIDS, this means that if any of the sharing addicts has HIV or \nAIDS, anyone who shares the needle is at great risk of infection. Now, \naddicts already know this. It is not a secret. There are also quick and \neasy ways to disinfect these needles. Addicts know these too. They are \nnot secrets here either.\n  Despite this, addicts often don't bother with these easy steps. They \ndon't bother even though they can do them with commonly available \ndisinfectants in the comfort of their own preferred environment for \ninjecting. Addicts are not the most rational of people when it comes to \nlife decisions. Their lives are built around and based upon upon risky \nbehavior. Our decisions on policy, however, should not be so cavalier.\n  Now we come to the logic of needle exchange. The argument is, that a \nsignificant, or overwhelming proportion of HIV-positive cases are the \nresult of using infected needles shared among addicts. Arriving at this \nconclusion, the next step in the logic is that stopping the use of \ninfected needles will stop the spread of HIV and AIDS. Having reached \nthis point, the next step is to argue that we must, therefore, keep \naddicts for sharing dirty needles. And now, in this breathless chain of \nargument, we arrive at this conclusion: To ensure that drug-using \naddicts only use safe needles, we, that is the government using public \nmoney or some similar deep-pocket institution, must hand out clean \nneedles to addicts on demand.\n  This is what the Secretary of Health and Human Services has now \nendorsed. But there is more to this story.\n  Let us start again at the beginning. Drug addicts, particularly \nheroin users, depend upon syringes as the best vehicle for \nadministering their drug of choice. This means that, for addicts, \nneedles are essential drug paraphernalia. Just like crack pipes or \nother devices used to administer the drug, needles are part of the \nnecessary equipment.\n  During our last drug epidemic, one of the things that we learned we \nneeded to do was to close the many ``Head Shops'' that specialized in \nselling drug equipment. We realized that pushing drug paraphernalia, \nmaking the equipment for drug use readily available, fostered drug use. \nIt encouraged a climate of use. It was an indirect way for advertising \ndrug use. Most states passed laws to prohibit the sale of drug \nparaphernalia.\n  Many States included needles as part of this. Doing so was one of the \nthings that helped us stop the drug epidemic. It helped us establish \nwith kids that consistent no-use message that is essential if we are to \nkeep drugs off our streets and out of our schools. Now, enter needle \nexchange.\n  The Congress and most of the public have long opposed needle \nexchange. This is not because anybody wants to promote the spread of \nAIDS. Let's get that canard out of the way right up front. The concern \nis for whether or not handing out drug paraphernalia promotes drug use. \nOur past experience says yes, so it is a reasonable assumption that \ndoing so in the present will cause a similar problem. Hence the \nopposition in many quarters to handing out needles. Thus, also part two \nof Secretary Shalala's announcement: Her claim that not only do needle \nexchanges stop AIDS, handing out needles will not, in her view, \nencourage drug use. Really?\n  Just how do we know this? Just how do we know that handing our \nneedles will also stop AIDS? The short answer is, we do not know any \nsuch thing.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n  The response from HHS, from an anonymous source I might add, and from \nAIDS activists is that the science tells us so. As proof they quote in \nthe HHS press release from Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, to the effect that needle exchanges can help. \nWell, so can chicken soup, but this is not the issue and is not what \nthe law calls for.\n  Being concerned about issues of public policy and public health, the \nCongress has been concerned not to be stampeded into irresponsible \npolicies.\n  In this light, it included specific guidance in law on using public \nmoney or government support for needle exchange. The intent was fairly \nclear: No money, no support. Full stop. It did provide for an exception \nif the science conclusively showed that needle exchange programs \nstopped AIDS and did not encourage use. That is a fairly high standard. \nAnd it should be. Otherwise, what we are doing is experimenting on the \npublic, betting on a hope that things will turn out right. This may be \na good strategy at the race track or at the roulette table, but it has \nno place in major policy.\n  Yet, this casino mentality is what the Secretary of HHS has now \nproclaimed. And she is gambling with the public health. Secretary \nShalala has announced that, ``a meticulous scientific review has now \nproven that needle exchange programs can reduce the transmission of HIV \n* * * without losing ground in the battle against illegal drugs.''\n  In doing this, the chief health official of the country has endorsed \na policy that is reckless and irresponsible. And she has done so on \nclaims about scientific support for her position that is, at best, \ninconclusive. At the worst, science contradicts her arguments flatly. \nIn either case, this is poor ground upon which to base such a \nsignificant change in public policy.\n  As Dr. James Curtis notes in an oped piece in the New York Times of \n23 April, the idea of handing out needles to stop AIDS is ``simplistic \nnonsense that stands common sense on its head.'' Dr. Curtis, a \nprofessor of psychiatry at Colombia University and the director of \npsychiatry at Harlem Hospital, goes further. ``For the past 10 years,'' \nhe writes, ``as a black psychiatrist specializing in addiction, I have \nwarned about the dangers of needle-exchange policies, which hurt not \nonly individual addicts but also poor and minority communities.''\n  The lack or contradictory nature of the science referred to by \nSecretary Shalala is also laid bare by Dr. David Murray of the \nStatistical Assessment Service. In an oped in the Wall Street Journal \nof 22 April, he notes just how thin the science is and yet how \nactivists try to skip over this fact.\n  Even the drug czar opposed this decision. Thus, there is not even \nconsensus within the administration on this policy. The reason for this \nlack of agreement is based on the fact that the science is not there to \nsupport the position. And the law is clear. It does not say the science \nmust show that such programs ``might reduce'', or ``can reduce''. What \nit says is the science must show that they in fact do reduce AIDS and \ndo not increase the chances for promoting illegal drug use. Even \nSecretary Shalala's press release hedges this with a ``can reduce'' \ncomment.\n  The only bright spot in the Secretary's announcement, and that light \nis a pretty dim bulb, is that no federal money will be used to support \nthis policy. But this is a dodge. Even the advocates for exchange \nprograms recognize it as such. This statement puts the authority of the \nadministration behind this program.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally \ntaking action to restructure the IRS. As my colleagues know, the IRS \nsupports operations of the Federal Government by collecting \napproximately $1.5 trillion in taxes each year. With roughly 102,000 \nemployees and a budget of $7.8 billion, the IRS has a wide variety of \nprograms designed to help taxpayers understand and meet their Federal \ntax obligations.\n  Given the highly publicized criticism of the agency, let me begin by \nmaking a few comments relating to staff of the IRS. I am confident that \nthe majority of the staff at the IRS, whose job it is to enforce \nfederal tax laws, are diligent and competent in their responsibilities. \nYet, we need to ensure that this professional staff lives up to a \nstrict code of conduct, especially the supervisors and the regional \ndirectors. We must demand that taxpayer complaints about unfair \ntreatment are promptly heard and that abusive IRS employees are dealt \nwith appropriately.\n  No one disagrees that serious reform is needed at the IRS. We in \nCongress also need to recognize that the complexity of the tax code and \nthe constant changes by Congress add to the taxpayer burden and \ncompound the difficulty of administering the laws we enact.\n  The Senate Finance Committee hearings last week again highlighted \nserious allegations of abuse by the agency. I was pleased that IRS \nCommissioner Charles Rossotti raised an important issue that deserves \nCongressional attention--that of tax evasion. Commissioner Rossotti \ndisclosed that the tax gap, or the amount that taxpayers owe to the \nFederal Government but fail to pay, is $195 billion annually. Previous \nestimates indicated that the figure was between $70 billion to $140 \nbillion. I agree with many of my colleagues that we must work together \nto conduct a review of ``willful non-compliance.'' We also need to \nmaintain public confidence in the ability of the IRS to fight tax \nevasion. This is one example among a host of serious issues that should \nbe a part of IRS reform.\n  I am presently working with members of the Finance Committee to \naddress an issue which involved IRS non-compliance with provisions of \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  Late last year, I was contacted by an IRS compliance officer who \ndescribed his efforts to ensure proper enforcement by the IRS of the \nForeign Investors Real Property Tax Act. After being assigned in 1990 \nto a special IRS project involving tax compliance of non-resident \naliens, the compliance officer identified an internal IRS recordkeeping \nproblem at the Philadelphia center, which hinders IRS collection and \nenforcement efforts. The compliance officer tried to resolve the matter \nusing the processes available to him in the IRS, but was unsuccessful. \nThis particular problem stems from the absence of an independent \nprocess for redress or complaint at the IRS. This recordkeeping failure \nprevents proper tax assessment and collection, and has resulted in a \nsignificant revenue loss. If these facts are correct, and the revenue \nloss is so great, then personnel actions should be considered for those \nwho are responsible.\n  I raise this issue to illustrate the point that we need greater \noversight of the agency. As we work to improve service and \nresponsiveness to taxpayers, we must also strive for an IRS that more \neffectively administers the tax laws.\n  Mr. President, again, I am pleased that the Senate is moving forward \non this critical issue. We must find a way to achieve an effective \nenforcement agency while ensuring that IRS powers are used responsibly. \nI believe that the legislation we are considering will move us in this \ndirection.\n  The bill incorporates many of the recommendations of the National \nCommission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service and is \ndesigned to enhance taxpayer rights and make the IRS more customer-\nfriendly. I look forward to the debate in the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/05/senate-section/article/S4377-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
