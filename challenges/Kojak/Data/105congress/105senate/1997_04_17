Often we hear people who have escaped from some \naccident or some life-threatening illness say, ``God must have some \nreason for saving my life.

May all of us be no less grateful for life or no less \nintentional in living out the special purpose You have for us.\n  Suddenly, we feel differently about the relationships and \nresponsibilities of the day ahead. You have plans for us and we don't \nwant to miss them. There are things You have appointed us to do and if \nwe don't do them, they will not be done. Help us not to procrastinate \nby putting off to the day after tomorrow what needs to be done today.\n  Lord, fill us with Your spirit and give us an enthusiastic, positive \nattitude for today. Help us to express delight in the people of our \nlives. They have enough burdens to carry; may we not be one of them. We \ncan choose whether we will drag our feet today or walk with a spring in \nour step because You are the unseen, but loyal Friend who holds our \nhands.

Mr. President, this time of year is budget time. Since \nit is budget time, it is a time when the Senate Chamber has been filled \nwith speeches about budgets, debt, the economy, taxes, and all the rest \nof the subjects that have to do with our joint effort--joint, meaning \nMembers of both parties, Members of both Houses, Members of both \nbranches, the executive as well as the legislative--to achieve a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. That is a very laudable goal, one \nthat has been put off for too long. I am delighted to be here \nrepresenting the State of Utah as the Congress launches itself in this \neffort.\n  However, as I have listened to these speeches on both sides of the \naisle, it has occurred to me that there is more political sloganeering \nthan analytical analysis that leads toward a better understanding of \nthe problems we face. Therefore, I take the floor today in an effort to \nlay out what I think is a clear understanding of where we are and what \nwe are looking at with respect to the budget, our deficit, and our \nfuture.\n  One of Washington's most thoughtful and capable political reporters, \nDavid Broder, did a column on this subject in which he addressed the \nissue of whether or not we should have tax cuts in the middle of the \ndebate over balancing the budget. He coined a magnificently succinct \nphrase. He lauded those who said we must put off tax cuts until the \nbudget is balanced, stating it this way: ``In other words, eat your \nspinach before you get the dessert.''\n  It is a great phrase and worthy of Mr. Broder's skill as a \njournalist. It also happens to be wrong.\n  It implies that tax cuts are without nourishment and have no \ncontribution to the meal. They are a reward for doing your job rather \nthan an integral part of doing your job. Much as I respect Mr. Broder \nand those who have echoed this sentiment in this Chamber, I think that \nthey are in error. We must examine the whole circumstance of where we \nare in order to understand the role that proper tax policy can play.\n  Now, in this Chamber, one very familiar image has been with us during \nthis debate which, like David Broder's phrase, is very compelling and \nvery easy to understand. The image is drawn by people on both sides of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\naisle, of a family, sitting around the table in their kitchen, going \nover the family budget. The father says to the members of the family, \n``We cannot balance our family budget. Our income is not sufficient to \ncover the expenses.'' Then the father says to the mother, and solemnly \nto the gathered children, ``We have only two choices. We can either \nsomehow convince the boss down at the factory to give us a raise or we \ncan cut our expenditures. Since the boss is not inclined to give us a \nraise, we will have to tighten our belts, do the right thing, and cut \nback on our expenditures.''\n\n  After we conger that image to mind, those in this Chamber are told \nthe Government is the same way. We must tighten our belts, stop the \nspending, cut down on the expenditures just like that family. Again, it \nis a powerful image. It is easily remembered. It surrounded by a great \ndeal of emotion, and it is wholly wrong, just like the spinach and the \ndessert.\n  In the process of hearing about the families, we always see this \nchart. It is displayed by people on both sides of the aisle. This is \nthe chart showing what is happening to the national debt. The national \ndebt is so low it did not show up on the chart in the years prior to \n1941, and then gradually it starts creeping up and stays about level \nand then suddenly it explodes and people point to this chart and \nremember the family, and say a family that is going into debt this \nrapidly is headed for absolute disaster.\n  I want to ask you to consider a different image, a different table, \nand a different group sitting around the table, that will help us \nunderstand, in my view, what is really going on in the economy. Instead \nof a family sitting around the table talking about their finances, let \nus consider a group of business people sitting around a boardroom table \nof a company. The chief executive officer of the company, we will give \nhim the title of chairman of the board, the chairman of the board calls \nhis people together and says to them, ``We have a deficit in this \ncompany of about $1 million a month. If we cannot solve that deficit \nproblem we will go bankrupt. What can we do to deal with a deficit of \n$1 million a month?''\n  His first expert steps up and says, ``Mr. Chairman, I have examined \nthis issue very carefully and I can tell you what it is we need to do. \nWithout question, we can solve our problem if we simply raise our \nprices. We are selling $50 million a month worth of our products. So if \nwe raise our prices 2\\1/2\\ percent, we will make enough money to cover \nour $1 million a month deficit.'' Case closed. All you need to do is \nraise your prices.\n  The next expert stands up and says, ``Mr. Chairman, I have been \nconsidering this. Raising prices is absolutely the worst thing you \ncould do. As a matter of fact, I know the answer to our problem. We \nmust cut prices. Yes, our problem is that our competition is cutting \ninto our market share. We are losing sales right and left because our \nprices are too high. If we simply cut our prices by 5 percent across \nthe board, the increased volume will do two things for us. No. 1, our \ntotal sales will go up; and No. 2, our cost of sales will come down as \nwe get economies to spread over a larger number of units. So I disagree \nabsolutely with the first expert. He says raise prices, and I say cut \nprices.''\n  Then the third expert stands up and addresses the chairman in our \nboardroom and he says, ``No, they are both wrong. The price structure \nis just fine. What we must do is spend more money on plant and \nequipment. Our factory is outmoded, our costs are enormously high in \nthe factory. If we spend another $50 million on the factory and \nretooling and new equipment, we would cut our overall cost of \nmanufacturing by more than $1 million a month, and we would get out of \nthe deficit circumstance.''\n  When he sits down, the fourth expert stands up and she says to the \nchairman of the board, ``Mr. Chairman, they are all wrong. We do not \nneed to raise prices or cut prices. We certainly do not need to \nincrease spending. All we need to do is cut spending, cut the overhead. \nOur overhead is running about $11 million a month, and if we cut it 10 \npercent that would give us the $1 million a month we need to come to a \nbreak-even position.''\n  So there sits the chairman of the board. He has four groups advising \nhim. The four groups are saying to him, ``raise prices, cut prices, \nincrease spending, cut spending.'' He thanks them all for their \nefforts. They leave. He is there, left alone with his assistant who \ndoes not have a great deal of experience in the business, and looks at \nthe chairman of the board and says to him, ``OK, you have four options. \nWhich one are you going to take?'' Because we are dealing with a wise \nchairman who has a great deal of experience in the free market system, \nhe smiles at his assistant and says, ``All four.''\n\n  Yes, Mr. President, all four. When you manage a business that is \nconstantly changing from day to day, as every business is, and you \nrealize that you cannot put in a static pattern and then leave it \nforever, you realize that you have some products that are not price \nsensitive, and you can raise the price and thereby increase your \nmargins without having any punishment in the marketplace. You have some \nproducts that are, perhaps, overpriced or need a lower price in order \nto increase their hold on the market, so you cut the prices on those \nproducts.\n  Yes, you have some increased spending for plant and equipment, \nresearch and development. It is the future of your business that \ndepends on your increased spending in those areas. Of course, there are \nalways areas where you have to cut spending.\n  In Government terms, what we are saying with this pattern is, if this \nwere the Government sitting around that table instead of a business, \nthere would be some areas where you would cut taxes, some areas where \nyou would raise taxes, some areas where you would cut spending, and \nsome areas where you would raise spending. It is not the simple either/\nor circumstance of the family sitting around the kitchen table. It is \nthe very challenging management problem of a business sitting around \nthe board table and trying to figure out how to maximize its profits \nand, at the same time, make the right kind of investments for the \nfuture.\n  With that new image in our minds, let's address what is, I think, the \nfundamental question here: How do we manage the economy intelligently? \nParticularly, the challenge is, how do we manage an economy--think of \nit in business terms--that is doing $7 trillion worth of business every \nyear? Just think of this. If you were the chief executive officer of a \nbusiness that was doing $7 trillion worth of business every year, how \nwould you manage that challenge? You obviously would have to look at \nall four of the options I have outlined.\n  Well, in order to understand how to manage this economy, we start by \nasking ourselves, where are we? You cannot manage a business without \naccurate data, without accurate information and reports. In other \nwords, we can't do the business of the country without accurate \ninformation.\n  I submit to you, Mr. President, that while this chart is enormously \npopular and enormously emotional in the message that it sends, like the \nvision of the family sitting around the kitchen table, it is not \nadequate. No, the numbers are not inaccurate; the numbers are correct. \nBut the question is: Debt compared to what?\n  If I may repeat an example I have given on the Senate floor before to \nillustrate this point, I will take you back to my own business career. \nWhen I was hired as the chief executive officer of the Franklin \nInstitute in Salt Lake City, that company had debt of $75,000. When I \nleft, prior to my run for the U.S. Senate 6\\1/2\\ years later, the \ncompany had debt of $7.5 million. If you were to put that on a chart \nlike this, your reaction would be: Bennett is a really irresponsible \nexecutive. When he took over the company, the debt was way down here at \n$75,000, and when he left, it was way up here at $7.5 million. Aren't \nwe glad to be rid of him? But you have to ask yourself ``the debt \ncompared to what?\"\n  When I took over as CEO of the company, it had four employees, it had \nsales about $250,000 to $300,000 per year. At the $300,000 figure, the \ndebt was 25 percent of sales. And we were not getting a margin of 25 \npercent of sales on our profit. The debt of $75,000 threatened the very \nexistence of that company. When I left the company and the debt was \n$7.5 million, the sales were over $80 million. We had more than $7.5 \nmillion in cash on the balance sheet.\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\n The only reason we didn't pay the debt off is there were prepayment \npenalties built into some of the mortgages we had signed, and it was \nfinancially more beneficial to keep the cash than to pay the prepayment \npenalties. So the mere size of the debt had nothing to do with the \nmeasurement of my stewardship as CEO of that company.\n  I will say, as an aside, that since I have left the company, the \nsales have now gone to over $400 million. It is a very clear cause and \neffect that getting rid of me caused the company to more than triple.\n  Let us, therefore, in the Government context, take this chart down \nand put up another one relating to the example I have given from the \nbusiness world--debt compared to the size of the company, or, in this \ncase, the size of the country. What is the size of the country? Here we \nhave a chart that shows gross domestic product, GDP, or the size of the \nNation's economy. Back in the 1940's, the economy was about a trillion \ndollars in inflation-adjusted dollars, 1992 dollars. You can see the \nsteady growth up, so that now, in 1996, as I say, we are a $7 trillion \neconomy, headed toward $8 trillion by 2002.\n\n  Under those circumstances, this chart is suddenly going to look a \nlittle different when you compare it to gross domestic product. This is \nthe result that you get on this chart. Federal debt, as a percentage of \nour gross domestic product, looks a little different than Federal debt \nin nominal dollars. We reached the highest point of debt in our history \nduring the Second World War, at 130 percent of gross domestic product. \nAs soon as the war was over, it started coming down and continued to \ncome down until it leveled off at around 30 percent of gross domestic \nproduct in the 1970's. It started back up in the mid-1970's and \ndramatically back up in the mid-1980's.\n  This is a comforting chart in that it says that the previous chart is \nnot wholly accurate when you compare debt to GDP, and a discomforting \nchart when you realize that our debt is rising as a percent of our \neconomy for the first time in peacetime in our history. Always before, \nthe debt has been tied to a war. And when the war is over, debt as a \npercentage of GDP comes down. For the first time in our history, it has \nstarted to go up in peacetime; that is a very disturbing trend. I will \ndeal with that in just a moment.\n  Now, the question is, why? Why is the debt starting to come up? There \nare those on the other side of the aisle who have a very quick answer, \nsummarized in two words: Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan is the one who \ncaused all of this to happen. Look how the debt exploded during the \nReagan years; it is all because of the disastrous Reagan tax cuts. It \nseems to me that we cannot, in this body discuss the tax cut that \nhappened in terms of the marginal rate in the 1980's, without \nautomatically adding in front of the phrase ``tax cut,'' the words \n``disastrous Ronald Reagan,'' as the words to describe it--as if it is \nall one word, a legal term of art.\n  I want to discuss whether or not the ``disastrous Reagan tax cuts'' \nare responsible for this rise in the national debt. Let's take a look \nat who pays the income taxes in this country and, also, what the \nhistory has been of the tax rate. Here is the history of Federal tax \nreceipts and personal tax rates on this chart. The red line on the \nbottom is Federal tax receipts expressed, again, as a percentage of \ngross domestic product. This is what we are measuring everything \nagainst, this chart showing the lines going up.\n  Do you notice a clear trend, Mr. President? Virtually from the end of \nthe Second World War until now, Federal tax receipts have remained rock \nsolid, within a narrow band, no lower than 18.5 percent and no higher \nthan 19.5 percent of gross domestic product, averaging around 19 \npercent year after year. That is where it was, 19 percent, when the top \nmarginal rate under Harry Truman was 91 percent. Then we had a tax cut. \nThe rates went down slightly. John F. Kennedy recommended that it come \ndown to 70 percent, and many people in this body were scandalized, \nsaying we can't afford that heavy a tax cut, we can't afford to lose \nthe revenue. So it came down from 90 percent to 70 percent. What \nhappened to the receipts? They didn't change.\n  Well, you had this one blip that Lyndon Johnson put through to help \npay for the Vietnam war in the tax rate, and it showed up with an \nupward blip in the tax revenue. But quickly the tax revenue went back \nto the 19 percent line and the tax rate stayed at 70 percent until the \ntime came to drop it to 50. When the tax rate dropped from 70 percent \nto 50, what happened to the tax revenues? They stayed solid. As a \nmatter of fact, they went up a little when the drop of 70 percent to 50 \npercent happened as the marginal rate.\n  Then Ronald Reagan convinced the Congress to pass the ``disastrous \nReagan tax cuts.'' The marginal rate came all the way down to 28 \npercent. What happened to the revenues? They stayed right solid at 19 \npercent. Bill Clinton said, ``We have to get more revenue to balance \nthe budget,'' and he forced the marginal rate, with Congress' help, \nback up to close to 40 percent. Actually, when you add Medicare on top \nof it, it is more than 40 percent. What happened to the revenue? \nNothing. It stayed around 19 percent.\n\n  You cannot blame the ``disastrous Reagan tax cuts'' for the increase \nin the debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, because they had \nlittle or no effect on the tax receipts as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product. Those are the facts.\n  Now, I said in my example that the businessman will be asked both to \nraise prices and cut prices. One of the interesting debates we have \naround here is that Members of the Republican Party stand up and accuse \nBill Clinton of pushing through the ``largest tax increase in \nhistory.'' Then the Members of the Democratic Party stand up and say, \n``That's not true, the largest tax increase in history was put through \nby''--the same two words, Mr. President--``Ronald Reagan.''\n  Who is right? Well, if you take nominal dollars, the Republicans are \nright. The Clinton tax increase was the largest in history. If you take \nconstant dollars, adjusted for inflation, the Democrats are right. \nRonald Reagan's tax increase was the largest in history. Now, he didn't \ncall it a tax increase; he called it ``revenue enhancements,'' which \ninfuriated conservative groups around town that looked upon him as \ntheir hero.\n  Reagan did exactly the thing that the businessman in my example did. \nHe both raised prices on some products and cut prices on others. He \nraised taxes on gasoline, for example, while cutting tax rates on \nincomes. And what happened to the economy in the Ronald Reagan years? \nLet's go back to this chart.\n  As I say, this chart is the inflation-adjusted gross domestic \nproduct. The reason for all the fancy colors is not just to help keep \nyou awake, Mr. President, but to demonstrate the differences in the \nvarious administrations. Understand that something that is done in one \nPresident's administration doesn't necessarily produce a result in that \nadministration. Many times, the effects are felt years later. \nNonetheless, to give us some guidance, here we have the growth of the \neconomy during President Eisenhower's administration. It started up \nmore vigorously in John F. Kennedy's administration. Why is that? That \nis the period of time we came down from 90 to 70. I don't know whether \nthere is a direct cause-and-effect correlation, but it is certainly a \nsignificant enough issue to look at. We dropped the top marginal rate, \nand the rate of growth in the country goes up through Kennedy and \nremains through Johnson. Then you get a recession. It is flat in the \nlast year of Johnson's administration and in the first year of Nixon's \nadministration. Incidentally, Mr. President, that is the only year on \nthis chart where we had a balanced budget--1969. It is an interesting \ncorrelation. It was flat. Then it starts to go up. But you get a \nrecession that hits you; Nixon-Ford. Here is this recession, and Jimmy \nCarter becomes President. As we come out of that recession and get the \nadvantage of the recovery out of that recession in his first 2 years, \nhits the 3d year, and gets another recession, and it becomes flat \nagain. Ronald Reagan was President while we had what the economists \ncalled the ``double dip.'' The Carter recession; then they came out of \nit in 1981, and then the more serious recession that followed, and \nseriously it came down. But once that recession was over, the rate of \ngrowth that came out of those years for the balance of\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\nReagan term in the first 2 years of Bush's term was historically one of \nthe finest we have ever had. Is there any reason for that? Well, that \njust happens to coincide with ``the disastrous Reagan tax cuts.'' This \nline that says percentage of GDP, unchanged by the change in tax rates \nand corresponds with the GDP that is going through the roof. Nineteen \npercent of this kind of growth produces a whole lot more revenue to the \nGovernment than 19 percent of a recession.\n\n  We cannot blame the tax policy relating to the top marginal rates for \nthe deficit and our problems. It is very clear that the deficit is not \ndriven by income tax policy.\n  If I might digress for just a moment, I would like to explain one of \nthe reasons why the change in the income tax marginal rate does not \nproduce a change in the percentage of income that comes in. This next \nchart demonstrates that because it tells us who pays the income taxes \nin this country.\n  The top 1 percent of households produce 13.8 percent of the income in \nthis country. Many people say that is very unfair and they want to do \nsomething about it. But that is where we are. The top 1 percent of \nhouseholds produces 13.8 percent of the income. They pay 28.7 percent \nof the income taxes, or more than twice the percentage of the income \nthat they receive. If you go to the top 5 percent, they get 27.8 \npercent of the income and pay 47 percent of the income taxes. In other \nwords, the taxes that are paid on this chart, nearly half of them are \npaid by people in the top 5 percent of our wage earners. If you go down \nto the top 10 percent, this goes to 60 percent of the income taxes. \nWhat that means is that when you change this rate, the people who earn \nthe most income, over here, have options as to what they will do with \ntheir money, and they will change their investment pattern to adapt to \nthe Tax Code, consequently avoiding things that are high tax and moving \ninto areas that are low tax, the result being that the percentage that \nthey pay remains constant as measured in terms of GDP.\n  So what you want to do, again back to this chart, is make sure that \nthe GDP is going up as rapidly as it was during the Reagan years in \norder to maximize your income because your income is going to remain a \nconstant percentage of that GDP by virtue of who it is that pays the \nincome tax.\n  Back to this chart, briefly. The bottom 50 percent pay virtually no \nincome taxes at all. The bottom 50 percent gets roughly 15 percent of \nthe Nation's wealth and they pay less than 5 percent of the Nation's \nincome taxes. They, however, pay payroll taxes. They don't pay income \ntaxes, but their payroll tax burden is inordinately high.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I would call the Senate's attention to \na piece that appeared in the Washington Post on the 15th of April \nwritten by our colleague from Nebraska, Bob Kerrey, and ask unanimous \nconsent that it appear at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Senator Kerrey has summarized the problem for the people \nin the bottom half of income earners superbly well, and pointing out \nthat they actually pay a higher effective rate on their income than \npeople who pay income taxes down in this particular area of the chart. \nThey do it in the form of payroll taxes, and that, as I have said on \nthis floor many times before, is just one of the reasons why a complete \nrestructuring of the Tax Code is absolutely necessary. But this is not \nthe time. I don't have the time today to discuss that issue all over \nagain. I am sure I will have a speech on that subject when we get into \nthat later on.\n\n  If the deficit is not caused by tax policy, the tax policy is \nproducing roughly the same amount of income regardless of what we do \nwith it, and indeed, if the tax policy causes the gross domestic \nproduct to increase rapidly, let's look at the spending side. That is \nthe only other place that the deficit can come from.\n  There are those in the Chamber who say, ``Well, it is all defense \nspending.'' Back to Reagan again, ``He is the problem because of his \nrunaway spending for defense.''\n  Let's look at defense spending again by our same measure as a \npercentage of gross domestic product. The defense spending--we left \nthese years out because this is the Second World War and the aftermath \nof the Second World War. Here is the Korean war. The green bars are \nEisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and so on all at the way through \ndifferent colors. Here is what we are spending in the defense budget in \nthe Korean war. When the Korean war was over it dipped off, and then, \nstarting here in the mid-1960's, the Vietnam war. Again there was a \npeak in 1968, the last year of Lyndon Johnson's Presidency. And then \nthe spending tapered off and went down still further in the Carter \nyears, and then Ronald Reagan did, indeed, call for a cold war buildup \nin his attack on the Soviet Union, and you got a bulge. But notice at \nthe highest point of spending for the cold war buildup, it was \nsubstantially lower than at any time in the Vietnam war and less than \nhalf the spending in the highest year of the Korean war.\n  Now with the result of the cold war buildup having produced the \ndestruction of the Soviet Union, we are reaping the peace dividend that \npeople have been talking about for so many years. And the spending came \ndown during President Bush's administration, and continues to come down \nduring President Clinton's. It is now, as you go across the chart, at \nthe lowest level it has been since 1940 as a percent of gross domestic \nspending.\n  Spending on defense even in the years of Ronald Reagan's buildup \ncould not be responsible for the budget gap. It simply wasn't that \nsignificant. You put it in historic context and it is below historic \nlevels in the other conflicts we have been examined. So, if it is not \ndefense spending, it must be nondefense spending--nondefense \ndiscretionary spending--that has done this. Let's look at that.\n  Here is nondefense domestic discretionary spending from 1962, to 2002 \nprojected. Notice where it hits its highest point. It hits its highest \npoint during the Carter years. 1976 is the year Jimmy Carter is \nelected; 1977 his first year, 1978; the highest point in 1978 tapers \noff a little bit. If we go back in history, we find that this was a \ntime of great domestic spending expansion. Again it started in the \nNixon-Ford years, carried over into the Carter years, and then began to \ncome down. It is back up--1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, the Clinton years. \nWhile not competing with the Carter years, his spending is coming back \nup after having gone down. But this is not the picture of disaster. \nThis is a picture of some stability in spending in this area.\n  So if it is not defense spending, and it is not nondefense spending, \nwhat is it?\n  Now let us put up the chart that deals with entitlements. Here are \nentitlements as a percentage of GDP. The yellow portion of the chart \nshows actual entitlements. The pink portion is the baseline projected \nfor the years ahead through the year 2007. You will notice there is a \nserious increase right here--late 1970's. This again was a period when \nCongress significantly expanded Social Security SSI and Medicaid. It \nwas at the same time, a period of recession, when you come over to this \nchart and find that the GDP is shrinking.\n  So Congress is authorizing more spending while the economy is \nshrinking, and that produces these spikes. When the economy recovered, \nit starts to come down. But then you get another recession, and now it \nbecomes even more serious in this recession that shows up in the first \npart of the Reagan term. Then the Reagan growth takes off, and you get \nthat rapid growth period and you get a period where entitlement \nspending as a percent of GDP begins to come down.\n\n  But when the growth slows down and you get into the recession that \nhits in the end of the Bush Presidency, beginning of Clinton, what \nhappens? Entitlement spending goes up. Then you realize what is built \nin, and what is happening to our demographics. And you see the baseline \nthat the Congressional Budget Office says is going to occur from here \non in, and you are into historic highs.\n  This is where the problem lies. It is not in defense spending. It is \nnot in nondefense discretionary spending. It is in entitlements. And \nhere is where it is showing up.\n  We will put up another chart that shows the contrast between \ndiscretionary spending as represented by the red line and entitlement \nspending as\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\nrepresented by the gray line. In this gray line, we have added another \ncomponent that has not been in any of these figures up until now, and \nthat is interest on the debt.\n  It is interesting. Here in the 1960's, John F. Kennedy is President. \nThe amount of mandatory spending is substantially less than half the \namount of discretionary spending. No big deal. The lines cross just \nabout the time that we have been talking about in the mid-1970's when \nthe debt started to go up as a percentage of gross domestic product. \nThey stayed pretty much the same. And then with the recession that hit \nin the early 1980's, the gray line starts to take off, leaving the red \nline somewhat constant, going up but not all that much. Clearly the \nproblem is in the gray line. Clearly the challenge that is creating the \ndeficit is not on the tax side, not on the spending for normal \nGovernment activities represented by the red line, and clearly the \nproblem of the deficit is the gray line which is mandatory expenditures \ncombined with interest which is in and of itself a mandatory \nexpenditure.\n  So that is where we are. Our challenge is to get the economy growing \nas rapidly as it did during the Reagan years, and then on the other \nhand begin to turn that gray line down so it can become a little bit \nflat. And that combination can bring us a balanced budget.\n  How do we do that? Get the gross domestic product growing more \nrapidly, and get expenditures under control. Those are our twin \nchallenges.\n\n  I take you back to the image that we had at the beginning of this \npresentation, back into the boardroom where the CEO is sitting with his \nexperts and they are telling him what he can do to manage his company \nmore intelligently and solve the company's deficit problem. Remember \nthe first recommendation he had, ``Raise prices.'' At the risk of \noffending some of the Members of my own party, I think there are places \nin this Government where we can raise prices. I think there are things \nwe can do--if we want to use the Reagan euphemism, revenue \nenhancements--where we can charge more for the services we are \nrendering. That is heresy to people who say never ever raise taxes. I \nam one who says I won't ever vote for an increase in the marginal tax \nrate, but there are, all around the Government, things that could be \nraised, raised prices on those products that are not price sensitive \nand get a little more revenue into the Government.\n  Then, the second expert told the CEO, ``Cut prices.'' We are being \ntold, no, if you try that in the Government, that is dessert, not \nspinach. There is no nourishment to that. I think we have shown clearly \nthat, properly done, cutting tax rates in the right places in the right \nway can do what we need to do to increase the revenue of the Government \nby increasing the gross domestic product. Where is the best place to \nstart on that? Clearly, for me it is capital gains.\n  Oh, says somebody, if you cut the rate on capital gains, you are \ngoing to benefit the rich because only the rich have capital gains.\n  As I have shown you, Mr. President, the rich pay most of the income \ntaxes, period. The issue is not: Are you going to benefit the rich? The \nissue is how are these people going to allocate their capital in the \nway that will produce the greatest benefit to the economy as a whole? I \nsay to any Member of this body, go back home, gather the venture \ncapitalists, the real estate investors, people who are involved with \nmoving capital around in your home State, and ask them this question: \nAre there deals that should be done that would improve the economy in \nthis State that are not being done because of the current capital gains \ntax rate? If you ask that question, as I have asked it in my State, the \nanswer will be: Every day deals that should be done are not being done \nbecause of the capital gains tax rate.\n  You have capital locked into mature investments which, if the capital \ngains tax rate were to come down, would immediately flow into \nentrepreneurial investments, thus creating new jobs. Alan Greenspan, \nwho has been praised by Members of both parties for his deft handling \nof the monetary policy in this country, has said repeatedly on the \nrecord that the best capital gains tax rate for maximum benefit to the \neconomy is zero. I would be happy to see that, but I am not going to \nput that proposal on the floor because I realize it will not pass. But \nif we were to do something about the capital gains tax rate, we would \nsee the proper allocation of capital into the economy to produce the \nkind of growth that we need.\n  People say, ``Oh, no, the stock market is going crazy and a capital \ngains tax adjustment would simply drive the stock market still farther \nand still higher and the only people that get rich are the rich.'' Some \nportions of the stock market are going up. The Dow is going up. The Dow \nconsists of 30 stocks. The NASDAQ, which consists of substantially \nmore, is not going up nearly as rapidly as the Dow, and the Russell \n2000, which consists of 2,000 companies down at the lower level, \ncompanies that are not in the Dow, they are not in the Standard & \nPoor's 500, they are down below that. The companies where the \nentrepreneurs are investing their money, and where the real new job \ngrowth in the future is going to come, is down substantially.\n  The Russell 2000 index, which hit its peak in January of this year at \naround 370, is now down to 340. If that drop were on the Dow rather \nthan the Russell 2000, we would have financial analysts jumping out of \nwindows, saying look how much trouble we are in. What that tells us is \npeople are taking their money out of entrepreneurial activity and \nputting it into the huge stocks that they think can weather the coming \nstorm. If we were to do something about the capital gains tax rate, \npeople would be willing to put their money into the entrepreneurial \nsector of the economy and we would be building a base for future growth \nin the gross domestic product that would be enormously beneficial for \nus in the long run.\n\n  So back to my example. The first person said to the CEO, ``Raise \nprices.'' I say yes, there are places where we can raise revenue in the \nGovernment even now. The second person said to the CEO, ``Cut prices.'' \nI say yes, there are areas where we can cut tax rates and get benefit, \nwhere it is not dessert. It has just as much nourishment as spinach and \nprobably tastes a good bit better. Then, of course, you will remember \nthe third expert said to the CEO, ``Increase your spending, because you \nhave an aging plant and aging equipment.'' The fact is, we need to \nincrease spending in the Government in some areas.\n  Our highways are in trouble; our airport and airway system could use \nsome infrastructure spending. We are taking the money that is in the \ntrust funds for both of those functions and we are spending it for \nsomething else. I think we need to take a long look at places where we \nare being penny-wise and pound-foolish in the long term, as far as some \nspending initiatives are concerned. I know that to some this sounds \nlike heresy, coming from someone on the Republican side, but it is \nsound management and for the best of our country.\n  Finally, we come to the final recommendation that was given to our \nCEO and that we hear around here a great deal, ``You have to cut \nspending.'' The answer is clearly, yes, we have to cut spending. Here \nis a chart that is not the past but the future, that demonstrates the \nchallenge that we face. Like every estimate, it can be wrong, but it is \nthe best estimate that we have. This is dealing with the two largest \nentitlement programs that we have, Medicare and Social Security. In the \nfirst 1996 set of bars, you see that Medicare, the red, is between 2 \nand 3 percent of gross domestic product; Social Security, the green, \nbetween 4 and 5. Ten years later, in 2005, Social Security remains \nstable, right about the same place. But Medicare, if nothing is done to \ndeal with it, will have grown significantly. Then go out 10 years more. \nSocial Security has now grown fairly significantly and Medicare has \ncaught up with it. In 2025, Social Security has grown again very \ndramatically, but Medicare has outstripped it. And, in the year 2035, \nSocial Security has grown some more and Medicare is going way past it.\n  This will not be of any concern to me. I will not be here in 2035. I \nmay be here in 2025--my genes are such that I can expect to live to \nthat year. But these young pages who are here on the\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\nfloor will be in the height of their earning years in 2035, and they \nwill be facing entitlements, in these two programs alone, which will \neat up 15 percent of gross domestic product.\n  If you remember, what was the line on revenues on the previous chart? \nIt was 19 percent of gross domestic product is all we get with our tax \nsystem. If 15 percent of gross domestic product goes to two programs \nalone, that means there will be nothing left for anything else. And, as \nthe debt goes up as a percent of GDP, interest becomes an increasing \nproblem and you quickly will be at the point in these years, the years \nwhen these pages will be looking for jobs or hoping to support \nfamilies, when the Government will not have any money for anything \nother than entitlements. That is the future if we do not do something \nto get this under control.\n  My time has almost expired. This was not a speech to lay out detailed \nsolutions. It was an attempt to put the debate in the right context, \nget it out of the context of the family sitting around the kitchen \ntable. It is to understand that this economy operates more like a \nbusiness and that it is a major economic entity that has to be managed \nintelligently. But it is very clear that entitlements have to be \nmanaged, along with the tax problem,  and the other spending problems. \nWe must get entitlements under control or we cannot solve this puzzle.\n\n  I suggest I would be willing to vote for means testing of \nentitlements; changing the definition of an entitlement, if you will, \nto this: You are entitled to this money if you need it. Absolutely the \nGovernment has it there for you. They are holding it for you, and as \nsoon as you need it, the Government will give it to you. Instead of \nsaying, ``You are entitled to Social Security payments, Ross Perot. You \nare entitled to Medicare, Donald Trump.''\n  I say, ``Ross Perot, if you ever fall on evil times, Medicare will be \nthere for you. Donald Trump, if you ever go back into bankruptcy, you \ncan draw your Social Security check, absolutely. You are entitled to it \nif you need it.''\n  The other issue we have to face, of course, is the question of cost-\nof-living adjustments. Built into this projection is the assumption \nthat the present cost-of-living adjustment formula is accurate and \nfair. The Boskin commission has looked at that and said, no, the cost-\nof-living adjustments are overstated by at least 1.1 percent. We are \ngoing to have a debate about that on this floor. There are many people \non both sides of the aisle who say, politically it would be crazy to \ntry to do something about the way cost-of-living adjustments are \ncalculated, let us just leave it as it is. I say to you the numbers say \nwe cannot leave it as it is. We have to deal with reality.\n  Social Security is a wonderful program. It was put in place in the \n1930's. Medicare is a wonderful program. It was put in place in the \n1960's. We now live in the 1990's in an entirely different economy \nfacing an entirely different kind of future. I suggest that ultimately \nwhat we want to do, as we deal with the challenge of our budget and our \nNation's fiscal sanity in the future, is take a clean sheet of paper \nand say, ``The tax system that was designed 60 years ago no longer \nmeets our needs. Let us write a new one. The retirement program that we \nput in place for our senior citizens 60 years ago no longer meets our \nneeds. Let us write an entirely new one. The health care plan we put in \nplace for our senior citizens 30 years ago no longer meets our needs. \nLet us write an entirely new one.'' And see if we cannot, as good \nmanagers, devise a system that will take care of the poor, take care of \nthe elderly, deal with the challenges of the flow of capital in our \ncountry, and at the same time see to it that we get back to the rate of \ngrowth that we enjoyed during the Reagan years while holding the \nspending down.\n  All we need to do is see that the economy grows more rapidly than the \nGovernment does. That is all we need to do. That has to be our \nlodestar. We do not have to freeze the Government. We do not have to \ndismantle the Government. All we need to do is say we will follow \npolicies that show that the economy will grow more rapidly than the \nGovernment will grow. When that happens--let's go back to the chart on \ndebt as a percentage of GDP--we can see the bars start going in the \nright direction again. Once we get the discipline where the economy \ngrows more rapidly than the Government, this trend will turn into this \ntrend. The debt will start to come down as a percent of GDP in \npeacetime as it historically has, and our children can have confidence \nthat we will have discharged our governmental stewardship \nintelligently.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that this has been lengthy. I do not \napologize for the length because of the importance of the subject. I \nfelt that all of this information which is counter to much that has \nbeen said on this floor on both sides of the aisle is important to put \ninto this debate. I hope my colleagues who disagree with me will come \nto the floor and respond. But I hope the responses will be in terms of \nintellectual analysis and fact rather than political sloganeering on \nboth sides. The issue is too important to be left to sloganeering. The \nissue is too important to be left to posturing for the 1998 elections, \nin which I have a rather strong personal interest myself. The issue has \nto do with generations yet to come of our children and our \ngrandchildren. We owe it to them to do more than shout political \nslogans to each other but to see to it that we address this issue on \nthe basis of the reality of where we are and where it is that we can \ngo.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you for your time and attention and \nyield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 15, 1997]\n\n                           The Forgotten Tax\n\n                            (By Bob Kerrey)\n\n       Today the income tax comes due for its annual flogging. \n     April 15 is the day we reserve for outpourings of frustration \n     about taxes. But the fact is that for average American \n     families, the biggest tax burden is felt not on this day but \n     on every single pay day, when 12.4 percent of their wages are \n     taken to provide retirement income for senior citizens and \n     operating revenue for government. This tax, known as FICA \n     (the Federal Insurance Contributions Act), funds the most \n     popular and successful government program in America today: \n     Social Security.\n       FICA is forgotten when tax-cutting time arrives. But \n     because of the way the income and the Social Security payroll \n     taxes are structured FICA is often the biggest tax burden. A \n     household is likely to pay 15 percent income tax, with large \n     chunks of earnings shielded from it, but the 12.4 percent \n     payroll tax applies flatly to all wages up to $65,400.\n       Consider: In 1995, the median U.S. household earned \n     $34,076, placing it in the 15 percent tax bracket. Because \n     standard exemptions and deductions shielded more than half \n     its earnings, a family of four earning that amount paid just \n     over $2,600 in income tax.\n       But because the payroll tax--6.2 percent paid by the \n     employee and 6.2 percent more by the employer--was assessed \n     against the family's entire income, it paid more than $4,200 \n     in FICA. This disparity holds true for a family of four \n     making as much as $56,600 or an individual making $30,000. I \n     include the employer's share in those figures because that \n     6.2 percent represents lost potential earnings and bears at \n     least partial responsibility for stagnating wages. But for a \n     large number of Americans--particularly the self-employed--\n     the payroll tax is larger even without an employer match.\n       The payroll tax to be sure, is collected for good purpose. \n     By providing income for current retirees, Social Security has \n     drastically reduced the rate of poverty among the elderly. It \n     deserves its distinction at the most popular and successful \n     government program in America.\n       But as tax policy, FICA also imposes serious burdens on \n     working families. It is not just regressive, it's super-\n     regressive. Because income above $65,400 is exempt, \n     individuals earning more than that amount actually pay less \n     as a percentage of income than those making less. It has \n     economic flaws as well: All of FICA's proceeds go to \n     consumption, either by current retirees or the government. \n     None of the money is invested; to the contrary, the fact that \n     these wages are being taxed means they are unavailable for \n     families to invest for their own retirement and reap the \n     benefits of the soaring value of capital in a global economy.\n       Most important, without reforms, the social contract on \n     which Social Security rests--that each generation allows its \n     wages to be taxed to provide retirement income, in return for \n     a promise that it will receive retirement income from the \n     next generation's taxes--is threatened by the program's \n     looming insolvency.\n       There is a way to address each of these problems--Social \n     Security's insolvency and the tax burden on working \n     families--while strengthening the basic income-transfer \n     premise of the program. I have proposed reform under which \n     families would invest two percentage points of what they now \n     pay into Social Security--2 percent of their total income--in \n     Personal Investment Plans under their own control. These \n     plans would provide a vehicle for building retirement wealth. \n     By adjusting the age of eligibility for full benefits, \n     correcting the consumer price index and\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\n     other reforms, my proposal would shore up Social Security's \n     solvency to ensure it continues to provide retirement income \n     as well.\n       Because my proposal diverts income currently being paid in \n     taxes to individual accounts owned by the taxpayer, it \n     constitutes a tax cut that totals $300 billion over five \n     years--50 percent bigger than even the most lavish ambitions \n     of the Republican leadership of Congress.\n       Under this proposal, the hypothetical four member family \n     described above would see its payroll tax burden reduced from \n     $4,200 to just over $3,500, with the difference invested for \n     the family's retirement. At 8 percent return--which is less \n     than the historical long-term performance of the stock \n     market--over the course of a 45-year working life, the family \n     would build more than $300,000 in wealth.\n       And it would build a stake in America's success in a global \n     economy. It is often lamented that the principal beneficiary \n     of the globalizing economy has been corporate wealth, which \n     is more readily shared with shareholders than employees. \n     Employees with advanced skills prosper, those who lack skills \n     are left behind, and the gap between the two is growing.\n       Just as troubling--more bothersome is some ways--is the gap \n     in wealth. Skilled workers prosper in a global economy. So do \n     owners of capital. The millions of middle-class Americans who \n     own mutual funds and whose wealth is growing as corporate \n     America thrives know this.\n       But the gap between those who own capital--and therefore a \n     stake in America's success in the world--and those who do not \n     is fast becoming a chasm. to take just one measure, a recent \n     survey found that among households earning $35,000 or less--\n     51 percent of all households and those most likely to pay \n     more in payroll tax than income tax--only 18 percent own \n     mutual funds. This is compared with 41 percent of households \n     earning $35,000 to $49,000, 58 percent of those making \n     $50,000 to $74,000 and 73 percent of households earning \n     $75,000 or more.\n       Thus some households not only lack a stake in America's \n     global success; they are often the ones most threatened by \n     it. These are the families that see their wages stagnate and \n     their jobs downsized while corporate profits--and the wealth \n     of those who own a stake--rise on each report of their \n     misery. Part of the solution is ensuring they have the skills \n     to climb the income ladder; another is ensuring laws are \n     written so workers are treated fairly. The other part of the \n     solution--just as vital--is ensuring those workers own a \n     stake in America's success.\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address this body on a most \nimportant issue, an issue which may affect our country and, of course, \nthe citizens of our country. The Chemical Weapons Convention, when \nratified by this body, will mark the beginning of a new arms control \nera.\n  I first stood before the Senate December 11, 1995, and urged that we \nbring the Chemical Weapons Convention to the floor for debate. I urged \nthat this be done expeditiously and without partisanship. After many \nunsuccessful attempts, we are now in a position to debate the treaty on \nthe Senate floor.\n  This treaty was negotiated and signed during the administration of \nPresident George Bush. The Clinton administration, after making its own \nassessment of the treaty, submitted it for the Senate's advice and \nconsent pursuant to our Constitution in November of 1993. The Chemical \nWeapons Convention is truly a bipartisan effort and is now enjoying \nsupport from both sides of the aisle. The Chemical Weapons Convention \nhas been signed by 161 countries and ratified by 68 of these countries \nand many more will ratify the convention once the United States does.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is not about eliminating our chemical \nweapons. The United States is already committed to eliminating our \nchemical weapons. We have done that unilaterally and have been doing \nthat since 1985 because in 1985 we passed legislation requiring the \nunilateral destruction of all of our chemical weapons inventory. The \nonly question since then has been how and where we do the destruction \nof the chemical weapons.\n  The convention will hold other nations to the same standards which we \nhold ourselves. How can this be viewed as anything but beneficial to \nthe citizens of this country. The Chemical Weapons Convention requires \nsignatory nations to destroy their chemical weapons inventory. The \nsecurity of this Nation and our allies will be improved when the \nChemical Weapons Convention enters into force on April 29 of this year.\n  Secretary Madeleine Albright, our Secretary of State, has said, among \nother things:\n\n       The convention will make it less likely that our Armed \n     Forces will ever again encounter chemical weapons on the \n     battlefield, less likely that rogue states will have access \n     to the material needed to build chemical arms, and less \n     likely that such arms will fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\n  That is what our Secretary of State said, and I agree with her.\n  This treaty reduces the possibility that our Armed Forces will \nencounter chemical weapons on the battlefield by preventing signatory \nnations from producing and, also importantly, possessing chemical \nweapons.\n  Ratification does not prevent our military from preparing for \nchemical attacks, nor does the ratification diminish the ability of our \nmilitary leaders to defend against a chemical attack. In fact, as I \nspeak, our national laboratories are working on programs to test how we \ncan defeat terrorist activities using chemical weapons. We need to have \na program where we determine how we can eliminate rogue states that \nhave these materials in their possession and terrorists obtain them. A \nlot of this will be going on at the Nevada test site in the deserts of \nNevada.\n  Ratification does not prevent our military, as I have indicated, from \npreparing for chemical attacks. The Department of Defense is committed \nto maintaining a robust chemical defense capability. The defense \ncapability will be supported by aggressive intelligence collection \nefforts and also the research and testing that I have indicated that \nwill likely take place at the Nevada test site. The Department of \nDefense will continue to prepare for the eventual possibility of \nchemical attacks, and they will continue to train on systems which can \nbe used to defend against such an attack.\n\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention requires other countries to destroy \ntheir weapons, I repeat, weapons that may someday threaten American \ncitizens.\n  Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who became an American folk hero because of \nhis activities during the Gulf war, has said:\n\n       I'm very, very much in favor of ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. We don't need chemical weapons \n     to fight our future wars. And frankly, by not ratifying that \n     treaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North \n     Korea.\n\n  The 1925 Geneva Protocol does not--I repeat, does not--restrict \npossession and production of chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons \nConvention fills that void by further rolling back the threat of \nchemical weapons.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the development, \nproduction, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of \nthese weapons. It enforces these basic prohibitions through the use of \na multinational economic and political sanction network.\n  I stress, the Chemical Weapons Convention makes it less likely that \nour Armed Forces will face these horrible instruments of power on the \nbattlefield by prohibiting the production and the stockpiling of these \nchemical weapons. The convention also protects Americans at home from \ndeadly terrorist attacks such as those that occurred at the Tokyo \nsubway. It does not eliminate them but it adds to the protection that \nwe in America have.\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention not only prohibits development of \nchemical weapons, it also, importantly, limits access to chemical \nweapons precursors. I do not know for sure, and I guess no one can \ndetermine for certain, if this convention would have prevented the \ndeadly attack in the Tokyo subway. It certainly would have made it less \nlikely. But we do know that almost immediately after the attack in the \nTokyo subway, where people were killed and injured for life, Japan \nratified the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Terrorism is a real threat to this country. We only need look at what \nhappened at the World Trade Center, Olympic Park, and, of course, \nOklahoma City. Chemical weapons provide an avenue for terrorists to \nfurther their cause. The Chemical Weapons Convention, while not \nperfect, will minimize the opportunity for these groups to use chemical \nweapons. The convention enters into force this month on the 29th day. \nRefusal to ratify the treaty will not stop the treaty. It will only \nprevent our country from participating on the governing council of this \nconvention.\n  The United States is the premier world leader today. That is without \ndispute. We provide leadership and direction in economic, military and \npolitical issues whether we want to or not. Delaying ratification of \nthis treaty is counterproductive to our world leadership role and \ncounterproductive to this Nation's security. Failure to ratify this \ntreaty by the 29th of this month not only aligns us with nations like \nIran, Iraq, and North Korea, it also prevents the United States from \nobtaining a seat on the executive council and the international \ninspection team. This executive council will decide how the treaty will \nbe implemented. If we are to continue as world leaders in \nnonproliferation, which we are now, it is vital for us to be a part of \nthe executive council and international inspection team. We not only, \nin my opinion, have the desire to do that but the expertise to do that.\n  The Department of Commerce estimated last year that only about 2,500 \nU.S. firms will be required to submit a data declaration form. Most of \nthese firms will only be required to complete a two-page form. It is \nimportant to note that chemical companies support this convention. \nLeading U.S. chemical trade associations such as the Synthetic Organic \nChemical Manufacturers and the Chemical Manufacturers Association \nparticipated in the negotiation of this treaty and strongly endorse \nthis treaty.\n  The chemical industry of the United States uses and produces \nchemicals from medicinal and industrial applications. The Chemical \nWeapons Convention does not restrict the use of chemicals for these \npurposes. The Chemical Weapons Convention is designed to ensure that \ncommercial facilities do not convert sensitive precursor chemicals into \nweapons agents.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention, I suggest, does not end the chemical \nweapons threat. It is only a tool that we can use to reach that as an \nobjective. That objective is eventual elimination of a very dangerous \nclass of weapons. The convention establishes a global norm by which \nstate behavior can be judged. Some would say it levels the playing \nfield in games of weapons proliferation.\n\n  Make no mistake. The Chemical Weapons Convention is not without a \nflaw. However, for all its imperfections, it is in essence a fine \ntreaty, one that will serve this Nation and this world well and will \nassist in stabilizing this all too volatile world. This convention is \nclearly in the best interests of our national security. It will assist \nin the leadership of our country. It will assist in the worldwide \ndestruction of chemical weapons. Let us not imperil our global \nleadership position. It is time to ratify this convention.\n  Mr. President, I also want to extend a personal word of \ncongratulations to the two leaders who enabled us to get to the point \nwhere we can have a say in whether or not this treaty will be approved. \nThe Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has worked personally, spending \nhours, days, and weeks to allow us to get to this position. And I have \nto say I think this shows the leadership qualities of the Republican \nleader in allowing us to have this treaty before the Senate. If it did \nnot come before the Senate, I think it would show a lack of leadership. \nAt this stage I hope I am not going to be disappointed. I hope it will \ncome before this body in a fashion that will allow us to fully debate \nand ratify this convention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3309-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3310-S3312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONFLICTING VALUES\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I appreciate the opportunity to spend a few moments \nspeaking about two of America's values. They are values that are \nembraced by people across our Nation from sea to shining sea, but \nsometimes those values come into conflict. When they come into \nconflict, how we resolve that particular conflict will depend on how \nwell we succeed in the next century, how capable we are of carrying on \nat the high level of performance that America has always expected and \nthat the world has always admired.\n  I speak about two values, and I do not think there are two values \nthat are more highly or intensely admired in America than these. The \nfirst one is the value we place on our families. We understand that \nmore than anything else the family is an institution where important \nthings are learned, not just knowledge imparted but wisdom is obtained \nand understood in a family which teaches us not just how to do \nsomething but teaches us how to live.\n  A second value which is a strong value in America and reflects our \nheritage is the value of work. Americans admire and respect work. We \nare a culture that says if you work well, you should be paid well. If \nyou have merit, you should be rewarded. If you take risks and succeed, \nthat is the engine that drives America forward.\n  When you have this value of family and the value of work both \nmotivating a society, it is good news for the culture and I think \nAmerica has a bright future. But sometimes these values collide. When \nthe demands of work somehow get so intense that they impair our ability \nto do with our families what we ought to do, then we feel tension \nbecause we have these two important components of the American \ncharacter that are bumping into each other.\n  Most of us as Americans know that we are working hard enough now that \nthere are many times when we simply feel we are not spending the time \nwe ought to with our families. If you will look at the data that has \nbeen assembled by the pollsters and everyone else who takes the \ntemperature of the American public regularly, you will find out that \nmost Americans would like to be able to spend more time with their \nfamilies, and that most Americans are spending far less time with their \nfamilies than they used to, and that most Americans are spending more \ntime on the job than they used to. The number of hours we are devoting \nto our enterprises and our work is going up, and we feel a tension with \nthe way in which we value our families. Sometimes we feel like we have \nbeen sacrificing our families.\n\n  So one of the things that faces us as a culture, as a community, as a \ncountry is, how are we going to resolve these tensions? I think that is \none of the jobs, that we have to try and make sure we build a framework \nwhere people can resolve those tensions and where Government somehow \ndoes not have rules or interference that keeps people from resolving \nthose tensions.\n  For example, there are a lot of times when an individual would say on \nFriday afternoon to his boss or her boss, ``My daughter is getting an \naward at the high school assembly today. Can I have an extended lunch \nhour, maybe just 1 hour so that I can see my daughter get the award? I \nwould like to reinforce, I would like to give her an `atta girl,' I \nwould like to hug her and say, `You did a great job, this is the way \nyou ought to work and conduct yourself, it is going to mean a lot to \nyourself and our family and our country if you keep it up.' ''\n  Right now, it is illegal for the boss to say, ``I will let you take \nan hour on Friday and you can make it up on Monday,'' because it is in \na different 40-hour week. You cannot trade 1 hour for 1 hour from one \nweek to the next. That will make one week a 41-hour week and will go \ninto overtime calculation.\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\n Since most bosses do not want to be involved in overtime, it just does \nnot happen.\n  What we have is a situation where parents are in a bind. They want to \ndeal with their family, they want to deal with them effectively. Lots \nof employers would like to help the parent do that, but here is the \nGovernment standing and saying, ``That's illegal.''\n  One of the reasons the Government says that is illegal is because we \ncrafted our labor laws about what can be done and what cannot be done \nback in the 1930's. A lot of us cannot even remember the 1930's, but \nthey were tough times. We did not have the commitment to flexibility in \nthe 1930's that we have now. We thought the 40-hour week was something \nthat had to be rigid. Only one out of six mothers of school-age \nchildren was in the work force in the 1930's--one out of six. That is \nabout 18 percent. Now we have between 70 and 80 percent of the mothers \nof school-age children in the work force.\n  As a result, we live in a different culture. We live in an entirely \ndifferent world, and these individuals, mothers and fathers, are \nfeeling the stress of not being able to have an ability to accommodate \nthe needs of the family and also pursue the value of work, which we \nvalued so highly and reflected in this body last year when we had \nwelfare reform. We said, ``You don't get welfare if you are not willing \nto go to work,'' and we want to value work. But we want to have a way \nso when we have work as being a primary focus of this culture, it also \nallows us the flexibility to do well with our families because we \nunderstand that it is in families that people build the habits of \nsuccess, that will ultimately carry ourself and our communities.\n  This tension between the workplace and the home place, juxtaposed or \nset in a framework of laws created in the 1930's that does not allow us \nflexibility, is a problem. For example, you might be asked to do \novertime over and over and over again, and you do overtime, and then \nyou are paid time and a half for your overtime. But at some point, most \nAmericans come to the conclusion, my goodness, no matter how much pay I \nget, I still need some time, and I would like to take some time off, \ninstead of getting time and a half in pay. I think it might be a good \nidea to say, if you want time and a half off some week in the future so \nyou can spend time with your kids and make up for lost time, or go on a \nvacation or go to a parent-teacher conference, you might be able to say \nto your employer, ``Instead of paying me time and a half in wages, you \nought to let me take time and a half off sometime.'' If the employer \nagreed to it voluntarily--both parties--we ought to let that happen. It \nis against the law. The law passed in the 1930's, when we were more \nrigid and had different conditions in this country, says if you work \novertime, you must be paid time and a half; you cannot take comp time \nor compensatory time off.\n  Some employers even want to go so far as to help their families by \nsaying instead of doing 1 week for 40 hours, we would be willing, if \nyou wanted to and on a voluntary basis, let the worker average 40 hours \nover a 2-week period regularly, so you would only work 9 days in the 2 \nweeks, but you would work 45 hours the first week and 35 hours the \nsecond week and have every other Friday off so you could take the kids \nto the dentist or drop by the department of motor vehicles and get the \ncar licensed or visit the governmental offices that are not open on \nSaturday. It is against the law to do that now.\n  What I have described are three problems: One, the comp time problem \nthat you can only get comp time in money not in time; two, flextime; \nsometimes you need to trade 1 hour one week for another hour the next \nweek; and three, to schedule flexibly so you might be on a regular \nschedule that allowed you to take time off with regularity.\n\n  All three of these things are available in the Federal Government and \nfor governmental entities. Since 1978, the Federal Government has said \nit is OK to swap comp time off instead of overtime pay. The Federal \nGovernment said it is OK to have a flextime bank so if you need to take \ntime off you can take some time off if you put some extra hours in the \nbank. It is also said if you want to have some flexible scheduling so \nthat every other Friday or every other Monday is off, that is something \nwe can work with you on.\n  It is totally voluntary--voluntary for the worker, it is voluntary \nfor the Federal Government employer or administrator. Neither can force \nthe other because we do not want to force people to work overtime or \ntake comp time, but we want to allow Americans to make choices which \nwill help them resolve the tensions between the home place and the \nworkplace, these two values that are in competition.\n  I tell you, it has worked so well in the Federal Government that it \nis almost unbelievable. When the General Accounting Office did one of \nits surveys, and the only survey really that has been done on the \nsubject, 76 percent of the workers said they liked it. Only 7 percent \nsaid they did not like it. That is better than a 10-to-1 ratio. \nFrankly, you cannot interview people in Washington and get that much \nagreement on the fact that today is Thursday. That is an overwhelming \nendorsement, and I think it is high time that we gave to the American \npublic generally what governmental workers have had for almost 20 years \nnow, 19\\1/2\\ years. Since 1978, Federal workers have had this ability \nto say on a voluntary basis, ``I would like to take some time off \ninstead of getting the overtime pay,'' and the time off would come at \ntime and a half. Or, ``I would like to work an extra hour this week so \nI can take an hour off next week and put it in a flextime bank.'' Or, \nif the worker and employer could agree, ``I sure would like to schedule \nit so I work 9 hours a day for 5 days this week and only work 35 hours \nnext week so I can take off all of Friday, every other Friday.''\n  These potentials, which exist for Federal workers, it occurs to me, \nought to be able to be available to workers in the private sector as \nwell, were we not to be locked into the hard and fast rules of the \n1930's. That was a time when Henry Ford said, ``You can have your Ford \nany color you want so long as it is black.'' Things were not quite as \nflexible then as they are now, and families did not need the \nflexibility then as they do now. With 70 to 80 percent of all mothers \nof school-age children now working and two parents working in all those \nsettings, and the tension between work and home, I think we ought to \nhave more flexibility at the option of both the employer and the \nworker, only when it is agreed to.\n  That is really the subject of the Family Friendly Workplace Act which \nI proposed this year and I believe we will be working on and actually \nvoting on in the next 30 days. It is a way of saying we need to allow \nfamilies to work out the conflict that exists between these important \nvalues that are crucial and so fundamental to the success of this \nculture in the next century, not just fundamental to the success of our \nculture, but fundamental to the success of our own families.\n  We were aware when we put this bill together that we did not want to \nallow any employer to be overbearing or coercive, either directly or \nindirectly, in this respect, so we put in tough penalties. We doubled \nthe penalties that would attend any violation of overtime rules. Not \nonly that, if a worker says, ``I think I would like to have time off at \ntime-and-a-half rates instead of being paid time and a half,'' and then \nthe worker changes his or her mind, of course, before taking the time \noff, the worker would have the right to cash the time in at any time. \nThe law provides that if at the end of the year the worker has not \ntaken the time off, the employer has to pay time and a half anyhow. It \nis designed to make sure there is no coercion and voluntary for both \nworkers and employers, but it is designed as well to be flexible.\n  Some people thought having family and medical leave would be the \nanswer. There is a law that says you can take time off to meet your \nfamily's needs, but you have to take it off without pay. I think that \nreally is a tough situation, because the workers are put in a \ncircumstance where, in order to relieve the family tension, he or she \nhas to increase the financial tension. Well, the financial tension is \nwhat has driven people into the workplace in the first instance.\n  I believe we should not have to take a pay cut in order to be a good \nmom or dad in America. If we would allow for flexible working \narrangements, a worker could have a bank of time they have earned in \nadvance that they could use as flextime or they could take some of\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nthe time in your bank that you put in at time and a half for comp time \nand you could meet your family needs that way without taking a pay cut. \nSimply, the Family and Medical Leave Act says you can leave without \npay. I think we ought to have the Family Friendly Workplace Act which \nsays you do not have to take a pay cut in order to be a good mom or dad \nin America.\n  Well, this is the situation. I believe if you ask people, they will \ntell you they need this. President Clinton commissioned a study by the \nLabor Department. The report was entitled ``Working Women Count,'' and \nthat report, headed by the Clinton Labor Department, said the No. 1 \nthing we want is more ability to harmonize, to accommodate the needs of \nour families and workers. The President himself has recognized this. \nThere was a small portion of Federal Government workers that have not \nbeen covered since 1978, and when he took office in the early nineties, \nhe said, ``I'll cover them,'' and he issued an Executive order which \nextended the benefits to these workers.\n\n  I think it is time for America to prepare for the next century, and \nperhaps it may be a little scary for some people to just loosen their \ngrip a little bit on the 1930's, but we do not live that way anymore. \nThe truth of the matter is, we need flexibility. As long as we have a \nframework of protections and we guard against abuse and we make it \nvoluntary for both employers and employees, I think it is time we said \nto the American people generally, you can have the same benefits that \nthe Federal Government employees have had since 1978, you can work to \naccommodate these competing needs that tug and pull you, the need to \nhave a good work situation and the need to meet the needs of your \nfamily.\n  When we address these issues on the floor of the Senate, I hope we \nwill have an overwhelming vote that sends the American work force into \nthe next century with a sense of optimism and a sense of being able to \naccommodate these competing values, values of their families and home \nplace and values of industry and the workplace.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first let me compliment the Senator from \nMissouri. I have supported his efforts and continue to do so because of \nthe important contribution that his legislation would make for \nflexibility for working families in this country. It is an important \neffort that I hope we can succeed in adopting before too long in the \nSenate of the United States. Again, I compliment him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3310-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3312-S3313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are working toward developing a unanimous-\nconsent agreement which I hope will permit us to vote yet today on an \nimportant piece of legislation that complements the efforts of the \nadministration to proceed with the consideration of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention next week.\n  For those who support the Chemical Weapons Convention, it is a way of \nreiterating that support. For those who oppose the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, it is a way of declaring support for a wide range of very \nrealistic and practical and constructive steps that the United States \ncan take to help reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and, in particular, chemical and biological weapons here in \nthe United States.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to call that bill up. It is a bill \nwhich I have sponsored with cosponsorships, including I believe all of \nthe Members of the leadership of the Senate Republicans, including the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Lott; Senator Nickles; Senator \nMack; Senator Coverdell; Senator Helms; Senator Shelby; Senator \nHutchison; Senator Allard; Senator Hutchinson; Senator Inhofe; Senator \nSmith; and myself.\n  It is a bill which would have, under the unanimous consent agreement \nbeing proposed, only 2 hours of debate before the vote. There would be \na very limited amount of time to describe it, and, therefore, I would \nlike to briefly describe the legislation at this time.\n  I think it should be noncontroversial, though the Chemical Weapons \nConvention itself is very controversial; and reasonable people can fall \non either side of that debate. I think the legislation before us today \nshould be supported by all Members of the United States Senate.\n  The title of the bill--or let me actually read the description of the \ntitle of the bill to begin this description:\n\n       To provide criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful \n     acquisition, transfer, or use of any chemical weapon or \n     biological weapon, and to reduce the threat of acts of \n     terrorism or armed aggression involving the use of any such \n     weapon against the United States, its citizens, or Armed \n     Forces, or those of any allied country . . .\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation came about because of the focus on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the determination that there were a \nlot of things that the United States could and should do whether or not \nthat convention is ratified.\n  For example, we found that while it is illegal in the United States \nto possess or manufacture biological weapons, there is no criminal \nprohibition upon the manufacture or possession of chemical weapons. \nTherefore, we combine the two sections of the statute which relate to \nchemical and biological weapons and provide that it is a criminal \noffense to manufacture them, to use them, to threaten to use them, to \npossess them. All of these things are criminalized with substantial \npenalties being provided for them.\n  We provide for the revocation of export privileges for those \ncompanies in the United States that might violate that law and, \nincidentally, for the forfeiture of assets to help pay victims of such \ncrime. In effect, say, this was an attack such as in the Tokyo subway \nabout a year ago. We would, under certain circumstances, be able to \nseize the assets of the criminals responsible for that for the purpose \nof compensating the victims of that terror.\n  This legislation provides for sanctions against the use of chemical \nand biological weapons. Under existing law there are sanctions, but we \nwould provide more flexibility for the President. Under the existing \nlaw, the President has a limited range of 10 sanctions that he has to \nimpose in two particular tiers if he makes a finding that there has \nbeen a violation of law. These are sanctions against another country.\n  What we would do is provide the President the flexibility to provide \nany combination of those sanctions. He is still required to impose five \nof them, as he is under current law, but this provides him some \nadditional flexibility depending upon the circumstances of how he would \nimpose sanctions against any particular country that has used or \npossesses or manufactures chemical or biological weapons.\n  There is also a continuation of the waiver for the President. \nAlthough that is strengthened somewhat, he would still be able to waive \nthese provisions in the supreme national interest of the United States.\n\n  But importantly, also, this act would call the President to block \ntransactions of any property that is owned by a country found to use \nchemical or biological weapons. So their property here in the United \nStates should be seized, here again, for paying the victims of such \ncrime.\n  Another thing this bill does is to call upon the President and the \nSecretary of State to use their best efforts to maintain the Australia \nGroup in force. That is the group of countries of the world that have \nagreed among ourselves not to trade in chemicals with countries we do \nnot think should have those chemicals because they might be used to \nmanufacture chemical or biological weapons.\n  We need to maintain the Australia Group. This provides the sense of \nthe Senate and the policy of the United States to continue that \nAustralia Group in force.\n  There are currently conditions on assisting Russia in the destruction \nof and the dismantling of their chemical and biological weapons. They \nhave far and away the largest stocks of chemical and biological weapons \nin the world. What we have done is to provide assistance to them under \nwhat are called Nunn-Lugar funds. This continues the same kind of \nrestrictions that existed in the past with respect to a certification \nby the President that Russia is in compliance with these requirements.\n  The four conditions in this legislation closely parallel those in the \n1996 Defense Authorization Act in which\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nboth Houses of Congress agreed to fence the so-called Nunn-Lugar funds \npending a certification by the President that either Russia was making \nprogress toward achieving these goals or that the President could not \nso certify.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent just to speak for a couple \nmore minutes to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  I note the distinguished Senator from Texas is here. I will, \ntherefore, try to stay within this limitation of time.\n  In any event, this is basically a continuation of previous policy, \nMr. President, not something new, but we think it is important to \ncontinue.\n  Our legislation calls for a report on an annual basis on the state of \nchemical and biological weapons proliferation. It calls for the \nSecretary of State to work with other nations of the world to try to \nfind ways to put teeth in the 1925 Geneva Protocol. That is the treaty \nwe all signed that bans the use of chemical weapons and, by the way, \nincludes such countries as Iran and Iraq and other countries that \nreally ought to comply with the provisions of that treaty.\n  We restrict the use of funds until the United States is actually a \nmember of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\n  Next to last, we make it the policy of the United States to continue \nto enhance our defense capabilities. The GAO came out with a report \nlast year that frankly said our military was going the wrong way in \nproviding defensive capability to our troops, that we need to spend \nmore money and that we need to do a better job in equipping our troops \nto defend against the use of chemical weapons.\n  Because of that GAO report, we have included in this legislation \ninstructions to the Secretary of Defense to get on with that job and, \nvery specifically, by the way, to require that the primary facility \nwhich engages in this conduct to defend our troops is under the \njurisdiction of a general officer of the United States.\n  We provide a sense of the Senate that the President reevaluate the \ncurrent policy on negative assurances. And, finally, we provide that \nthe policy begun in the Ford administration on the use of riot control \nagents be continued in force. This is a policy that says, for example, \nthat notwithstanding any chemical weapons convention, if we have a \ndowned pilot, for example, and there are civilians in the area, we can \nuse riot control agents, tear gas, if you will, so we do not have to \nfire real bullets to extricate that pilot from that situation.\n\n  The bottom line is this act that will be introduced, and we hope \nvoted on today, is an act that continues some very important policies \nand institutes some new, positive changes in the law, including filling \nsome important gaps in the law relating to the manufacture and use of \nchemical weapons here in the United States. It ought to be supported by \nall Senators in this Chamber whether or not they intend to support the \nChemical Weapons Convention. This bill is an important bill to support, \nand we will be calling on them later today for that support.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, are there any time limits on the \namount of time that a Senator can speak at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes per Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to commend the distinguished junior Senator from \nArizona for all of the efforts that he has made to educate Members of \nthe Senate and members of the American public on the chemical weapons \ntreaty that will be before the Senate at some point in the next week. \nHe has shown so many of the problems with this treaty and some of the \nconsequences that might occur if the treaty is put forward in the form \nthat it is in.\n  I think his bill would correct some of the real problems, such as the \nconcern over the ability to use tear gas. To unilaterally say we would \nnot use tear gas is unimaginable when we know what an important tool it \nis to safely extricate a pilot that is down or to safely be able to \ncontrol a group of prisoners, which was done with Iraqi prisoners of \nwar in Desert Storm. The last thing you want to do is have to shoot \nwith real bullets when you have other options that are not permanently \nharmful.\n  So, I thank the Senator from Arizona, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of his bill that I think would correct some of the problems \nin this treaty so that we would all be able to ratify it very happily \nand knowing that we have carried our responsibility to do what is right \nfor our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3312-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORST INDUSTRIAL DISASTER IN THE HISTORY OF \n                                AMERICA\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say that I had quite an \nexperience yesterday. I went back to my home territory near Texas City, \nTX, and helped commemorate the 50th anniversary of the worst industrial \ndisaster in the history of America. That was the explosions in Texas \nCity on April 16, 1947.\n  I remember the incident personally because I was there as a 4-year-\nold. I remember the tremendous jolt that occurred at that time. I put a \nstatement in the Record yesterday that talks about the incredible \nimpact this had on the people of the area of Texas City.\n  Just to put it in perspective, this was a town of 17,000 that lost \n600 of its citizens in one 24-hour period. It lost the entire fire \ndepartment that was on duty at the time. It lost people who were trying \nto help victims. It was an incredible impact. But the impact that I \nwitnessed yesterday on the faces of the residents of Texas City \nhighlighted for me the rejuvenation of this city, now of 50,000 people.\n  Thanks to the leadership of its mayor, Chuck Doyle, there is a 3-day \ncommemoration of this event, and it is having a strong, positive impact \non the city. It is a city that has put itself back together and made \nitself stronger from the adversity.\n  I am very proud of Texas City, TX, and the sister city of La Marque \nwhere I grew up for healing this devastating event in its history and \nfor emerging stronger than ever. The area is today one of the \npetrochemical centers of the world and a place that I am proud to have \ngrown up in and to have known the wonderful people who live there and \nwho have made this city what it is.\n\n  So I commend Mayor Doyle, the survivors of the Texas City explosion, \nthe residents of Texas City, and the many other people who worked to \nmake the commemoration of that disaster such a positive event for Texas \nCity and for this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3313-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3313-S3314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri is the key sponsor \nof this legislation. It is the Ashcroft-Hutchison legislation that I \nthink is so important for the working people of our country. Senator \nAshcroft talked about it earlier this morning.\n  I am pleased to be able to talk about this incredible opportunity we \nhave to bring hourly workers under the same laws that salaried, or \nexempt workers now have, and that all Federal employees now have.\n  Mr. President, every hourly Federal employee today is given the \nbenefit of flexible work scheduling--a benefit which is unavailable to \ntheir private sector counterparts. Federal hourly employees can today \ngo to their manager and say, ``I would like to work 2 extra hours this \nweek and get off at 3 o'clock next Friday to go to my child's soccer \ngame,'' or to take off early on a camping trip, or for whatever reason \nthey choose.\n  Right now the hourly workers of America are not able to do this \nbecause of the inflexibility of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This is \nunfortunate, because hourly workers, those who punch a time clock, are \nthe most stressed of all American workers. They, more than\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\nany other sector of our workforce, would benefit from flexible work \nschedules. So the Family Friendly Workplace Act of 1997 is meant to \ngive our hourly blue-collar workers the same opportunities that \nsalaried workers and all Federal employees now have.\n  So what we are trying to do, Mr. President, is to end the inequity in \nlabor laws in this country that artificially place barriers around \nhourly employees and deny them the freedom to sit down with their \nemployers and work out a flexible schedule that best meets their \npersonal, family, and community needs, in order to relieve some of the \nstress in their lives caused by time pressures.\n  Here is what the bill does. Where an employer requires an employee to \nwork overtime, the bill would give that employee the option of choosing \npaid time and a half off in lieu of time-and-a-half pay. Now, if the \nemployee says ``No, I want the time-and-a-half pay,'' they are \nabsolutely entitled to the time-and-a-half pay. But if they know that \nthey are going to want some time off in the future, they would be able \nto say, ``No, I would like an hour and a half of overtime that I can \nput in a bank to use when I need it to take my child to the doctor.'' \nSo this is going to give them the option to earn paid time off for \ntheir overtime work.\n  The second thing the bill does is provide an additional option for \nthose employees who do not typically work overtime, which includes over \n90 percent of the hourly wage women who work in this country. These \nemployees would be allowed to voluntarily work more than 40 hours in \none week in order to take the same amount of paid time off later on. \nThis will give hourly workers, including working mothers and fathers in \nour country a better chance to plan for the future and to get the \noption to go to their employer and say, ``You know, I am working 40-\nhour weeks here but what I really need is flextime. What I need is the \nability to start putting hours aside that would allow me to take time \noff later for a child's school event or some other purpose.'' For \nexample, the employee could work 9-hour days and take every other \nFriday off, with pay, as many Federal employees now do. This is called \nflextime.\n  Finally, the bill will give employees and employers the option of \nestablishing regular 2-week schedules to allow an employee to work \nadditional hours in week one in order to work fewer hours in week two. \nAgain, this time is paid, and could be taken for any reason the \nemployee wishes.\n  Mr. President, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, both the \nmother and father work out of the home in two-thirds of the homes in \nour country. So, Mr. President, we know that mothers and fathers are \nstressed in two-thirds of the families in our country where both the \nmother and the father work outside the home.\n  This has come about because many women would like to work outside the \nhome. That is their choice. It has come about because many women need \nto work outside the home in order to help pay the bills. In many \ninstances the mother is working just to pay taxes. Now, we are trying \nto do something about that. We are trying to lower the tax burden on \nthe American family because we think working people should keep more of \nwhat they work so hard to earn. Until we are able to do that, to give \nmothers the choices they want--whether it is to work outside the home \nor not--we want to give the working mothers of this country every \npossibility to spend the time with their children that they need.\n  A key element of our approach is that the time off employees would \nreceive is paid time off. This is in contrast to other proposals, \nincluding an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act that the \nPresident and some others have advocated. They want to give American \nworkers time off, but unpaid time off. Comptime and flextime are paid, \nbecause they have been earned by the workers themselves, not handed \ndown from Washington as another unfunded mandate on employers and \nemployees. We want people to be able to have flexible work schedules, \nwithout busting their budget.\n  So, Mr. President, we are trying to expand the options of the hourly \nworkers in our country. That is the key point of this bill. We are not \ntrying to let employers in any way tell an employee or pressure an \nemployee to take comptime instead of comp pay. In fact, there are very \nstiff penalties if the employer tries to do this. We want the employee \nto have the option, in cooperation with the employer. We want the \nemployee to be able to say, ``It is the stress in my life that I need \nrelief from, without busting my budget.'' That is what we want the \nemployee to be able to say to the employer--``I am stressed. I want to \nbe able to take 2 hours or 20 hours off next week, in exchange for \nworking a little later this week, so that I can spend more time with my \nchildren.''\n  All the polls show, Mr. President, if an employee feels comfortable \nthat he or she has the time with his or her children, that employee is \na happier, more productive employee, and it is a win-win situation for \nboth employer and employee. In fact, upward of 75 percent of Federal \nemployees say that they like comptime and flextime, and that it has \nimproved their morale and performance as employees.\n  Mr. President, Congress cannot make more hours in the day. There are \njust 24, and there will always be just 24. But we can make those hours \nmore productive and we can make lives less stressful if we give the \nhourly employees in our country the same opportunities that salaried \nworkers have, that Federal employees have, that they say means a lot to \nthem.\n  So we want these options to be available to the hourly workers as \nwell. This is our goal. The Family Friendly Workplace Act that is \nsponsored by Senator Ashcroft and myself is for the families of our \ncountry, it is for the blue-collar workers, the hourly employees that \nare working so hard, that need the stress relief more than any of us, \nthat do not now have it, and we think they should. That is what we are \nworking for.\n  I hope we will be able to take this bill to the floor very quickly. \nIt has passed through the committee. It is a good bill. I think we can \nwork together in a bipartisan way if the other side will work with us.\n  Until we in Congress can get around to giving American families the \ntax and regulatory relief they deserve, the least we can do is allow \nthem a little more flexibility in their work week. America's hourly \nworkers want and deserve to choose the hours they work so they can take \ntheir children to the doctor, to the soccer game, to the Little League \nbaseball game, or to the camping trip, or whatever they would like to \ndo with their own time. We think it should be their choice.\n  Thank you, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Ashcroft and \nmyself in supporting this most important legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, last week I introduced the Drug-Free \nCommunities Act of 1997. This bill, which is\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nstrongly supported by Members from both sides of the aisle, rechannels \nexisting Federal drug control resources into community, antidrug \nefforts that are already reducing teenage drug abuse in our towns.\n  We must act now on this issue, because teenage drug abuse is one of \nthe worst problems in America today. Drug abuse encourages crime and \ngang violence, as well as higher rates of teenage pregnancy, and other \nsocial problems. Many of our schools are under siege from the onslaught \nof drugs.\n  What's more, teenage drug abuse is getting worse. After more than a \ndecade of substantial progress in combating the problem, the trends \nhave reversed since 1991. Marijuana use alone has tripled among 8th \ngraders and more than doubled among 10th and 12th graders. Daily use \nhas increased so dramatically during this period that one in 20 of \ntoday's high school seniors uses marijuana daily. And, the marijuana of \ntoday--because of the chemical THC content--can be 15 times stronger \nthan the marijuana of the 1970's. Cocaine, crack cocaine, amphetamine \nstimulants, barbiturates, and heroin are increasingly popular among \nteenagers. The use of LSD has never been higher.\n  These nationwide statistics are extremely troubling. But, the \nproblems of teenage drug abuse are experienced most vividly in each of \nour towns and communities. Our sons and daughters face this threat \nevery day in school and on the playground. We need to target our drug \nreduction efforts to help these teenagers in their own communities. \nThat is why we are introducing the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997.\n  With little or no Federal funds, many local anti-drug coalitions are \nalready helping some teenagers in their communities. This legislation \ntargets assistance to these coalitions, so that they can reach out to \nand help more teenagers. In order to receive Federal support, a \ncommunity must first demonstrate a comprehensive, long-term commitment \nto addressing teenage drug abuse. This commitment must include a \nfocused mission, the implementation of strategies to reduce drug abuse, \nand the involvement of all parts of the community--including parents, \nyouth, businesses, media, schools, law enforcement, religious leaders, \nand others. Moreover, a community must demonstrate that its antidrug \neffort is an on-going concern that has local support and is self-\nsustaining.\n  I also support the Drug-Free Communities Act because it is fiscally \nresponsible. It does not increase Federal spending or the deficit. \nInstead, it simply rechannels existing funds from the $16 billion \nFederal drug control budget. Even more importantly, the bill requires a \nfinancial commitment from the communities involved. Under the bill, the \nFederal Government will not simply grant money to local communities \nthat meet the criteria that I just mentioned. The qualifying \ncommunities must match the Government's funds with resources of their \nown--up to a cap of $100,000. These matching grants will force the \ncommunities to demonstrate an even greater commitment to fighting drug \nabuse before receiving Federal funds.\n  Finally, the legislation creates an Advisory Commission to oversee \nthe antidrug program. This commission will consist of local community \nleaders and national and State experts on substance abuse. This \ncomposition ensures that the program draws upon national expertise in \nfighting drug abuse, while remaining responsive to local needs.\n  The Drug-Free Communities Act has attracted the support of more than \n150 State and local law enforcement groups, churches, and other \norganizations. On the national level, it has been endorsed by groups as \ndiverse as Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and William Bennett's Empower \nAmerica. This bill represents a wonderful opportunity to provide \nmeaningful help to community coalitions in South Dakota and nationwide, \nwithout expending additional Federal funds.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3314-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NO CASH TO CONVICTS ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor Senate bill \n438, a bill that will help close a costly loophole in the current \nadministration of Social Security benefits. I commend my colleague, \nSenator Grassley, for introducing this important bill, the No Cash to \nConvicts Act. The bill will help the Federal Government identify \nincarcerated prisoners who are receiving Social Security disability \nbenefits to which they are not entitled, and will provide that \nprisoners who are incarcerated for even short periods of time are not \neligible for those cash benefits when they are in prison.\n  In the landmark welfare reform legislation enacted last Congress, \nCongress set up a voluntary program between local law enforcement and \nthe Federal Government to assist in the identification of prisoners who \nare receiving supplemental security income or SSI benefits. While \nearlier versions of that legislation covered prisoners' receipt of \nSocial Security disability benefits as well, the Social Security \nprovisions had to be dropped from the final conference report because \nof Senate rules preventing changes to Social Security benefits in a \nreconciliation bill. We should finish the job this Congress and ensure \nthat prisoners do not get those cash disability benefits, which would \nbe better spent on our law-abiding elderly and disabled.\n  By precluding any defendant who is convicted of a criminal offense \nand who is incarcerated from receiving Social Security disability \nbenefits, this bill removes an arbitrary and illogical requirement \nunder current law that a defendant have been sentenced to at least a \nyear in prison to be ineligible for benefits. There is no reason that \nan incarcerated prisoner should receive benefit checks intended to \nprovide for necessities like food, shelter, and clothing when the \nprisoner is already receiving those at the expense of the Government.\n  The bill also creates financial incentives for State and local law \nenforcement authorities to provide timely information concerning \nprisoners to the Social Security Administration. This will permit the \nFederal Government to check the benefit rolls to see whether prisoners \nare receiving benefits. If the Federal Government identifies any \ninstances in which inmates are illegally receiving Social Security \ndisability checks, the local authority that provided the information \nwill receive a cash payment\n  I am glad that this provision is structured to provide an incentive \nsystem rather than an unfunded mandate, and am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa in sponsoring this much-needed bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3315-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the Chemical \nand Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act which will, for the first \ntime in U.S. history, provide criminal and civil penalties against \nthose who produce, stockpile, or transfer chemical weapons in the \nUnited States. It will also legislate other practical and realistic \nreforms to reduce the spread of both chemical and biological weapons \nand improve the American military's defenses against them.\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\n  The impetus for this legislation was the realization that the \nChemical Weapons Convention being promoted by the administration, \nthough noble in aim, would have little practical effect, especially in \nthe United States; and that there were important steps we could take to \nfill gaps in existing law regardless of what happens with the CWC.\n  That is why Senate Republicans have introduced the Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Threat Reduction Act, setting forth a comprehensive \npackage of domestic and international steps to address chemical and \nbiological threats. Importantly, the legislation reiterates our firm \ncommitment to destroying the entire U.S. chemical weapons stockpile \nwhether or not the CWC is ratified--a pledge no other chemical weapons \nstate has matched.\n  Some may be skeptical of this bill because they see it is as an \nalternative to the CWC. To the contrary, S. 495 provides a sensible and \neffective action plan that CWC critics and proponents alike should \nsupport. By enacting the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat \nReduction Act, the United States will lead by example, and will \nunderscore its commitment to bringing together like-minded friends and \nallies to make unthinkable the resort to chemical or biological \nweapons.

Mr. President, a news flash to President Clinton: In \nAmerica, you do not get to rule by Presidential decree.\n  President Clinton is prepared to provide the ultimate payoff to labor \nbosses, an Executive order that essentially mandates that Government \ncontractors toe the union line. Too bad about the millions of American \nworkers who choose not to belong to a union. Now they are to be second-\nclass citizens.\n  The policy substance of the President's gambit is sufficiently bad, \nbut we suggest there is an even larger issue, one that goes to the very \nheart of our constitutional form of government.\n  One of the great strengths of our Republic is a Constitution that \nreflects, and nicely balances, the tension between democratic \nrepresentation in the legislative branch and the executive power of the \nPresident. The Founders established Congress in article I as the source \nof all legitimate authority, all legislative powers; that is, the \nauthority granted by the people. The executive branch, at least in \nterms of domestic policy, is constrained by the requirement that the \nPresident take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  Fairly elementary stuff. But in reality, of course, there has been a \ncontinuous struggle among the branches over where the legislative power \nbegins and ends. Normally, these tensions erupt at times of great \ncrisis: Lincoln during the Civil War, Truman and the steel mills. \nTypically they are bound up in questions of war and peace and the \nPresident's foreign policy role.\n  What we face during the twilight of the Clinton era is something very \ndifferent and much more worrisome. What we see now is a calculated \nstrategy by the White House to ignore the unhappy reality that the \nPresident was reelected with less than a majority vote while the \nRepublicans were reelected to a majority in Congress. Now, it appears \nhis goal is to encourage gridlock in the Congress while issuing \nExecutive orders and regulations that exceed his legal power to act.\n  There is perhaps no area of Federal policy more contentious than \nlabor issues. This has been true in fact for most of this century. It \nis also clear that labor bosses and leaders faced continued loss of \npower and declining membership. They have been stymied time and again \nin their efforts to expand their powers over unwilling American \nworkers.\n  So what has the President done here? He is issuing an Executive order \nthat deprives nonunion employees of their right to choose whom they \nsupport in the political process. He attempted to bar, through an \nExecutive order, any company that exercises its right to hire \nreplacement workers during a strike, though the courts properly struck \nthis down. He is now about to issue an Executive order that would allow \nagencies to bar--prohibit--Federal contractors if they do not use \nunionized labor.\n  Most recently, he is playing with a change in procurement regulations \nthat would bar companies from Federal contracts unless they had \nsatisfactory labor relations. Determined by whom? The President. Unions \ncould have a field day with that. All they would have to do is initiate \na lawsuit under the National Labor Relations Act and, presto, you have \na company that has unsatisfactory labor relations. This would be \nlaughable if the impact were not so grave. Hundreds of billions of \ndollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake.\n\n  In short, President Clinton's actions twist beyond recognition the \nrole of the Presidency in the legislative process. The Framers were \ncareful to ensure that the President's voice was a negative one by \ngranting him the veto. They did not grant him the equal and opposite \npower--he did not get the power of decree. A negative power like a veto \nis more easily used to avert harm. The decree smacks of autocracy.\n  But give the White House their due. The White House has carefully \nestablished precedents based on issues that are difficult to confront. \nIronically, some of the most contentious issues are going to be the \nmost difficult for the Congress to resolve. In some cases, perhaps a \nmajority of Congress would agree, in others they will not. But we \nbelieve those are precisely the types of issues that are intended for \nlegislative consideration and a majority vote. This is known as \nrepresentative democracy. It might be messy. It might take longer than \nthe pundits like. The results may not please everybody. But it is a \nprocess that is founded on the consent of our citizenry.\n  This is a time when there are many questions on whether various \nindividuals in the White House have been engaged in unlawful activity. \nOnly time will tell how that plays out. What we do know right now is \nthat even more than all these financial and campaign issues, the \nPresident's abuse of Executive orders and regulations is a direct \nthreat to the rule of law in America.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to my good colleague from New Hampshire 5 \nminutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his excellent \nstatement, which sets the premise for this hour of discussion that has \nbeen reserved relative to the proposal by the administration and the \nPresident and the Vice President to unilaterally take control over what \nis clearly a legislative prerogative and determine, unilaterally, that \n89 percent--89 percent--of the work force in this country which would \nparticipate in Federal jobs will no longer be able to participate in \nthose jobs. That is the practical effect of this proposal which is \nbeing put forward by the President and which was announced by the Vice \nPresident, was announced by the Vice President at a convention of a \nbuilding trades union.\n  One could be cynical and say, ``Well, the building trades unions in \nthe last campaigns spent $35 million reported''--we suspect maybe it \nmay be closer to twice that unreported--``spent $35 million reported \nfor the purposes of electing this President and that therefore this \ndecision by the President to exceed his authority, as announced by the \nVice President, is a return of that favor.'' One could be cynical and \none would be accurate, I suspect, in making that statement.\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n  But as the Senator from Georgia has pointed out, this goes well \nbeyond the cynicism of this administration, which has already been \ndisplayed in a most significant way in a variety of other instances \nrelative to campaign financing and fundraising and what will be done by \nthis administration to benefit people who contribute to them. It goes \nwell beyond that cynical approach and abuse of power which has become \nalmost a hallmark of this administration. It goes to the essence of the \nseparation of powers on which our Government is structured.\n  This Congress is the Congress of the people. It is the Congress which \nis elected by the people. You may agree with it. You may disagree with \nit. But the fact is that the membership of this Congress is sent here \nfor the purpose of writing the laws which govern the people whom we \nrepresent.\n  As the Senator from Georgia has so adequately pointed out, the \nPresident's power in the legislative process is that of a negative, not \nof a creator of that law. In fact, ironically, the President does not \neven participate as a negative on some of the most significant laws \nthat affect this country.\n  For example, the budget of the United States is not signed or vetoed \nor subject to signature or veto by the President of the United States. \nIt is purely a law driven by the body of the people of this country, \nwhich is the Congress. When a decision is going to be made to \ndisenfranchise 89 percent of the people who presently participate in \nworking for the Federal Government as contractors, that cannot be \nunilaterally done by the executive branch. That is a decision of such \nweight and of such importance that it is reserved clearly to the House \nof the people and to the Senate of the United States. And yet, this \nPresident has decided to do that and to, by fiat, by an arbitrary \ndecision, put together who knows what.\n  It certainly was not put together through the process of a \nlegislative hearing. It was not put together through a process of a \nlegislative debate. It was not put together through a process of a \nlegislative vote in a committee, and a legislative vote on the floor of \nthe Senate, and a legislative vote in the House, and a legislative \nconference, creating a bill which is sent to the President.\n  No, it was put together by somebody sitting in a back row, writing an \nidea which was given to the Vice President of the United States, who \nwent to a labor union annual meeting and announced, ``This will be the \nnew law of the land.'' That is not the way we govern in a democracy.\n  For that reason, I strongly support the initiative today put forward \nby our leader in the Senate, Senator Lott, which, said as I understand, \nthe nomination of the Secretary of Labor shall not be brought before \nthe body until this matter is cleared up, because that is our \nprerogative. That is our legal right as a representative of the people \nto advise and consent on the nominees for Cabinet positions. That is a \nlegal and constitutional right. We have the legal and constitutional \nright to limit our advice and consent, and to not approve a member of \nthis Cabinet, or to approve a member of the Cabinet.\n  In this instance, we certainly have a right to hold up that \nnomination until this arbitrary act of excess on the part of the \nexecutive branch, done for whatever reason, is clarified and withdrawn. \nAnd, in fact, it would be my view that we should hold up probably just \nabout every nomination which the administration wants to proceed with, \nbecause if they are not going to proceed in good faith in governing, if \nthey are going to proceed in a manner which clearly exceeds the bounds \nof authority of the executive branch, then it is incumbent upon us as \nthe legislative branch, as the branch elected by the people, to govern \nand to legislate, to make it clear to the President that that type of \naction will not be tolerated and cannot be tolerated if we are to \nmaintain a constitutional democracy, a democracy built on the concept \nof checks and balances, a democracy which was designed by Madison and \nhas survived so well for so many years.\n  The issue has been laid out. The fight has been joined. I believe \nthis Congress must assert its prerogative to retain its right as a \nlegislative body of the people of this country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his comments with regard to this very crucial and, in fact, \nconstitutional issue.\n  We have been joined by my good colleague from Arkansas. I yield such \ntime as the Senator from Arkansas desires to address this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3316-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3317-S3320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                S. 606, THE OPEN COMPETITION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today an \nimportant piece of legislation which will guarantee to all Americans an \nequal opportunity to compete for the nearly $60 billion of Government \ncontracts.\n  The Open Competition Act of 1997 ensures that no single special \ninterest group will have an exclusive claim on Federal contracts, and \nwould accomplish this by amending the National Labor Relations Act to \nsimply prohibit discrimination in bidding for contracts funded by the \nFederal Government.\n  The Clinton administration, specifically the Vice President, recently \nannounced their intent to issue an Executive order which would, in \npractice, create a union-only mandate for all Federal projects.\n  Upon closer examination, a disturbing connection exists between \ncontributions made by big labor interests, the announcement of the \nproposed Executive order, and the individuals who actually drafted the \nlanguage of this order.\n  For the American people to fully understand what prompted these \nactions by the Clinton administration, it is essential to understand \nexactly what big labor did for them during the 1996 election.\n  As widely reported after the November election cycle, labor unions \nspent between $300-400 million on the 1996 elections--Wall Street \nJournal, April 11, 1997.\n  This amount is even more astonishing when you consider that it was \nfinanced in large part by dues-paying union members who were never \nasked by the union leadership if this was how they wanted their hard-\nearned wages spent.\n  I firmly believe in the constitutional right to donate money to the \npolitical candidate of your choice. However, the problem here is what \nis asked for in return for this money, and even worse, what is given.\n  The question must be asked--What did the labor unions get in return \nfor the incredible amount of money they spent in the 1996 election?\n  On February 18 of this year, at the AFL-CIO convention in Los \nAngeles, the Vice President pledged the administration's support for \norganized labor and announced several initiatives the administration \nwould be launching in coming months.\n  ``How you treat your employees and how you treat unions counts with \nus,'' said the Vice President--White House Press Release, February 18, \n1997. He told the executive council of the AFL-CIO that the \nadministration would issue an Executive order which would require \nFederal agencies to consider using project labor agreements on all \nFederal contracts--Bureau of National Affairs, February 19, 1997.\n  These project labor agreements require all contracts for a particular \njob to be awarded only to contractors who agree to recognize designated \nunions as the representatives of their employees on that job.\n  In addition, these agreements would require all contractors to use \nonly union hiring halls to obtain workers, pay union wages and \nbenefits, and obey the union restrictive rules, job classifications and \narbitration procedures. The Open Competition Act would do away with \nthis requirement and restore fairness to the bidding process.\n  Just 3 days ago, on April 14, the Vice President announced that the \nadministration was prepared to offer an Executive order encouraging \nFederal agencies to use project labor agreements--again, which \ngenerally require union representation--on Federal construction \nprojects.\n  His announcement was greeted by thunderous applause by almost 3,000 \nAFL-CIO trade union officials in Washington, DC.\n  This Executive order becomes very interesting when you consider the \nparties who had a hand in drafting the language. The language in the \ndraft was jointly developed by the AFL-CIO, the\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\nClinton administration, and the Builders and Construction Trades \nDepartment.\n  I believe this is a clear indication that the money spent by big \nlabor during the 1996 elections not only provided the catalyst for this \nExecutive order, but also gave them a seat at the table when it was \nwritten.\n  Is this the way to build trust with the American worker?\n  The Clinton administration would have us believe their actions \nbenefit the majority of the American work force. But when you consider \nthe percentage of Americans who belong to labor unions, this is clearly \nnot the case.\n  Of the total work force in America, only 14.5 percent belong to \nunions. When you consider just those workers in the construction \nindustry, only 18.5 percent of those are union members.\n  The facts clearly show that if this Executive order is implemented, \nonly a minority of American workers will benefit. The 81.5 percent of \nworkers who do not belong to a labor union will be placed at a clear \ndisadvantage to the 18.5 percent who do.\n  Essentially, this means 4 out of every 5 workers would face \ndiscrimination. This is clearly not the way to help the American \nworker.\n  I want to make it very clear to the American people the detrimental \neffect this action by the administration will have on the American work \nforce.\n  The Open Competition Act which I am introducing today, will assure \nthe vast majority of American workers that their government will not \ndiscriminate against them.\n  This proposed Executive order will have the effect of creating a \nunion-only mandate for all Federal construction projects. In addition, \nit would directly attack the principle of open competition in Federal \ncontracting by excluding from the bidding process four out of every \nfive workers who have chosen not to be represented by unions.\n  The Federal Government should not be ordering discrimination against \nopen shop companies which bid for federally-funded construction \ncontracts. Rather, it should be encouraging competition for these \ncontracts and promoting participation in the process by all companies \nwho wish to bid.\n  The Open Competition Act of 1997 would make sure this occurs.\n  It would simply be unconscionable to institute a federal policy which \nwould allow a special interest group to have an exclusive claim on \nFederal contracts based on their enormous political contributions to \nthe current occupants of the White House.\n  This distinguished body has the obligation to insure that Federal \ncontracts are awarded through full, open, and competitive procedures. \nThe Open Competition Act which I am introducing today along with \nSenators Lott, Nickles, Mack, Coverdell, Craig, Thurmond, Jeffords, \nCoats, Gregg, Frist, Enzi, Collins, Warner, McConnell, Allard, \nBrownback, Hagel, Kyl, and Roberts, guarantees that our constitutional \nprerogatives will not be infringed upon.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and \nguarantee to the American worker that their own Government will not \ndiscriminate against them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Open Competition Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION REGARDING CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN LABOR \n                   RELATIONS POLICIES OF OFFERORS ON FEDERALLY \n                   FUNDED CONTRACTS.\n\n       Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following: \n     ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no person \n     may be discriminated against when bidding on a prime \n     contract, funded in whole or in part with funds provided by \n     the Federal Government, where such discrimination is based in \n     whole or in part on a requirement that such person enter into \n     or adhere to a collective bargaining agreement or any similar \n     agreement as a condition of performing work under the \n     contract.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       The amendment made by section 2 shall not be construed--\n       (1) to apply to subcontractors, or\n       (2)(A) to prohibit a contractor from voluntarily entering \n     into a lawful agreement with a labor organization; or\n       (B) to discourage contractors who have entered into such an \n     agreement from bidding on Federal contracts.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICATION.\n\n       The amendment made by section 2 shall apply to contracts \n     made directly with any agency of the Federal Government and \n     to contracts made with any entity that is managing or \n     operating a facility owned or controlled by the Federal \n     Government on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas not \nonly for his statement and understanding of the issue but for taking \nthe initiative affirmatively to correct it. I only wish it had not been \nthe case that the legislative branch has engaged in legislation to \nprotect its constitutional rights.\n  If I might, I will take just a moment to describe by precedent the \nsequence of events that are occurring here. In the 1992 campaign for \nPresident, President Clinton took a position on striker replacement \nwhich had been in labor law since the mid-1930's, which, under certain \ncircumstances, would allow a company meeting certain criteria to \nreplace strikers who were striking not over economic matters. This has \nbeen a contentious issue. The President said he would support \nlegislation that would prohibit that, even though it has been in labor \nlaw for over three decades.\n  He was thwarted in that. Even though he controlled the Congress--he \ncontrolled the White House and he had a majority in the Senate and the \nHouse--and he could not secure consensus on that pledge that he had \nmade. So the beginning of this new concept began to unfold, even in the \nearly days of this administration. The President issued an Executive \norder on striker replacement because, as I said, he had promised this \nin his campaign, could not get the Congress to agree.\n  After wooing labor during the election with promises of a ban, \nPresident Clinton made good on his pledge on March 8, 1995, when he \nissued Executive Order 12954, titled, ``Ensuring the Economical and \nEfficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government \nContracts.'' The order authorized the Secretary of Labor to debar a \ncontractor after finding that the contractor has permanently replaced \nlawfully striking employees, thus, making the contractor ineligible to \nreceive Government contracts.\n\n  As I said, Congress had rejected this legislatively. So the President \nignored the will of the people, ignored the Congress, and imposed it \nthrough an Executive order. Now, what happened? Well, back to the \ningeniousness of the forefathers. There is an executive, legislative, \nand judicial branch. Quite properly--I repeat, properly--a Federal \nappeals court unanimously declared that the Executive order exceeded \nthe President's authority. He had overreached. He was governing by \ndecree. This is not a part of the American republic.\n  Now, here we come again, another Presidential campaign is carried \nout, commitments are made, but the President is finding a people's \nbranch, the legislative branch, that will not accept an egregious \ncommand that excludes 80 percent of the work force. So according to the \nBureau of National Affairs publication, it says, ``The proposed \nExecutive order would encourage Federal agencies to consider requiring \nthe use of a project labor agreement for federally funded construction \nprojects.'' This is interesting language in the draft: ``The Executive \norder was jointly developed by the Building and Construction Trades \nDepartment, the AFL-CIO, and the Clinton administration,'' according to \nRobert A. Geogine, BCTD President, the President of that union.\n  Here we have this new Senate Chamber, opened in 1859, and the House \non the other side, the House and the Senate and the legislative \nprocess; but one trade union drew this law that would be imposed on all \nthe American people and that would exclude 80 percent of the work force \nfrom having an opportunity to engage in these contracts.\n  Mr. President, to add to this sequence of events, making it a little \nclearer--this is a new form of making laws in the American Republic, \nfar from these hallowed Halls. This is a memo to the national and \ninternational union presidents from John J.\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nSweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. It says: ``Support for a proworker \nFederal procurement reform * * *'' dated March 25, 1997. What it \ndoesn't say is it's support for 20 percent of the workers, in a very \nselect category, and to the exclusion of the others. And it says: ``As \nyou may recall, the Clinton administration recently announced its \nintention to undertake several initiatives that will,'' in his words, \n``protect workers' rights and workplace standards * * *''--he is \ntalking about the workers that belong to his union, not the rest of the \nworkers--``* * * while improving Federal Government procurement and \ncontracting practices * * *''--which means that the practices are \ndesigned to benefit his interest but not the other 80 percent. It says: \n``If properly implemented, these initiatives will affect the \nexpenditure of * * *''--his words--``hundreds of billions of dollars \nevery year.'' In any given year, Federal contracts total as much as \n$200 billion, and Federal contractors and subcontractors employ \napproximately one-fifth of the labor force.\n  He goes on in the memorandum to say, ``The Government will be issuing \nproposed regulations that will accomplish three reforms. First, the \nGovernment will evaluate whether a bidder for a Government contract has \na satisfactory record of labor relations.''\n  Well, who makes that decision? I guess it would be made in the same \nroom in which these procurement regulations were written, and that they \nwould become the arbitrators of what is a satisfactory performance, \njust like they are the authors of this law that is being placed on the \npeople of America, without any lawmaker ever voting on it.\n  He goes on to say: ``Second, the Government will not reimburse \nFederal contractors for the costs they incur in unsuccessfully \ndefending against an unfair labor practice suit.''\n  This has been an argument in the Labor Relations Board for over 30 \nyears, as I said.\n  ``Third, the Government will not reimburse contractors for the money \nthey spent to fight unionization.'' Perhaps, but this is where we make \nthese decisions, not wherever this room was. This goes on to say--and \nthis is a very pertinent paragraph in this memo of March 25: \n``President Clinton will also issue an Executive order directing all \nFederal departments to consider using a project labor agreement when \nthey undertake Government-funded construction projects. This order is \nnot subject to notice and comment, or other administrative steps.'' I \nrepeat, ``This order is not subject to notice and comment, or other \nadministrative steps.'' In other words, fiat, decree, governance by \ndecree. And then it goes on and meticulously points out how the \nrecipients of this memorandum should begin building cases. Lawyers \nshould provide citations to the National Labor Relations Board and \ncopies of all decisions, settlement agreements, et cetera. Organizers \nshould provide information about campaigns and work sites. And \nlobbyists should review their files where local unions and other \ninternal bodies have requested intervention, et cetera, et cetera, et \ncetera.\n\n  Decree--written in some room between the Building Construction Trade \nDepartment, the AFL-CIO, and the President. It is a new way of writing \nlaw, Mr. President.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to my good colleague from Idaho, Senator \nCraig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Georgia for \nthe time he has taken today to bring this critical issue to the floor \nand for an open discussion among Senators and, hopefully, the American \npeople on a proposed Executive order that our President is at least \ntalking about at this moment, and that the Vice President has pledged \nthat the administration will act upon, which would significantly change \nthe dynamics of Federal contracting.\n  Without doubt, open competition in a free enterprise environment is \nthe only way the Government of this country and the taxpayers can \nexpect fair treatment of the tax dollar when it comes to buying the \ngoods of Government or the projects of Government for the citizens of \nthis country. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year in this \nbusiness of contracting.\n  As Government provides services and, of course, provides capital \nexpenditures for construction of roads, bridges, and buildings, that \nare a part of what we think is necessary, for the President to suggest \na whole new dynamics as to how that contracting ought to come about, \nsignificantly skewing it toward organized labor is, at best, not being \nresponsible to the taxpayers and, at worst, if I can simply say it, \npaying off for the great service provided in the last election by \norganized labor to the Democrat party.\n  Is that a blunt and cold statement? Well, it is. But it falls on the \nheels of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of expenditures, \ntargeted specifically at members of the Republican Party. And now I \nmust say that it appears that union bosses were literally sitting \ninside the offices of this administration to help craft what we \nbelieved would be a significant change in the way the bidding process \nof a fair and competitive market would work on Government contracts. \n``Require Federal departments and agencies to evaluate whether a bidder \nfor a Government contract has a satisfactory record of labor relations \nand other employment practices, in determining whether or not the \nbidder is a responsible contractor, eligible to receive a particular \nGovernment contract.''\n  This regulation, if it were to become regulation under Executive \norder, would require the companies bidding for Federal contracts to \nhave a spotless record of compliance throughout the Federal regulatory \nspectrum, including collective bargaining, wages, benefits, equal \nopportunity, health, and safety.\n  In an era of regulatory overkill, when OSHA can issue a $13,200 fine \nto a roofing company for having a broken shovel in the back of a truck, \nmy guess is there is hardly a potential contractor out there today that \ncan meet all of this criteria. And now we have added dramatically to it \na second possibility, ``to prohibit Government reimbursement of Federal \ncontracts for the costs they incur in unsuccessfully defending against \nor settling unfair labor practice complaints brought against them by \nthe NLRB.'' ``Prohibit Government reimbursement of contractors for \nmoney they spend to fight unionization of their employees,'' and so on \nand so forth.\n  Why is it significant that we talk about this today? The Executive \norder that we are concerned about has not yet been issued. Well, here \nis the reason why we talk about it and think it is extremely important. \nIt wasn't very long ago that the Vice President went before organized \nlabor and suggested to them that there would be an Executive order sent \nforward on worker replacement, and it was. It took a Federal court \naction to strike down this particular action on the part of the \nadministration as simply being outside the law in relation to the \nNational Labor Relations Board and its ability to make decisions. And, \ntherefore, it was an illegal act, or certainly an act outside the law, \nand the decision was struck down.\n  Now, it is interesting that our Vice President would follow the same \nprocess. I think that we can suggest to the courts that this kind of an \nExecutive order would fall under very similar kinds of guidelines that \nthe one of a year ago did, because it probably falls under the Supreme \nCourt's decision of 1986 of Wisconsin Department of Industries.\n  I think what concerns all of us is the use of Executive order and \nrule and regulation on the part of this administration, instead of \ncoming to the Congress of the United States and saying this is good \npolicy. Do you mean this policy can't be debated on the floor of the \nSenate and voted on as a part of the law for contracting of Government \nprograms? It should be, if that is how we are going to make public \npolicy instead of by Executive order of the kind and the nature that is \nbeing talked about in this potential Executive order. Union-only \nsubject agreements clearly have an exclusive and an anticompetitive \nnature to them. It is not for me to give an anti-union speech. Clearly, \ncompanies that are unionized ought to have every right to bid. But \nother companies that meet reasonable standards can compete over good \nbids, and do it in a fair and responsible way and provide the service \nto the Government as expected. They ought to have\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\na right in that same market. That is exactly what George Bush said when \nhe said it very clearly in 1992 in an Executive order requiring all \nFederal agencies to use an open competitive process for all Federal \ncontracts. President Clinton's executive order would revoke this \nbasically. That was revoked in 1983, and this would go even further to \nnarrow it and define who could bid. It just so happens that only a \nlimited few could bid. Last year, if this Executive order, as we \nunderstand it, were in place--I guess it is a contract for fiscal year \n1993--it would have been well over 13 percent more of them at about \n$182 billion.\n\n  In addition to contracts with major corporations, a study identified \nwith contracts with Duke University, with Loyola University, and \nothers, would fall subject to them and could well shut them off from \ntheir kind of contracts for research and development in the area of \nAIDS research in one and biomedical research in another.\n  Mr. President, what our President proposes and what the Vice \nPresident has openly talked about to be expected this next week is in \nitself, in my opinion, a travesty of the way Government works and the \nway the executive and the legislative branch come together to build \ngood public policy. This is special interest group legislating in the \nworst form. It is very bold, and it is very open. But, then again, \nhundreds of millions of dollars worth of campaign contributions later, \nI guess they can figure they can be that bold and that open because, \ncertainly, in the shadow of what has occurred in the last election, \nthis appears to be a response to those kinds of levels of \nparticipation.\n  I thank my colleague and the Senator from Georgia for bringing this \nissue to the floor. It must be talked about. It must be understood \nopenly by the American people. And, as I say, what the American people \nwant for their tax dollar, its expenditure for and purchase of \nGovernment services and the need for capital expenditure within the \nGovernment is a fair and open bidding process and a good product in the \nend. Certainly, the President at this moment may well be accused of \nattempting to skew that into less competitive and most assuredly a less \nopen process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nusual contribution. He has contributed substantively to this \ndiscussion.\n\n\n                     Privilege of the Floor--S. 495\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jeanine Esperna, staff \nmember, and David Stephens, fellow for Senator Kyl, be granted \nprivileges of the floor this afternoon during consideration of S. 495.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to first make it clear--and I \nthink Senator Craig alluded to this--that this is a constitutional \nconfrontation. There is a growing propensity on the part of the \nadministration, faced with a Congress that the people elected that are \nof a majority of the other party, to try to obviate the legislative \nbranch through two courses: By Executive order or decree--and we have \ncertainly seen the abuses of that throughout the world, which is why \nthe Republic is so carefully constructed; and by regulation, which is \nsomething that has become unique in our own development in this \ncountry, where more and more regulators are lawmakers. You can't blame \nthis administration alone for that kind of activity, but it has \ncertainly accelerated.\n  I want to point out that I have already pointed out that the U.S. \nappellate court struck down the President's last attempt at this kind \nof reconstruction of the Republic. But there are other judicial \nprecedents.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the remainder of my time in just a \nmoment. I see my good friend from Alabama. They are dealing with the \nlogistics of time here in terms of trying to deal with the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  I will close by simply saying there is a growing outrage in the \nCongress with regard to these attempts to reconstruct lawmaking. \nLawmaking in America cannot be done in an isolated room with just \nspecial interests. Obviously, all interests have a rising ability to \ncontribute their thoughts so long as they are debated and aired \nultimately in the people's body and not bypassed. This is a clear \nattempt to bypass the legislature, and I do not believe it will be \nsuccessful. Perhaps the administration needs to take counsel with \nitself with regard to the suggestions they have put forward--that major \nlabor law would be written somewhere other than the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all remaining time to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3317-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3320-S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THREAT REDUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Threat Reduction Act.\n  With the end of the cold war, we live in a much safer, but still \nunstable, world. Without the bi-polar domination of two superpowers, we \nnow face a world comprised of many nations that have gained power on \nthe world stage by producing a relatively inexpensive means of war.\n  Among the most deplorable methods of war-making known to the world, \nchemical and biological weapons are horrific tools of mass destruction.\n  Long ago, the United States discontinued and dismantled its \nbiological weapons program and is currently unilaterally destroying its \nstockpile of poison gas. We would hope that other nations would follow \nsuit, and destroy these weapons as well.\n  However, there are rogue States that are pursuing dangerous weapons \nprograms contrary to international norms against the use and \nstockpiling of biological and chemical weapons.\n  Some countries are even suspected of pledging to ratify international \nagreements, while secretly continuing to develop and stockpile these \nlethal weapons.\n  One significant problem in the fight against chemical and biological \nweapons is the stunning lack of enforcement of existing international \nprotocols.\n  International agreements, such as the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the \n1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, ban the use of poison gas \nin war and prohibit the acquisition, development, production, and \nstockpiling of biological weapons. However, they have not been used as \nan effective deterrent.\n  For example, as the world watched with horror and disbelief when Iraq \nused poison gas against its own nationals, the community of nations \nfailed to punish the perpetrators of this act.\n  In addition, there is currently no U.S. law which provides criminal \nor civil penalties relating to the use of these weapons in the United \nStates.\n  Therefore, with the hope of reinforcing U.S. international leadership \non chemical and biological weapons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nChemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act.\n  This legislation demonstrates our firm commitment to destroy U.S. \nchemical weapons, setting a strong example for other countries to \nfollow.\n  Further, this initiative reinvigorates U.S. efforts to enforce \nexisting international prohibitions against chemical weapons, provides \nstrong deterrence, and sends a clear message to nations around the \nworld that the United States will not tolerate the use of these \nweapons.\n  Specifically, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction \nAct sets out civil and criminal penalties for the acquisition, \npossession, transfer, and use of chemical and biological weapons.\n  This legislation mandates the death penalty where the use of these \nweapons leads to the loss of life and provides for a $100,000 penalty \nfor civil violations.\n  The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act requires \nenhancements to U.S. chemical and biological defenses to protect our \nmilitary men and women. Further, it would require U.S. sanctions, \ntermination of foreign assistance, and suspension of diplomatic \nrelations against any country that uses chemical and biological weapons \nagainst another country or its own people.\n  The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act provides\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nconcrete and achievable measures to reduce the threat of these \nabhorrent weapons. It is the best thing we can do to protect our \ncountry, our allies, and our world from any future atrocities caused by \nthe use of chemical and biological weapons.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first I want to go ahead and speak on the \nlegislation, S. 495, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat \nReduction Act of 1997, in the interest of time. I think this is very \nimportant legislation, and I wanted to comment on it. But while we are \nin the final efforts to get an agreement on the unanimous consent \nagreement on how to consider the completion of this legislation, then \nwhen and how to take up the Chemical Weapons Convention next week, and \nhow issues that are still in disagreement would be handled and how the \nmotions to strike would be ordered--all of that is in the final phases \nof negotiation at this time.\n  I would like to thank, at the beginning, Senator Kyl for the work he \nhas put into this legislation and for his effort to come up with a fair \nand reasonable unanimous consent agreement as to how we would \nproceed. I thank Senator Helms for his cooperation and the highly \nrespectable and respectful manner in which he has dealt with this issue \nin the very important hearings he had.\n\n  Also, Senator Daschle has been persistent, but he has been reasonable \nin allowing us to have time to work through all the details. I think \nwith an agreement of this importance and with as many parts to it as \nthere is, you never could get it worked out to where it would just be \n100 percent what everybody wants. But I think we have gotten it now to \nwhere it is fair, and I hope we can go ahead and close the loop, \ncomplete consideration of the legislation and then be prepared next \nweek to move to the treaty itself.\n  I see the Democratic leader is on the floor.\n  Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the bill, in anticipation \nof entering into a unanimous-consent agreement, I will first observe \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  I withhold. Does the Senator from Texas wish to proceed at this time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was going to proceed if there was no \nbusiness in the Chamber, subject to the Senator from Arizona saying I \nwould not encroach on his time.\n  Apparently that is the case.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas will need to extend \nmorning business for the time she wishes to speak.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona because, in fact, I do want to talk \nabout the bill that will be in the Chamber very shortly. The bill is \nsponsored by the junior Senator from Arizona, the Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Threat Reduction Act. I am an original cosponsor of \nthis bill. I think it is very important that we pass this bill. This \nbill provides the most strength that we will ever be able to get to \ndeal with the real chemical and biological weapons issues.\n  I like this bill because it has real teeth. It permits the U.S. \nmilitary to use tear gas, for instance, when it is necessary to rescue \na downed pilot or for the control of prisoners, which has been done, \nbecause tear gas is basically harmless. I would much prefer that we be \nable to use tear gas rather than shoot people. It would make more \nsense.\n  That is one of the problems, Mr. President, I have with the chemical \nweapons treaty. This bill deals with my concerns in a positive way by \nassuring that we are not going to unilaterally disarm ourselves from a \nweapon such as tear gas. So this solves one of the problems that I have \nwith the Chemical Weapons Convention that we will have in the Chamber a \nfew days from now.\n  This bill also preserves the Australia Group. The Australia Group is \nan effective international export control organization that really has \ndone the most, the very most, to restrict the transfer of biological \nand chemical materials and technology. It is the one thing that is \nworking and would be vitiated by the chemical weapons treaty.\n  So I am very pleased that this preserves the Australia Group because \nthis is the one thing we have that works. This will strengthen U.S. \nbiological and chemical defense programs. It does require Russian \ncooperation and, of course, it is very important that we work together \nwith Russia in the dismantling of their chemical and biological \nweapons. S. 495 has a requirement that we cooperate with Russia. So I \nthink it is a very important, positive step that we must take. Frankly, \nif we can pass this bill, it will take away many of the fears that many \nof us have about the chemical weapons treaty.\n  What this bill does not do is require the sharing of chemical defense \ncapabilities with countries like Iran. That is one of the concerns many \npeople have with the Chemical Weapons Convention, the treaty we will be \ntaking up toward the end of next week. S. 495 does not require such \nsharing. So we would not have to sit down with a country like Iran--\nknowing that they will not abide by the treaty as we do--and share our \nchemical weapons capabilities or secrets with them. We do not produce \nchemical weapons, but we certainly have the technologies to do so in \nthis country. In that case, of course, we should know what is going on \nwith chemical weapons in other countries.\n\n  This bill does not require the expansion of trade in chemicals. This \nis another concern that we have with the chemical weapons treaty that \nS. 495 addresses. We are not going to expand the trade.\n  We are not going to circumvent the United States Constitution with \nthis bill. S. 495 will not take away the fourth amendment right against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, which many of us believe is \ninherent in the chemical weapons treaty. It certainly does not permit \nan intrusive inspection of U.S. businesses by international inspection \nteams, which is another concern that we have with the chemical weapons \ntreaty. Small businesses that are making chemical-related products \nshould not suddenly be faced with a surprise inspection by an \ninternational team of experts. And who knows for what kind of \nintelligence those groups would be looking? Who knows who would even be \nin the groups? What kind of protection would a small company making \nfertilizer or cleaning products have against unwarranted intrusion by \nan international group that might include someone from the Government \nof Iran or the Government of China? Who could really tell exactly who \nwould be in those groups?\n  I think the Senator from Arizona has fashioned a very good bill. It \nis a positive bill. It does alleviate many of the concerns that others \nhave expressed about the reliability, the verifiability and the \nnegative impact of the chemical weapons treaty, but it also makes this \ncountry stronger in its ability to enforce restrictions against the \nactual export of products that could be used in producing chemical \nweapons. The Australia Group is the best avenue that we have, and S. \n495 would preserve it.\n  So I commend the Senator from Arizona. I am very pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill. I am pleased that he is gaining \ncosponsors by the minute. I think people are beginning to see that we \ndo have an alternative to stiffen the penalties, to stiffen our resolve \nagainst chemical and biological weapons and at the same time, make sure \nthat we have laws with real teeth that would disallow the export of \nproducts that could be used to produce chemical weapons from our \ncountry or other countries in the Australia Group. This is the kind of \nlegislation that I think will help make America stronger and will help \nprotect this great country even more from the future use of chemical or \nbiological weapons.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Texas for a brilliant statement. I \nreally appreciate that very much.\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ashcroft be added as a cosponsor \nof S. 495.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic leader and I, we \njust want to announce again that what we are about to do within the \nnext 10 minutes or so is offer a unanimous-consent agreement on the \nChemical Weapons Convention. We are still working to make sure we have \na mutual understanding of exactly what is in it, and we want all \nSenators to be aware that we are preparing to do that.\n  I would be glad to yield at this point to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the majority leader's yielding.\n  I heard him thank a number of people, and I want to express my \ngratitude as well to the majority leader and so many others who have \nbrought us to this point. We have hot-lined this unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Let me just urge all of my Democratic colleagues to respond as \nfavorably and as quickly as they possibly can. I have very closely \nexamined once more this request, and I must say I think it is fair to \nall sides. It is not everything we would like, but it is not everything \nthat the Republicans would like either. It is important for purposes of \ncompleting our work on time that we get this agreement today, this \nafternoon.\n  So I urge my Democratic colleagues to support the request and to \nallow us to enter into an agreement no later than 2:15 this afternoon. \nSo again I thank the majority leader, all of those on our side of the \naisle for their great work in bringing us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3320-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of this \nlegislation that has been drafted by Senator Kyl and joined in with \ncosponsorship from Senators Helms, Nickles, Mack, Coverdell, Shelby, \nHutchison, and myself, as well as others. We introduced this \nlegislation on March 21. This is important legislation. I know there \nare a lot of people who are trying to assess will this legislation \nfavorably or unfavorably affect the final vote on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. I do not think you can really judge that. Senators that \nwill vote on both sides of the issue on this bill and that bill will \nview it in different ways depending on their own personal perspective. \nThe most important thing is this is a bill we should have passed. We \nshould already have passed it irrespective of what might happen on the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  As I have gotten into this issue and studied this bill, I am amazed \nthat we do not already have laws on the books dealing with sanctions \nagainst any country that uses chemical and biological weapons against \nanother country or its own nationals, that we do not allow a range of \nchemical and biological weapons within the United States. I cannot \nbelieve we have not already done it.\n  This is very good legislation. I hope action on this legislation will \nput one myth to rest once and for all: No one supports chemical weapons \nin the United States. Everyone is opposed to them. We all know they are \nterrible things. Whether they are used in a military situation or \ncivilian situation like we have seen in recent instances in other parts \nof the world, they are a horrendous thing and they should be eliminated \nfrom the face of the Earth in any way we can do it.\n  As a matter of U.S law, our chemical weapons stockpile will be \ndestroyed by 2004. No matter what happens on the chemical weapons \ntreaty, we already made a commitment and in fact are in the process of \ndestroying our own stockpiles by 2004. Whether or not we pass this bill \nor whether or not we ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \nweapons in the United States are being destroyed.\n  Next week, when we get this UC agreement worked out, the Senate will \ndebate and vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I have a number of \nkey concerns about the convention which have not yet been resolved, but \nto the credit of the proponents and the administration, they have been \nworking with us, I believe, in good faith. We have had a number of \nminor and some major improvements. We are still working on that \nlanguage at this very moment. But fundamental issues exist, some of \nwhich have not been resolved.\n\n  I do think that requiring search warrants for involuntary searches is \nessential. Protecting United States intelligence information is vital; \nensuring United States chemical defensive technology and equipment, \nmaking sure it is not shared with Iran or other countries that could \npossibly under this convention get access to United States information \nor information from other parts of the world in terms of how chemical \ntechnology can be utilized for chemical weapons or also how that \ntechnology or equipment could be used in defense capability. We do not \nwant that kind of information spread throughout the globe to those \nrogue countries that in fact have already been using chemical weapons, \nhave that capability and have indicated they either will be in the \nconvention or may not.\n  But serious concerns remain. Whether the convention is verifiable \nenough, whether Russia is taking steps to perhaps violate the treaty \nand, most importantly, whether provisions in the convention actually \nincrease the likelihood of chemical weapons proliferation, those are \nall very important questions and we will vote on those issues next week \nin one form or another through a motion to strike or on final passage. \nI know all Senators are weighing the information very seriously. To the \ncredit of our committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, in the \nhearings they have been having, we have been hearing testimony from \nvery distinguished Americans on both sides of the issue.\n  It is being analyzed and critiqued in articles and editorials. I \nbelieve the Senate now is focusing on this issue, and that is as it \nshould be. This bill will help to do that.\n  Today, though, the Senate will have an opportunity to take real \nenforceable and effective action to address the threat of chemical \nweapons. The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act \nincludes comprehensive domestic and international steps to act against \nthese horrible weapons.\n  Domestically, this bill provides for civil and criminal penalties for \nthe acquisition, possession, transfer or use of chemical or biological \nweapons. Again, it is amazing we do not already have this on the books.\n  It designates the FBI as the lead domestic agency to address chemical \nweapons threats.\n  Our bill provides for a Federal death penalty in cases when the use \nof weapons results in the loss of life. Swift and certain punishment \ncan help ensure that terrorists do not use chemical weapons against \nAmerica, and ending bureaucratic struggles can help ensure any \nterrorists get caught quickly.\n  Internationally, this legislation directs the administration to add \nenforcement provisions to existing international bans on the use of \nchemical weapons. Use of chemical weapons has been banned since 1925 in \nthe Geneva Protocol, but the world knows this ban has not been \neffective. In fact, in the 1980's, after clear evidence--clear \nevidence--of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against its own people, the \ninternational community did nothing--did nothing. It is time to add \nenforcement mechanisms to that Geneva Protocol.\n  S. 495 includes a number of provisions to stem chemical and \nbiological weapons proliferation around the world. It requires \nmandatory sanctions on countries which use these weapons.\n  It mandates enhancements to our chemical and biological defenses.\n  It requires the administration to name names in an annual report to \nidentify the people and the countries\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nwhich are aiming for and aiding the chemical weapons programs of rogue \nstates.\n  I believe these provisions make good common sense. I believe the \nAmerican people would want us to upgrade our chemical defenses and to \nimpose sanctions on countries that use weapons of mass destruction.\n  Much has been said about another provision of the legislation \nrequiring certain minimum criteria be met before United States \ntaxpayers send dollars to Russia. Our legislation calls on Russia to \nimplement and comply with the bilateral destruction agreement it signed \n5 years ago to present accurate information about its chemical weapons \nprogram and to comply with the Biological Weapons Convention signed \nmore than 20 years ago.\n  I cannot understand why anyone would oppose this provision. U.S. aid \nis not an entitlement to be given no matter how recipients behave. If \nRussia complies with its agreements, Russia should get assistance as it \nmoves toward more free enterprise and more toward democracy. If they do \nnot comply, why in the world should they get aid? But there have been \nconcerns about the impact this legislation might have on the so-called \nNunn-Lugar legislation.\n  Senator Kyl from Arizona has heard those concerns, and, as I \nunderstand it, he has a modification that has addressed that problem.\n  We have heard much over the past few weeks about what the Senate \nshould do to prevent the spread of chemical weapons and related \ntechnologies and equipment. Many people say the Chemical Weapons \nConvention will do that. I have my doubts. I am not sure that the day \nafter that vote--if, in fact, it should pass--that we will have fewer \nchemical weapons in the world. I fear that without further action, we \ncould have more. That is a basic, fundamental part of the concerns that \nI have and that I have enumerated over the past few days and weeks to \nthe proponents of the legislation.\n  Today, though, the Senate can vote for the Kyl bill and take serious \nsteps for enforcement of effective and achievable chemical weapons arms \ncontrol.\n  Once we enter into this unanimous consent request and, hopefully, its \nagreement, we will begin the actual debate under a time arrangement \nthat we have worked out, I believe, and go to completion of this bill, \nhopefully, by a relatively early hour this afternoon. Hopefully, we can \nget it done between 4 and 5 o'clock. We will be prepared to make that \nrequest shortly.\n  Mr. President, we have another 5 minutes, I believe, remaining in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are still in the process of trying to work \nout the details of a unanimous-consent agreement. Part of the question \nis whether we can get to a vote on this matter by 3:45, or thereabouts, \nthis afternoon. We are trying to leap to that conclusion, and in order \nto allow people to continue to talk about that and perhaps reach that \npoint, I am going to begin discussing this bill now as if it were \nbefore us, so I will not have to speak later and, therefore, we will \nnot have to use more time, hoping to be helpful in that regard.\n  What we are talking about doing here this afternoon is having a \ncouple hours of debate on a bill called the Chemical and Biological \nWeapons Threat Reduction Act. The bill is S. 495. This legislation is \nbefore us because in the process of leading up to the debate on the \nChemical Weapons Convention itself--which, if there is a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, will be taken up next week--we discovered there were \nseveral things actually we could do right now, very practical, \nrealistic steps we could take to help ameliorate the threat. Senator \nHutchison from Texas has already spoken to it. Let me detail what those \nthings are.\n  It, basically, involves closing some loopholes in existing law and \nensuring that the administration and the Congress work together in \nthose ways that we can, right here at home, irrespective of whether the \nChemical Weapons Convention passes or does not pass, to actually reduce \nthis threat. One example of the kind of thing we are talking about is \nthe fact that existing U.S. law does not make it a crime to manufacture \nor possess chemical weapons in the United States. If we are going to \nhave this big debate about the chemical weapons treaty, the first thing \nyou want to do is make sure that kind of activity is outlawed here at \nhome. It is a provision of the law we add as a result of S. 495.\n  There are several things like that in this bill, and I will go \nthrough them briefly. I want to assure my colleagues, whether you are \nfor the Chemical Weapons Convention or opposed to the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, this legislation is legislation you can support. If you are \nagainst the convention, you can see this as an alternative. If you are \nfor it, you can see it as a supplement. I am not trying to sell it as \neither one. I am saying these are good, practical steps we can take \nright now, and we should do it.\n  Let me quickly go through the specifics of the provisions of the \nlegislation. I think my colleagues will see it is exactly as we have \nsaid that it is.\n  For the first time in history, we would be criminalizing the entire \nrange of chemical weapons activities. The current law only prohibits \nthe use or attempt or conspiracy to use chemical weapons. It does \noutlaw, with respect to biological weapons, the possession or \nmanufacture. We combine the two and say that it is against the law to \nmanufacture, to possess, to use or to conspire to use either chemical \nor biological weapons. So, for the first time, we contain all of those \nthings in our criminal code, and that is against the law in the United \nStates. That is the first thing this bill would do.\n  The second thing it would do is to revoke certain export privileges \nof companies that violate the law. That is a commonsense proposition, \nand it has the additional benefit, by the way, of helping us to prevent \nAmerican companies from assisting countries who we believe should not \nhave chemicals, the precursors to making their biological or chemical \nweapons.\n  The third section deals with sanctions against the use of chemical or \nbiological weapons. Mr. President, today under existing law, the \nPresident of the United States is obligated to impose sanctions against \ncountries that use chemical or biological weapons, and he is given a \nlist of 10 sanctions that he is to impose. They are in two different \ntiers--five in one tier and five in another tier. He also has a waiver \nauthority.\n  What we do in this legislation is to grant him more flexibility, to \nkeep the same sanctions, but not to have the one tier and two tier. So \nhe can actually decide, based upon the circumstances at the time, \nexactly how he wants to proceed. The price for that flexibility is that \nwe reduce somewhat his flexibility on the waiver, but he still has the \nability, under the supreme-national-interest-waiver clause to waive the \nimposition of those sanctions should he deem it appropriate.\n  Obviously, that waiver would not likely be used by a President if a \ncountry actually used chemical or biological weapons. He would, under \nthe law today, under the law as we have it written today, want to \nimpose sanctions. As I said, we provide more flexibility in those \nsanctions.\n  In addition, in this section, we call on the President to block \ntransactions of any property that is owned by a country found to have \nused chemical or biological weapons. In other words, just to use a \nhypothetical, country A uses biological or chemical weapons, and they \nhave assets in banks in the United States. The President could block \nany transaction of that property, basically freeze those assets as a \nway of preparing to indemnify victims of the use of that chemical \nweapon. This is a way we can provide real, meaningful relief. This is \nnew in law. This does not exist today. We would have a way, therefore, \nat least of providing a fund should we be able to indemnify victims of \nsuch a horrible, horrible crime.\n\n  Another thing we do is have a section on continuation and enhancement \nof\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nmultilateral control regimes, which is really a fancy way of saying \nthat we are expressing the sense of the Senate and establishing United \nStates policy that the President continue to maintain our role in the \nAustralia group, that group of countries that has agreed among itself \nnot to trade chemicals to countries we believe might want to use them \nto create a biological or chemical weapon with them.\n  We establish the policy that the President will attempt to block any \nattempt to substantially weaken the controls established by the \nAustralia group. I believe that as a general proposition--this is the \nadministration's policy anyway--I do not think that this is \nparticularly new, but it puts into statute our policy expressing this \nstrong position. It should, therefore, assist the President in the \nadvocacy of that position in the Australia group meetings.\n  There is another section dealing with assistance to Russia. A year \nago, in the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, the Congress actually \nfenced, meaning it set aside the expenditure of funds under the so-\ncalled Nunn-Lugar provision for chemical- and biological-related \nactivities. We did this because we felt there was some question about \nwhether Russia was actually proceeding in good faith to dismantle their \nchemical and biological capability. As a result of the compromise that \nwas struck by Senators Nunn and Lugar, there was actually a provision \nfor four conditions in that legislation that had to be certified by the \nPresident prior to the release of part of these funds.\n  What we have done in this legislation is to reinstate--essentially \nthe same language that was in that 1996 defense authorization bill--and \nto reestablish those four conditions for certification by the \nPresident. Those conditions, as I said, are essentially the same \nconditions that existed before and would be certified by the President \nor, as was done in that defense authorization bill, the President could \nalso release the funds if he formally certifies that he is unable to \nmake the certification.\n  So the President has total flexibility here, but at least it focuses \nattention on the degree of cooperation by the Russians with respect to \nthe dismantlement of their CW and BW programs.\n  The next section calls for reports on the state of chemical and \nbiological weapons proliferation. It asks the administration to provide \nus an annual classified report that will enable us to better understand \nthe threat that is out there.\n  The next section would strengthen the 1925 Geneva Protocol. It is a \nsense of the Senate, but what it does do is urge and direct the \nSecretary of State to work to convene an international negotiating \nforum for the purpose of putting some teeth into this 1925 Geneva \nProtocol, which is the agreement that actually prevents or prohibits \nthe use of chemical weapons, not just the manufacture or possession of \nthem. We provide $5 million for the State Department to begin this \nprocess.\n\n  We think this would be useful because countries of greatest concern \nto us, like Iran and Iraq, North Korea, Russia, China, Syria, and \nLibya, are all signatories to the 1925 Geneva Protocol. If we could \nmake an international agreement that puts some teeth into that, it \nwould be clearly useful. As I say, it is a sense of the Senate, but we \nbelieve it is useful nonetheless.\n  Next it says, until the United States has developed its resolution of \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention--if it does--we would \nnot be providing funding for that organization.\n  The next section is that it is the sense of the Senate that we \nactually do some things to beef up our military defenses against the \nuse of chemical or biological weapons.\n  The General Accounting Office, in 1996, issued a report that was very \ndistressing in that it reported that U.S. forces are inadequately \nequipped, organized, trained and exercised for operations in \nbattlefields in which chemical and biological weapons are being used.\n  So this bill recommends three specific corrective steps to deal with \nthat and, as a result, we think, will help to actually improve and \nenhance our defensive capability should our forces ever be confronted \nwith the use of these weapons.\n  The last two sections, Mr. President.\n  The first is relating to negative security assurances. It is a sense \nof the Senate that calls on the President to reevaluate the current \npolicy of the United States on negative assurances and its impact on \ndeterrent strategy.\n  In effect, what this is all about is the following. In return for a \nnation's decision to join the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as a \nnonnuclear weapons state, the United States pledges never to threaten \nor use nuclear weapons against that state unless it was allied with a \nnuclear weapons state in aggression against the United States.\n  So today, when chemical and biological threats seem like the larger \nconcern, this negative security assurance could undermine our effective \ndeterrence against such an attack. Would Saddam Hussein, for example, \nfeel free to use chemical weapons if he did not think we would possibly \nretaliate with nuclear weapons? As a result, that is in here.\n  Finally, we have the riot control agent provision which has been much \nspoken of. We think it is important for the rescue of downed pilots or \nin a situation where civilians are present that riot control agents be \nused. And our act provides for that.\n  These are all, I would say, very helpful, very specific, very \nrealistic provisions that constructively deal with the proliferation of \nthis threat. As a result, we think this legislation is important. \nAgain, as I say, whether you are pro or con on the treaty, this \nlegislation enhances the security of the United States. I certainly \nrequest my colleagues to consider it and to support the vote, assuming \nwe have the vote here before long.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, I want to thank the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Kyl, for his work on this legislation.\n  We do have a unanimous-consent request ready to offer now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3322-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3324-S3327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 495 AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Would the majority leader yield at that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. At that point I would add 1 hour under the control of \nSenator Leahy.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLeahy be recognized then for up to 1 hour on Wednesday, April 23. I ask \nthat additional request be placed at this point in the unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the first 28 conditions, declarations, \nstatements, and understandings shall be identified as being agreed to \nbetween the chairman and ranking minority member, that these 28 \nconditions, declarations, statements, or understandings not be subject \nto further amendments or motions, and it be in order for the Senate to \nvote on the agreed-upon items, and if agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the final 5 of the 33 \nconditions, declarations, statements, or understandings shall be \nidentified as not being agreed to between the chairman and ranking \nminority member, that it be in order for the Democratic leader or his \ndesignee to offer one motion to strike each of the conditions, \ndeclarations, statements, or understandings, as listed below, and the \nmotion be limited to 1 hour to be equally divided.\n  The conditions, declarations, statements, or understandings subject \nto motions to strike are as follows:\n  First, Russian elimination of chemical weapons;\n  Second, chemical weapons in countries other than Russia;\n  Third, designation of inspectors and inspection assistants;\n  Fourth, stemming the proliferation of chemical weapons; and\n  Fifth, essential verifiability.\n  The full text by title is appended hereto. I send it to the desk and \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (29) Russian elimination of chemical weapons.--Prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall certify to the Congress that--\n       (A) Russia is making reasonable progress in the \n     implementation of the Agreement between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on \n     Destruction and Nonproduction of Chemical Weapons and on \n     Measures to Facilitate the Multilateral Convention on Banning \n     Chemical Weapons, signed on June 1, 1990 (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement'');\n       (B) the United States and Russia have resolved, to the \n     satisfaction of the United States, outstanding compliance \n     issues under the Memorandum of Understanding Between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral Verification \n     Experiment and Data Exchange Related to Prohibition on \n     Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on \n     September 23, 1989, also known as the ``1989 Wyoming \n     Memorandum of Understanding'', and the 1990 Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement;\n       (C) Russia has deposited the Russian instrument of \n     ratification for the Convention and is in compliance with its \n     obligations under the Convention; and\n       (D) Russia is committed to forgoing any chemical weapons \n     capability, chemical weapons modernization program, \n     production mobilization capability, or any other activity \n     contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention.\n       (30) Chemical weapons in other states.--\n       (A) Certification requirement.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification the President, in \n     consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, shall \n     certify to the Congress that countries which have been \n     determined to have offensive chemical weapons programs, \n     including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, the Democratic People's \n     Republic of Korea, China, and all other countries determined \n     to be state sponsors of international terrorism, have \n     ratified or otherwise acceded to the Convention.\n       (31) Exercise of right to bar certain inspectors.--\n       (i) In general.--The President shall exercise United States \n     rights under paragraphs 2 and 4 of Part II of the \n     Verification Annex to indicate United States non-acceptance \n     of all inspectors and inspection assistants who are nationals \n     of countries designated by the Secretary of State as \n     supporters of international terrorism under section 40(d) of \n     the Arms Export Control Act, or nationals of countries that \n     have been determined by the President, in the last five \n     years, to have violated United States nonproliferation law, \n     including--\n\n       (I) chapters 7, 8, and 10 of the Arms Export Control Act;\n       (II) sections 821 and 824 of the Nuclear Proliferation \n     Prevention Act of 1994;\n       (III) sections 11b and 11c of the Export Administration Act \n     of 1979;\n       (IV) the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945;

and\n       (ii) by amending Article XI to strike any provision that \n     states or implies disapproval of trade restrictions in the \n     field of chemical activities, including paragraphs 2(b), \n     2(c), 2(d), and 2(e); and\n       (B) no provision has been added to the Convention or to any \n     of its annexes, and no statement, written or oral, has been \n     issued by the Organization, stating or implying the right or \n     obligation of States Parties to share or facilitate the \n     exchange among themselves of chemical weapons defense \n     technology, chemicals, equipment, or scientific and technical \n     information.\n       (33) Effective verification.--\n       (A) Certification.--Prior to the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to Congress that compliance with the Convention is \n     effectively verifiable.\n       (B) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Effectively verifiable.--The term ``effectively \n     verifiable'' means that the Director of Central Intelligence \n     has certified to the President that the United States \n     intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4) of the \n     National Security Act of 1947) has a high degree of \n     confidence in its ability to detect militarily significant \n     violations of the Convention, including the production, \n     possession, or storage of militarily significant quantities \n     of lethal chemicals, in a timely fashion, and to detect \n     patterns of marginal violation over time.\n       (ii) Militarily significant.--The term ``militarily \n     significant'' means one metric ton or more of chemical \n     weapons agent.\n       (iii) Timely fashion.--The term ``timely fashion'' means \n     detection within one year of the violation having occurred.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent no \nsubstitute or second-degree amendments be in order and no other \nreservations, conditions, declarations, statements, or understandings \nbe in order to the resolution of ratification.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority \nleader, after notification of the Democratic leader, to call for a \nclosed session of the Senate, to be held in the Old Senate Chamber, to \nhear confidential debate regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention, not \nto exceed 2 hours, to be equally divided, again, between the two \nleaders or their designees, and 48 hours before moving to the closed \nsession all classified material to be used during the debate by any \nSenator be given to both leaders.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of \nthe above-listed amendments, closed session, and the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution \nof ratification, as amended, all without further action or debate, and \nfollowing the vote the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action or, if the \nresolution is defeated, the resolution to return to the President be \ndeemed agreed to and the Senate resume legislative session.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that prior to the \nMemorial Day recess the majority leader, after notification of the \nDemocratic leader, shall turn to the consideration of the implementing \nlegislation, and it be considered under a time agreement of 2 hours to \nbe equally divided, again, between the chairman and the ranking \nminority member, and there be only one amendment in order to be offered \nby the majority leader or his designee, and one amendment only to be \noffered by the Democratic leader or his designee, and limited to 1 hour \neach, to be equally divided in the usual form, and each amendment must \nbe relevant to the implementing legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I just want to clarify \nthat the amendments we will offer to strike will be in order Thursday \nregardless of whether the 10 hours of debate has been completed and \nthat the vote on the agreed-on reservations will occur prior to \nconsideration of the reservations in this agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me ask you to state that again--that the \nmotions to strike would be in order on Thursday, the 24th, whether or \nnot the 10 hours has been completed?\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\n  Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I could address this \nquestion to the Democratic leader.\n  I do not see any reason why we should not have completed at that \ntime, but you are just saying if the time is not agreed to, you want to \ndelay the actions on the motions to strike.\n  Mr. President, that would be my intent. I think that is what the \nagreement indicates. That is what we will do. I believe we will be able \nto get our time in on Wednesday or we will have an agreement to take \npart of the time Thursday morning and move immediately to a motion to \nstrike, because we want to make sure that that time and those motions \nto strike are in order. And the time is required. There is about 6 \nhours or so. We will make sure that time is there.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I just only clarify this \nbecause that is the understanding. I appreciate very much the \ndistinguished majority leader's assurances in that regard.\n  Mr. President, as I said a moment ago, this is the product of several \ndays' worth of work. I thank the majority leader for his leadership and \nthe cooperation he has shown in bringing us to this point.\n  I also thank Senators Biden, Leahy, Levin, Kerry, Bingaman, and many \nothers who had so much to do on our side with this effort. I think it's \na very good agreement and appreciate the cooperation from all of our \ncolleagues.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I inquire? \nThis agreement would provide for a separate vote on the so-called 28 \nitems in agreement; is that correct? If that is correct, I will have to \nobject because that was never my understanding of the agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me put in a quorum call at this point so \nwe can make sure we understand the question to make sure we go over the \nhistory of why that language would be in there.\n  I must say this is the longest and the most complicated unanimous-\nconsent agreement that I have worked on since I have been majority \nleader. I know that the Senator from West Virginia has probably entered \nin some much longer, more complicated than this. But as I was reading \nthrough it, I even hesitated, to go back and reread at least one \nsection there, to make sure it was accurate. I understood exactly what \nit meant. But we do need to clarify this particular point.\n  I would like to suggest the absence of a quorum so I can get a proper \nexplanation.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be glad to withhold that and yield to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished majority leader yield for a question \nor perhaps a brief statement before he asks for a quorum?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been informed that our offices were \nnotified 20 minutes ago, roughly, about this agreement. I assume that \nit was thought that if there were no objections registered within 15, \n20 minutes, whatever it was, there were none and therefore we would go \nahead with the agreement.\n  It seems to me that at times certainly that is not in the best \ninterest of the Senate. I am not complaining. Here is a very lengthy \nunanimous-consent agreement. I have not seen it. I am not one of the \nprincipal players in this situation. I probably am going to vote for \nthe treaty.\n  But the approval of resolutions of ratification of treaties is one of \nthe unique reasons for the Senate's raison d'etre. Consequently, to \njust, at first blush, come up here to the floor and hear this long \nagreement read and then go along without objecting, at least for a \nlittle while until I can read it, it seems to me I am not doing my duty \nto the Senate, my duty under the Constitution, my duty to my people.\n  Twenty minutes. If a hotline goes to the office on a lengthy \nagreement like this and I am out doing other things--and we do have \nother important duties that are part of the people's business--nobody \nin the office is in a position to approve or to object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, would the distinguished--I do not know \nwho has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to respond, if I could, to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  There were four notifications, I would explain to my dear colleague, \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  First, we had sent out the substance of this agreement about 48 hours \nago. So staffs have had this now for the better part of 2 days.\n  Second, we discussed it in the caucus on Tuesday.\n  Third, we had the opportunity to talk to all relevant committee staff \nand then, of course, to those who had a particular interest in it over \nthe last 24 hours.\n  Then, finally, of course, we have explained it again in a policy \ncommittee just about 2\\1/2\\ hours ago.\n  So I really think that in this case there ought not be any surprises \nfor any of our colleagues if they had an interest.\n  We have really made the effort as this has evolved to bring people \nalong with the understanding of where we are. This is simply a \nconfirmation of what I have been explaining to our caucus now for the \nbetter part of a week.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could say to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, we have been working on both sides of the aisle to make sure \nthat this was a very carefully and fairly drawn unanimous-consent \nagreement. There has been give-and-take on both sides. I am sure the \nway it is set up would not be the first choice for some of our \ncolleagues that are proponents of the treaty. Let me assure you there \nare some things in here that the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms, had to swallow hard to agree to. \nBut we have been talking to Senator Biden, Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, \nSenator McCain, and I am sure that Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy have \nbeen following closely. In fact, let me assure everyone they have been \nfollowing closely, because Senator Leahy got another bite of the apple \nat the end.\n  I believe we have set it up in a way that is fair. We set it up in a \nway, sir, where Senators like yourself will actually take the time to \nread the statements and conditionalities, will have time today and over \nthe weekend and Monday and Tuesday, and even during the debate. We set \nit up carefully so there is adequate time for full debate. With a \nmotion to strike, and hours of debate, we will have, I believe, and I \ncertainly hope, the time to fully discharge our responsibilities.\n  This is a very, very difficult issue for me. I have people I respect \ndearly, ultimately, on both sides of this treaty. It is a very \nimportant treaty dealing with a very important issue. I certainly have \nwanted to be careful about how we set it up, to have the time, have the \nhearings that are necessary so we hear from some of the opponents that \nwe have not heard from, and give the proponents opportunities.\n  I think the leadership always at the end tries to pull it together \nbefore one more cork pops loose, and we try to push it at the \nconclusion, at the end. If we missed a Senator or two, it certainly has \njust not been our intention, and we will work with you in every way we \ncan to make sure you have the time to consider it, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. The only thing I am accusing my leaders of is that they \nalways act with the very best of intentions and they are very sincere.\n  I was at the caucus on Tuesday. I never heard this agreement \ndiscussed. Am I wrong?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not know if you were there. If the distinguished \nSenator will yield again, I do not know that he was there when this \nsegment of it was discussed, but we brought it up at the end of the \ncaucus. I think the Senator may have already left the caucus.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am talking about the details of this agreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is right. We talked about the timeframe--which is \nwhat this agreement addresses--within which all of the legislation \naffecting the agreement will be considered. I spoke at some length in \ndescribing what the scenario would be, and again repeated it, as I \nsaid, at the policy committee this afternoon.\n  Mr. BYRD. I was not at the policy committee this afternoon. That is \nnot the leader's fault. I have had some other things that demand my \nattention, one of them being the election\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nchallenge to Mary Landrieu, which took some time, at least before noon.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Again, I reiterate, we also had the text of this \nagreement. The substantive portions of this agreement have all been \ntransmitted to every Democratic office now for some time. It should be \nin the office of every Senator. Every Democratic Senator and staff \nshould have been well aware of it. We then faxed the specific agreement \nabout an hour ago.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have not seen that. That is not the leader's fault. That \nmay have been my office. It has not been called to my attention. I will \ndiscuss that with my staff. The leader knows we are very short in our \nstaffs--shorthanded. I will go back and take a look at that.\n  There is one thing I thought I had clearly understood, and that was \nwhen we have an agreement and we go to third reading and part of the \nagreement is to the effect that we go immediately after third reading \nwithout further action or debate to final passage, I objected to that \nlast year, but I see that the agreements that are being proposed now go \nback to that same kind of phraseology. I am a little troubled by that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could say, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has made himself very clear on this point. I agree with him.\n  I think that we ought to use the language that will allow for \nconsideration of final passage after reaching the third reading, which \nis what the Senator has suggested.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my previous unanimous-consent \nrequest, which I read into the Record in its entirety, with two \nchanges. On the second page, I would make this change:\n  That the first 28 conditions, declarations, statements, and \nunderstandings shall be identified as being agreed to between the \nchairman and the ranking minority member, that these 28 conditions, \ndeclarations, statements, or understandings not be subject to further \namendments or motions, and a vote occur on adoption of Executive \nResolution 75 to be followed by a vote on the agreed-upon 28 items, \nand, if agreed to, the motion or motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  Basically what that is saying is that there would be a voice vote on \nthe underlying resolution and on the 28 conditions and declarations.\n  Also, at the end of the unanimous-consent request, I would make this \nrequest:\n  I further ask that Senator Leahy be recognized for up to 1 hour on \nWednesday, April 23, and that prior to the adoption of the resolution \nor ratification there be an additional 10 minutes equally divided \nbetween the two leaders at that time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \njust say that I think this has again addressed all of the concerns \nraised. And I appreciate very much everyone's cooperation here. The \nclock is ticking. We are losing time. We need to get on with \nconsideration of the Kyl bill. And I hope now that we can enter into \nthis unanimous-consent agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  No objection is heard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nclarify that this will be a voice vote on both of the two matters \nindicated in the unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I absolutely confirm that that is the case.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object, the \nvoice vote on the which?\n  Mr. LOTT. On the underlying resolution of the committee and on the 28 \nconditions that have been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States eliminated its stockpile of \n     biological weapons pursuant to the 1972 Biological Weapons \n     Convention and has pledged to destroy its entire inventory of \n     chemical weapons by 2004, independent of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention entering into force;\n       (2) the use of chemical or biological weapons in \n     contravention of international law is abhorrent and should \n     trigger immediate and effective sanctions;\n       (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution 620, adopted \n     on August 26, 1988, states the intention of the Security \n     Council to consider immediately ``appropriate and effective'' \n     sanctions against any nation using chemical and biological \n     weapons in violation of international law;\n       (4) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade recognizes \n     that national security concerns may serve as legitimate \n     grounds for limiting trade; title XXI of the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade states that ``nothing in this \n     Agreement shall be construed . . . to prevent any contracting \n     party from taking any action which it considers necessary for \n     the protection of its essential security interests. . .'';\n       (5) on September 30, 1993, the President declared by \n     Executive Order No. 12868 a national emergency to deal with \n     ``the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \n     security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'' \n     posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons, and of the means for delivering such \n     weapons;\n       (6) Russia has not implemented the 1990 United States-\n     Russian Bilateral Agreement on Destruction and Non-Production \n     of Chemical Weapons and on Measures to Facilitate the \n     Multilateral Convention on Banning Chemical Weapons, known as \n     the ``BDA'', nor has the United States and Russia resolved, \n     to the satisfaction of the United States, the outstanding \n     compliance issues under the Memorandum of Understanding \n     Between the United States of America and\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\n     the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n     Regarding a Bilateral Verification Experiment and Data \n     Exchange Related To Prohibition on Chemical Weapons, known as \n     the ``1989 Wyoming MOU'';\n       (7) the Intelligence Community has stated that a number of \n     countries, among them China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North \n     Korea, Syria, and Russia, possess chemical and biological \n     weapons and the means to deliver them;\n       (8) four countries in the Middle East--Iran, Iraq, Libya, \n     and Syria--have, as a national policy, supported \n     international terrorism;\n       (9) chemical and biological weapons have been used by \n     states in the past for intimidation and military aggression, \n     most recently during the Iran-Iraq war and by Iraq against \n     its Kurdish minority;\n       (10) the grave new threat of chemical and biological \n     terrorism has been demonstrated by the 1995 nerve gas attack \n     on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo;\n       (11) the urgent need to improve domestic preparedness to \n     protect against chemical and biological threats was \n     underscored by enactment of the 1997 Defense Against Weapons \n     of Mass Destruction Act;\n       (12) the Department of Defense, in light of growing \n     chemical and biological threats in regions of key concern, \n     including Northeast Asia, and the Middle East, has stated \n     that United States forces must be properly trained and \n     equipped for all missions, including those in which opponents \n     might threaten use of chemical or biological weapons; and\n       (13) Australia Group controls on the exports of chemical \n     and biological agents, and related equipment, and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, together provide an indispensable \n     foundation for international and national efforts to curb the \n     spread of chemical and biological weapons, and their delivery \n     means.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to take all \n     appropriate measures to--\n       (1) prevent and deter the threat or use of chemical and \n     biological weapons against the citizens, Armed Forces, and \n     territory of the United States and its allies, and to protect \n     against, and manage the consequences of, such use should it \n     occur;\n       (2) discourage the proliferation of chemical and biological \n     weapons, their means of delivery, and related equipment, \n     material, and technology;\n       (3) prohibit within the United States the development, \n     production, acquisition, stockpiling, possession, and \n     transfer to third parties of chemical or biological weapons, \n     their precursors and related technology; and\n       (4) impose unilateral sanctions, and seek immediately \n     international sanctions, against any nation using chemical \n     and biological weapons in violation of international law.\n\n     SEC. 4.

coalition \n     partners, including those countries where the United States \n     currently deploys forces, where United States forces would \n     likely operate during regional conflicts, or which would \n     provide civilians necessary to support United States military \n     operations, to determine what steps are necessary to ensure \n     that allied and coalition forces and other critical civilians \n     are adequately equipped and prepared to operate in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n

contamination through higher altitude intercepts and boost-\n     phase intercepts.\n       (I) Training and readiness.--An assessment of the training \n     and readiness of the United States Armed Forces to operate in \n     chemically and biologically contaminated environments and \n     actions taken to sustain training and readiness, including at \n     national combat training centers.\n       (J) Military exercises.--A description of the progress made \n     in incorporating consideration about the threat or use of \n     chemical and biological weapons into service and joint \n     exercises as well as simulations, models, and wargames, \n     together with the conclusions drawn from these efforts about \n     the United States capability to carry out required missions, \n     including with coalition partners, in military contingencies.\n       (K) Military doctrine.--A description of the progress made \n     in developing and implementing service and joint doctrine for \n     combat and noncombat operations involving adversaries armed \n     with chemical or biological weapons, including efforts to \n     update the range of service and joint doctrine to better \n     address the wide range of military activities, including \n     deployment, reinforcement, and logistics operations in \n     support of combat operations, and for the conduct of such \n     operations in concert with coalition forces.\n       (L) Defense of civilian population.--A description of the \n     progress made in resolving issues relating to the protection \n     of United States population centers from chemical and \n     biological attack and from the consequences of such an \n     attack, including plans for inoculation of populations, \n     consequence management, and progress made in developing and \n     deploying effective cruise missile defenses and a national \n     ballistic missile defense.\n\n     SEC. 208. NEGATIVE SECURITY ASSURANCES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     order to achieve an effective deterrence against attacks of \n     the United States and United States Armed Forces by chemical \n     weapons, the President should reevaluate the extension of \n     negative security assurances by the United States to \n     nonnuclear-weapon states in the context of the Treaty on the \n     Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives a report, both in classified and unclassified \n     forms, setting forth--\n       (1) the findings of a detailed review of United States \n     policy on negative security assurances as a deterrence \n     strategy; and\n       (2) a determination by the President of the appropriate \n     range of nuclear and conventional responses to the use of \n     chemical or biological weapons against the United States \n     Armed Forces, United States citizens, allies, and third \n     parties.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Negative security assurances.--The term ``negative \n     security assurances'' means the assurances provided by the \n     United States to nonnuclear-weapon states in the context of \n     the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 \n     UST 483) that the United States will forswear the use of \n     certain weapons unless the United States is attacked by that \n     nonnuclear-weapon state in alliance with a nuclear-weapon \n     state.\n       (2) Nonnuclear-weapon states.--The term ``nonnuclear-weapon \n     states'' means states\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\n     that are not nuclear-weapon states, as defined in Article \n     IX(3) of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968 \n     (21 UST 483).\n\n     SEC. 209. RIOT CONTROL AGENTS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--The President shall not issue any order \n     or directive that diminishes, abridges, or alters the right \n     of the United States to use riot control agents--\n       (1) in any circumstance not involving international armed \n     conflict; or\n       (2) in a defensive military mode to save lives in an \n     international armed conflict, as provided for in Executive \n     Order No. 11850 of April 9, 1975.\n       (b) Circumstances Not Involving International Armed \n     Conflict.--The use of riot control agents under subsection \n     (a)(1) includes the use of such agents in--\n       (1) peacekeeping or peace support operations;\n       (2) humanitarian or disaster relief operations;\n       (3) noncombatant evacuation operations;\n       (4) counterterrorist operations and the rescue of hostages; \n     and\n       (5) law enforcement operations and other internal \n     conflicts.\n       (c) Defensive Military Mode.--The use of riot control \n     agents under subsection (a)(2) may include the use of such \n     agents--\n       (1) in areas under direct and distinct United States \n     military control, including the use of such agents for the \n     purposes of controlling rioting or escaping enemy prisoners \n     of war;\n       (2) to protect personnel or material from civil \n     disturbances, terrorists, and paramilitary organizations;\n       (3) to minimize casualties during rescue missions of downed \n     air crews and passengers, prisoners of war, or hostages;\n       (4) in situations where combatants and noncombatants are \n     intermingled; and\n       (5) in support of base defense, rear area operations, \n     noncombatant evacuation operations, and operations to protect \n     or recover nuclear weapons.\n       (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     international law permits the United States to use \n     herbicides, under regulations applicable to their domestic \n     use, for control of vegetation within United States bases and \n     installations or around their immediate defensive perimeters.\n       (e) Authority of the President.--The President shall take \n     all necessary measures, and prescribe such rules and \n     regulations as may be necessary, to ensure that the policy \n     contained in this section is observed by the Armed Forces of \n     the United States.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Abraham \nbe added as cosponsor to S. 495.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say for the benefit of my colleagues, \nto whom we had indicated that we would try to ensure that we would have \na vote on this matter at about 3:45, that even though, under the \nunanimous consent agreement, we have a half-hour to discuss this \nlegislation in order to try to accommodate my colleagues, to set an \nexample for those on the other side who may wish not to take their full \ncompliment of time, that at this time I am going to express a \nwillingness to discuss this bill no further but just take a couple of \nminutes to close and to relinquish the floor to those who may be in \nopposition, again with the plea to them that since we had earlier \nadvised colleagues that a vote would occur on this matter at about 3:45 \nthat anyone who can possibly do so truncate their remarks in order to \naccommodate our colleagues.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, has the \nunanimous consent agreement not yet been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The unanimous consent agreement has been \nreached.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was in my office. I still have not had an \nopportunity--I am not blaming anyone for that--to read this agreement. \nBut in listening to what was said, I thought I heard that a part of the \nagreement was to the effect that certain votes would occur by voice. Am \nI correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, \nthe agreement calls for a vote on the Helms amendments, and on the 28 \namendments in agreement. It was stated by at least one of our \ncolleagues that it was his hope that these votes would be voice votes, \nand the majority leader indicated that it was his desire to have a \nvoice vote. But no one is precluded, of course, from calling for a \nrollcall as is his constitutional right.\n  So the distinguished Senator from West Virginia makes a good point. A \nSenator is not precluded. It is my hope, working with the majority \nleader, that we can have voice votes on these matters and that we can \nmove ahead as the agreement anticipates. But certainly it is anyone's \nright to call for a rollcall on this or any other vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my concerns have been allayed, and I thank \nthe distinguished leader.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the concern of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and others in wanting to move forward with S. 495.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, we may be seeking a greater good here on the \nchemical weapons treaty. Those who are opposed to it will feel that it \nisn't important that they have a chance to vote against it; but those \nwho are for it, as am I, will feel it is important to have a chance to \nvote for it.\n  But S. 495 in my mind does not have such urgency.\n  In an effort to cooperate with the Democratic leader, and with the \nRepublican leader, who is seeking to fulfill, I think, a responsible \ncommitment to the President of the United States to have this bill up \nhere, or to have the treaty up here, I did not object to S. 495, the \nKyl bill, coming up. But, Mr. President, I would point out that this is \na bill that was introduced--the first version of it was introduced and \nreferred to the Senate Judiciary Committee a day or two before our last \nrecess. There has never been a hearing on it. There has not been 21 \nseconds of debate on it in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and today we \nhave before us a 70-page and a 70-page substitute for it. We are going \nto be asked sometime in the next few minutes to vote on a substitute \nfor S. 495. We are going to be asked to vote on a bill that has had no \nhearings, no debate in committee, no markups, no votes, no report, and \nno discussion.\n\n  I am willing to wager that there will not be more than five Senators \nwho can walk off the floor and tell people honestly, looking them \nstraight in the eye, and say they read it and understood what is in it.\n  In fact, I would make this challenge to the press. I would make this \nchallenge to the press of every one of the 50 States. I would ask, if \nthe press really wants to do their job, to do this: Call each of the \nSenators. All it requires is for the press in each State to call up \nonly two people immediately after the vote on S. 495, and say, ``Did \nyou read this bill that you just voted on? Did you understand what was \nin this bill you just voted on? Could you explain this bill to me that \nyou just voted on?'' And if somebody says they voted for a major issue \nlike this, then I think it is reasonable to ask, ``Did you read it? Did \nyou understand it? Do you know what is in it?''\n  There may be some very good things in the bill. I have heard that it \nborrows much from the administration's proposals for implementation \nlegislation. I understand that there are some aspects of it that are \nvery similar to legislation that I introduced. And that may very well \nbe so. There may well be some parts of this bill that I would eagerly \nsupport and vote for. But the fact of the matter is I do not know and \nam not being given an opportunity to find out, let alone have hearings \nor an opportunity to seek to improve the bill.\n  We have not had an opportunity or the benefit of discussion. We have \nnot had the opportunity or the benefit of debate--and we will not have \ndebate on it today.\n  The sole reason it is up here under this expedited procedure is to \ngive some kind of cover one way or the other to bring up the chemical \nweapons treaty. What we have is the majority insisting that we \nconsider, without review, a revised substitute version of a bill that \nwas not made available to us until this afternoon.\n  Nobody has said in the Senate Judiciary Committee this could not have \na prompt hearing. Certainly I would support the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, if he wanted to have a prompt \nhearing on it.\n  The principal sponsor of the bill, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, would certainly pursue it strongly through the committee, and \nI have no doubts that he would be able to explain it very, very well in \nthe committee and answer any questions that might come up. He is a \ndiligent and hard-working Senator who would be able to do that. But \nunder this procedure, we will never know. This committee has a majority\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\nof Republicans, as all Senate committees do, but yet the committee will \nnever vote on it.\n  The majority leader, who is my good friend, has always described \nhimself as one who seeks regular order. I think the Washington Post had \na front-page story on December 3, 1996, in which they quote the Senator \ndescribing himself as an ``order'' kind of guy.\n  I recall when our distinguished majority leader came to the floor and \nsaid:\n\n       There is a way to do things around here. You bring up a \n     bill reported by a committee, have debate, offer amendments, \n     you vote, and win or lose, and you move on, and then it goes \n     to conference.\n\n  Well, we are not bringing up a bill reported by a committee. We are \nreally not going to have debate. We are not going to offer amendments. \nWe will vote. And that is about the only reflection of order.\n  If we were considering a resolution to commend the cherry blossom \nprincess or to say we will open the doors of the Senate 5 minutes early \nor something like that, I could understand. Instead, we are talking \nabout a 70-page bill which is to provide criminal and civil penalties \nfor acquisition, transfer, or use of any chemical weapon or biological \nweapon, to reduce the threats of acts of terrorism, armed aggression, \nand so on. This bill refers to patent law, to chemical and biological \nweapons, to aircraft, and to continuation and enhancements of \nmultilateral control regimes. It refers to the Australia group--I would \nlike to have five Senators stand up and tell me what the Australia \ngroup is, to the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding and the 1990 \nBilateral Destruction Agreement. These are major things. Vaccine \nproduction and stocks, decontamination of infrastructure are also \nserious matters and we have not had any hearing, any debate, any \ndiscussion of it. The bill refers to owner or possessor liability and \nwarrantless seizures and seizures on warrants and reimbursement of \ncosts, saying how people will have to pay the United States certain \namounts of money under certain circumstances and all. This may be heady \nstuff, Mr. President, very heady stuff.\n  Now, we have had the Chemical Weapons Convention before us since \nNovember 1993. It has been bottled up in committee. We have the April \n28, 1997, deadline approaching after which our lack of ratification \nrisks economic sanctions against our chemical industry. This could cost \nU.S. chemical companies hundreds of millions of dollars. We are talking \nabout thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars on \nsomething that has been stalled, stalled for years.\n  Now but all of a sudden, whoop-de-do, we have a bill and a substitute \nbill and the Senate is to take 12 minutes and go ahead with it.\n  I am afraid that without proper review of the domestic law changes in \ncriminal laws against chemical and biological weapons, we may \ninadvertently weaken protections already in the law. I know my friend \nfrom Arizona does not intend to weaken our laws, but that could be the \neffect of this bill.\n\n  There is no need for this irregular procedure. We ought to be able to \ntake a look at S. 495. I would have no objection to its coming up in \nregular order after hearings, but it is not a substitute for the \nChemical Weapons Convention. It is not a substitute or alternative to \nimplementing legislation.\n  After we delayed something that President Reagan had negotiated, \nsomething that President Bush had negotiated, something that President \nClinton had negotiated, the Chemical Weapons Convention, after we \ndelayed it for year after year after year, now we are going to take up \nin less than 3 hours and pass this 70-page bill that nobody has read. \nWe delay something that has been debated, argued, considered, we delay \nthat for years, but then we take a major piece of legislation that \nnobody has seen and do not even debate it and it is out the door. \nSomething has gone wrong here.\n  On April 15, every American had to file their taxes or the IRS comes \nafter them. That is the law. We also have a law that says that the \nHouse and the Senate shall pass a budget by April 15. With all due \nrespect to my friends on the Republican side, they control the Speaker \nof the House, they control the majority in the House, they control the \nmajority leader and a majority in the Senate, but we have not had one \nsecond of debate on a budget resolution even though the law requires \nthem to pass it by April 15.\n  April 15 comes and goes. Can you imagine, Mr. President, if you took \nthat same attitude in filing your taxes and said well, you know, I am \nbusy, I cannot do it. You would hear the doorbell ring and there would \nbe the IRS after you. But nobody comes after us for doing the same \nthing.\n  We have nearly 100 vacancies on the Federal bench, and we cannot get \na quorum in the Judiciary Committee to report them out.\n  Yet this 70-page major piece of legislation suddenly comes zipping \nforth. There are a lot of problems in it. As I said, there may be some \nthings I like. But it says, for example, the bill would prohibit the \nproduction of 16 specific chemicals and 54 more already controlled by \nthe Australia group. Do we know what chemicals are in this bill that \nwould be criminalized? I doubt that any one of us could even pronounce \nthe chemicals. We do not know what we are voting to ban?\n  The bill prohibits any other chemical that may be developed that \nproduces the same effect as the other listed chemicals. I take it this \nmeans chemicals developed in the future. But what about other terrible \nweapons that now exist? Would chemical weapons that exist now but not \nlisted in the bill be OK? What deadly chemicals that are prohibited \nunder current law, which has a far broader definition of chemical \nweapons, would be freed from criminal penalties?\n  We have had no answer. This bill repeals the two major chapters of \nthe Federal Criminal Code dealing with biological weapons and with \nchemical weapons. The ink is barely dry on the chemical weapons law \nthat this legislation would repeal. The chemical weapons statute became \nlaw as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996. It was enacted April 14, 1996. It is barely 1 year old and we are \ngoing to repeal it without a single hearing, single expert comment \nabout what might be wrong with a bill that we passed a year ago. Do we \nreplace it with a stronger law? No.\n  First, the definition of chemical weapons that will be banned under \nthis bill is far more limited than the chemical weapons banned under \ncurrent law.\n  The bill has a number of exemptions to the overall prohibitions on \nchemical and biological weapons that are far broader in scope than what \nare in current law. For example, current law bars chemical weapons for \nanything but lawful authority. This bill replaces that limited, \ncircumscribed rule with five extensive exemptions including for any \npeaceful purpose related to any activity.\n\n  What does that mean? Is that an exemption any enterprising terrorist \nor criminal caught with a chemical weapon could use to great advantage? \nSomeone could make a strong argument that way.\n  While there are parts of the bill I may well like, there are a lot of \nother parts that raise unanswered questions. Again, any Senator who \nvotes for this, I would challenge the press in his or her State to ask: \nYou voted for it, do you know what was in it? Did you read the bill? \nDid you understand the bill? Were all your questions answered? Did you \nfeel you repealed any criminal laws we now have that we should have \nkept?\n  Mr. President, we spent far, far, far more time this week in quorum \ncalls when we did nothing than we have on hearings on this bill. We \nspent more time voting on a 100-to-0 resolution on assisted suicide to \nmake us all feel good. We spent far more time on that than we have \nhearings on this bill. Mr. President, we spent more time with the \nChaplain's prayer this morning than we spent on hearings on this 70-\npage bill. We spent more time saying good morning to each other this \nmorning than we have had in hearings on this 70-page bill. It takes \nmore time for the elevator to go from the second floor to the first \nthan we have had in hearings on this 70-page bill.\n  I do not fault the Senator from Arizona for this. The leadership is \nwilling to bring it forward, and if it is his legislation, then he is \nobviously going to go for it.\n  But before the Senate becomes irrelevant, if we do not have time and \nwill not even follow the law, which requires\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nus to have a budget by April 15, if we only had time to confirm two \nFederal judges in 4 months and we have a 100-judge vacancy, if we do \nnot have time to have 18 seconds of debate on the budget, if we can \nbottle up the chemical weapons treaty for years, following the support \nof President Reagan, President Bush and President Clinton, why in \nHeaven's name do we suddenly have to come rushing forth with something \nwe do not need now and we do not have to have now?\n  If we are going to have an expedited process, I think the emergency \nshould be the leadership bringing forward the budget that the law \nrequires. If we have urgency for something, fill some of those \njudgeships. After all, the Chief Justice has said that is a judicial \ncrisis. If we have urgency for something, let us take something that \nhas actually had a hearing.\n  So with all due respect to the sponsors of this bill and knowing \nthere are parts of the bill as I have read them that I like, there are \na lot of other parts that raise far more questions than are answered in \nmy mind. I will oppose it. I would find extremely interesting the \nexplanations of those who vote for it.\n  I see the distinguished sponsor of the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I just want to respond to a couple of things my \ndistinguished colleague has raised. He is certainly correct to point \nout the fact that in my view there has been inadequate attention paid \nto this entire subject. I wish we could spend a lot more time debating \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, as a matter of fact, but in an effort \nto meet the deadline imposed or that the administration has indicated \nit needs to meet, we have had to accordion a great deal of debate and \nconsideration of items into a very small period of time.\n  I desperately wanted to spend more time on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, but in order to agree to get that done on time, we have all \nmade some compromise agreements of how much time to take on things. \nThat is why there is not much time taken on this legislation. The one \nthing I did want to assure my colleague of, and that is the portions \nwhere he sees sections having been repealed, those sections were picked \nup in a new title under title I, section 101, chapter 11(B) and the \nfollowing.\n  Essentially what was done, I assure my colleague, is the chemical and \nbiological provisions of the code were combined and the same activities \nthat are illegal as to one are now illegal as to both with the same \npenalties. So nothing was dropped from the law; it was merely \nconsolidated in a different place. The definition of chemicals, \nincidentally, is the same definition that is contemplated by the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  I might also note, the subject matter here has been debated and was \nthe subject of hearings really for the last 3 years in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, by and large, and the exact language of \nthis legislation has been aided by the FBI and others in the \nadministration as well.\n  My colleague is correct, it would be better to have more time to \nspend not only on this bill but on the Chemical Weapons Convention \nitself. In an effort to try to get all of this done under the timeframe \nthe administration is working under, we have all made compromises. I \nwould like a lot more time to brag about what is in this bill, but I \nagreed to keep my remarks to a couple minutes.\n  I will not take more time at this point. I appreciate the spirit in \nwhich the comments of the Senator from Vermont were made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls 10 minutes \n35 seconds. The Senator from Arizona controls 25 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the opposition will soon be led by the \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I guess I will yield \nmy time to him. I will speak 1 more minute until he arrives, and then I \nwill yield the floor.\n  I understand what my friend from Arizona says about wanting to vote \nfor it now, but we do not need S. 495 now. The clock is ticking on the \nchemical weapons treaty. It was ticking on it last year, the year \nbefore, and the year before that. It ticks right up until midnight \nApril 28. If there is anything we have to vote on and should vote on as \nresponsible Senators, either vote up or down, it is the chemical \nweapons treaty. S. 495 can wait for the normal hearing route.\n  When you have the merger of current chemical and biological weapons \nchapters in the criminal code but with different definitions and \ndifferent exemptions for lawful conduct, this is a matter we ought to \nat least debate.\n  Again, I urge everybody to ask and whether members can look their \nconstituents in the eye and say in this 70-page major piece of \nlegislation on chemical weapons, can they say they read it, they \nunderstood it, and they are prepared to vote on it?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have time remaining, and I am perfectly \nhappy to yield back almost all of that time in an effort to get this \nmatter to a vote. I urge my colleagues on the other side, if they have \nopposition, to please make their arguments in opposition so we can \nbring this to a vote and our colleagues can try to catch their \nairplanes, which I know they are trying to do.\n  Until someone is here to speak, I will reiterate the basic point of \nthe legislation. I do urge my colleagues who may be in opposition to \nplease come to the floor to make their arguments to try to accommodate \nour colleagues.\n  This legislation, again, Mr. President, is simply designed to \ncomplement the provisions of existing law and is also complementary to \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. It does not create a great deal that \nis new, but rather plugs loopholes in existing law. We noted, for \nexample, that while it is illegal for one to manufacture and possess \nand use biological weapons in the United States, we have overlooked \npassing a law that makes it illegal to manufacture or possess chemical \nweapons. If we are going to be serious about the chemical weapons \nbusiness and trying to prevent proliferation, obviously we need to make \nthat conduct illegal as well. We do that in this legislation.\n  It is not anything Members should have concern about. In fact, they \nshould want that. Who would be against providing the President a little \nmore flexibility and imposing sanctions on countries that violate \ninternational law by using chemical or biological weapons?\n  Who could be against asking the President of the United States to do \nhis best to keep the Australia group together, working as a group of \ncountries in the world that do not sell chemicals, precursor chemicals, \nto nations that might make chemical weapons of them? It is the policy \nof the United States, and a sense of the Senate, that the President \nshould ensure that the Australia group restrictions are not weakened in \nany way. That is consistent totally with the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. Again, I cannot imagine anyone objecting to that.\n  We continue the conditions that were imposed in the 1996 defense \nauthorization bill on aid to Russia, which is designed to help them \ndismantle their chemical weapons. We say they have to demonstrate \nreasonable progress toward that dismantlement. We pick the same \nlanguage that was the subject of the Nunn-Lugar compromise in the 1996 \ndefense authorization bill. What we have done is simply to continue \nthat same requirement of Presidential certification of compliance by \nRussia, or, if all else fails, the President can certify that he cannot \ncertify, and we still send the money to them. So it is not a condition \nI can imagine anyone would object to. If anything, we would want to \nmake it stronger.\n  Our legislation calls for an annual report on the state of \nproliferation of\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\nchemical and biological weapons, something that the Congress needs in \norder to work with the President in doing everything we can to stop the \nproliferation of these weapons.\n  We ask the President to convene a group of nations to try to put some \nteeth into the Geneva protocol, which is the treaty that currently bans \nthe use of chemical weapons. Like the Chemical Weapons Convention, it \ndoes not have strong teeth in it. So we are urging the President to try \nto get a group of nations together to try to do that. Again, I cannot \nimagine any opposition to that.\n  We provide our military be better protected against chemical warfare. \nThe GAO issued a report last year that found grave deficiencies in the \nway that our troops were being equipped and trained to deal with \nchemical warfare and biological warfare. That needs to be remedied, and \nwe have three specific things in here that we think will help the \nDefense Department in ensuring that our troops are adequately \nprotected.\n  One of the things that we recommend, for example, is that the U.S. \nArmy Chemical School remain under the oversight of a general officer, \njust to make our point that we think this is an important matter, and \ncertainly at least a one-star general ought to be in charge of that \nfacility and that operation.\n  We provide for a fixed riot-control agent problem, Mr. President. \nThis is the problem that has arisen because this administration has \nsignaled an intention to change the understanding that has been in \nexistence since President Ford's days when the opportunity to use riot-\ncontrol agents, or tear gas, was said to be permitted in certain \ninstances where it would help to save lives. For example, where we have \na downed pilot that is being held by a group of hostile civilians, we \ncan rescue that downed pilot, not by shooting civilians but by the use \nof tear gas. Where you have a group of civilians protecting someone \nthat you want to get out, or you want to control a group of hostile \nprisoners of war, that kind of thing, you do not want to shoot anybody, \nyou can do it with riot-control agents, tear gas. We want to assure \nthat is possible under the law.\n\n  These are the things that are the key elements of S. 495, Mr. \nPresident, and there should not be anything controversial here. It \nshould be provisions that all of us can support. We simply identified \neach of these items in the course of all of the hearings and all of the \ndebate about the Chemical Weapons Convention and found there were a lot \nof practical things we could do in legislation.\n  Bear in mind, this legislation has to go over to the House, it has to \npass the House, it has to go to the President. Therefore, there are \nplenty of scrubs on it, even though the Senate has not had a great deal \nof opportunity to debate it.\n  I hope that our colleagues, if there is anyone else in opposition, \nwill say so and we can get on with a vote on this matter pursuant to \nthe unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if there are any more \nquorum calls, that the time be subtracted equally from both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to begin my comments on S. \n495 with two observations. First, if the United States desires to be an \noriginal member of the Chemical Weapons Convention, this body must act \nto ratify this treaty within the next 7 days. Second, the whole world \nis watching what we say and do on the CWC--a treaty that I believe is \none of the most important arms control agreements this body will \nconsider for many years to come.\n  Having made these observations, one would think the Senate would be \nmoving to immediate consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nInstead, the Senate unfortunately finds itself debating S. 495--a bill \nthat its most ardent supporters have characterized in recent days as \nthe conservatives' substitute to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I must tell the Senate that despite these claims, S. 495 is not the \nChemical Weapons Convention. In fact, I think it's safe to say S. 495 \nis not even a distant relative of the Chemical Weapons Convention. And, \nas former Democratic leader George Mitchell was fond of reminding many \nof his colleagues at moments like this, saying something repeatedly \ndoes not make it so.\n  Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention offers this Nation an \noasis of security in an increasingly threatening world. S. 495 offers \nus a mirage--a mirage, that if pursued, would jeopardize our national \nsecurity and our economy.\n  First, Mr. President, S. 495 only requires the United States to do \nwhat it is already doing under an existing law signed by President \nReagan in 1986--destroy our stockpile of chemical weapons. S. 495 does \nabsolutely nothing to force other nations to eliminate their stocks of \nthese deadly materials.\n  Second, the supporters of S. 495 act as if the CWC does not exist at \nall. S. 495 directs the Secretary of State to negotiate a whole new \nagreement. The purpose of this new agreement would be to enhance \nenforcement of an old agreement--the 1925 Geneva protocol. The Geneva \nprotocol merely prohibits the use of chemical weapons. If you care \nabout getting tough on chemical weapons, CWC is the only real answer. \nCWC bans the development, production, and stockpiling of chemical \nweapons as well as their use.\n  Third, S. 495 does nothing to address the trade sanctions that would \nhit the American chemical industry if we fail to ratify the CWC. \nEveryone needs to understand that this treaty will take effect with or \nwithout us on April 29. Without U.S. ratification of the CWC, U.S. \nfirms will immediately have to secure end-user certificates for the \nexport of chemicals. The implications for U.S. business will be as \nswift as they are costly.\n  Finally, I must note with a bit of irony that, according to legal \nexperts who have examined this bill, S. 495, the so-called Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997, may actually weaken \nexisting law in the very same areas it seeks to toughen them up. As a \nresult of exemption clauses in this bill, passage of S. 495 could \nundercut the very purpose of the bill itself.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I ask the Senate not to pursue this \nmirage. S. 495 is not a real substitute for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. I ask that the Senate reject this false vision and that we \nthen get on with the real debate--consideration of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention has such \nfar-reaching domestic and national security implications that it \ndeserves the most thorough and thoughtful examination by the Senate. I \nhave given this matter a careful review and now rise to discuss some of \nthe conclusions I have reached.\n  If I thought supporting this treaty would make chemical weapons \ndisappear, and give us all greater security from these heinous weapons, \nI would not hesitate in giving my support. Unfortunately, the facts do \nnot demonstrate this; indeed, implementing this treaty may actually \ncreate opportunities for security breaches.\n  The Convention has been signed by 160 nations and ratified by only \n70--less than 50 percent. Five countries who are thought to have \nchemical weapons are not even signatories of the Convention: Egypt, \nIraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria. Another six nations have signed, \nbut not ratified the Convention: China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Israel, \nand Russia. In short, this Convention is not global in scale.\n  Mr. President, even if it were true that this treaty had been signed \nand ratified by 160 nations, serious problems would remain. Compliance \nwith the Chemical Weapons Convention is not verifiable. I think it is \ntimely and appropriate to remember the principle President Reagan \ninsisted upon when negotiating an arms control treaty--trust, but \nverify. Unlike nuclear weapons which require a large, specialized \nindustrial base, chemical weapons can be manufactured almost anywhere. \nMoreover, many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses. \nChemicals help us to manufacture products such as pesticides, \npharmaceuticals, plastics, and paints. With such a broad spectrum of \nuses, it would be difficult to discern the legitimate from the illicit.\n  Even if verification of compliance were not a concern, this treaty \nwould\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nbe difficult to enforce. In a sound arms control treaty, the United \nStates must be able to punish other countries caught in violation of \nthe agreement. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides only vague, \nunspecified sanctions to be imposed on a country found in breach of the \nConvention. Ultimately, the Chemical Weapons Convention leaves the U.N. \nSecurity Council to impose penalties severe enough to change behavior \nout an outlaw nation. Since any one of the five members of the Security \nCouncil can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or \ntheir friends, China and Russia, for example, could simply veto \nresolutions imposing sanctions if they disagreed with other Security \nCouncil members. In sum, Mr. President, it does not appear that this \nagreement is verifiable or enforceable.\n  Appropriate questions have also been raised about the treaty's \ncompatibility with our Constitution. The Convention creates an \ninternational monitoring regime called the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW. The OPCW will be granted the \nmost extensive and intrusive monitoring power of any arms control \ntreaty ever because it extends coverage to governmental and civilian \nfacilities.\n  The intrusive nature of this treaty brings up important issues in \nregards to our citizens' constitutional protection against unreasonable \nsearch and seizure of private property. Mr. John Yoo, an acting \nprofessor of law at the University of California at Berkeley wrote \nyesterday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that ``Under the CWC, a drug \ndealer running a crack house will have more constitutional rights than \nthe law-abiding operator of a chemical plant.'' Proponents of the \nChemical Weapons Convention have suggested that there are a wide \nvariety of solutions to the constitutional problem. However, the \nChemical Weapons Convention states that it is ``unlawful to disrupt, \ndelay, impede an inspection or refuse entry of an inspection team.'' It \nappears as though this treaty is incompatible with our Constitution.\n\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I do not want to look for ways to get \naround the so-called constitutional problem. If the treaty flies in the \nface of rights protected under the fourth and fifth amendments, we \ncannot and should not ratify.\n  The authority of the international monitoring regime also raises \nconcern about foreign nationals having such broad authority to obtain \naccess to property held by private U.S. citizens. The U.S. chemical \nindustry is known to be one of the top industries targeted for \nespionage by foreign companies and governments. There is legitimate \nworry that international inspections could jeopardize confidential \nbusiness information, trade secrets, and other proprietary data. Since \nthe United States will be expected to pay 25 percent, or approximately \n$50 million, of the OPCW's operating costs, American tax dollars could \nbe subsidizing increased risk for U.S. business interests. And even \nthough we would pay the lion's share of the OPCW's budget, the United \nStates would have no special status over other signatory nations, no \nveto power, and no assurance of being a member of the executive \ncouncil.\n  Despite my objections to ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, I believe Senator Kyl's Chemical and Biological Threat \nReduction Act will help protect our citizens and troops from the threat \nof chemical and biological weapons. This bill would establish workable \nnational policies for confronting the chemical and biological weapons \nthreats, while not jeopardizing our national security like the CWC.\n  Currently, there exists no U.S. law providing comprehensive criminal, \ncivil, and other penalties for the acquisition, possession, transfer, \nor use of chemical or biological weapons. Senator Kyl's bill would \nimpose stiff criminal and civil penalties for illegal possession of \nchemical weapons. The death penalty could be a punishment for an \nindividual who causes the death of another through this bill.\n  The Chemical and Biological Threat Reduction Act also imposes \nmandatory sanctions against nations that use biological and chemical \nweapons against other countries or their own citizens. Unlike the \nChemical Weapons Convention that only vaguely defines sanctions which \ncould be thwarted by the U.N. Security Council, this bill would \nautomatically terminate foreign assistance, suspend arms sales, impose \nimport and export restrictions, and end financial assistance from \nmultilateral banks. This act also would improve the readiness of U.S. \nmilitary forces against chemical weapons attacks by improving troop \npreparedness.\n  In view of some of the contacts I've had from Idahoans concerning \nSenator Kyl's bill, I think it's important to point out that this bill \ndoes not ratify the flawed Chemical Weapons Convention. It would \nenhance our own methods to deal with chemical terrorism without making \nus vulnerable to the defects of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, making the production and possession of chemical \nweapons illegal according to international law will not make them \ndisappear. Use of such weapons has been prohibited since 1907, yet we \nhave seen the results of their use. We all know about the tens of \nthousands of deaths from poison gas in World War I, and no one could \nforget the tragic photographs of the Iranian children killed during the \n1980's by the Iraqi Government. Illegal? Yes, but still in use, \nnonetheless.\n  Mr. President, I stand today with all Americans expressing a grave \nconcern over the increasing proliferation of chemical and biological \nweapons. The real question here seems to be whether ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention will increase our own national security. \nUnfortunately, the answer is no. There is little value in implementing \ninternational laws which do little to decrease illegal research, \ndevelopment, and proliferation of chemical weapons worldwide.\n  I support the goal of making the world safe from the threat of \nchemical weapons. I applaud the honorable statement the CWC makes \nagainst these heinous weapons. However, I believe the best way to \nprotect ourselves from this threat is by rejecting this treaty. The \nConvention does nothing to better our security, but may even open the \ndoor to increasing risks against our vital security interests and \ninfringing on the rights of innocent citizens. For these reason, I am \ncompelled to vote against the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise as a cosponsor and supporter \nof S. 495, The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of \n1997. This bill will truly provide the United States the tools it needs \nand deserves from chemical and biological weapons. It is a \ncomprehensive domestic and international plan to reduce the threat of \nchemical and biological weapons use, setting forth practical, \nrealistic, and achievable nonproliferation measures to combat the very \nreal dangers posed by these weapons.\n  Because of the horrible nature of these weapons, the United States \nhas dismantled its biological weapons program and is now unilaterally \ndestroying its entire stockpile of chemical weapons. This bill \nreinforces our commitment to finish the job.\n  S. 495 contains many provisions that will improve our ability to \nprotect our citizens and military against these deadly weapons. The \nbill imposes criminal, as well as civil, penalties for the development, \nproduction, stockpiling, and transfer of chemical and biological \nweapons. Penalties range from civil action of up to $100,000 per \nviolation to the death penalty on individuals who use chemical weapons \nwhich cause death to another.\n  Also, the export privileges of violators can be revoked as well. And, \nit preserves the system of multilateral export controls on biological \nand chemical materials and technologies, better known as the Australia \ngroup.\n  For our Armed Services, it strengthens U.S. biological and chemical \ndefense programs and it preserves the military's ability to use riot \ncontrol agents, such as tear gas. It also requires the President to \nreview the policy of negative security assurance to widen U.S. options \nto respond with nuclear weapons against such an attack by a nonnuclear \nweapons state.\n  For foreign countries who use biological or chemical weapons in war \nor against its own citizens, mandatory 3-year sanctions are imposed as \nlisted in the bill. Plus, it calls an international conference to \nstrengthen the existing 1925 Geneva Protocol. Lastly, it requires \nRussian cooperation in disarmament of CW/BW weapons in return\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\nfor continued U.S. assistance for dismantling these weapons of mass \ndestruction. This applies only to CW/BW destruction and not to any \nother Russian assistance, such as the Nunn-Lugar programs.\n  I hope all my colleagues support S. 495. It toughens our domestic \nlaws on those who use these weapons. For all the talk about chemical \nweapons, little has been done domestically to punish users of these \nhorrible weapons. This bill will do just that. Support this bill and \nlet's make it known that we will not tolerate the use of these weapons \nagainst American citizens or any other people.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 495, the \nChemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997. In the \nwake of World War I, nations from all around the world came together to \nsign the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Having witnessed the horrible effects of \npoison gas in battle, this agreement banned its use in interstate \nconflict. However, at the time no provisions were made in U.S. law to \nestablish criminal or civil penalties pertaining to such weapons.\n  Today, for the first time, legislation has come to the Senate floor \nthat provides criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful \nacquisition, transfer, or use of any chemical or biological weapon and \ngives domestic law enforcement authorities the needed legal basis to \nenforce prohibitions on chemical weapons activities within the United \nStates. Most importantly, in light of recent domestic terrorist attacks \nand the actual release of Sarin gas in a Tokyo subway, S. 495 allows \nthe death penalty for the use of chemical or biological weapons that \nleads to the loss of life.\n  From the international perspective, this legislation conditions \ncontinued United States aid to Russia for chemical and biological \nweapons dismantlement and destruction upon Russia demonstrating that it \nis abiding by existing agreements in this area. It urges enhancement of \nmultilateral regimes to control trade in chemical and biological \nweapons-related materials, while requiring that the United States \ncontinue strengthening chemical and biological defenses, particularly \nin terms of equipment and training. Finally, S. 495 establishes, for \nthe world, U.S. policy on the use of riot control agents and permits \nthe use of tear gas for such things as the rescuing of downed pilots.\n  The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997 \naugments existing international norms and agreements by establishing a \nframework for U.S. sanctions against nations which use chemical or \nbiological weapons and by directing the Secretary of State to convene \nan international negotiating forum for the purpose of reaching an \nagreement on the enforcement of the 1925 Geneva Protocol which bans the \nuse of chemical weapons in war.\n  I wish to point out that supporting S. 495 is not in conflict with \nthe ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Instead it \ncomplements the CWC by reducing the threat of acts of terrorism and \narmed aggression against the United States involving chemical and \nbiological weapons. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and take a step toward making our country safer with a \ncomprehensive plan that provides realistic and practical measures to \ncombat the dangers of these repugnant weapons.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 495, the \nChemical and Biological Threat Reduction Act of 1997, offered by the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and others.\n  There has been criticism of this legislation by Members of the Senate \nas well as by the administration. The criticism largely centers around \ncharges that it falls short as an alternative to the Chemical Weapons \nConvention [CWC].\n  I do not know what the outcome will be of the Senate vote on advice \nand consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This \nlegislation could possibly be an alternative in the event two-thirds of \nthe Members present do not vote for the treaty. On the other hand, it \nmay also complement the treaty, if it passes.\n  I want the Record to be clear, whatever the outcome of the vote on \nthe CWC, I support efforts by the Senate to provide comprehensive \ncriminal, civil, and other penalties for the acquisition, possession, \ntransfer, or use of chemical or biological weapons. I also want the \nRecord to reflect my continued support for the destruction of the U.S. \nunitary stockpile.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 495.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I proudly stand here today as a \ncosponsor of S. 495, Senator Jon Kyl's Chemical and Biological Weapons \nThreat Reduction Act of 1997. First and foremost, I want to thank the \ngood Senator from Arizona for his commitment and hard work regarding \nchemical and biological weapon threats. This legislation certainly \nprovides a comprehensive domestic and international plan to reduce the \nthreat of chemical and biological weapon use.\n  It sets forth practical, realistic, and achievable nonproliferation \nmeasures to combat the very real dangers posed by these weapons.\n  Today the U.S. Senate will vote on the Chemical and Biological \nWeapons Threat Reduction Act. Mr. President, for the first time in U.S. \nhistory, we will have legislation that provides the needed criminal and \ncivil penalties against those who produce, stockpile, and transfer \nchemical weapons in the United States.\n  Mr. President, as this body begins debate on the chemical weapons \nissue, I wholeheartedly believe that S. 495 will not only reinforce our \nstrong commitment to eliminating chemical and biological weapons, but \nmore importantly this legislation will provide our domestic law \nenforcement authorities the needed legal basis to enforce prohibitions \non chemical weapons activities within the United States.\n  I have heard the arguments against S. 495, including that it amounts \nto the ``U.S. go at it alone,'' approach. However, Mr. President, this \nbill sets forth a strong moral example for other nations to follow and \nin doing so underscores our commitment to global nonproliferation \nefforts.\n  Furthermore, through the Australia Group, the United States and its \nprincipal international partners have worked together to prevent the \ntransfer of dual-use chemicals and chemical\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nweapon-related equipment. The Australia Group must remain a cornerstone \nof our international nonproliferation effort and Mr. President, the \npassage of this legislation accomplishes this goal.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize the strong points of this bill:\n  It requires U.S. sanctions against any country that uses chemical \nand/or biological weapons against another country. In effect a range of \nsanctions can be imposed: arms sales, trade restrictions, foreign \nassistance, etc.;\n  It outlaws the entire range of chemical and biological weapons \nactivities within the United States. This bill mandates a $100,000 \npenalty for civil violations and provides the death penalty where \nchemical and/or biological weapons use leads to the loss of life;\n  It establishes criteria for continued United States aid to Russia for \nchemical and biological weapons dismantlement and destruction;\n  Most importantly, the assistance for dismantling Russia's chemical \nweapons stockpiles is contingent upon Russia's commitment to abide by \nalready existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on chemical and \nbiological weapons; and\n  This legislation requires calling an international conference to \nstrengthen the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of \nbiological and chemical weapons. The Geneva Protocol has been violated \non numerous occasions with little or no response from the states \nobserving its prohibitions. Section 205 of this legislation would call \nfor the creation of an international body whose purpose would be to \nensure that the participating states will penalize any state violating \nthe Geneva Protocol.\n  Mr. President, we must, to the best of our ability, avoid the \nhorrible events of the 1980's, when the international community \nwitnessed the horrors of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against its own \npeople. However, we took no action despite the clear and compelling \nevidence that this atrocity had taken place.\n  To answer this threat, Senator Kyl's legislation directs the \nSecretary of State to convene an international negotiating forum for \nthe purpose of concluding an international agreement on the enforcement \nof the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of poison gas in war.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important provisions of S. 495 is that \nit strengthens U.S. biological and chemical defense programs. The bill \nrecommends three steps to improve the readiness of U.S. military forces \nin the area of biological and chemical defense. First, it would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to ensure that U.S. military forces are \nprepared to conduct operations in a contaminated environment, \nparticularly in the areas of operating ports and air fields. Second, it \nwould seek improved allied support for biological and chemical defense \nto sustain operations in a contaminated environment. Third, it would \nrequire that the U.S. Army Chemical School remain under the oversight \nof a general officer.\n  Mr. President, as we begin the debate on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and whether to ratify or not, I believe that this \nlegislation, S. 495, is significant because it establishes substantive \nand workable national policies for confronting the chemical weapons \nthreat.\n  The American people, with justification, will ask their leaders how \nand where they stand on the issue of chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, the passage of S. 495 will send a clear and \nunmistakable message to the American people that this Congress will do \neverything in its power to rid our world of all chemical and biological \nweapons. I urge my colleagues to adopt this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. The Senator has 11 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the bill \nitself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nDelaware have 11 minutes each, the Senator from Arizona has 13, and the \nSenator from Vermont has 4\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate is an unusual \npiece of legislation. It comes to the Senate in an expedited fashion \nrarely witnessed in this body. The so-called Chemical and Biological \nWeapons Threat Reduction Act has been presented as something of an \nalternative to or substitute for the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  In contrast, though, to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which has \ntaken 3\\1/2\\ years and counting to reach the Senate floor, S. 495 comes \nto us a mere 3\\1/2\\ weeks following its introduction. The substitute \namendment to S. 495 that the Senate is now considering--all 64 pages of \nbill language--was made available to Senators just a few hours ago. So \nit is so new, the substitute, that copies of the amendment are just \npractically warm to the touch.\n  The CWC has undergone a thorough and rigorous evaluation in the \nSenate since its submission in November 1993, the subject of 17 \nhearings, dozens of witnesses, 1,500 pages of testimony, questions and \nanswers, letters, reports, and other documentation.\n  By contrast, the bill before us, S. 495, arrives fresh and green, \nnever having been reported out of committee, never having been the \nsubject of a single congressional hearing.\n  This is not the way the Senate should consider important legislation, \nparticularly given the gravity of the subject matter contained in this \nbill. S. 495 changes existing American law with respect to domestic law \nenforcement, criminal penalties, international sanctions, and export \ncontrols. From what I can determine in these few hours, many of the \nchanges contained in S. 495 would weaken existing law.\n\n  Also, S. 495 conditions United States assistance to Russia for the \nsafeguarding and destruction of its vast chemical and biological weapon \nstockpile of 40,000 tons. These changes and others contained in S. 495 \nsignificantly alter American domestic and foreign policy, and as such \nshould be carefully studied by the Judiciary Committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, and the Foreign Relations Committee at a minimum \nbefore the Senate acts on it. But that has not happened.\n  The timing of this bill as a prelude to considering the Chemical \nWeapons Convention leaves the unmistakable impression that proponents \nof S. 495, or some of them, see it as an alternative or substitute to \nthe treaty. It is nothing of the kind.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention has been signed by 161 nations and \nratified by 72. It is a global treaty that bans an entire class of \nweapons of mass destruction. It prohibits the production, acquisition, \nstockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical weapons. The treaty, \nnegotiated and signed under Republican administrations and strongly \nsupported by our military leaders and battlefield commanders, is the \nproduct of American leadership in combating the international \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The CWC joins the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as the \ntriumvirate of multinational nonproliferation treaties that strengthen \nU.S. national security while at the same time enhancing global \nstability.\n  The bill, S. 495, falls well short of what U.S. participation in the \nChemical Weapons Convention can deliver. It does not have the depth, \nthe scope and the boldness of the CWC. More importantly, if this bill \nis passed as an alternative to the CWC, it would undermine our efforts \nto deprive aggressor nations and terrorist organizations of the use of \nchemical weapons.\n  The CWC makes illegal the development, production, or possession of \nchemical weapons by signatory states. S. 495 applies only to the United \nStates. Furthermore, S. 495 would require sanctions against countries \nonly if they use chemical weapons, punishment already existing in U.S. \nlaw. Nations that produce, possess, or transfer chemical weapons would \nnot be affected by S. 495.\n  The CWC requires that signatory states begin destruction of their \nchemical weapons within 1 year of the treaty's entry into force and \ncomplete that destruction in 10 years, a commitment the United States \nhas already made independently of the CWC. By contrast, S. 495 does not \nrequire the destruction of a single chemical bomb or warhead.\n  The CWC, our Chemical Weapons Convention that will come before us \nnext week, creates a verification regime to provide for on-site \ninspection of signatory nations to ensure compliance with the \nprohibitions created in the treaty. S. 495 concerns itself with \npunishing individuals and/or nations\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\nafter chemical weapons are used and lives are lost, not with the \nabolition of the insidious weapons prior to their use.\n  Countries that are not signatories to the CWC are isolated from the \nworld community and prohibited from buying certain dual-use chemicals \nfrom member states that could be fashioned into weapons of mass \ndestruction, in the process hampering the economic potential of their \ndomestic industries, chemical and otherwise. S. 495 does nothing to \nleverage nonsignatory nations to forswear the production and possession \nof chemical weapons, thereby leaving open the door for the spread of \nthese destabilizing weapons.\n  Those are some of the major shortcomings of S. 495 as an alternative \nto Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and its \nimplementation legislation.\n  S. 495 is not simply an ineffective tool in ridding the world of \nchemical weapons; it also contains a number of legal ambiguities and \npolicy flaws that weaken existing U.S. law and add weight to why the \nSenate should reject the bill. Even a quick reading of S. 495 reveals \nsignificant problems with the bill from both a legal and national \nsecurity perspective. I think a more careful analysis by the committees \nof jurisdiction would undoubtedly reveal more problems.\n  There are two sections in S. 495, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe analysis of these two sections of S. 495 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       S. 495 is divided into two sections: Title I sets forth \n     penalties for unlawful activities within the United States or \n     by United States nationals abroad. Title II makes changes to \n     the Arms Export Control Act and other portions of existing \n     law regarding the imposition of economic and diplomatic \n     sanctions against any foreign government determined to have \n     used chemical or biological weapons illegally. Other \n     significant changes are contained in Title II, including \n     placing limits on U.S. assistance to Russia for the \n     transportation, safeguarding and destruction of such weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are a number of policy flaws in S. 495 which I want \nto highlight in the few minutes remaining, Mr. President. Specifically, \nthis bill would substantially weaken current criminal provisions in at \nleast five significant areas. This bill weakens existing criminal law \nin at least five areas, from even a cursory view.\n  First, new provisions in title I of the bill would expressly \nauthorize ownership, production, sale or use of chemical and biological \nweapons for a broad array of purposes described as exempted conduct. \nThe FBI has expressed concern about this new exemption in law, stating \nif this approach is taken, ``the legitimate purpose allowed must be \nspecifically defined and narrowly tailored'' to avoid rendering the \nprohibitions toothless.\n  But, unfortunately, section 229(b) defines the term ``exempted \nconduct'' to include:\n\n       (A) any peaceful purpose related to an industrial, \n     agricultural, research, medical, pharmaceutical activity,\n       (B) any protective purpose directly related to protection \n     against the chemical or biological weapon.\n\n  The FBI has found significant ambiguities in this definition that can \nbecome major loopholes in the statute. For instance, any research \npurpose could mean a terrorist group or cult conducting research into \nchemical or biological weapons. Obviously they would assert it was for \na peaceful purpose, but under this new provision of law would it fall \nwithin the realm of research intended to be prohibited? The Aum \nShinrikyo was conducting research and testing. If they were discovered \nbefore they released deadly chemical agents into the subway in Tokyo in \n1995, they would not have necessarily violated this act, especially \nsince they were recognized at the time as a legitimate religious group \nand were not viewed at that time as a terrorist organization.\n  The phrase in this bill ``any protective purpose'' which is used in \nexemption (B) is too broad, as well. Although hopefully not intended, \nthis exemption could be asserted in self-defense claims. A case \ninvolving an individual in possession of Ricin, a potent toxin, who \nused it as a form of a booby-trap is illustrative of a potential \nprotective purpose. This could be asserted by survivalist-type groups \nthat may store these types of weapons, as was the case, according to \nthe FBI, in 1985 when a white supremacist organization had a drum of \nchemical agents at their wooded compound.\n  Second, section 229(c)(2) of the new provision contains an exclusion \npermitting any ownership and possession of chemical and biological \nweapons by any member of the U.S. Armed Forces. This provision is \npoorly written. It does not appear to require official authorization \nfor the ownership or possession of the weapon. Just if you are in \nuniform, then you are exempted, whether or not you have authority or \nnot to be in possession of the weapon.\n  The same paragraph contains broad language authorizing ownership and \npossession of chemical and biological weapons by any person who is \n``attempting to seize the weapon.'' That language could conceivably \ninclude a terrorist who is attempting to seize chemical or biological \nweapons. By contrast, the existing law that it would replace covers any \nuse that is without lawful authority. That is a big difference. Again, \nthis bill weakens current law. Current law says if you have it without \nlawful authority, you violate the law. This provision substitutes a \nweaker law, a weaker provision, for what is in current law and exempts \npeople who are attempting to seize a weapon, whether or not they have \nlawful authority or not. That is a significant weakening of current \nlaw.\n  Third, current law authorizes a life sentence for any person who \n``knowingly assists a foreign state or any organization'' to acquire \nbiological warfare agents--or delivery systems for use with such \nweapons--or who attempts, threatens, or conspires to do so. This aspect \nof the law would be repealed by title I of S. 495 with no substitute.\n  Fourth, section 229C(a) of the new provision would authorize a \nmaximum sentence of 10 years for any person who knowingly uses riot \ncontrol agents as an act of terrorism, or knowingly assists any person \nto do so. By contrast, the existing law it would replace subjects any \nperson who uses chemical weapons, including riot control agents, \nwithout lawful authority to a life sentence.\n  Fifth, section 229C of the new provision would prohibit the \nunauthorized use of riot control agents only if use is an act of \nterrorism. Before any penalty could be imposed, law enforcement \nofficials would be required to prove that the chemicals were used to \nintimidate or coerce a civilian population, to influence the policy of \na government by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a \ngovernment by assassination or kidnaping. The existing law it would \nreplace contains no similar requirement; requires no proof. Possession \nis enough.\n  Turning attention to title II of S. 495, one of the most troublesome \nand counterproductive provisions of this bill is section 203 entitled \n``Criteria for United States Assistance to Russia.'' This section is a \nconglomeration of several of the conditions that have been proposed to \nthe CWC resolution of ratification, but which the administration cannot \naccept. Section 203 would require four Presidential certifications \nconcerning Russian compliance with existing chemical/biological \nagreements before United States assistance under the cooperative Threat \nReduction Program--also known as the Nunn-Lugar program--can be \nprovided. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shalikashvili \narticulated to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year, \nthe CWC's greatest attraction from a military standpoint is the \nrequirement for all parties to destroy their chemical weapons \nstockpiles, including the eventual destruction of approximately 40,000 \ntons of declared Russian chemical agents, the largest stockpile in the \nworld. Limiting cooperative threat reduction funding for this purpose \nmight endanger prospects for Russian ratification of the CWC as well as \nremove the most effective United States tool for inducing Russia to \ndismantle its massive chemical weapons stockpile.\n  Another section of the bill that should concern Senators is section \n208, entitled ``Negative Security Assurances.'' This provision calls \nfor classified and unclassified reports to Congress on ``the \nappropriate range of nuclear and conventional responses to the use of \nchemical or biological weapons against the United States Armed\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nForces, United States citizens, allies and third parties.'' The text of \nthis provision is different from the agreed-to condition contained in \nthe CWC Resolution of Ratification and requires the submission of the \nreport to the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations \nand the Speaker of the House, a peculiar designation to say the least. \nFurthermore, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has indicated that \nan unclassified report on this issue is not possible and, more \nimportantly, is concerned that the language in section 208 is designed \nto lead to a major change in U.S. Government policy in this area.\n  Mr. President, 1997 marks 80 years since the advent of chemical \nwarfare on the western front during World War I. It was in 1917 that \nstymied field commanders lifted the lid of Pandora's Box and unleashed \non the world a new kind of warfare, horrifying in its effects and \ninsidious in its indiscriminate application on the battlefield. It was \n80 years ago that dense, yellowish-green vapors, pushed along by light \nwinds, crept across the desolation of no-mans land and filled the \nbloodied trenches of a doomed generation of soldiers. Thousands of \nunprotected men suffocated to death in an excruciatingly painful and \nprotracted fashion, the inner lining of their lungs eaten away by the \npervasive gas. The world's abhorrence over the use of gas warfare in \nthe latter years of World War I led to the Geneva protocol of 1925 \nprohibiting the use of these weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Now, decades later, we are on the verge of the united world community \ndedicated to the complete abolition of these battlefield poisons. The \nonly question is whether the United States will follow through with the \nleadership it has shown in the past 15 years by joining the community \nof civilized nations and ratifying the CWC. The CWC has languished in \nthe Senate for 3\\1/2\\ years and time is short for us to act. We should \nnot be distracted by S. 495, a bill so rushed, so flawed, and so \ncounterproductive to our law enforcement, counterterrorism and national \nsecurity interests.\n  Its approval would constitute a step backward from the commitments we \nmade as a nation when President Bush signed the CWC in January, 1993. \nIn its descriptive title, S. 495 claims to be the Chemical and \nBiological Weapons Threat Reduction Act. But, in fact, it is nothing of \nthe sort. Nothing in this bill will remove chemical or biological \nweapons from foreign military weapons arsenals. Nothing in this bill \nwill deprive terrorists of the chemical or biological ingredients \nnecessary to threaten and kill innocent men, women and children in a \nsubway or at a shopping mall. S. 495 concerns itself with reacting to \nthe use of these weapons, not preventing their use.\n  History has shown that the threat of criminal penalties and economic \nsanctions will do little to deter those with no regard for \ninternational law and the sanctity of human life. The best way to \nprevent a chemical weapons attack is by preventing the attacker from \nobtaining such a weapon in the first place. This is the philosophical \nunderpinning of the CWC. It seeks to prevent the use of chemical \nweapons through abolition, while S. 495 relies on the deterrent effect \nof criminal penalties and economic sanctions, already contained in U.S. \nand international law, to inhibit their use.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against S. 495. Even \nafter a cursory review, the shortcomings of S. 495 are sufficiently \nnumerous and serious enough to warrant its defeat. The real test of \nthis body's resolve to strengthen our national security interests and \npromote global stability will come when the Senate turns its attention \nto the consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention. To endorse S. \n495 prior to our vote on ratification would send mixed signals to our \nallies and the rest of the international community about America's \nwillingness to lead in the fight against chemical weapons. At a time \nwhen the world community looks to us for leadership in the effort to \ncounter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we cannot \nafford to renege on such an important obligation.\n  Mr. KYL. In the interest of time, since we would like to get on with \nthe vote, I respond by saying that is a misreading of the bill. The \nexemptions are the same as the implementing legislation submitted by \nthe administration. The same for protective purposes. And he misreads \nthe exemption he spoke to about seizing the weapon. That is related \nonly to the pending destruction of the weapon authorized by law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have colleagues who have planes to catch, so I will try \nto be brief.\n  Let me be very, very blunt, as the Chair knows I usually am, much to \nmy detriment on occasion. This is not about anything, this vote. This \nvote is really designed to try to come up with a substitute for the \nchemical weapons treaty--to give people who want to say they voted \nagainst chemical weapons an ability, then, to vote against the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  I know we are supposed to be more diplomatic than that, and I know \nall that, and I am not suggesting that things in the bill are not \nworthwhile. They are. But this is what happens after we pass the \ntreaty, that is, the implementing legislation. The way treaties work \nis, if we pass a treaty like the Chemical Weapons Convention, then we \nwill come back here and pass implementing legislation. Just today, \nSenator Lugar and I have introduced legislation called the implementing \nlegislation. That is, how do we domestically implement what we have \njust signed on to internationally.\n  Now, this bill does some of those things. Some of the things in here, \nin this bill--and I have great respect for my friend from Arizona, I \nreally do. I always kid him and say my problem with him is he is too \nbright. I always prefer people who I am usually in disagreement with \nphilosophically that are not very bright. He is very bright. That is a \nproblem. So he is more effective. But I hope he will not be offended. I \nthink he would be willing to tell you not only does he believe in what \nis in here, he also hopes it has the political benefit of gathering \nenough votes to allow people the option to vote against the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  So, when I give this short shrift, I am not giving short shrift to \nthe ideas, please understand. But the Record should note that this is \nnot the norm; nobody that I am aware of, at least as long as I have \nbeen here, is usually willing to allow, without any hearings, a major \nbill to be brought up that is 64 pages long that most of us have not \nhad a chance to read.\n  I just want the Record to reflect why I am going to truncate this a \ngreat deal because this debate is not really about the substance here \nbut about the treaty. I will tell you why we need a treaty and why this \nlegislation, even if I knew all that was in it, and even if I agreed \nwith all that was in it, would not get the job done.\n  First, the treaty addresses two flaws in the Geneva Protocol which \nfocused on a single wrong. It said we would ban the use of chemical \nweapons. The Chemical Weapons Treaty says you cannot produce chemical \nweapons, you cannot own chemical weapons, you cannot stockpile them. \nThis legislation does nothing to affect any other country. Nothing we \ndo in here in any way puts or imposes a prohibition on other countries \nother than as it relates to how we will deal with them on a bilateral \nbasis.\n  Second, we need a Chemical Weapons Convention because it will \nstrengthen the ability of nations of the world to cooperate in placing \nstrict global controls on trade and chemicals. We want to be able to \ntrace the precursor chemicals that go from one country to another \ncountry, from one country or company to an individual, because that is \nthe thing that will allow us to trace down and see whether the bad \nguys, whether they be terrorists and or countries at large, are doing \nbad things. That is, possessing, building, or designing chemical \ncapability. This does nothing on that score.\n\n  Third, we need a Chemical Weapons Convention because we have decided \nto get rid of most of our chemical stockpile, and that decision was \njointly made by the Congress and the President in the 1980's. After the \nGulf War, George Bush announced we would destroy the rest.\n  The fourth reason is we need a treaty because it greatly enhances our \nability\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\nto detect and deter a chemical weapons program. This will do nothing to \naffect anybody else's chemical weapons programs.\n  In sum, the CWC will be a powerful instrument. This, at best, you \ncould say, would be something along the line of implementing \nlegislation, if we had that treaty passed, which I hope we will.\n  I might add, I agreed to allow this bill to come up before the \ntreaty, which is a very unusual way to do this because, quite frankly, \nI had no other way of getting the treaty up. Had I not agreed to this, \nmy colleagues could have filibustered or prevented it from coming out \nof committee. Even though I have the votes in the committee for the \ntreaty I could have prevented it from coming to the floor. This must be \nconfusing to people listening to this debate today, because why would \nwe vote on this before the international treaty? The answer is that we \nhave no choice. The answer is they've got me by the procedural ears \nhere. If we don't get a chance to vote on the CWC by the 28th, we are \nnot in the deal and we, as a nation, are very much out of sync.\n\n  I will conclude by suggesting that Senator Kyl's bill calls for a \ncouple of things that already are in the treaty. The bill does nothing \nto eliminate other nations' chemical weapons. It requires us to go back \nand renegotiate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which, as General \nBrent Scowcroft, not a man known for hyperbole, said the concept of \nstarting over was pure fantasy.\n  Next, this bill does nothing to strengthen trade controls \ninternationally. It has language about the Australia Group--an \norganization that is already in place and will stay in place. There is \nnothing extraordinary about that. The Australia Group exists and will \ncontinue to enforce trade controls.\n  Third, the Kyl bill provides sanctions against nations that use \nchemical weapons. That's already in law. The bill does strengthen this \nin minor respects, but it weakens it in others. It doesn't make it \nillegal to produce or stockpile these weapons.\n  Fourth, the Kyl bill does nothing to address trade sanctions that \nwill apply against U.S. companies if the Chemical Weapons Convention \nenters into force with us.\n  In sum, the Kyl bill is not a substitute for the Chemical Weapons \nTreaty, although there are things in the Kyl bill that I would vote \nfor.\n  As I told my friend--and I really do think he is my friend, and we \nhave been completely straight with one another--I am going to vote \nagainst this and urge my colleagues to do the same, because I don't \nknow enough to know what is in here. I will never forget that when I \nfirst got here, Senator Pastore of Rhode Island, an old fellow, was a \nvery powerful Senator; I asked him about something and he said, ``Boy, \nlet me tell you something. If you don't know what's in it, it's always \nsafer to vote no.'' So I am voting no. Although there might be some \nmerit to this, I can't find it. It is clearly not a substitute for the \nCWC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield my time back. I hope \nSenator Leahy will yield his time. In passing, at another time I will \nrespond to my friend from Delaware. I make the point that there is \nnothing in this legislation that requires any renegotiation of the \ntreaty. I assure my colleague of that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we yield back all of our time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation.\n  I yield back all my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The bill is before the Senate and open to amendment. If there be no \namendment to be proposed, the question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth], the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], and the Senator \nfrom Missouri [Mr. Bond] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Bond] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 606, the so-\ncalled Open Competition Act of 1997, introduced this afternoon by \nSenator Hutchinson from Arkansas. As I understand the proposal, it \nwould forbid the Federal Government from entering into so-called \nproject labor agreements on any Federal construction project. What \nprompted the bill is a proposed Executive order under consideration by \nthe administration.\n  That Executive order would permit Federal agencies to consider \nrequiring contractors on certain large Federal construction projects to \ncomply with labor contracts for the duration of the project. The \nExecutive order would not mandate this procedure for any contract. It \nwould simply direct the agencies to consider such agreements in \nappropriate circumstances.\n  These so-called project labor agreements have been used with great \nsuccess on numerous large-scale construction projects in the past. They \nwere used on large flood control and hydroelectric projects in the \n1930's. They\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nwere used when Disney World was being built in the 1970's. They were \nused on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 1970's and 1980's.\n  These agreements have also been used on Federal projects for decades. \nIn the late 1940's, the agreements were used regularly for construction \nat atomic energy facilities.\n  And the agreements continued to be used today. Across the country, \nnuclear sites are being decontaminated and decommissioned. The \nDepartment of Energy has entered into project labor agreements at the \nOak Ridge facility in Tennessee; the Idaho National Engineering \nLaboratory in Idaho; the Savannah River site in South Carolina; the \nFernald facility in Ohio; the Hanford/Richland site in Washington \nState; and the Lawrence Livermore facility in California--just to name \na few.\n  The agreements are also being used by State governments. In the \nBoston Harbor cleanup, for example, the State of Massachusetts required \ncontractors to comply with such labor agreements for the duration of \nthe work. That was a very large project, which is taking years to \ncomplete. The labor agreement is helping to ensure that the project is \ncarried out efficiently and safely.\n  According to an October 4, 1996, letter from the manager of \nindustrial relations on that project, the Boston Harbor cleanup was \noriginally projected to cost $6.1 billion. Now, the estimated total \ncost of the project is $3.4 billion. Accident rates are significantly \nlower than for projects of similar size and duration. And, during the \nnearly 7\\1/2\\ years that the project has been underway, ``there have \nbeen approximately 20 million craft hours worked without lost time due \nto strike or lock-out.'' Anti-union contractors challenged the \nrequirement in the Boston Harbor case, and in 1993 the U.S. Supreme \nCourt unanimously upheld the State's ability to issue the requirement.\n  Other States have taken the same approach. In January 1997, Governor \nPataki of New York issued an Executive order strikingly similar to that \nunder consideration by the President. Governor Pataki's order directed \nthat ``Each state agency shall establish procedures to consider, in its \nproprietary capacity, the utilization of one or more project labor \nagreements with respect to individual public construction projects.'' \nThe Governors of New Jersey and Nevada have recently issued similar \norders.\n  Despite the very clear advantages that such agreements can provide, \nthe proponents of this bill that has been introduced this afternoon, \ncontend that Government agencies should not enter into them because \nthey deny nonunion contractors and workers the opportunity to bid and \nwork on federally funded projects. This is false. Nonunion contractors \nare completely free to bid on projects subject to project labor \nagreements--and many do. In the Boston Harbor cleanup, for example, 40 \npercent of the subcontractors are nonunion firms.\n  Nor is it true that project labor agreements restrict jobs only to \nlabor union members. No such agreement requires that an individual join \nthe union to be referred for a job. In fact, the National Labor \nRelations Act forbids unions from discriminating against nonmembers \nwhen making job referrals.\n  Obviously, some of our Republican colleagues disagree strongly with \nsuch labor agreements. Many of us support them as sensible Federal \ncontracting policy and needed protection for working families.\n  At the very least, the Federal Government should not be denied the \nopportunity to gain the substantial benefits and savings that such \nagreements can supply, and that is why I hope that legislation \nintroduced to prohibit those agreements will not be favorably \nconsidered by the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3343-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RENEWING THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our indefatigable negotiator with \nresponsibility for mediating the outstanding, difficult issues between \nthe Israeli Government and the Palestinian authorities is back at work \nin the Middle East. The peace process was derailed by the intemperate \naction by the government led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, in supporting \nnew Israeli settlements in Jerusalem. There appears little doubt that, \nregardless of the failings of Mr. Arafat to fully restrain Palestinian \nreactions to this action, the Israeli leader bears very heavy \nresponsibility to undo the mischief which brought that elaborate tango \nof negotiations and actions called the peace process crashing down.\n  Now we read of an unfolding, unprecedented scandal centered around \nthat same Prime Minister. I have no judgment to make on that, but I \nhope that, as I have said before on this floor, Mr. Netanyahu will rise \nabove the pressures on him, particularly from his right wing, and face \nhistory squarely. It is up to him to make the crucial moves that will \nhalt the settlement construction, and take a courageous step. I call \nupon him, again, to do this, for the sake of the people of Israel and \nthe Palestinians.\n  It is important that the Clinton administration continue to take the \nposition that the settlement construction must be halted. Ambassador \nRoss is reported today to be pressing the Prime Minister to do so. The \nUnited States has an important stake in this matter. As the strongest \nally and the best friend that Israel ever had, or will have, it is \nsurely not too much to expect some consideration of the U.S. position \non this matter on the part of Mr. Netanyahu. He surely cannot expect to \ncontinue stonewalling the United States on this critical matter. I, for \none, felt he should not have come to the United States to meet \nextensively with our President with nothing in mind to offer \napparently. That is not what a good ally or a good friend does. He \ncertainly cannot expect us to stand by while he gives an American \nPresident--our President--no more than a hello and goodbye on such a \ncritical matter, and also then still expects the United States to \nprovide our annual supplement of over $3 billion in American tax \ndollars to Israel without batting an eye--$3 billion. I wonder if the \nAmerican people are aware of that, every year.\n  This is a crucial period for the Likud government. I hope that it \nwill see that support from the American people cannot continue to be in \nthe form of a blank check no matter what that government does to stall \nor derail the process of making peace with the Palestinians. It does \nnot do the Israeli people any good whatsoever for the message to go to \nthem that whatever happens is essentially fine with the United States \nGovernment. We need to be consistent, both in Washington and in New \nYork. The Clinton administration needs to take this into consideration, \nas well. We cannot take one position, against the settlements \nconstruction, here in Washington, and water it down by not endorsing \nthe same policy embodied in Security Counsel resolutions. That is \nspeaking out of both sides of our mouth. That is speaking with a forked \ntongue. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to speak in one voice with the \nadministration, and I urge the administration to be completely \nconsistent, not inconsistent, because inconsistency creates confusion. \nIt sends the wrong message. Make it clear that we will continue to act \nin good faith as a mediator and as an ally of Israel, but we expect the \nIsraeli Government to step up to the plate and make the kind of moves \nthat will be necessary to breathe new vigor and new life into the \nprocess of peacemaking, which is so critical to the people of Israel, \nto the Palestinians, to the United States and to our allies.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address a very real \nthreat to the economic well being of our Nation. I speak, of course, of \nthe anticipated issuance by President Clinton, of an Executive order \nthat would likely lead to the exclusion of nonunion contractors from \nFederal construction. I also wish to express my strong support for S. \n606,\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\nintroduced today by Senator Hutchinson, which I have cosponsored.\n  The strength and prosperity of this great Nation are in large part a \nresult of the industrial peace between labor and management, that has \nbeen the norm since the passage, in 1935, of the Wagner Act. That act, \nand its progeny, form the keystone of our national labor relations \npolicy. The bedrock belief supporting this policy has been to recognize \nthat the parties--workers, employers, and unions--are in the best \nposition to resolve their differences and to set and to achieve their \ngoals. To this end, Congress has maintained a basic hands-off policy, \npreferring to set only the broadest boundaries, beyond which the \nconduct of the parties must not stray. I have to say that our \ncongressional predecessors legislated wisely, for this policy of \nFederal Government neutrality has allowed the United States to become \nthe envy of the industrialized world.\n  This is not to say that there have not been bumps in the road to \nlabor-management harmony. Congress has amended the Federal labor laws, \nand also has considered, and rejected, amendments to the Federal labor \nlaws. Attempts by Congress to smooth the bumps, however, have been \nsubjected to one overriding process--any changes to the laws that \nnurture the balance between the parties in the industrial arena will \nhave been forged in the heat of legislative debate and advocacy.\n  Today, sadly, the Clinton administration considers an action that \nwould displace Federal neutrality, thereby renouncing over 60 years of \nnational labor policy, and ignoring 60 years of fine tuning of that \npolicy by Congress and the courts. Simply put, the Executive order \nbeing considered by the Clinton administration would result in most, if \nnot all, Federal construction being performed by union shop \ncontractors. This would give a whole new meaning to the term top down \norganizing. It would represent union organizing from the very top--the \nPresidency of the United States.\n  Further, this Clinton initiative would occur without benefit of the \nlegislative process, the process which in my opinion is mandated by the \nConstitution of the United States. And I find it even more \ndisheartening that this end run by the administration, of the policy \nsetting role of the Congress, seems less designed to serve the public \ninterest than to advance political interests.\n  Now, I understand that the administration will probably argue that \nthe proposed order does not mandate the adoption of a project labor \nagreement, and therefore does not inescapably lead to union-only \ncontractors on Federal construction projects. The administration would \ngo on to argue that since the order requires the Federal agencies to \nmake a finding that use of a project labor agreement would advance the \nGovernment's procurement interest, only where that finding is made \nwould union agreements be required. This argument, however, is suspect. \nThe introductory paragraphs of the draft order clearly indicate the \nPresident's preferences as to use of a project labor agreement. Since \nthe boss thinks it is such a good idea, it is not likely that persons \nthat the President selected to head the executive branch agencies would \nthink otherwise.\n  There is one other factor that is very important, and must be noted. \nEmployment in the construction industry, particularly where union \nagreements are in place, is done through hiring hall referrals. If a \nnonunion contractor is forced, because of a project labor agreement, to \nbecome a party to a union agreement, it is not hard to picture what \nwould happen to that contractor's employees. They would be at the back \nof the line when it comes to hiring hall referrals. This is despite the \nfact that the overwhelming majority of construction workers have not \nchosen to belong to a union.\n  I, and my Republican colleagues on the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, have written to the President, asking him not to issue this \nor any similar Executive order. We noted that if the proposed order \nwere adopted, it would undermine the benefits derived from a \nnondiscriminatory competitive bidding process, likely resulting in \nsubstantially higher Federal construction costs to the American \ntaxpayer. We further pointed out that, if adopted, the order would \ncause harm to the important principle of employee freedom of choice to \nselect or reject representation by a union. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  Finally, I congratulate Senator Hutchinson on introducing S. 606, and \noffer my full support in gaining its passage. The bill would prevent a \nFederal agency from requiring a bidder on a Federal contract to be a \nunion contractor. Frankly, it is unfortunate that we need to legislate \nopen competition, and outlaw this type of anticompetitive restriction, \nin the Federal procurement process. The Clinton initiative, however, \ndemonstrates the need for S. 606. I further note, that no matter what \none thinks of any specific provision of S. 606, my colleagues, from \nboth sides of the aisle, must be comforted to know, that before any \nchanges are made by S. 606 to Federal labor policy, those proposals \nwill be subjected to the debate, opinion gathering, and fact finding, \nthat is the hallmark of the legislative process. And whatever comes out \nof that process will be better, for this Nation, because of that \nprocess.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                    Labor and Human resources,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1997.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: It has been widely reported that the \n     Administration is preparing to issue an Executive Order \n     promoting the use of ``project labor agreements'' on federal \n     and federally funded construction projects. We have reviewed \n     a published draft of this proposed order and are writing to \n     you to express our grave concerns regarding this initiative.\n       The proposal would require executive branch agencies, which \n     are preparing to implement or fund a construction project, to \n     determine whether the use of a project labor agreement on \n     that project would ``advance the government's procurement \n     interest in economical, efficient, and timely high quality \n     project performance by promoting labor-management stability \n     and project compliance with applicable legal requirements \n     governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, \n     labor standards and other matters . . .'' While these are \n     laudable objectives, we note that federal law already \n     requires that they be met.\n       Under the proposal after an agency has made the requisite \n     determination, the ensuing construction project could be \n     performed only pursuant to an agreement with a union. We note \n     that any agency would be hard pressed not to answer this \n     determination in the positive, given that in the introduction \n     of the proposal, you extol the use of project labor \n     agreements. The bottom line of this proposal Executive Order \n     is that most, if not all, federal construction would be \n     performed by union shop contractors.\n       If the proposed order is issued, union status might well \n     trump savings to the taxpayers. Even if a qualified non-union \n     contractor might be able to bid the project at a substantial \n     savings to the American taxpayer, a higher-priced union \n     bidder would be awarded the contract under your proposal. \n     Even though the overwhelming majority of construction workers \n     have not chosen to belong to a union, they would be \n     effectively barred from federal construction work. It comes \n     as no surprise that the head of AFL-CIO Building and \n     Constructions Trades Department is reported to have \n     participated in the drafting of this proposal.\n       We believe that this proposed order threatens to undermine \n     the benefits derived from a nondiscriminatory competitive \n     bidding process, likely resulting in substantially higher \n     federal construction costs to the American taxpayer. Further, \n     the order would reverse the over sixty years of neutrality in \n     matters of labor-management relations by the federal \n     government. It also would injure an overreaching principle of \n     our nation's labor relations policy, that of employee freedom \n     of choice to select or reject representation by a union.\n       We urge you in the strongest terms to reconsider this \n     initiative, and not promulgate this or any similar Executive \n     Order giving greater encouragement to project labor \n     agreements for federal and federally assisted construction.\n           Sincerely,\n     James M. Jeffords,\n     Judd Gregg,\n     Mike DeWine,\n     Tim Hutchinson,\n     John W. Warner,\n     Dan Coats,\n     Bill Frist,\n     Michael B. Enzi,\n     Susan M.

Mr. President, I rise today to express the deep gratitude \nof the\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\nSenate to Ron Ledlow, the Deputy Director of the Senate Service \nDepartment, who is retiring after nearly 30 years of dedicated service \nto the Senate.\n  Ron Ledlow began his career 27 years ago this week as a pressman on \nthe night shift in the Service Department and rose through the \njourneyman ranks into management, eventually serving as the Director of \nthe Senate Service Department.\n  Ron has used his skill, creativity, and expertise in shepherding the \nSenate through nearly 30 years of changes in print, production, and \ngraphics technology on which we as Members, and an institution, rely.\n  Through all of these changes, Ron has been driven by his high \nstandards for quality control and exceptional customer service. His \nprofessionalism and respect for his employees and this institution have \nbeen a great example to his coworkers, and to all of us here in the \nSenate.\n  His contributions in support of democratic institutions are not \nlimited to the U.S. Senate. In 1990, under the Gift of Democracy \nResolution, Ron, along with several other congressional \nrepresentatives, went to Poland as a technical adviser. His counsel and \nassistance helped strengthen the emerging democratic institutions of \nPoland. Ron's assistance was so valuable, that he was asked to return \nto Poland for another tour of duty.\n  Outside of his work in the Service Department, Ron has served on \nseveral committees for the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union. Ron was an \nactive member of the Senate Staff Club and served as the club's \npresident in the mideighties. In 1991, Ron was presented with the Roll \nCall Sid Yudain Congressional Staffer of the Year Award.\n  Mr. President, our Senate family wishes Ron, his wife Dee, and his \nchildren Gerald and Steven the very best.

This may result in additional emission \n     controls in all areas, thus imposing significant economic, \n     administrative, and regulatory burdens on Michigan, its \n     citizens, businesses, and local governments; and\n       Whereas, EPA's own Clean Air Science Advisory Committee \n     (CASAC) was unable to find any ``bright line'' that would \n     distinguish any public health benefit among any of the \n     proposed new standards for ozone, including the current \n     standard; and\n       Whereas, there is very little existing PM2.5 monitoring \n     data; and\n       Whereas, there are many unanswered questions and scientific \n     uncertainties regarding the health effects of particulate \n     matter, in particular PM2.5, including: Divergent opinions \n     among scientists who have investigated the issue; Exposure \n     misclassification; Measurement errors; Lack of supporting \n     toxicological data; Lack of a plausible toxicological \n     mechanism; Lack of correlation between recorded PM levels and \n     public health effects; Influence of other variables; and The \n     existence of possible alternative explanations; and\n       Whereas, no scientific proof exists that establishing a \n     more stringent ozone standard or a new, more stringent PM2.5 \n     standard would avoid alleged adverse health, but it would \n     assuredly impose significantly higher costs; and\n       Whereas, the issue of transported volatile organic \n     compounds is not adequately addressed; Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     reaffirm the existing NAAQS for ozone; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     reaffirm the existing NAAQS for PM10; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     refrain from establishing a new NAAQS for PM2.5 at this time \n     and to gather the necessary PM2.5 monitoring data and conduct \n     all necessary research needed to address the issue of \n     causality and other critical and important unanswered \n     scientific questions concerning PM2.5; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we advise and strongly urge the EPA to \n     identify any unfunded mandates or other administrative and \n     economic burdens for state or local governments or agencies \n     that would result from the proposed changes to the NAAQS for \n     ozone and particulate matter; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the administrator of the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and other appropriate \n     administration officials.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-47.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking a child hostage in order to evade arrest; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  S. 602. A bill to provide a mandatory minimum sentence for State \ncrimes involving the use of a firearm, impose work requirements for \nprisoners, and prohibit the provision of luxury items to prisoners; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           CRIME LEGISLATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills \nintended to protect innocent Americans from the violent will of \ncriminals and fugitives. One need take only a quick review of recent \nstatistics to realize the chilling scope of our nation's crime \nproblems. For instance, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that \n11 million Americans were the victims of violent crime in 1994 alone. \nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics also reports that approximately 3.5 \nmillion Americans were accosted at gunpoint during that same year. \nThese statistics should galvanize us all into taking concrete steps to \nprotect innocent Americans against senseless victimization and turn the \ntide against criminals once and for all. My bills will help to do just \nthat.\n\n  The first bill I introduce today, the Crime Control Act of 1997, will \nensure that an individual convicted of committing a violent crime or \nengaging in drug trafficking activities while in possession of a gun, \nwill go to jail for 10 years, and not a day less. If an offender fires \na gun while committing those crimes, that offender will go to jail for \n20 years. And should that criminal make the mistake of using a \nmachinegun or a gun with a silencer to commit those crimes, that \ncriminal will be incarcerated for 30 years. Once imprisoned, the Crime \nControl Act provides hardened criminals with no option for parole or \nreduced sentences that would allow them another chance to harm innocent \ncitizens.\n  Simply put, the passage of my Crime Control Act ensures that if you \ndo the crime, you will most certainly do the time. And under my bill, \nthat time won't be easy. A key initiative of the Crime Control Act is \nthe creation of work programs for all able bodied prisoners by the \nAttorney General. In addition, my bill prohibits the government from \nproviding any entertainment devices, like televisions, radios, or \nstereos, for use in individual prisoner cells. Federal prisons are not \nthe place for entertainment. They are not intended to be fun. They are \nthe places where individuals repay their debt to society and in the \ncase of violent criminals, it is a very large debt indeed. My Crime \nControl Act makes sure that violent criminals pay that debt, and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this important and effective \ncrime control measure.\n  The second bill I introduce today applies directly to actions taken \nby fugitives who resist arrest. Over the past few years, America has \nwitnessed an unfortunate trend involving standoffs between the U.S. \nGovernment and parties who reject its authority to enforce the laws of \nthis land--specifically, the incidents in Waco, TX; Ruby Ridge, ID; and \nGarfield County, MT. Thankfully, the episode involving the Freemen did \nnot escalate to violence or bloodshed. Regrettably, this does not hold \ntrue for Waco or Ruby Ridge, where there was a tragic loss of life to \ncivilians and Government agents alike.\n  Each of these situations jeopardized children's lives--innocent \nchildren who had no choice in the role they played in these standoffs. \nIn Waco, 25 young children under the age of 15 died in the blaze that \nspread throughout the compound. These deaths occurred despite the \nrepeated efforts by Federal agents to encourage Branch Davidians \nleaders to allow children to leave the compound.\n  At Ruby Ridge, a 14-year-old died after being caught in gunfire. And \nduring the Freeman standoff, Americans across the Nation held their \nbreath--praying that violence would not erupt. Once again, the lives of \nchildren were placed in jeopardy. But thankfully, this time, the \nchildren--and adults--emerged unharmed.\n  As we have seen, tragedy can occur in these very tense situations. \nAbove all else, we need to ensure that children are kept out of these \nsituations in the future. People who arm themselves after failing to \ncomply with warrants or because they seek to avoid arrest must realize \nthat, whether or not it is intended, children are implicated in these \nstandoffs. We cannot allow this to continue any longer. We cannot allow \nanother child's life to be endangered in this manner.\n  This bill seeks to protect children from harm in these standoff \nsituations. My bill would make it a crime to detain a child when two \nconditions are met: if a person is trying to evade arrest or avoid \ncomplying with a warrant, and that person uses force, or threatens to \nuse force, against a Federal agent. Any person convicted of violating \nthis act would be imprisoned for 10-25 years. If a child is injured, \nthe penalty would be increased to 20-35 years. If a child is killed, \nthe penalty would be life imprisonment.\n  No law can ever assure that children will be kept free from harm. But \nthis legislation will help assure that children do not become \ninadvertent, innocent pawns when violent situations arise. It will \nprovide a deterrent to involving a child in any standoff--and severe \npenalties for those who ignore the law.\n  Both of the bills I introduce today are aimed at protecting the \ninnocents in our society, and I urge my colleagues to support them. \nAmerica needs to be a place where innocent citizens do not have to fear \nfor their life\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\nbecause gun-toting criminals and drug pushers linger on the streets. It \nneeds to be a place where children are not the captives of adults \nintent upon resisting arrest. Freedom from violence and captivity are \nbasic tenets of our society, which most Americans enjoy and respect. \nThose among us who don't share our respect for the laws of our society \nmust realize that their actions are criminal, and that in America, \ncriminal actions have repercussions. The passage of these bills will \nmake sure that they do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 603. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and \ndisseminate statistically reliable information from milk manufacturing \nplants on prices received for bulk cheese and to provide the Secretary \nwith the authority to require reporting by such manufacturing plants \nthroughout the United States on prices received for cheese, butter, and \nnonfat dry milk; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 604. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to use the price of feed grains \nand other cash expenses as factors that are used to determine the basic \nformula price for milk and any other milk price regulated by the \nSecretary; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                        agricultural legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \ntwo pieces of legislation which will respond to a very serious problem \non the falling prices of milk which have occurred in Pennsylvania, \nespecially in northeastern Pennsylvania, and across the country.\n  In introducing this legislation, I am pleased to have a chance to \naddress this issue in the presence of the distinguished Senator from \nKansas, who was the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and is \nmaking quite an addition to the U.S. Senate. It is not inappropriate to \nnote that Senator Roberts is from Kansas, as I am a native of Kansas. I \nwas born in Wichita, grew up in Russell, and worked on a farm as a \nteenager and have some appreciation of the problems of the farmers.\n  During my tenure in the U.S. Senate, I have been on the Agriculture \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. There are more people \nliving in rural Pennsylvania than live in the rural part of any State \nin the Union. Mr. President, my colleague from Kansas, we have 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion people living in rural Pennsylvania. When I last looked, which \nis a while ago, there were not 2\\1/2\\ million people living in all of \nKansas, let alone 2 million people--slightly reduced--when I moved into \nPennsylvania. So I approach this issue with some due regard for the \nexpert presiding over the U.S. Senate. Having discussed this issue with \nhim before, I am not sure he agrees with me on all aspects.\n  I am of the firm opinion that something needs to be done to help the \nmilk farmers. I say that because the price of milk has fallen \nprecipitously from almost $16 per hundredweight down to $11 per \nhundredweight. It has gone back up a little, but not a great deal.\n  In responding to that problem, I asked the distinguished Secretary of \nAgriculture, Dan Glickman, also a Kansan, to accompany me to \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, which he did, on February 10. We met a crowd \nof approximately 500 to 750 angry farmers who complained about the \nprecipitous drop in the price of milk.\n  During the course of my analysis of this pricing problem, I found \nthat the price of milk depended upon a number of factors, one of which \nwas the price of cheese. For every 10 cents the price of cheese was \nraised, the price of milk would be raised by $1 per hundredweight. Then \nI found that the price of cheese was determined by the National Cheese \nExchange in Green Bay, WI. At least according to a survey made by the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, there was an issue as to whether the price of \ncheese established by the Green Bay exchange was accurate or not. The \nauthors of the report used a term as tough as manipulation. Whether \nthat is so or not, there was a real question as to whether that price \nwas accurate.\n  Since this controversy has arisen--perhaps it brought the matter to a \nhead, perhaps not; perhaps it would have happened anyway--it has been \nannounced that the Green Bay exchange will close and will be replaced \nby a new commodity market on May 1. In any event, in my discussions \nwith Secretary Glickman, I found he had the power to raise the price of \nmilk unilaterally by establishing a different price of cheese.\n  This subject was aired during the course of his testimony when he \ncame before the appropriations subcommittee. It is a very good time to \nfind a more-agreeable-than-usual Cabinet officer when a Cabinet officer \ncomes in for the appropriations process for his Department's budget.\n  During the course of that hearing, we could not explore fully the \nissue of the price of milk and the price of cheese, so our \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Cochran, agreed to have a special \nhearing, which we had a couple of weeks later. At that time, Secretary \nGlickman said that they had ascertained the identity of 118 people or \nentities who had cheese transactions that could establish a different \nprice of cheese. He told me they had written to the 118 and were having \nproblems getting responses. I suggested it might be faster to telephone \nthose people.\n\n  Secretary Glickman provided my staff and me with the list of people, \nand we telephoned them and found, after reaching approximately half of \nthem, that the price of cheese was, in fact, 16 cents higher by those \nindividuals than otherwise.\n  I have been pressing Secretary Glickman since. If he has C-SPAN2, or \nif he knows someone who has C-SPAN2 or if he talks to someone who has \nC-SPAN2, my staff has been exhorting his staff daily to act on it, and \nI am going to send him a fax letter before the day is up to try to get \na determination on this issue, because I am on my way to northeastern \nPennsylvania again next Monday on a routine trip to the Wilkes-Barre/\nScranton area. The Presiding Officer knows what that is like. There \nwill be people who want answers to questions, and I shall answer with \ndue diligence, which I think I have. I hope the Secretary of \nAgriculture will note this different price of cheese and act \naccordingly to raise the price of milk.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today goes to two points. One \nis to amend the Agriculture Market Transition Act to require the \nSecretary to use the price of feed grains and other cash expenses in \nthe dairy industry as factors that are used to determine the basic \nformula for the price of milk and other milk prices regulated by the \nSecretary.\n  Simply stated, the Government should use what it costs for production \nto establish the price of milk, so that if the farmers are caught with \nrising prices of feed and other rising costs of production, they can \nhave those rising costs reflected in the cost of milk.\n  The second piece of legislation would require the Secretary of \nAgriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable \ninformation from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk \ncheese and provide the Secretary with the authority to require \nreporting by such manufacturing plants throughout the United States on \nthe prices for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk.\n  Frankly, I am reluctant to impose this obligation anywhere, but I \nthink it is a fair request to make since the Secretary told the \nSubcommittee on Agriculture of the Appropriations Committee that the \nSecretary could not get this information on a voluntary basis. People \nwould not comply. My staff found that corroborated when we telephoned \nthe individuals who had these transactions. Burdensome as it is, I \nthink it is fair to give the Secretary the authority to require this \nreporting.\n  Mr. President, I am authorized to say that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, wishes to cosponsor the piece of \nlegislation requiring the information to be collected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 603\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n     SECTION 1.\n\n       (1) Not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall collect and disseminate, on a weekly \n     basis, statistically reliable information, obtained from \n     cheese manufacturing areas in the United States on prices \n     received and terms of trade involving bulk cheese, including \n     information on the national average price for bulk cheese \n     sold through spot and forward contract transactions. To the \n     extent practicable, the Secretary shall report the prices and \n     terms of trade for spot and forward contract transaction \n     separately,\n       (2) The Secretary may require dairy product manufacturing \n     plants in the United States to report to the Secretary on a \n     weekly basis the price they receive for cheese, butter and \n     nonfat dry milk sold through spot sales arrangements, forward \n     contracts or other sales arrangements.\n       (3) All information provided to, or acquired by, the \n     Secretary under subsections (1) and (2) shall be kept \n     confidential by each officer and employee of the Department \n     of Agriculture except that general weekly statements may be \n     issued that are based on the information and that do not \n     identify the information provided by any person.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                 S. 604\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BASIC FORMULA PRICE.\n\n       Section 143(a) of the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 7253(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(5) Basic formula price.--In carrying out this subsection \n     and section 8c(5) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 608c(5)), reenacted with amendments by the \n     Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the Secretary \n     shall use as factors that are used to determine the basic \n     formula price for milk and any other milk price regulated by \n     the Secretary--\n       ``(A) the price of feed gains, including the cost of \n     concentrates, byproducts, liquid whey, hay, silage, pasture, \n     and other forage; and\n       ``(B) other cash expenses, including the cost of hauling, \n     artificial insemination, veterinary services and medicine, \n     bedding and litter, marketing, custom services and supplies, \n     fuel, lubrication, electricity, machinery and building \n     repairs, labor, association fees, and assessments.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, a bill which attempts to \naddress problems in the dairy industry stemming from the lack of \nadequate price discovery in manufactured dairy product markets.\n  There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding the National \nCheese Exchange [NCE], currently located in Green Bay, WI. The NCE is a \nsmall cash market that trades less than 1 percent of all bulk cheese \nsold nationally, has few traders, short trading periods, and infrequent \ntrading sessions. Those characteristics make this exchange vulnerable \nto price manipulation. Trading on this exchange would not be a concern \nif it did not have such tremendous influence over cheese prices \nnationally. However, because the Cheese Exchange is the only source of \ncheese price information in the country, it acts as a benchmark or \nreference price for most off-exchange cheese sales. There simply is no \nother reliable source of information, no other source of price \ndiscovery, available for buyers and sellers in this industry to use as \nan indicator of market conditions. Because the price for cheese \ndirectly and indirectly affects the price of milk, dairy farmers are \njustifiably concerned about the lack of adequate cheese price \ninformation and the influence of the NCE on prices they receive for \nmilk.\n  Concern about the Cheese Exchange among dairy farmers, while on-going \nfor many years, heightened late last year when cheese prices at the \nexchange fell dramatically in just a few weeks, causing record declines \nin milk prices paid to farmers. While milk prices have recovered \nslightly, they are expected to fall again next month as a result of \nfurther price declines at the National Cheese Exchange.\n  While the National Cheese Exchange is closing its doors at the end of \nthis month, a new but nearly identical cash market for cheese is \nopening at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It is expected that this \nnew market, which appears to share a number of the flaws of the Cheese \nExchange, will serve as the reference price for cheese throughout the \ncountry. It is unclear whether this market will be capable of providing \nadequate price discovery for the dairy industry.\n  That is why the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and I are \nintroducing this bill today. This legislation requires the Secretary to \ncollect and disseminate statistically reliable cheese price information \ncollected from cheese manufacturing plants throughout the country--a \nprovision also included in my bill, S. 258, which I introduced in \nFebruary. A price series of this type will not only provide more price \ninformation, it will provide more reliable information based on \ntransactions throughout the country rather than on one thinly traded \ncash market.\n  Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has already begun this process. \nLast August, I asked the Secretary to use his existing administrative \nauthority to initiate a weekly price survey of cheese plants to improve \ncheese price discovery and lessen the influence of the small but \npowerful National Cheese Exchange on milk prices. Secretary Glickman \ngraciously agreed to conduct such a survey, which formally began this \nJanuary on a monthly basis, and became a weekly survey last month. I \nhave been very pleased with the Secretary's response to the concerns \nabout cheese pricing and effect of the National Cheese Exchange on \nfarm-level milk prices and I appreciate his efforts on this matter.\n  Since that survey is relatively new, it is still unclear whether it \nwill produce prices which reflect market conditions. That depends upon \nthe voluntary participation of those manufacturers reporting prices as \nwell as on the integrity of the data reported.\n\n  On March 13, both Secretary Glickman and I testified before the \nSenate Agriculture Appropriations Committee about the problem of the \nCheese Exchange and the lack of reliable price information in the dairy \nindustry and the potential for this new price series to address that \nproblem. At that time, the Secretary indicated that if participation by \ncheese manufacturers in his new survey was inadequate, the Department \nmay need to consider requiring participation in that survey. However, \nunder current law, the Secretary has only very limited authority to \nrequire cheese price reporting by manufacturing plants.\n  The bill we are introducing today requires the Secretary to continue \nhis cheese price collection and reporting activities and provides him \nwith broader authority to require participation by cheese manufacturers \nin that survey. I want to make clear that this bill does not mandate \nthat the Secretary require participation in the cheese price survey, \nbut merely provides him with the authority to do so if it is necessary \nto ensure the new cheese price survey is statistically reliable. Under \nthe current survey procedures, many cheese manufacturers are already \nparticipating voluntarily, so this new Secretarial authority may not be \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that dairy farmers have some \nassurances that cheese prices, which have such a dramatic impact on the \nprice of milk, are reflective of market conditions and not vulnerable \nto manipulation. By improving price discovery, the new USDA cheese \nprice survey implemented by Secretary Glickman may help accomplish that \ngoal. If mandatory price reporting is necessary to produce accurate \nsurvey data, our bill provides the Secretary with the authority to \nrequire participation. However, I am hopeful that participation in the \nsurvey will continue to be high so that mandatory reporting never \nbecomes necessary.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for working with me to devise \nlegislation that might effectively improve price discovery in the dairy \nindustry and I welcome his interest in this important issue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 605. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \nemergency assistance to producers for cattle losses that are due to \ndamaging weather or related condition occurring during the 1996-97 \nwinter season, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n             AGRICULTURAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my State has been hit by one of the most \nremarkable series of events ever in the history of our State.\n  First we had the greatest snowfall in our State's history, over 100 \ninches of snow. Then the last of eight major blizzards hit. The eighth \nand final blizzard\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\nwas the most powerful winter storm in 50 years. It included almost 2 \nfeet of snow as well as major ice storms, then followed by 70 mile-an-\nhour winds that were devastating--80,000 people lost their electricity, \nmany of them for a week. The economic devastation is truly remarkable.\n  Now in the last 12 hours even more disaster is occurring. I am going \nto read just briefly from the major newspaper in my State, which is in \nthe largest city of our State, Fargo, ND.\n  The article begins this way:\n\n       At 12:15 a.m. today, the flood of 1997 officially became \n     the worst in Fargo-Moorhead's history.\n       The National Weather Service said a reading taken at that \n     time put the Red River's level at 39.12 feet. That exceeds . \n     . . the river level measured in the flood of 1897--until this \n     morning, the worst ever.\n       That also means the Red [River] has hit the 500-year flood \n     level.\n       Speaking on [a local] radio [station] at 1:15 a.m., city \n     Operations Manager Dennis Walaker struck an ominous note.\n       Walaker said, ``We are at river stages that exceed the 1897 \n     level. No one has ever seen this much water in the Fargo \n     area, ever. All we can do is react.''\n\n  I just talked to the mayor, and I just talked to Mr. Walaker. He \ntells me they have 15 square miles of water headed for Fargo, ND. This \non top of the river which is 20 feet above flood stage. There is just a \nmass scramble to try to deal with this extraordinary flood threat.\n\n       The crest is not expected to be much higher than [about \n     39.5 feet] but officials will reevaluate the situation this \n     morning. . . .\n       Iced-over farm fields liquefied. Shelterbelt snowdrifts \n     shrank. Drainage ditches whooshed into coulees and merged \n     with rivers.\n       In rural Cass County . . . winter turned into water.\n       By noon, sheets of melted snow rolled toward the Red River. \n     Water that couldn't fit into engorged rivers, particularly \n     the Wild Rice River, took off over land. The overland flows \n     crossed I-29--\n\n  The major north-south Federal highway--\n\n       near the Horace exit and threatened homes in southwest \n     Fargo.\n       At midmorning, [the mayor] warned residents of approaching \n     overland flooding. He suggested people leave work and check \n     their property if they live in--\n\n  Certain residential areas.\n\n       By midafternoon, some students were leaving [schools] \n     because of the flood threat.\n       The situation was even more urgent next to the Red River. \n     Fargo-Moorhead homeowners who hadn't lost the battle Tuesday \n     asked for more sandbags and sandbaggers. North Dakota State \n     University canceled classes so students could help in the \n     fight.\n\n  I will not go further, Mr. President, other than to say this is \nabsolutely an extraordinary time. One of the areas in which we have \nbeen hit the hardest is cattle death losses. The number of cattle \nlosses are at least 112,000 head at this point. North Dakota Farm \nService Agency reports that nearly 80,000 of them are from the weekend \nstorm of April 4 through 6 alone, a storm that is being called Blizzard \nHannah. I fear, Mr. President, that many more calves may die.\n  This is such an extraordinary set of events. These pictures depict \nsome of the situations and scenes that we are seeing across the State \nof North Dakota. Here, one cow is nuzzling a calf with a dead cow \nalongside. What happened in this storm, which was so powerful, is that \nnot only did cattle freeze to death, but many suffocated because the \nwinds were so intense that compacted snow was blown up into their \nnostrils and they suffocated.\n  Mr. President, this next picture shows what we are seeing all too \noften. Here a farmer is coming down the road to inspect the herd. Here \nis a cow dead in a ditch. All across North Dakota, carcasses are \nlittered after this devastation.\n  Here is an all-too-often sight. This is a cow frozen in a snow bank. \nIt is not just a snow bank, it is actually ice and snow together. \nPeople report that these snow banks are like concrete. There was first \nthis heavy snowfall, then the ice, then these incredible winds. These \ncattle did not have a chance.\n  For that reason, today I am introducing legislation that will provide \nfor an indemnification payment. I hope that this legislation will be \nenacted. I hope that my colleagues will understand the massive economic \nloss in my State.\n  Under this legislation, producers who have experienced a 5-percent \nloss of their cattle herd or calf crop would receive indemnity payments \nof $200 per head, up to 200 of lost livestock. In some cases, losses \nwill be covered by private insurance. In these instances, producers \nwill be able to receive indemnity payments under my program, but the \ntotal payments of private insurance and Government indemnity cannot \nexceed the expected value of a cow.\n  I have been working with my colleagues from the Dakotas, Senator \nDorgan from North Dakota, and Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson from \nSouth Dakota to implement assistance to livestock producers in North \nDakota and South Dakota. We will continue working to provide \nmeaningful, comprehensive relief.\n  Cattle producers in my State have asked for something simple and \nsomething that will help them overcome these overwhelming difficulties. \nMy legislation accomplishes those goals, and I call on my colleagues to \noffer this assistance to livestock producers.\n  I understand I have a colleague standing by who would like to have \ntime as well, so I do not want to extend this, other than to send the \nlegislation to the desk and ask it be appropriately referred. I \nintroduce it on behalf of myself and my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan. I urge my colleagues' close attention to it.\n  Again, Mr. President, we are faced with what I call a slow-motion \ndisaster, because it is a circumstance in which you do not have the \nflood come and leave. In this circumstance, the flood has come, and it \nis staying. In addition to that, we have all of these other severe \nweather factors to cope with.\n  I, again, hope that we will move expeditiously with the supplemental \ndisaster legislation so that we can fund the programs necessary to help \nin the recovery that is so urgently needed, not only in my State but in \nthe States of Minnesota and South Dakota as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 608. A bill to authorize the enforcement by State and local \ngovernments of certain Federal Communications Commission regulations \nregarding use of citizens band radio equipment; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              CB RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation designed \nto provide a practical solution to the all too common problem of \ninterference with residential home electronic equipment caused by \nunlawful use of citizens band [CB] radios. This problem can be \nextremely distressing for residents who cannot have a telephone \nconversation, watch television, or listen to the radio without being \ninterrupted by a neighbor's illegal use of a CB radio. Unfortunately, \nunder the current law, those residents have little recourse. The bill I \nam introducing today will provide those residents with a practical \nsolution to this problem.\n  Up until recently, the FCC has enforced its rules outlining what \nequipment may or may not be used for CB radio transmissions, how long \ntransmissions may be broadcast, what channels may be used, as well as \nmany other technical requirements. FCC also investigated complaints \nthat a CB radio enthusiast's transmissions interfered with a neighbor's \nuse of home electronic and telephone equipment. FCC receives thousands \nof such complaints annually.\n  Mr. President, for the past 3 years I have worked with constituents \nwho have been bothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio \ntransmissions in some cases caused by unlawful use of radio equipment. \nIn each case, the constituents have sought my help in securing an FCC \ninvestigation of the complaint. In each case, Mr. President, the FCC \nindicated that due to a lack of resources, the Commission no longer \ninvestigates radio frequency interference complaints. Instead of \ninvestigation and enforcement, the FCC is able to provide only self-\nhelp information which the consumer may use to limit the interference \non their own.\n  In many cases, residents implement the self-help measures recommended \nby FCC such as installing filtering devices to prevent the unwanted \ninterference, working with their telephone company, or attempting to \nwork with the neighbor they believe is causing\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nthe interference. In many cases these self-help measures are effective.\n  However, in some cases filters and other technical solutions fail to \nsolve the problem because the interference is caused by unlawful use of \nCB radio equipment such as unauthorized linear amplifiers.\n  Municipal residents, after being denied investigative or enforcement \nassistance from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town \ngovernment and ask them to police the interference. However, the \nCommunications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal \nGovernment for the regulation of radio, preempting municipal ordinances \nor State laws to regulate radio frequency interference caused by \nunlawful use of CB radio equipment. This has created an interesting \ndilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass their own \nordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they rely on the \nagency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to enforce the \nvery Federal law which preempts them.\n  Let me give an example of the kind of frustrations people have \nexperienced in attempting to deal with these problems. Shannon Ladwig, \na resident of Beloit, WI has been fighting to end CB interference with \nher home electronic equipment that has been plaguing her family for \nover a year. Shannon worked within the existing system, asking for an \nFCC investigation, installing filtering equipment on her telephone, \nattempting to work with the neighbor causing the interference, and so \non. Nothing has been effective. Shannon's answering machine picks up \ncalls for which there is no audible ring, and at times records ghost \nmessages. Often, she cannot get a dial tone when she or her family \nmembers wish to place an outgoing call. During telephone conversations, \nthe content of the nearby CB transmission can frequently be heard and \non occasion, her phone conversations are inexplicably cut off. Her TV \ntransmits audio from the CB transmission rather than the television \nprogram her family is watching. Shannon never knows if the TV program \nshe taped with her VCR will actually record the intended program or \nwhether it will contain profanity from a nearby CB radio conversation.\n\n  Shannon did everything she could to solve the problem and a year \nlater she still feels like a prisoner in her home, unable to escape the \nbroadcasting whims of a CB operator using illegal equipment with \nimpunity. Shannon even went to her city council to demand action. The \nBeloit City Council responded by passing an ordinance allowing local \nlaw enforcement to enforce FCC regulations--an ordinance the council \nknows is preempted by Federal law. Earlier this year, the Beloit City \nCouncil passed a resolution supporting the legislation I am introducing \ntoday, which will allow at least part of that ordinance to stand.\n  The problems experienced by Beloit residents are by no means isolated \nincidents. I have received very similar complaints from at least 10 \nother Wisconsin communities in the last several years in which whole \nneighborhoods are experiencing persistent radio frequency interference. \nSince I have begun working on this legislation, my staff has also been \ncontacted by a number of other congressional offices who are also \nlooking for a solution to the problem of radio frequency interference \nin their States or districts caused by unlawful CB use. The city of \nGrand Rapids, MI, in particular, has contacted me about this \nlegislation because they face a persistent interference problem very \nsimilar to that in Beloit. In all, FCC receives more than 30,000 radio \nfrequency interference complaints annually--most of which are caused by \nCB radios. Unfortunately, FCC no longer has the staff, resources, or \nthe field capability to investigate these complaints and localities are \nblocked from exercising any jurisdiction to provide relief to their \nresidents.\n  The legislation I am introducing today attempts to resolve this \ndilemma by allowing States and localities to enforce existing FCC \nregulations regarding authorized CB equipment and frequencies while \nmaintaining exclusive Federal jurisdiction over the regulation of radio \nservices. It is a commonsense solution to a very frustrating and real \nproblem which cannot be addressed under existing law. Residents should \nnot be held hostage to a Federal law which purports to protect them but \nwhich cannot be enforced.\n  This legislation is by no means a panacea for the problem of radio \nfrequency interference. My bill is intended only to help localities \nsolve the most egregious and persistent problems of interference--those \ncaused by unauthorized use of CB radio equipment and frequencies. In \ncases where interference is caused by the legal and licensed operation \nof any radio service, residents will need to resolve the interference \nusing FCC self-help measures that I mentioned earlier.\n  In many cases, interference can result from inadequate home \nelectronic equipment immunity from radio frequency interference. Those \nproblems can only be resolved by installing filtering equipment and by \nimproving the manufacturing standards of home telecommunications \nequipment. The electronic equipment manufacturing industry, represented \nby the Telecommunications Industry Association and the Electronics \nIndustry Association, working with the Federal Communications \nCommission, has adopted voluntary standards to improve the immunity of \ntelephones from interference. Those standards were adopted by the \nAmerican National Standards Institute last year. Manufacturers of \nelectronic equipment should be encouraged to adopt these new ANSI \nstandards. Consumers have a right to expect that the telephones they \npurchase will operate as expected without excessive levels of \ninterference from legal radio transmissions. Of course, Mr. President, \nthese standards assume legal operation of radio equipment and cannot \nprotect residents from interference from illegal operation of CB \nequipment.\n  This bill also does not address interference caused by other radio \nservices, such as commercial stations or amateur stations. Mr. \nPresident, last year, I introduced S. 2025, a bill with intent similar \nto that of the bill I am introducing today. The American Radio Relay \nLeague [ARRL], an organization representing amateur radio operators, \nfrequently referred to as ``ham'' operators, raised a number of \nconcerns about that legislation. ARRL was concerned that while the bill \nwas intended to cover only illegal use of CB equipment, FCC-licensed \namateur radio operators might inadvertently be targeted and prosecuted \nby local law enforcement. ARRL also expressed concern that local law \nenforcement might not have the technical abilities to distinguish \nbetween ham stations and CB stations and might not be able to determine \nwhat CB equipment was FCC-authorized and what equipment is illegal.\n  Over the past several months, I have worked with the ARRL \nrepresentatives and amateur operators from Wisconsin to address these \nconcerns. As a result of those discussions, the bill I am introducing \ntoday incorporates a number of provisions suggested by the league. \nFirst, my legislation makes clear that the limited enforcement \nauthority provided to localities in no way diminishes or affects FCC's \nexclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of radio. Second, the bill \nclarifies that possession of an FCC license to operate a radio service \nfor the operation at issue, such as an amateur station, is a complete \nprotection against any local law enforcement action authorized by this \nbill. Amateur radio enthusiasts are not only individually licensed by \nFCC, unlike CB operators, but they also self-regulate. The ARRL is very \ninvolved in resolving interference concerns both among their own \nmembers and between ham operators and residents experiencing problems.\n  Third, my legislation also provides for an FCC appeal process by any \nradio operator who is adversely affected by a local law enforcement \naction under this bill. FCC will make determinations as to whether the \nlocality acted properly within the limited jurisdiction this \nlegislation provides. FCC will have the power to reverse the action of \nthe locality if local law enforcement acted improperly. And fourth, my \nlegislation requires FCC to provide States and localities with \ntechnical guidance on how to determine whether a CB operator is acting \nwithin the law.\n  Again, Mr. President, my legislation is narrowly targeted to resolve \npersistent interference with home electronic equipment caused by \nillegal CB operation. Under my bill, localities cannot establish their \nown regulations on CB\n\n[[Page S3354]]\n\nuse. They may only enforce existing FCC regulations on authorized CB \nequipment and frequencies. This bill will not resolve all interference \nproblems and it is not intended to do so. Some interference problems \nneed to continue to be addressed by the FCC, the telecommunications \nmanufacturing industry, and radio service operators. This bill merely \nprovides localities with the tools they need to protect their residents \nwhile preserving FCC's exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the \nregulation of radio services.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that group and \nindividual health insurance coverage and group health plans provide \ncoverage for reconstructive breast surgery if they provide coverage for \nmastectomies; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGERY BENEFITS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Reconstructive \nBreast Surgery Benefits Act of 1997. An identical bill is being \nintroduced by Representative Anna Eshoo in the House of \nRepresentatives. Our purpose in introducing this legislation is to \nimprove the lives of thousands of women who suffer from breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in American women, \naffecting one woman out of every nine. Nearly three million American \nwomen are living with the disease, and 46,000 die from it each year. \nOver 180,000 more women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, \nand nearly half of the women will suffer the loss of one or both \nbreasts in order to survive.\n  Reconstructive surgery or use of a prothesis can help women cope with \nthe consequences of this deadly illness. Every woman deserves the \nopportunity to have these important options available if breast cancer \nstrikes. It is also a distressing fact that some women avoid early \ndetection procedures, for fear that it may result in the loss of a \nbreast if cancer is detected. For these women, breast reconstruction \nsurgery should be available as a part of treatment, since its \navailability can alleviate fears about the disease and encourage life-\nsaving early detection and treatment.\n  Many insurers classify this important medical procedure as cosmetic, \nhowever, and deny coverage for it. In addition, as many as 25 percent \nof women who undergo breast cancer treatments are affected by \nlymphedema, a complication resulting from mastectomy. Many insurers \nalso refuse to cover treatment and management of this condition. This \nlegislation will end these types of discrimination.\n  Currently, 12 States have laws that require coverage for breast \nreconstruction following mastectomy. Nine States require coverage for \nprosthesis. This legislation will extend these protections to all \nwomen.\n  This bill will amend the Public Health Service Act and the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act in order to accomplish the following \nimportant actions:\n  It requires insurers and companies that provide coverage for \nmastectomy to provide coverage for reconstructive breast surgery, \nprosthesis and other treatments which may be necessary as a result of \nsurgical complications, including lymphedema;\n  It prohibits monetary payments or rebates that encourage a woman to \naccept less than the minimum medical protection available; and\n  Finally, it prohibits insurers using penalties or incentives to \nencourage providers to furnish levels of care inconsistent with this \nlegislation.\n  This bill has been endorsed by major national organizations involved \nin the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, including the American \nCancer Society, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National \nWomen's Health Network, and the national medical and nursing groups \nconcerned with this disease.\n  Our goal is to end the cruel and arbitrary practice that unfairly \ndiscriminates against breast cancer patients and their needs. I look \nforward to early action by Congress, and I hope that it will receive \nthe overwhelming bipartisan support it deserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 610.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chemical weapons pose a significant threat to the \n     national security of the United States and are a scourge to \n     humankind.\n       (2) The Chemical Weapons Convention is the best means of \n     ensuring the nonproliferation of chemical weapons and their \n     eventual destruction and forswearing by all nations.\n       (3) The verification procedures contained in the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention and the faithful adherence of nations to \n     them, including the United States, are crucial to the success \n     of the Convention.\n       (4) The declarations and inspections required by the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention are essential for the \n     effectiveness of the verification regime.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATIONS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following declarations:\n       (1) It shall be the policy of the United States to \n     cooperate with other States Parties to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention and to afford the appropriate form of legal \n     assistance to facilitate the implementation of the \n     prohibitions contained in title II of this Act.\n       (2) It shall be the policy of the United States, during the \n     implementation of its obligations under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, to assign the highest priority to ensuring the \n     safety of people and to protecting the environment, and to \n     cooperate as appropriate with other States Parties to the \n     Convention in this regard.\n       (3) It shall be the policy of the United States to \n     minimize, to the greatest extent practicable, the \n     administrative burden and intrusiveness of measures to \n     implement the Chemical Weapons Convention placed on \n     commercial and other private entities, and to take into \n     account the possible competitive impact of regulatory \n     measures on industry, consistent with the obligations of the \n     United States under the Convention.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, \n     the definitions of the terms used in this Act shall be those \n     contained in the Chemical Weapons Convention.

However, nothing \n     in this subsection shall be interpreted as modifying the time \n     frames established in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       (e) Scope.--\n       (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection \n     and subsection (f), an inspection conducted under this title \n     may extend to all things within the premises inspected \n     (including records, files, papers, processes, controls, \n     structures and vehicles) related to whether the requirements \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention applicable to such \n     premises have been complied with.\n       (2) To the extent possible consistent with the obligations \n     of the United States pursuant to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, no inspection under this title shall extend to--\n       (A) financial data;\n       (B) sales and marketing data (other than shipment data);\n       (C) pricing data;\n       (D) personnel data;\n       (E) research data;\n       (F) patent data;\n       (G) data maintained for compliance with environmental or \n     occupational health and safety regulations; or\n       (H) personnel and vehicles entering and personnel and \n     personal passenger vehicles exiting the facility.\n       (f) Facility Agreements.--\n       (1) Inspection of plants, plant sites, or other facilities \n     or locations for which the United States has a facility \n     agreement with the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons shall be conducted in accordance with the \n     facility agreement.\n       (2) Facility agreements shall be concluded for plants, \n     plant sites, or other facilities or locations that are \n     subject to inspection pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article VI \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention unless the owner and the \n     operator, occupant or agent in charge of the facility and the \n     Technical Secretariat agree that such an agreement is not \n     necessary. Facility agreements should be concluded for \n     plants, plant sites, or other facilities or locations that \n     are subject to inspection pursuant to paragraphs 5 or 6 of \n     Article VI of the Chemical Weapons Convention if so requested \n     by the owner and the operator, occupant or agent in charge of \n     the facility.\n       (3) The owner and the operator, occupant or agent in charge \n     of a facility shall be notified prior to the development of \n     the agreement relating to that facility and, if they so\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\n     request, may participate in the preparations for the \n     negotiation of such an agreement. To the extent practicable \n     consistent with the Chemical Weapons Convention, the owner \n     and the operator, occupant or agent in charge of a facility \n     may observe negotiations of the agreement between the United \n     States and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \n     Weapons concerning that facility.\n       (g) Sampling and Safety.--\n       (1) The Department of Commerce is authorized to require the \n     provision of samples to a member of the inspection team of \n     the Technical Secretariat in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The owner or the \n     operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be \n     inspected shall determine whether the sample shall be taken \n     by representatives of the premises or the inspection team or \n     other individuals present.\n       (2) In carrying out their activities, members of the \n     inspection team of the Technical Secretariat and \n     representatives of agencies or departments accompanying the \n     inspection team shall observe safety regulations established \n     at the premises to be inspected, including those for \n     protection of controlled environments within a facility and \n     for personal safety.\n       (h) Coordination.--To the extent possible consistent with \n     the obligations of the United States pursuant to the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention, the representatives of the United States \n     National Authority, the Department of Commerce and any other \n     agency or department, if present, shall assist the owner and \n     the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to \n     be inspected in interacting with the members of the \n     inspection team of the Technical Secretariat.\n\n     SEC. 402.

For all inspections other \n     than those conducted pursuant to paragraphs 4, 5 or 6 of \n     Article VI of the Convention, the term ``Department of \n     Commerce'' shall be replaced by the term ``Lead Agency'' in \n     section 401.\n       (b) Lead Agency.--For the purposes of this title, the term \n     ``Lead Agency'' means the agency or department designated by \n     the President or the designee of the President to exercise \n     the functions and powers set forth in the specific provision, \n     based, inter alia, on the particular responsibilities of the \n     agency or department within the United States Government and \n     the relationship of the agency or department to the premises \n     to be inspected.\n\n     SEC. 403. PROHIBITED ACTS.\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to \n     permit entry or inspection, or to disrupt, delay or otherwise \n     impede an inspection as required by this Act or the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention.\n\n     SEC. 404. PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Civil.--\n       (1) (A) Any person who violates a provision of section 203 \n     of this Act shall be liable to the United States for a civil \n     penalty in an amount not to exceed $50,000 for each such \n     violation.\n       (B) Any person who violates a provision of section 303 of \n     this Act shall be liable to the United States for a civil \n     penalty in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each such \n     violation.\n       (C) Any person who violates a provision of section 403 of \n     this Act shall be liable to the United States for a civil \n     penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each such \n     violation. For purposes of this subsection, each day such a \n     violation of section 403 continues shall constitute a \n     separate violation of section 403.\n       (2)(A) A civil penalty for a violation of section 203, 303 \n     or 403 of this Act shall be assessed by the Lead Agency by an \n     order made on the record after opportunity (provided in \n     accordance with this subparagraph) for a hearing in \n     accordance with section 554 of title 5, United States Code. \n     Before issuing such an order, the Lead Agency shall give \n     written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty \n     under such order of the Lead Agency's proposal to issue such \n     order and provide such person an opportunity to request, \n     within 15 days of the date the notice is received by such \n     person, such a hearing on the order.\n       (B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Lead \n     Agency shall take into account the nature, circumstances, \n     extent and gravity of the violation or violations and, with \n     respect to the violator, ability to pay, effect on ability to \n     continue to do business, any history of prior such \n     violations, the degree of culpability, the existence of an \n     internal compliance program, and such other matters as \n     justice may require.\n       (C) The Lead Agency may compromise, modify or remit, with \n     or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be imposed \n     under this subsection. The amount of such penalty, when \n     finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, \n     may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to \n     the person charged.\n       (3) Any person who requested in accordance with paragraph \n     (2)(A) a hearing respecting the assessment of a civil penalty \n     and who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty \n     may file a petition for judicial review of such order with \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such \n     person resides or transacts business. Such a petition may be \n     filed only within the 30-day period beginning on the date the \n     order making such assessment was issued.\n       (4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil \n     penalty--\n       (A) after the order making the assessment has become a \n     final order and if such person does not file a petition for \n     judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph \n     (3); or\n       (B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (3) \n     has entered a final judgment in favor of the Lead Agency;\n\n     the Attorney General shall recover the amount assessed (plus \n     interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the \n     expiration of the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (3) \n     or the date of such final judgment, as the case may be) in an \n     action brought in any appropriate district court of the \n     United States. In such an action, the validity, amount and \n     appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to \n     review.\n       (b) Criminal.--Any person who knowingly violates any \n     provision of section 203, 303 or 403 of this Act, shall, in \n     addition to or in lieu of any civil penalty which may be \n     imposed under subsection (a) for such violation, be fined \n     under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned for not more \n     than two years, or both.\n\n     SEC. 405. SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Jurisdiction.--The district courts of the United States \n     shall have jurisdiction over civil actions to--\n       (1) restrain any violation of section 203, 303 or 403 of \n     this Act; and\n       (2) compel the taking of any action required by or under \n     this Act or the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       (b) Civil Actions.--A civil action described in subsection \n     (a) may be brought--\n       (1) in the case of a civil action described in subsection \n     (a)(1), in the United States district court for the judicial \n     district wherein any act, omission, or transaction \n     constituting a violation of section 203, 303 or 403 of this \n     Act occurred or wherein the defendant is found or transacts \n     business; or\n       (2) in the case of a civil action described in subsection \n     (a)(2), in the United States district court for the judicial \n     district wherein the defendant is found or transacts \n     business. In any such civil action process may be served on a \n     defendant wherever the defendant may reside or may be found, \n     whether the defendant resides or may be found within the \n     United States or elsewhere.\n\n     SEC. 406. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\n       (a) Warrants.--\n       (1) The Lead Agency shall seek the consent of the owner or \n     the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to \n     be inspected prior to the initiation of any inspection. \n     Before or after seeking such consent, the Lead Agency may \n     seek a search warrant from any official authorized to issue \n     search warrants. Proceedings regarding the issuance of a \n     search warrant shall be conducted ex parte, unless otherwise \n     requested by the Lead Agency. The Lead Agency shall provide \n     to the official authorized to issue search warrants all \n     appropriate information supplied by the Technical Secretariat \n     to the United States National Authority regarding the basis \n     for the selection of the plant site, plant, or other facility \n     or location for the type of inspection sought, including, for \n     challenge inspections pursuant to Article IX of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention, appropriate evidence or reasons provided \n     by the requesting State Party to the Convention with regard \n     to its concerns about compliance with the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention at the facility or location. The Lead Agency shall \n     also provide any other appropriate information available to \n     it relating to the reasonableness of the selection of the \n     plant, plant site, or other facility or location for the \n     inspection.\n       (2) The official authorized to issue search warrants shall \n     promptly issue a warrant authorizing the requested inspection \n     upon an affidavit submitted by the Lead Agency showing that--\n       (A) the Chemical Weapons Convention is in force for the \n     United States;\n       (B) the plant site, plant, or other facility or location \n     sought to be inspected is subject to the specific type of \n     inspection requested under the Chemical Weapons Convention;\n       (C) the procedures established under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention and this Act for initiating an inspection have \n     been complied with; and\n       (D) the Lead Agency will ensure that the inspection is \n     conducted in a reasonable manner and will not exceed the \n     scope or duration set forth in or authorized by the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention or this Act.\n       (3) The warrant shall specify the type of inspection \n     authorized; the purpose of the inspection; the type of plant \n     site, plant, or other facility or location to be inspected; \n     to the extent possible, the items, documents and areas that \n     may be inspected; the earliest commencement and latest \n     concluding dates and times of the inspection; and the \n     identities of the representatives of the Technical \n     Secretariat, if known, and, if applicable, the \n     representatives of agencies or departments.\n       (b) Subpoenas.--In carrying out this Act, the Lead Agency \n     may by subpoena require the attendance and testimony of \n     witnesses and the production of reports, papers, documents, \n     answers to questions and other information that the Lead \n     Agency deems necessary. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees \n     and mileage that are paid witnesses in the\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\n     courts of the United States. In the event of contumacy, \n     failure or refusal of any person to obey any such subpoena, \n     any district court of the United States in which venue is \n     proper shall have jurisdiction to order any such person to \n     comply with such subpoena. Any failure to obey such an order \n     of the court is punishable by the court as a contempt \n     thereof.\n       (c) Injunctions and Other Orders.--No court shall issue an \n     injunction or other order that would limit the ability of the \n     Technical Secretariat to conduct, or the United States \n     National Authority or the Lead Agency to facilitate, \n     inspections as required or authorized by the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n\n     SEC. 407. AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Regulations.--The Lead Agency may issue such \n     regulations as are necessary to implement and enforce this \n     title and the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, \n     and amend or revise them as necessary.\n       (b) Enforcement.--The Lead Agency may designate officers or \n     employees of the agency or department to conduct \n     investigations pursuant to this Act. In conducting such \n     investigations, those officers or employees may, to the \n     extent necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this \n     Act, or for the imposition of any penalty or liability \n     arising under this Act, exercise such authorities as are \n     conferred upon them by other laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 408. SAVING PROVISION.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to enable the United States to \n     comply with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. Accordingly, in addition to the authorities set \n     forth in this Act, the President is authorized to issue such \n     executive orders, directives or regulations as are necessary \n     to fulfill the obligations of the United States under the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, provided such executive orders, \n     directives or regulations do not exceed the requirements \n     specified in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             U.S. Arms Control and\n\n\n                                           Disarmament Agency,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: On behalf of the Administration, I \n     hereby submit for consideration the ``Chemical Weapons \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1997.'' This proposed \n     legislation is identical to the legislation submitted by the \n     Administration in 1995. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) \n     was signed by the United States in Paris on January 13, 1993, \n     and was submitted by President Clinton to the United States \n     Senate on November 23, 1993, for its advice and consent to \n     ratification. The CWC prohibits, inter alia, the use, \n     development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, \n     and direct or indirect transfer of chemical weapons.\n       The President has urged the Senate to provide its advice \n     and consent to ratification as early as possible this year so \n     that the United States will be an original State Party and \n     can continue to lead the fight against these terrible \n     weapons. The CWC will enter into force, with or without the \n     United States, on April 29, 1997. if the United States has \n     not ratified by that time, we will not have a seat on the \n     governing council which will oversee implementation of the \n     Convention and U.S. nationals will not be able to serve as \n     inspectors and in other key positions. Here at home, the U.S. \n     chemical industry could lose hundreds of millions of dollars \n     and many well-paying jobs because of CWC-mandated trade \n     restrictions against non-Parties. As Secretaries Albright and \n     Cohen have recently underscored, ratifying the CWC before it \n     enters into force is in the best interests of the United \n     States.\n       The CWC contains a number of provisions that require \n     implementing legislation to give them effect within the \n     United States. These include: carrying out verification \n     activities, including inspections of U.S. facilities; \n     collecting and protecting the confidentiality of data \n     declarations by U.S. chemical and related companies; and \n     establishing a ``National Authority'' to serve as the liaison \n     between the United States and the international organization \n     established by the CWC.\n       In addition, the CWC requires the United States to prohibit \n     all individuals and legal entities, such as corporations, \n     within the United States, as well as all individuals outside \n     the United States, possessing U.S. citizenship, from engaging \n     in activities that are prohibited under the Convention. As \n     part of this obligation, the CWC requires the United States \n     to enact ``penal'' legislation implementing this prohibition \n     (i.e., legislation that penalizes conduct, either by \n     criminal, administrative, military or other sanctions).\n       Expeditious enactment of implementing legislation is very \n     important to the ability of the United States to fulfill its \n     obligations under the Convention. Enactment will enable the \n     United States to collect the required information from \n     industry, to provide maximum protection for confidential \n     information, and to allow the inspections called for in the \n     Convention. It will also enable the United States to outlaw \n     all activities related to chemical weapons, except CWC \n     permitted activities such as chemical defense programs. This \n     will help fight chemical terrorism by penalizing not just the \n     use, but also the development, production and transfer of \n     chemical weapons. Thus, the enactment of legislation by the \n     United States and other CWC States Parties will make it much \n     easier for law enforcement officials to investigate and \n     punish chemical terrorists early, before chemical weapons are \n     used.\n       As the President indicated in his transmittal letter of the \n     Convention: ``The CWC is in the best interests of the United \n     States. Its provisions will significantly strengthen United \n     States, allied and international security, and enhance global \n     and regional stability.'' Therefore, I urge the Congress to \n     enact the necessary implementing legislation as soon as \n     possible.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal and its \n     enactment is in accord with the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John D. Holum,\n                                                         Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 612. A bill to amend section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to prevent the avoidance of corporate tax on prearranged sales of \ncorporate stock, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             CORPORATE ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Often, the corporation that is to be acquired \nborrows or assumes a large amount of debt incurred prior to the spin-\noff, while the proceeds of such indebtedness are retained by the other \ncorporation.\n  For Federal income tax purposes, the initial distribution generally \nis tax free pursuant to section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code and \nthe subsequent acquisition is tax free pursuant to one of the various \nreorganization provisions described in section 368. Such positions are \nconsistent with the holding in the case of Commissioner v. Mary Archer \nW. Morris Trust, 367 F.2d 794 (4th Cir. 1966) and published IRS \nrulings.\n  Congress did not intend that section 355 apply to insulate these \ntransactions from tax. Section 355 was intended to permit tax free \nrestructurings of several businesses among existing shareholders, with \nlimitations to prevent the bail-out of corporate earnings and profits \nto the shareholders as capital gains. The recent transactions that \nraise concerns have very little to do with individual shareholder tax \nplanning. Rather, they are pre-arranged structures designed to avoid \ncorporate-level gain recognition. In essence, these transactions \nresemble sales.\n  Today's introduced legislation is intended to treat transactions \noccurring after April 16, 1997, the general effective date of the bill, \nas sales at the corporate level.\n  A technical explanation of the legislation is provided below. This \nlegislation affects complex transactions and additional or alternative \nlegislative changes also may be appropriate. For example, it may be \nappropriate to amend or repeal present-law section 355(d), and to treat \ncertain asset acquisitions as stock acquisitions. Written comments on \nthe issues raised by this bill are welcome.\n\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n  Acquisitions of distributing or controlled corporations pursuant to \n                                  plan\n\n  The proposal would adopt additional restrictions under section 355. \nUnder the proposal, if pursuant to a plan or arrangement in existence \non the date of distribution, either the controlled or distributing \ncorporation is acquired, gain would be recognized by the other \ncorporation as of the date of the distribution.\n  Whether a corporation is acquired would be determined under rules \nsimilar to those of present-law section 355(d), except that \nacquisitions would not be restricted to purchase transactions. Thus, an \nacquisition would occur if a person--or persons acting in concert--\nacquired more than 50 percent of the vote or value of the stock of the \ncontrolled or distributing corporation pursuant to a plan or \narrangement. For example, assume a corporation (``P'') distributes the \nstock of its wholly-owned subsidiary (``S'') to its shareholders. If, \npursuant to a plan or arrangement, either P or S is acquired, the \nproposal would apply to require gain recognition by the corporation not \nacquired. It is anticipated that certain asset acquisitions would be \ntreated as stock acquisitions.\n  Acquisitions occurring within the 4-year period beginning 2 years \nbefore the date of distribution would be presumed to have occurred \npursuant to a plan or arrangement. Taxpayers could avoid gain \nrecognition by showing that an acquisition occurring during this 4-year \nperiod was unrelated to the distribution.\n  In the case of an acquisition of the controlled corporation, the \namount of gain recognized by the distributing corporation would be the \namount of gain that the distributing corporation would have recognized \nhad the stock of the controlled corporation been sold for fair market \nvalue on the date of distribution. In the case of an acquisition of the \ndistributing corporation, the amount of gain recognized by the \ncontrolled corporation would be the amount of net gain that the \ndistributing corporation would have recognized had it sold its assets \nfor fair market value immediately after the distribution. This gain \nwould be treated as long-term capital gain. No adjustment to the basis \nof the stock or assets of either corporation would be allowed by reason \nof the recognition of the gain.\n  The proposal would not apply to a distribution pursuant to a title 11 \nor similar case.\n  The Treasury Department would be authorized to prescribe regulations \nas necessary to carry out the purposes of the proposal, including \nregulations to provide for the application of the proposal in the case \nof multiple distributions.\n\n          Treatment of distributions within affiliated groups\n\n  Except as provided in Treasury regulations, section 355 would not \napply to a distribution of stock of one member of an affiliated group \nof corporations filing a consolidated return to another member. In the \ncase of a distribution of stock within an affiliated group, the \nSecretary of the Treasury would be instructed to provide appropriate \nrules for the treatment of the distribution,\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\nincluding rules governing adjustments to the adjusted basis of the \nstock and the earnings and profits of the members of the group.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n  The proposal would be effective for distributions after April 16, \n1997, unless the distribution is: First, made pursuant to a written \nagreement with an acquirer which was (subject to customary conditions) \nbinding on or before such date and at all times thereafter; second, \ndescribed in a ruling request that identifies the acquirer and is \nsubmitted to the IRS on or before such date; third, described in a \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') filing made on or before \nsuch date, to the extent such filing was required to be made on account \nof the distribution and identifies the acquirer; or fourth, described \nin a public announcement that identifies the acquirer on or before such \ndate. The exceptions for written agreements, IRS ruling requests, SEC \nfilings, and public announcements would not apply to distributions of \nstock within a consolidated group of corporations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. FRIST):\n\n  S. 613. A bill to provide that Kentucky may not tax compensation paid \nto a resident of Tennessee for certain services performed at Fort \nCampbell, KY; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 FORT CAMPBELL TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide much-needed tax relief to the residents of my State who are \nemployed as civilians on Fort Campbell, KY. These Clarksville area \nTennesseans are hard working citizens who, I believe, are being taxed \nunfairly by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Fort Campbell is the home of the Army's famous 101st Airborne \nDivision. This installation straddles the border between Tennessee and \nKentucky. In fact, 80 percent of it lies within the State of Tennessee. \nBut because the post office is located on the Kentucky side of the \nbase, it is best known to most people as Fort Campbell, KY.\n  Civilian residents of both Tennessee and Kentucky are employed by the \nFederal Government to perform important nonmilitary functions at Fort \nCampbell. Approximately 2,000 of the Tennesseans who work on post are \nemployed on the Kentucky side in the schools, at the post office, at \nthe post exchange, and on the primary airfield. Unfortunately, these \nTennesseans are forced to pay income tax to the Commonwealth of \nKentucky of up to 6 percent of their wages, in addition to the sales \nand excise taxes they pay to their home State of Tennessee.\n  Because the State of Tennessee does not have an income tax, \nKentuckians employed on the Tennessee side of Fort Campbell do not pay \nincome tax to the State of Tennessee. Nor are Kentuckians required to \npay Tennessee sales tax on Fort Campbell. All of the facilities on the \nTennessee side of Fort Campbell to which Kentuckians have access, the \nKFC and the Taco Bell, for example, are exempt from State sales tax. It \nis only when a Kentucky resident leaves post that he or she becomes \nsubject to Tennessee sales tax on purchases made in the State.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is unfair of Kentucky to impose income \ntax on Tennesseans, because Tennesseans who work on the Kentucky side \nof Fort Campbell do not consume any services provided by the \nCommonwealth. Fort Campbell is a Federal installation. All emergency \nfire, police, and medical services on post are provided by the Federal \nGovernment, not the Commonwealth of Kentucky. All roads on Fort \nCampbell, both on the Kentucky and the Tennessee side, are maintained \nby the Federal Government. Water and sewer services are paid for by the \nFederal Government. If a Tennessean who worked on the Kentucky side of \nFort Campbell were laid off, he or she would not be eligible to \nobtain unemployment benefits from Kentucky, despite the fact that he or \nshe had been paying income tax to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nFinally, Tennesseans have no voice in the Kentucky legislature to \naffect change to this law. Tennesseans are being unfairly taxed without \nthe benefit of representation--a principle anathema to this country. As \nI see it, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is receiving free money from \nresidents of Tennessee who work on a Federal installation that happens \nto border their State.\n\n  And although Kentucky likes to argue that the residents of \nClarksville are not forced to work on the Kentucky side of Fort \nCampbell, employees are often moved on the base where a change of \nbuildings means a change of State. A Tennessean forced to move into a \nFort Campbell job across the border takes an automatic pay cut of up to \n6 percent--just for moving across the street. This situation has been \nthe cause of significant morale problems at Fort Campbell. According to \nKentucky, however, those employees can escape paying the income tax by \nquitting their jobs. I find this alternative an unacceptable one. It is \nfor this reason that I am introducing legislation to prohibit Kentucky \nfrom imposing its income tax on these Tennesseans employed either by \nthe Federal Government or by a contractor with the Federal Government \nat Fort Campbell. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator \nFrist. Congressman Ed Bryant has introduced the similar legislation in \nthe other body.\n  Let me provide some history on this issue. According to legislation \nenacted by Congress in 1940, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is permitted \nto impose its income tax on Federal employees working in the State. \nThis legislation, the Buck Act, repealed a prior law prohibiting States \nfrom imposing income tax on individuals who live or work on Federal \nproperty. However, Congress has also granted exemptions from State \nincome tax to classes of Federal employees based on their obvious \nspecial circumstances: military personnel and Members of Congress and \ntheir employees. In addition, Congress enacted legislation in 1990 to \nexempt Amtrak employees from State taxation in the States in which they \ndo not reside but through which they travel while working. Congress \nintended these exemptions to provide relief from inequitable \nsituations. The Tennesseans employed at Fort Campbell also merit an \nexemption.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that a State has the right to raise \nrevenue in whatever manner its residents believe is most appropriate. \nIn the case of Tennessee, residents have chosen sales and excise taxes \nto fund their cost of government--only one of six States in the United \nStates without an income tax. But it should be noted that Kentucky has \nentered into reciprocal tax agreements with surrounding income tax \nStates to ensure that Kentuckians are treated fairly. Unfortunately, \nKentucky has refused to negotiate any type of reciprocal tax agreement \nwith Tennessee, because it knows it has Tennesseans over a barrel. \nProhibiting the Commonwealth of Kentucky from taxing Tennesseans \nworking on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell is the best way to \nresolve this inequitable situation.\n  During this week in April Americans are reminded of their obligations \nto government. I believe that Americans are willing to pay their fair \nshare of taxes, but citizens should not be expected to pay tax to a \ngovernment from which they receive nothing and in which they have no \nvoice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3349-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3361-S3371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE FORT CAMPBELL TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend, colleague, \nand senior Senator from Tennessee, Fred Thompson, to introduce the Fort \nCampbell Tax Fairness Act of 1997.\n  We are introducing this legislation today to rectify a tax injustice \nimposed on Tennessee residents at Fort Campbell in northwest Tennessee. \nFort Campbell, a 105,000-acre military installation that serves as \nAmerica's premier power projection platform, straddles the border of \nTennessee and Kentucky. Under current law, about 2,000 Tennesseans who \nwork on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell are forced to pay income tax \nto Kentucky--even though they receive no benefits or services from the \nKentucky State government.\n  They cannot send their children to Kentucky public schools. In an \nemergency, these residents cannot use Kentucky fire, ambulance, and \npolice services. Tennesseans who want to attend a Kentucky public \nuniversity must pay out-of-State tuition. Tennesseans who want to hunt \nand fish in Kentucky\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\nmust pay out-of-State rates for licenses. Most importantly, these \nTennesseans who are paying Kentucky income taxes cannot vote in \nKentucky elections. I consider this inherently unfair situation a case \nof ``taxation without representation''--violating a fundamental \nprinciple of our American Revolution.\n  Our bill, like its bipartisan companion in the House introduced by \nRepresentatives Ed Bryant and John Tanner, simply provides that \nKentucky may not tax compensation paid to Tennessee Federal workers and \ncontractors working on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell. I look \nforward to working with Senator Thompson and other members of the \nTennessee delegation to enact this bill into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 614. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nflexibility in the use of unused volume cap for tax-exempt bonds, to \nprovide a $20,000,000 limit on small issue bonds, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      TAX-EXEMPT BONDS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today with Mr. D'Amato to introduce \nlegislation that will improve the use of tax-exempt bonds as a \nfinancing mechanism for small manufacturing facilities and other \nimportant uses.\n  The first thing our bill does is give States more flexibility under \nthe annual $50 per capita or $150 million cap. Under current law, if \nthe State designates bond money for a project and, for whatever reason, \nthat project is not started in 3 years the State cannot put the bond \nmoney toward another project. This bill would allow States to \nreallocate that bond money to another type of project needed elsewhere \nin the State.\n  In addition, the $10 million limit on capital expenditures a company \ncan maintain and still qualify for this industrial bond money would \nincrease to $20 million under our bill. The increase reflects the \neffects of inflation since 1978 when the program was first created and \nalso corrects for future effects of inflation on a company's real \nworth.\n  Finally, our bill would further clean up an omission in the current \nlaw. The 3-year carryover provision does not apply to small \nmanufacturing facilities. In researching current law, it appears that \ndenying carryover to manufacturing facilities is nothing more than an \noversight. The legislation that we are introducing today will correct \nthis error and allow Governors the flexibility to allow tax-exempt \nauthority for manufacturing facilities to be carried over for 3 years \nin the same way as other activities allocated tax-exempt bonds.\n  Tax-exempt bonds are essential for States to finance industrial \ndevelopment projects, ranging from small manufacturing facilities to \npollution control and resource recovery facilities. Our legislation \nwould help States fund industrial development and better allocate their \nscarce tax-exempt bond authority.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 614\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide for continued \neligibility for supplemental security income and food stamps with \nregard to certain classifications of aliens; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             the fairness for legal immigrants act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today Senators Feinstein, D'Amato, \nLieberman, DeWine, Moynihan, and Mikulski and I are introducing \nlegislation to protect legal immigrants who are facing the loss of \ncritical SSI and food stamp benefits later this summer.\n  Now that the welfare bill has become law, the crisis facing many \nlegal immigrants, especially the elderly and disabled, is all too \nevident. For those legal immigrants who face the loss of assistance in \nAugust and September, the outlook is grim.\n  The bill we are introducing focuses on the plight of these legal \nimmigrants. First, our bill grandfathers all legal immigrants who were \nreceiving SSI or food stamp benefits as of August 22, 1996, the date \nthe President signed the welfare bill. Second, our bill grandfathers \nthose refugees who were in the country on August 22, 1996, regardless \nof whether they were receiving benefits.\n  Why this approach? To us, it is a matter of fundamental fairness. \nThat is the principle that underlies our bill. We believe that those \nwho were in this country and playing by the rules should not have the \nrules suddenly changed out from under them. As for refugees, we provide \nthem a slightly broader provision, since unlike other immigrants they \ndo not have sponsors and they come here to flee persecution.\n  This is a matter of great importance to the residents in the States \nrepresented before you today. In my own State, a significant percentage \nof our total population is immigrants, indeed, measured in those terms, \nRhode Island is one of the top immigrant States in the country. Some \n10,000 legal immigrants in my State rely on SSI and food stamp \nbenefits, quite a lot by RI standards.\n  We believe that our approach is a reasonable, commonsense proposal \nthat will appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle and that can be \nenacted this year. By introducing this bipartisan\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\nbill today, we hope to signal to our colleagues the seriousness of our \nconcern and the strength of our resolve. We intend to fight for passage \nof this bill, and we have every expectation of meeting with success.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nmy statement be submitted in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The welfare reform law that passed last year will have an adverse \nimpact on legal immigrants who are elderly and disabled, the most \nvulnerable of our population.\n  That is why I am joining my colleagues, Senators Chafee, Feinstein, \nMoynihan, DeWine, Lieberman and Mikulski in introducing this \nlegislation to protect vulnerable legal immigrants who are facing a \nloss of their supplemental security income [SSI] and food stamp \nbenefits this August.\n  Now that the welfare reform law is being implemented, with nearly \n900,000 SSI recipients nationwide receiving preliminary noncitizen \nstatus notices of the changes in the law, there has emerged a crisis \nfacing legal immigrants who are elderly and disabled.\n  The Social Security Administration has estimated that these welfare \nreform changes may result in 434,000 legal immigrants actually losing \nSSI benefits.\n  Of the 80,000 legal immigrants at risk of losing their SSI benefits \nin New York State, roughly 70,000 are in New York City. New York City \nalso expects that more than 130,000 legal immigrants currently \nreceiving food stamps will lose those benefits by 1998.\n  The bill we are introducing will grandfather those immigrants who \nwere receiving SSI or food stamp benefits as of August 22, 1996, the \ndate of enactment of the Welfare bill. And it will grandfather refugees \nand asylees who were in this country as of August 22, 1996.\n  This bill is about making sure that some of the most vulnerable \npeople, the elderly and the disabled, are not pushed out of the SSI and \nFood Stamp Programs.\n  The people of America recognize that many people who are elderly and \ndisabled are in fact unable at times to take care of themselves without \nassistance through no fault of their own. To turn our back on these \npeople would be cruel and not in keeping with our Nation's tradition of \nsupporting those in need.\n  Refugees who have been granted political asylum also merit that extra \nconsideration that comes from leaving one's own country under duress \nsearching for freedom and a new way of life. They also need a hand up \nand that too is in the great and long tradition of America.\n  This is not a welfare bill, it is a bill of fundamental fairness and \ncompassion. These people came to the United Sates and have been living \nunder our laws for years. It is unfair to change the rules on them \nsuddenly. That is the crux of this bill.\n  This isn't just a matter of statistics and hypothetical situations of \nwhat might happen. There are real people out there, and you can be sure \nthat they are going to get hurt if we do nothing. We are not going to \nlet that happen.\n  We want to work with our colleagues to pass a bill that will not put \nthe elderly and the disabled out on the streets.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, when Congress approved and the \nPresident signed the comprehensive welfare reform legislation last \nyear, it was clear to many that it was not a perfect bill.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues expressed grave concern about a \nnumber of provisions that will have a devastating impact, not only on \nStates and counties in terms of a huge cost shift, but on the lives and \nwell-being of many elderly and disabled people--people who are now \ndependent upon public assistance for their survival.\n  The provision denying supplemental security income [SSI] and food \nstamps to virtually all legal immigrants who are noncitizens, even \nthose who are elderly and disabled, who cannot support themselves, who \nhave no sponsor or other means of support, such as refugees, in my \nview, is one of the most egregious flaws in that bill, and one of the \nmain reasons why I voted against its passage.\n  Today, Senator Chafee and I, along with Senators D'Amato, Moynihan, \nDeWine, Lieberman, and Mikulski are offering legislation to correct \nthis flaw.\n  The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1997 would grandfather in \nfrom the ban on SSI and food stamps: those elderly and disabled legal \npermanent residents who were receiving SSI and food stamps on or before \nAugust 22, 1996 and, those refugees who were in the country as of \nAugust 22, 1996.\n  This legislation prohibits SSI and food stamps for legal permanent \nresidents who are not refugees and who were not receiving SSI and food \nstamps as of August 22, 1996.\n  This legislation also prohibits SSI and food stamps for all legal \npermanent residents and refugees coming to this country following the \ndate of enactment of the Welfare Reform Bill, August 22, 1996.\n  Mr. President, to not correct this flaw in the bill represents an \nenormous unfunded mandate to States and counties by simply shifting the \ncost of caring for the seriously ill, disabled, and elderly legal \nimmigrants who are destitute and have no other way to survive.\n  As I speak, SSA is sending out 125,000 SSI ban notices per week, to \n800,000 legal immigrants who are on SSI nationwide. SSA estimates that \nmore than 62.5 percent or 500,000 people currently receiving SSI \nbenefits nationwide will lose their benefits under the current law--\nmore than 40 percent, 205,000 of them in California. Many of these \nelderly and disabled legal immigrants have no family or friends to turn \nto for support and will become completely destitute. Their only \nrecourse will be county general assistance programs or, at worst, \nhomeless shelters.\n  Let me give you an example from my home State:\n  My staff met with a 73-year-old legal immigrant on SSI. She was \nwelcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee from \ncommunism with no family in the United States. She speaks no English \nand she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis three \ntimes a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will lose SSI, \nher only source of support. Her well-being will become the \nresponsibility of the county.\n\n  I am the first to acknowledge that prior to welfare reform, there was \nabuse of the SSI program in this country. Elderly noncitizens could \ncollect SSI, even if they lived with their children, as long as they \nclaimed to be financially independent from the children.\n  And the number of noncitizens receiving SSI has skyrocketed at a \ndisproportionate rate to that of citizens. The number of noncitizens \ncollecting SSI increased 477 percent in 14 years, from 1980 to 1994, \nwhile the number of U.S. citizens receiving SSI increased 33 percent \nduring that same period.\n  Although I strongly support efforts to hold sponsors accountable for \nthe support of legal immigrants they bring into the country, the \nwelfare reform bill passed by Congress simply went too far. It banned \nSSI and food stamps for virtually all legal immigrants, even those \nwhose sponsors cannot afford to support them, or who have no sponsors \nat all.\n  The current welfare reform bill will not just eliminate fraudulent \ncases from the SSI rolls. It will eliminate truly needy people like the \n73-year-old elderly refugee. Surely, it was not the intent of this \nCongress to leave elderly, disabled, and destitute people with nowhere \nto go to except county relief or the streets.\n  If we do not revise the welfare ban for legal immigrants the \nfinancial costs to States and counties will be enormous, and the human \ntoll even greater:\n  Los Angeles County estimates that 93,000 legal immigrants in its \ncounty will lose SSI benefits at a cost of up to $236 million a year \nto the county.\n\n  San Francisco estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the \ncounty's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 \nmillion annually.\n  I believe this body must finish what it started last year. In this \ntime of budgetary constraints where tough choices have to be made, we \nmust act with prudence and compassion toward those who truly have no \none to turn to, while at the same time preserving portions of the \nsavings needed to balance the budget and enact meaningful reform.\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the SSA table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    NUMBERS OF SSI RECIPIENTS RECEIVING PRELIMINARY NONCITIZEN

A bill to amend titles 23 and 49, United States Code, to \nimprove the designation of metropolitan planning organizations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the metropolitan planning organizations reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill reform the relationship between central cities and their outlying \nareas in terms of distribution of highway funds. This issue was brought \nto my attention by one county in my State and they were quickly joined \nby several others who feel they have been treated unfairly in their \nMPO.\n  The current law governing MPO's is the 1991 Intermodal Service \nTransportation and Efficiency Act. This legislation established the \nplanning powers of MPO's and also set standards for membership and \nqualifications for leaving MPO's. A number of counties in my State have \nindicated they are unhappy in their particular MPO and would like to \nleave. However, current law prohibits this.\n  One case in particular that has been brought to my attention is \nDouglas County's experience since 1991. Douglas County is directly \nsouth of Denver and is the fastest growing county in the Nation. \nFurthermore, they are a linkage county connecting Denver and Colorado \nSprings, which makes Douglas County's transportation needs tremendous. \nTo meet these needs they have attempted to work with their MPO to \nreceive an equitable share of funds. Douglas County has demonstrated \nthat these attempts have failed, while they are 5.27 percent of their \nMPO, over the years their funding has been .35 percent for the fiscal \nyear 1993-1995 cycle, 1.2 percent for the fiscal year 1995-1997 cycle, \nand .4 percent of the fiscal year 1997-1999 cycle. Clearly, there is a \nproblem with how these funds are being distributed.\n  This issue cannot be dismissed as a one county problem either. In the \nDenver regional county of governments MPO [DRCOG], with the exception \nof Denver County, I have received letters from every county supporting \nthe legislation I am introducing today.\n  This legislation would lower the barrier for disaffected parties that \nwould like to create their own MPO or join an adjacent MPO. This \nlegislation eliminates the 75 percent of the effected population \nthreshold to leave necessary in current law, and lowers that to 50 \npercent. Furthermore, it would eliminate the central city veto \nauthority.\n  This legislation will have no effect on those who are content with \ntheir MPO. Nor will this legislation have any impact on central cities \nthat have worked with their MPO members equitably. It will only impact \nthose areas where counties are being held in a relationship they feel \nis unfair. It's my hope that in future deliberations on transportation \nmatters we can address and resolve this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Burns, \n        and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 617. A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act to require \nthat imported meat, and meat food products containing imported meat, \nbear a label identifying the country of origin; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  the imported meat label act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation that would require that imported meat and meat food \nproducts containing imported meat be labeled for country of origin so \nthat consumers can make the choice to buy meat produced from livestock \nraised on American ranches and farms. This act would require that these \nproducts be labeled for country of origin prior to their sale at the \nretail level in the United States.\n  Senator Craig, Senator Daschle, Senator Burns, and Senator Baucus \njoin me today in introducing this needed policy change. I welcome and \napplaud their support. I would also point out to my colleagues the \nsupport this legislation has received from the National Farmers Union, \nthe American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, and the American Sheep Industry. From my State, this \nlegislation is supported by the South Dakota Farmers Union, South \nDakota Farm Bureau, South Dakota Livestock Auction Markets Association, \nand the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association. I hope that other \nSenators join us in support of this measure and help us to quickly pass \nthis bill.\n  America's livestock producers are proud of their record of producing \nquality meat and meat food products from American raised livestock. \nWhile labeling products from other industries for country of origin is \ncommonplace, imported meat and meat food products containing imported \nmeat are often not labeled at all. With the passage of the Canadian \nFree-Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and GATT, we are moving toward more \nimported meat. Exports of American meat are high quality, value added \nitems that American exporters are proud to advertise as American \nproduced. On the other hand, meat imports into the United States tend \nto be of lower quality and importers generally do not advertise the \ncountry of origin.\n  American consumers deserve to know the source of their meat and meat \nfood products. The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing \nwill allow America's consumers to know the source of their meat and \nmeat food products. Considering that food safety and the wisdom of \nproduction systems in other countries are concerns that consumers \nconsistently have, this legislation allows the competitive free market \nto determine the prices and demand for imported meat and meat food \nproducts.\n  Finally, American taxpayers have invested heavily in our food safety \nsystem--and it is undoubtedly the safest in the world. It just makes \ngood sense for these same taxpayers and consumers to know the origin of \nthe meat they buy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the complete text of \nthe legislation printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Imported Meat Labeling Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING OF IMPORTED MEAT AND MEAT \n                   FOOD PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Labeling Required.--Section 1(n) of the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(13)(A) If it is imported into the United States unless \n     it bears or is accompanied by labeling that identifies the \n     country of origin of the animal that is the source of the \n     imported carcass, part thereof, or meat or is part of the \n     contents of the imported meat food product.\n       ``(B) If it originates from an animal that was imported \n     into the United States less than 10 days prior to slaughter \n     unless it bears or is accompanied by labeling that identifies \n     the country of origin of the animal.\n       ``(C) If it is a meat food product prepared in the United \n     States using any carcass, part thereof, or meat imported into \n     the United States unless the meat food product bears or is \n     accompanied by labeling that identifies the country of origin \n     of the animal that is the source of the imported carcass, \n     part thereof, or meat.\n       ``(D) In this paragraph, the term `country of origin' means \n     the country or countries in which an animal is raised before \n     slaughter.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1(n) of the Federal \n     Meat Inspection Act is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``if'' at the beginning of each of \n     paragraphs (1) through (12) and inserting ``If'';\n       (2) by striking the semicolon at the end of each of \n     paragraphs (1) through (10) and inserting a period, and\n       (3) in paragraph (11), by striking ``; or'' at the end and \n     inserting a period.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nSouth Dakota today as an original cosponsor of the Imported Meat \nLabeling Act of 1997. This act would require the labeling of imported \nmeat and meat products prior to their sale at a retail level in the \nUnited States.\n  For the record, I want my colleagues to know that this type of action \nis legal under the terms of our GATT Agreement. In addition, a number \nof groups have policy that support this type of measure including the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the \nAmerican Sheep Industry.\n  Again, I commend Senator Johnson for introducing the Imported Meat \nLabeling Act of 1997 and Senator Burns from Montana for his additional \nefforts on this topic. I hope that other Senators will join us in \nsupport of this measure. I would pledge my support of addressing any \nlegitimate concerns that this legislation might raise and ask in return \nthat we seek quick resolution and passage of this bill.\n  One legitimate concern with this legislation is the treatment of \nCanadian cattle that are slaughtered in the United States. Concern \nalong the northern tier States that border Canada is high among all \nareas of Canadian trade. Producers in these States might ask how cattle \nthat are born in Canada, fed in Canada, but shipped to the United \nStates for slaughter would be labeled. Realistically, these animals are \nCanadian and the beef produced from them should be labeled as such. \nHowever, if the legal interpretation is different, I state my \nwillingness for the record to amend this legislation and address this \ntype of concern.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor a bill being \nintroduced by myself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Johnson on an issue of great \nimportance to my State and the agricultural industry in Montana. The \nissue is that of labeling meat coming into America from other \ncountries.\n  We are offering today language, which will require all meat products \nthat come from a foreign country to be labeled with the country of \norigin of that meat. This will allow all Americans to know and \nunderstand where the meat they are purchasing really comes from. This \nbill will protect the consumer as well as an industry which has had to \nface severe competition from foreign countries in recent years.\n  Today when shopping at the local grocery market, the American \nconsumer is buying meat products without all the information they need \nto make an informed decision on the product they are purchasing. Our \nconsumers go to the market and purchase meat products with no idea of \nwhere the meat they are buying comes from. Recent events in foreign \ncountries have made this issue important to the retail consumer. \nOutbreak of disease and problems with the quality of foreign products \nmakes it necessary that we provide our consumers with all the \ninformation they should have when making an informed decision about the \nfood they are buying.\n  If we look at the vast majority of products that are imported into \nour country, we find that they are labeled with the country in which \nthat product was produced. We have consumers that for numerous years \nhave established a custom of purchasing only products with a Made in \nAmerica label. It only seems right that we provide these same consumers \nwith the information that will allow them to make the same intelligent \ndecision when shopping for the food that they consume.\n  Our consumers today go to the market and buy meat products under the \nassumption that if it carries a USDA inspection and graded label that \nthe meat they are purchasing comes from the United States. This, we \nhave recently found out, can be far from the truth. Just carrying that \nlabel does nothing to inform the consumer that the hamburger they are \npurchasing is from this country.\n  As I stated earlier, recent outbreaks of disease in foreign countries \nhas haunted our American meat producers. The public fears that the beef \nthey are buying could be from a European country with a disease that \nhas killed their citizens. Out breaks in meat and vegetable products \nleads Americans to fear the purchase of American meat and vegetables \nbecause they are under the assumption that the product is American in \norigin. This is not always the case. The recent outbreak of hepatitis \nfound in strawberries is proof.\n  American agriculture provides the American consumer with the safest \nmost reliable source of food and fiber in the world. With this in mind \nwe then should be informing the American consumer that they really are \npurchasing American product or if they so chose product raised in a \nforeign country.\n  I am proud and very pleased to add my name to this bill and I look \nforward to moving this through the legislative process so we can give \nour consumers the information on meat that we have provided to them on \nother numerous consumer goods.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 618. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nassist in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the chesapeake bay restoration act of 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 619. A bill to establish a Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails \nNetwork, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n        the chesapeake bay gateways and watertrails act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing--along with a \nnumber of my colleagues--two measures to continue and enhance efforts \nto restore the Chesapeake Bay. Joining me in sponsoring one or both of \nthese measures are my colleagues from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and \nMaryland, Senators Warner, Santorum, Robb, and Mikulski.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is one of the world's great natural resources. It \nis a world-class fishery that still produces a significant portion of \nthe fin fish and shellfish catch in the United States.\n  It provides vital habitat for living resources, including more than \n2,700 plant and animal species. It is a major resting area for \nmigratory birds and waterfowl along the Atlantic flyway, including many \nendangered and threatened species.\n  As our Nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay is also key to \nthe ecological and economic health of the mid-Atlantic region. The bay \nis a treasured asset for all our citizens, particularly for the nearly \n15 million of us who live within the six State watershed. It is a one-\nof-a-kind recreational asset enjoyed by 9 million people, including \nmany Members of this body.\n  The bay is also a major commercial waterway and shipping center for \nthe\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nregion and much of the eastern United States. And it provides thousands \nof jobs for the people in this region. Certainly, we in Maryland regard \nthe bay as a defining element in our State's history, and as a key to \nMaryland's quality of life.\n  Most people are aware of these and other dimensions of the bay. \nCertainly, our Nation's scientists are aware, and have consistently \nregarded the bay's protection and enhancement as an extremely important \nnational objective.\n  When the bay began to experience serious unprecedented declines in \nwater quality and living resources in recent decades, people in the \nregion, including those in my State, suffered as well. We lost \nthousands of jobs in the fishing industry and much of the wilderness \nthat defined the watershed.\n  We began to appreciate for the first time the profound impact that \nhuman activity could have on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Untreated \nsewage, deforestation, toxic chemicals, farm runoff, and increased \ndevelopment resulted in a degradation of water quality and destruction \nof wildlife and its habitat.\n  Fortunately, over the last two decades we have also come to \nunderstand that humans can have a positive influence on the \nenvironment, and that we can, if we choose, assist nature to repair \nmuch of the damage which has been done.\n  We now treat sewage before it enters our waters, and even have a \nsuccessful waste treatment pilot project here in Washington that \nutilizes state-of-the-art biological methods to significantly reduce \nnutrients entering the bay.\n  We banned toxic chemicals that were killing the wildlife, initiated \nprograms to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the bay's tributaries, \nand we have taken aggressive steps to successfully restore the striped \nbass and other species.\n  We have undertaken the Nation's largest habitat restoration project \non Poplar Island in the upper bay, and enacted legislation protecting \nthe estuary from economically and ecologically harmful aquatic nuisance \nspecies.\n  The States of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania deserve much of \nthe credit for undertaking many of the actions that have put the bay \nand its watershed on the road to recovery.\n  All three States have had major cleanup programs and have made \nsignificant commitments in terms of resources. The cleanup has remained \nan important priority item supported by Governors, State legislatures \nand the public. And a number of private organizations--the Chesapeake \nBay Foundation and Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay come to mind--have \ndone stellar work in this area.\n  But the Federal Government has played a critical catalyzing role in \nhelping to bring about these successes. Without the Federal Clean Water \nAct, the Federal ban on DDT, and EPA's watershed-wide coordination of \nbay restoration and cleanup activities, we would not have been able to \nbring about the concerted effort, the real partnership, that is \nsucceeding in improving bay water quality and in bringing back many \nfish and wildlife species that were on the verge of extinction.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is getting cleaner, but we cannot affort to be \ncomplacent. Ever increasing population and commercial stresses are \nimposed upon the bay. So we must not relax if we hope to maintain, and \nbuild upon, our past successes.\n  The first measure I am introducing today is designed to build upon \nour National Government's past role in the Chesapeake Bay Program, the \nhighly successful Federal-State-local partnership to which I made \nreference, that so ably coordinates and directs efforts to restore the \nbay.\n  This legislation carries forward and enhances the role of \nthe Environmetnal Protection Agency as the lead Federal agency \ncommitted to cleaning up the bay. It redoubles efforts to ensure wide \ncompliance with Chesapeake Bay agreement goals, including habitat \nrestoration and toxics reduction.\n\n  And it establishes a mechanism for EPA to further assist communities \nwith local watershed restoration and protection projects in the bay and \nits tributaries. This is an especially important component of this \nmeasure. Let me spend a moment to explain why.\n  The initial stages of the bay cleanup focused on the mainstem bay. \nBut it became increasingly clear that many of the bay's problems \noriginate in the rivers and streams which flow into the bay. It also \nbecame obvious that we must expand efforts within these waters if we \nhope to achieve nutrient reductions and other improvements in the \noverall bay watershed.\n  The bay partners recognized this urgent need with 1992 and subsequent \namendments to the Chesapeake Bay agreement that committed the bay \npartners to develop and implement tributary-specific strategies \nthroughout the watershed, and the States are making tremendous progress \nin this regard.\n  It is clear that one of the most cost-effective ways to protect the \nrivers and streams in the watershed is to help, encourage and promote \nstewardship among citizens and others who have a direct stake in a \nspecific local situation. After all, stewardship starts with the \nindividual citizens who live in the watershed. And that is what this \nmeasure encourages by providing EPA with mechanisms to stimulate such \nlocal efforts.\n  The second measure I am introducing today would connect natural, \nhistoric, cultural, and recreational resources to create an innovative \nChesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network throughout the mainstem \nbay and its tributaries.\n  The vast bay watershed contains many distinctive treasures that \ncombine to tell a unique story about the evolvement of human settlement \nand culture within the area. Each region within the watershed is dotted \nwith historic seaports, Federal and State parks, and other natural, \ncultural, or recreational sites.\n  Many residents of the bay are familiar with the rich resources within \ntheir particular region. Similarly, countless visitors to a particular \nsegment of the watershed are exposed to selective sites, but receive \nonly a limited if any introduction to similar resources throughout the \nentire bay. They learn little about the bay's collective cultural and \nnatural history, and perhaps little about comprehensive bay cleanup \nefforts.\n  What we currently lack--and what this measure provides--is a \nmechanism that links these many valuable resources and sites throughout \nthe watershed into a unified network of jewels of the Chesapeake.\n\n  This shared linkage and identity can improve access to the bay. It \ncan further educate residents and visitors about this treasured \nresource.\n  It can boost the already substantial economic activity generated by \ntourism and recreation within the watershed, and it can entice \nadditional residents within the watershed to play more active roles in \nthe bay restoration effort.\n  This measure would accomplish these worthy goals in several ways. \nFirst, it authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nidentify and protect resources throughout the watershed, to identify \nthese individual jewels as Chesapeake Bay gateways, and to link them \nwith trails, tour roads, scenic byways and other sites.\n  Second, it directs the Secretary to develop and establish Chesapeake \nBay Watertrails, consisting of important water routes, and connects \nthese watertrails with gateways sites and other land resources to \ncreate a Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. This network \nwill guide residents and visitors alike along important water routes \nand the many land based resources within the watershed.\n  Third, this legislation authorizes the Secretary to provide technical \nand financial assistance to State and local partners for conserving and \nrestoring these important resources throughout the watershed.\n  The Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort, and Federal-State efforts to \nprotect related resources and to promote economic activity, have been \nmajor bipartisan undertakings in this body. The bay has been strongly \nsupported by virtually all Members of the Senate, as evidenced by \nenactment of three of the five related measures introduced last \nsession. I urge my colleagues to continue the momentum by supporting \nthis legislation and contributing to the improvement and enhancement of \none of our Nation's most valuable and treasured natural resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chesapeake Bay \nRestoration Act of 1997 and the Chesapeake\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\nBay Gateways and Watertrails Act of 1997 be printed in the Record. I \nalso ask unanimous consent that copies of letters from the Governor, \nState of Maryland, from the Chesapeake Bay Commission, from the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation and from the Chesapeake Bay Local Government \nAdvisory Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 618\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Paul: Congratulations on the introduction of the \n     Chesapeake Bay Restoration Act of 1997. Passage of this \n     legislation will enable the State of Maryland to build on the \n     progress that has been achieved in cleaning up the Bay by \n     strengthening and expanding the federal Chesapeake Bay \n     Program.\n       Your bill provides a much-needed increased focus on \n     watershed planning and management. This effort skillfully \n     complements the Tributary Strategy effort to reduce nutrient \n     loadings into the Bay. The additional federal resources will \n     also greatly increase the effectiveness of our joint effort \n     to protect and restore the Bay.\n       The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. Your \n     longstanding determined commitment to its protection and \n     restoration has been key to the improvements in the water \n     quality and living resources of the Bay. I stand ready to \n     help you secure passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Paris N. Glendening,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, March 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing, in my capacity as \n     Chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, to commend you for \n     taking the initiative to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay \n     Program through the introduction of the Chesapeake Bay \n     Restoration Act of 1997.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\n     The Commission strongly supports the legislation. We commit \n     to you our resources and expertise in working to secure its \n     passage.\n       We believe that the cooperation of government at the \n     federal, state and local level is, and will continue to be, \n     essential to protecting and restoring the Bay. Your bill \n     helps to establish the blueprint for that cooperation. It \n     provides new opportunities on habitat restoration through the \n     creation of low-cost restoration and enhancement \n     demonstration projects. These projects are key to protecting \n     the living resources of the Bay, the main goal of the \n     Chesapeake Bay Agreement.\n       As a signatory to the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement, the \n     Commission is committed to the reduction of nutrient and \n     toxic loads entering the Chesapeake Bay. To do this, we have \n     developed a river-specific approach to the implementation of \n     pollution control strategies. The tributary strategy \n     provisions of the legislation will support this effort and \n     ensure that these strategies are implemented, basinwide.\n       The Chesapeake Bay watershed will face increasing \n     environmental threats in the years ahead. The population of \n     the watershed is growing. Development of our natural resource \n     lands is commonplace. The burdens placed on our pollution \n     control infrastructure are constantly expanding. The \n     Commission has long recognized that coordinated, locally-\n     based programs can help to counter these pressures.\n       For this reason, we are particularly supportive of the \n     small watershed grants component of your bill. We believe \n     that it will enhance efforts made by non-governmental \n     organizations, local governments and private individuals to \n     implement water quality and habitat protection programs at \n     the local level. The small watershed grants program is also \n     directly complementary to the Local Government Participation \n     Action Plan, developed by the Chesapeake Bay Program in 1996, \n     to better involve local governments in Bay restoration \n     activities.\n       In our watershed, there are many examples of small \n     watershed projects that would benefit from a cost-share grant \n     program. In Maryland, residents and local government \n     officials in Worcester and Somerset Counties have committed \n     to improve the local economy through well-planned \n     conservation and the promotion of natural, historic and \n     cultural resources. In Pennsylvania, the Lackawanna River \n     Corridor Association has been working to improve water \n     quality by addressing acid mine drainage, combined sewer \n     overflows and urban stormwater flow problems by developing \n     public-private partnerships that leverage resources and \n     expertise. And in my own home state of Virginia, private \n     organizations have joined forces with local, state and \n     federal government officials in the Chesconessex Creek \n     Watershed to establish a project to restore vital habitat and \n     living resources on Virginia's Eastern Shore.\n       In closing, I want to thank you, and Charles Stek and Kevin \n     Miller of your office, for consulting extensively with our \n     staff, and with the many sectors of the Bay community during \n     the drafting of your legislation. The final product reflects \n     a strong cooperative relationship with the Chesapeake Bay \n     Program and will allow us to build on the progress that we \n     have already made.\n       I look forward to working with you. We hope that this \n     legislation can be moved forward as quickly as possible, and \n     we offer our assistance with the hope that it will be enacted \n     before this Congress comes to a close. I am,\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            W. Tayloe Murphy, Jr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Foundation,\n\n                                     Annapolis, MD, April 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to express the \n     Chesapeake Bay Foundation's support for the Chesapeake Bay \n     Restoration Act of 1997. Although I realize that no single \n     piece of legislation can save the Chesapeake Bay, I believe \n     this bill will help push the Bay Program towards an increased \n     effort to carrying out the commitments made by the \n     signatories.\n       I am particularly glad to see the section enhancing the \n     oversight responsibilities of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency. CBF has long felt that it is important for the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to take a stronger leadership \n     role in assuring that the participants are held accountable \n     for their commitments.\n       I am also enthusiastic about the provisions providing for a \n     small watershed grant program. Restoration of the Bay's \n     essential habitat--its forests, wetlands, and grass beds--is \n     a critical component of the effort to save the Bay, and this \n     legislation should help move that effort forward.\n       In summary, this legislation provides a step forward for \n     the Bay Program, and will help steer it in the right \n     direction. I would like to thank you and your cosponsors for \n     your efforts on behalf of this legislation and on behalf of \n     the Chesapeake Bay.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 William C. Baker,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Chesapeake Bay Local\n\n\n                                Government Advisory Committee,\n\n                                        Easton, MD, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Senator Paul Sarbanes,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the Maryland Delegation \n     of the Chesapeake Bay Local Government Advisory Committee \n     (LGAC), I would like to offer support for the Bill to amend \n     section 117 of the Clean Water Act which specifies a \n     financial commitment by the Federal Government to the \n     Chesapeake Bay protection effort.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ngreater equity in savings opportunities for families with children, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the women's investment and savings equity act\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important and unique \nlegislation known as the Women's Investment and Savings Equity Act, or \nthe WISE bill.\n  As chairman of the Republican Task Force on Retirement Security, I \nhave worked with other task force members to explore various ways that \nthe Federal Government might better facilitate adequate savings for \nretirement. I am extremely pleased that Majority Leader Lott convened \nthis task force, and asked me to lead it, because the problem of \nensuring adequate retirement savings has been one in which I have \nbecome increasingly engaged. I am extremely pleased to have had the \nassistance and cooperation of all of the other Senators in the task \nforce.\n  We are currently in the process of drafting a comprehensive package \nof legislation designed to increase retirement saving through a diverse \nvariety of means. However, one of these legislative initiatives, the \nWISE bill, has struck us as being so important that it warrants \nseparate introduction and action. I am very proud of this legislation, \nand I am gratified to see the rapid growth in support for it.\n  One thing has become ever more clear in the course of our work: this \nNation must increase retirement saving--at every level--in order to \nmeet retirement needs in the 21st century.\n  The problem for women is particularly severe. They live longer than \nmen, and they have less saving. As a result, they are almost twice as \nlikely as men to spend their retirement years in poverty.\n  If you wan to see a demonstration of why it is important that we \npermit greater saving by women in their own name, all that you must do \nis to review the poverty rates for widows and divorcees. Overall, \nelderly women have a poverty rate of 15.7 percent. For men, the level \nis 8.9 percent. Divorcees suffer poverty rates of 29.1 percent, widows \n21.5 percent. For too many women, it is the case that they enter their \nelderly years, after devoting much of their lives to raising a family, \nonly to find themselves alone and without sufficient means of financial \nsupport. That is not right.\n  Current law has an unequal impact on women because they are more \nlikely to interrupt their periods of paid employment in order to raise \nchildren. When they finally do return to the work force, and when they \nfinally may have surplus money for saving, the law places tight limits \non what they can contribute towards their own retirement.\n  We shouldn't force women to choose between attentive parenting and \nsaving for retirement. Women shouldn't be more likely to enter poverty \nin retirement simply because they have taken time out from work to \nraise a child.\n  Our legislation would do three things:\n  First, it would strengthen the homemaker IRA law. We would permit \nhomemakers--and other workers without a pension--to make deductible \ncontributions to IRA, regardless of whether their spouse participates \nin a pension plan.\n  This is good for saving. It is also good for women; we shouldn't \ndeprive homemakers of the opportunity to save on the basis of their \nspouse's participation in a pension plan. This is an idea that already \nhas broad bipartisan support.\n  Second, we would permit catch-up contributions to 401(k) retirement \nplans--and other types of elective deferral plans--for parents who miss \ntime from work for maternity or paternity leave.\n\n  Under current law, if an individual goes on unpaid leave from work \nfor service in the National Guard or certain other military service, \nthey may make ``catch-up'' contributions to their 401-(k) or similar \nretirement plans for the time that they missed.\n  We would make similar ``catch-up'' contributions available to cover \nthe employee portion of contributions that would have been made by \nparents had they not gone on parental leave. This is good savings \npolicy, and good family policy.\n  Third, and this is the most creative aspect of the legislation: We \nwould create higher contribution limits--in ``catch-up years''--for \nparents who have returned to work after a long period of \nnonparticipation in a pension plan.\n  Consider a too-familiar story: A woman spends 15 years working at \nhome, raising a family. Or--and let me stress that our provision \napplies in this case, too--maybe she works part-time, but she cannot \ncontribute to a pension plan because she needs that money for day care. \nEither way, she spends a large amount of her life, unable to contribute \nto a pension plan.\n  If she returns to the workforce at age 45 or 50, and her children are \n``out of the nest,'' perhaps only then does she have surplus money to \nput into retirement savings. But current law is inflexible; she can't \n``catch-up'' for the lost years. She is limited by a short number of \nworking years, and tight annual limits on what she can contribute.\n  Our legislation would simply do the following: For every year that \nyou are unable to participate in a pension plan, and during which you \nare caring for a dependent child, you may take that number of ``catch-\nup'' years when you return to plan participation.\n  During that catch-up year, you can make your normal allowed \ncontribution to a 401-(k) or similar plan, and you can make an \nadditional contribution of equal size to ``catch-up'' for a missed \nyear. You can do this for up to 18 years.\n  Working people have been telling us that they need some flexibility \nin being allowed to ``catch-up'' for missed opportunities to save. Not \neveryone has the money to save when they are 25. The problem is most \nsevere for parents--for mothers. The least we can do is to make the law \nflexible enough to permit additional retirement contributions when they \ncan afford it.\n  These issues are not abstractions. For too many women, this is how \nlife works. Maybe they suddenly become widows, or they go through a \ndivorce. And they have forever lost their opportunity to generate \nsaving in their own name. We see the results in the comparatively large \nnumber of women in poverty.\n  This legislation would build additional flexibility into the law so \nthat women--and all parents--are not penalized for making the choice to \nraise a child.\n  Current law assumes that you have the same opportunity to save in \nevery year of your life. That is just not so. Families with children \noften find it very difficult to save money, and this legislation would \ngive them a chance to catch up when they reach a point where they at \nlast can save.\n  I believe this legislation is worthy of favorable consideration by \nthe Senate. I also believe that prospects are good that we can pass at \nleast a version of it. The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nRoth, has contributed his valuable support, as has the chairman of the \nLabor Committee, Senator\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\nJeffords. With the support of the leadership, and the support of the \nappropriate committee chairmen, I believe there is a basis for optimism \nthat such overdue reforms will be passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Today, I am proud to join the Republican \npension task force chaired by Senator Gregg to introduce the Women's \nInvestment and Savings Equity Act of 1997, known as the Wise bill. I \nwant to commend Senator Gregg for his leadership of the Republican \npension task force and his hard work in putting this bill together.\n  Of the 63 million baby boomers in America, a full 32 million of them \nare saving less than one-third of what they will need for retirement. \nThis concerns me. It concerns me even further that the overwhelming \nmajority of these Americans, unprepared for retirement, are women. \nAccording to the Census Bureau, retired women are almost twice as \nlikely as men to live in poverty. The poverty rate for elderly single \nwomen is about four times greater than the rate for those who are \nmarried.\n  I consider the Wise bill one of the beginning steps toward creating \nan environment where Americans can work for self-reliance and a secure \nfuture. It will go a long way toward establishing equity in the Tax \nCode for stay-at-home parents who want to save for their retirement \nyears. And while it's called the women's investment and savings equity \nbill--because the majority of those who will benefit are women--it \ncovers both mothers and fathers, whichever serves as homemaker.\n  The Wise bill of 1997 will allow homemakers and other workers without \na pension plan to make a full $2,000 tax-deductible IRA contribution \neach year, regardless of their spouse's pension plan. In addition, \nparents who take maternity or paternity leave will be allowed to make \ncatch-up payments to their retirement plans after they return to work. \nEven homemakers who return to employment after an extended absence, and \nworking parents who cannot afford pension contributions while raising \nchildren, will be able to catch-up for the years they were raising \nchildren.\n  This bill is an important first step of a larger retirement savings \nand security expansion bill by the Republican pension task force. It \nwill give families the tools for a secure retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 22\n\n       Whereas Roger Williams was the primary architect of the \n     lively experiment of church-state separation as the necessary \n     corollary of religious liberty;\n       Whereas Roger Williams was an ardent advocate of the legal \n     rights of Native Americans, maintained a close friendship \n     with them and purchased land from them;\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\n       Whereas Roger Williams may also be seen as the first \n     European environmentalist on this continent; and\n       Whereas Roger Williams was the founder of the first Baptist \n     church in America and the founder of the first Baptist \n     denomination in this hemisphere: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the statue of Roger Williams shall be \n     returned to the United States Capitol Rotunda at the \n     conclusion of the temporary display of the Suffragists \n     Portrait Monument.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this weekend while we are away from the \nCapitol, an unusual event will occur here. Areas in the Capitol rotunda \nand the small rotunda, which are ordinarily open to the public, will be \nclosed to visitors, as will the passageway to the majority leader's \noffice. And starting tomorrow, temporary structures will be constructed \nin these areas. Under the able supervision of the Architect of the \nCapitol's office, steps are underway to move the statue of Roger \nWilliams, which stands in the rotunda, to the second floor hallway \noutside of the majority leader's office.\n  In February, Senator Warner, chairman of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, notified me that the statue of Roger Williams would be \nmoved from the rotunda in order to accommodate the so-called portrait \nmonument of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia Mott \nin accordance with a concurrent resolution approved by both houses \nduring the last Congress. While I have no objection to moving the \nportrait monument to the rotunda, I was disappointed to learn that it \nwould result in the dislocation of the statue of Roger Williams. \nSenator Warner assured me that the Roger Williams statue would receive \nan excellent new location and that none of the alternatives--namely in \nthe rotunda--were available.\n  Senator Warner certainly kept his word. The new location is very \nsatisfactory. The statue will stand in the second floor hallway between \nthe Senate Chamber and the rotunda, on the way to the majority leader's \noffice. It is a bright and sunny space with windows looking out beyond \nthe West Front of the Capitol to the Washington Monument. The statue of \nRoger Williams will be in good company, too.

To ensure the safety of the statue which is quite delicate, it \nwas wrapped in numerous layers of protective materials. First it was \ncompletely covered in plastic wrap. Then, it was wrapped in several \nlayers of aluminum foil which was secured with duct tape. Next, it was \ncovered with paraffin wax and a quarter of an inch of latex rubber was \napplied. All of this was bundled in burlap and a second layer of latex \nwas applied. It was then completely covered with plaster, and tomorrow \nall of this will be encased in fiberglass. The actual move is expected \nto occur on Saturday, and on Sunday, after the statue is replaced on \nits base and precisely positioned in the hallway, all of these layers \nof covering will be removed with the same kind of instrument orthopedic \nsurgeons use to remove casts from patients. I have every confidence in \nthe Architect's office and the office of the Curator that the job of \nrelocating the Roger Williams statue will be skillfully completed.\n\n  As satisfied as I am with all of this, Mr. President, I am submitting \na concurrent resolution to return this statue of Roger Williams to the \nrotunda when the portrait monument is removed. I do this because I \nbelieve that the millions of girls and boys, men and women, from all \nparts of the United States and of the world, should be reminded of the \nprinciples for which Roger Williams is known.\n  Roger Williams was born in England around 1603 to James and Alice \nWilliams. He grew up in a section of London in which religious \ndissenters were burned at the stake. Through his personal ingenuity, he \ngained notice by Sir Edward Coke, who helped young Roger attend school. \nLater he was able to attend Pembroke Hall in Cambridge University. He \nwas ordained by the Church of England and made chaplain at a manor \nhouse in Essex. It was there that he met and married his wife, Mary \nBarnard.\n  By 1629, Roger Williams had accepted many of the views of the \nPuritans and 1 year later, he and Mary left England aboard the Lyon to \nstart a new life in New England.\n  He refused to join the congregation at Boston because of its close \nties to the Church of England, and instead, became minister at Salem. \nThe bad blood between Roger Williams and the Boston magistrates led to \nhis departure from Salem. He moved to Plymouth where he joined the \nSeparatist Pilgrims. He remained in Plymouth for 2 years, and \neventually became assistant pastor. It was during his time in Plymouth \nthat Roger Williams first became acquainted with and interested in \nnative Americans.\n  Eventually he returned to Boston where he found himself again \nembroiled in controversy, this time because he questioned the validity \nof the Massachusetts Bay Colony's Charter. Roger Williams pointed out \nthat the King of England had no authority to grant a charter giving \naway lands that were owned by the native Americans. Of course, this was \nvirtual heresy, and Roger Williams, once again, was banished.\n  You can see that Roger Williams was way ahead of his time with his \nconcern for native Americans and that they be paid fairly for their \nland. Because of this, once again he was banished.\n  Leaving his wife and baby daughter behind, he journeyed for 14 weeks \nthrough the winter harshness to seek refuge with his native American \nfriends in Narragansett County. In the spring, he was joined by others, \nbut soon this small group of dissenters was forced to uproot themselves \nagain because they were still within the boundaries of the \nMassachusetts Bay Colony. They traveled across the Seekonk River, \nlanded at Slate Rock on the west side of the Seekonk River and, in \ngratefulness for the goodness of God to him, he named the area where he \nwas ``Providence,'' and therefrom came the name of Providence. \nSubsequently, of course, it was the capital of the State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Roger Williams and his followers purchased land from Canonicus and \nMiantonomi, the chief sachems of the Narragansett Tribe, and in 1636, \nfounded a new colony devoted to religious freedom and tolerance, the \nfirst time in the history of the world that there had been anything \nlike this.\n  No one was turned away or banished because of his or her religious \nbeliefs. Roger Williams embraced people of all faiths. In fact, the \nfirst synagogue in the New World was built in Newport, RI, and, after \njoining the Baptist faith, Roger Williams built the first Baptist \nChurch in the New World. Both of these historic and religious landmarks \nstill stand today and are completely operational, a living tribute to \nRoger Williams.\n  Roger Williams was banished time and again for having the courage of \nhis convictions. He believed that every individual should be free to \npractice whatever faith he chose, a view that today is as integral to \nour national consciousness as is freedom of expression. He believed in \nthe separation of church and state. And he believed in protecting the \nrights of those who first inhabited this beautiful land, the native \nAmericans. This weekend, he will be banished once more from the \npantheon of leaders with whom he certainly deserves to stand.\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is only fair for this statue of Roger \nWilliams--in this symbol here you see the picture on the stamp that was \nissued depicting his settlement in the State of Rhode Island in 1636.\n  I believe it only fair for this statue of Roger Williams, his symbol \nof tolerance, be returned to the Capitol Rotunda. This provision in the \nconcurrent resolution says--the suggestion is that the statue of the \nwomen, the so-called monument, will only be there for a temporary \nperiod. Indeed, the resolution says that at the conclusion of the \ntemporary display of the suffragettes--how long the temporary period is \nwe are not sure. We are not against the statue of the suffragettes at \nall. But when that is moved, we ask that the statue of Roger Williams \ngo back into the Rotunda.\n  As I say, I have no desire to hasten the removal of the portrait \nmonument. But at the appropriate time, I and my colleagues believe that \nthe Roger Williams statue should be returned.\n  So I send the concurrent resolution to the desk, and ask that it be \nreferred to the appropriate committee.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this evening to join my colleague, \nSenator Chafee, in support of his resolution to return a statue of \nRoger Williams to the Capitol rotunda, and also to commend Senator \nChafee for his excellent statement. He has described in detail the \ncentral role that Roger Williams has played not only in the life of \nRhode Island, but in the life of this Nation.\n  His displacement from the rotunda will not be the first time he was \nbanished. In 1635 he was banished from his first home because he \nadvocated at that time the revolutionary idea that there should be a \nseparation between church and state, that individuals should have \nfreedom of conscience, that individuals should be able to worship the \ngod of their choice, and that the system of government should respect \nthat choice.\n  In a sense he began the intellectual revolution that would culminate \nyears later in the revolution against Great Britain that would lead to \nour Declaration of Independence and to the Constitution of the United \nStates, because he emphasized in his quest for the rights of conscience \nthat element of individuality which is so much a part of America.\n  Roger Williams was a central figure not only in the history of Rhode \nIsland but in the history of this country, and we recognize that by \ngiving him a place of honor and distinction in the rotunda of the \nCapitol.\n  Like Senator Chafee, I do not object at all to the display of the \nsuffragettes statute. That is once again a recognition of individual \nAmericans who showed us the way, who advocated for the right of people. \nIn fact, their behavior was in some way directly or indirectly inspired \nby the tradition established by Roger Williams in the 1600's.\n  I also respect the deliberations of Senator Warner to find a location \nwhich would be appropriate for Roger Williams. But my feeling, as well \nas my colleague's feeling, is that he is of such a historical \ncharacter, not just to Rhode Island but to the Nation, that he well \ndeserves a place in the rotunda of the Capitol of the United States.\n  When Roger Williams came to Rhode Island he created not just a State, \nbut an attitude, an idea, that men and women could worship as they saw \nfit. He inspired the development of the first Baptist church in America \nwhich stands today in Providence. That spirit of tolerance, a respect \nfor individuality, of respect for the dignity of the individual to \nchoose, became a beacon for people around the world to come to Rhode \nIsland. As Senator Chafee indicated, the first Jewish synagogue in \nNorth America was established in Newport and stands today as a symbol \nof Roger Williams' legacy, of our commitment to tolerance, and the \nright and dignity of the individual.\n  Such accomplishments, which go to the very fiber and the spirit of \nAmerica, must be recognized, and, in fact, I feel should be \nappropriately recognized by the display of the Roger Williams statue in \nthe rotunda of the Capitol.\n  When Roger Williams established Rhode Island, he said he was going to \nbegin a lively experiment, and he has. That lively experiment has spun \nthrough the ages the creation of our Government; the very debate that \nwe have here today. His legacy is monumental. His monument should be in \nthe rotunda.\n  I am proud to join my colleague from Rhode Island to cosponsor this \nresolution and to urge, along with him, that at the first appropriate \nmoment the statue of Roger Williams should be returned to the rotunda, \nthat its temporary banishment from the rotunda be ended, and that \nscores of Americans in this generation and generations to come can \nrecognize his accomplishments, can recognize his particular \ncontributions to America and, in recognizing those contributions, can \ncontinue to reaffirm the spirit of religious freedom, of tolerance, and \nof individual dignity which he represents so magnificently. I am proud \nto be associated with my senior colleague and hope that this Senate \nwill move quickly to support the return of Roger Williams to the \nrotunda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our good friends and colleagues from \nRhode Island make a very important statement about one of our very \nsignificant, historic leaders. But we in Massachusetts take some credit \nbecause Roger Williams really originated in Massachusetts before going \nto Rhode Island.\n  As a Senator from Massachusetts, I want to say that all of us in \nMassachusetts hope that our two friends and colleagues are going to be \nsuccessful because we, too, hold this very important and significant \nhistorical figure in very high regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3371-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3373-S3379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE EXECUTIVE RESOLUTION 75--RELATIVE TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS \n                               CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. HELMS submitted the following executive resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

and\n       (II) the Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for \n     limiting the spread of chemical and biological weapons-\n     related materials and technology, and that the effectiveness \n     of the Australia Group has not been undermined by changes in \n     membership, lack of compliance with common export controls \n     and nonproliferation measures, or the weakening of common \n     controls and nonproliferation measures, in force as of the \n     date of ratification of the Convention by the United States.\n\n       (ii) Consultation with senate required.--In the event that \n     the President is, at any time, unable to make the \n     certifications described in clause (i), the President shall \n     consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a \n     resolution of continued adherence to the Convention, \n     notwithstanding the fundamental change in circumstance.\n       (D) Periodic consultation with congressional committees.--\n     The President shall consult periodically, but not less \n     frequently than twice a year, with the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives, on Australia Group \n     export control and nonproliferation measures. If any \n     Australia Group member adopts a position at variance with the \n     certifications and understandings provided under subparagraph \n     (B), or should seek to gain Australia Group acquiescence or \n     approval for an interpretation that various provisions of the \n     Convention require it to remove chemical-weapons related \n     export controls against any State Party to the Convention, \n     the President shall block any effort by that Australia Group \n     member to secure Australia Group approval of such a position \n     or interpretation.\n       (E) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Australia group.--The term ``Australia Group'' means \n     the informal forum of states, chaired by Australia, whose \n     goal is to discourage and impede chemical and biological \n     weapons proliferation by harmonizing national export controls \n     chemical weapons precursor chemicals, biological weapons \n     pathogens, and dual-use production equipment, and through \n     other measures.\n       (ii) Highest diplomatic levels.--The term ``highest \n     diplomatic levels'' means at the levels of senior officials \n     with the power to authoritatively represent their \n     governments, and does not include diplomatic representatives \n     of those governments to the United States.\n       (8) Negative security assurances.--\n       (A) Reevaluation.--In forswearing under the Convention the \n     possession of a chemical weapons retaliatory capability, the \n     Senate understands that deterrence of attack by chemical \n     weapons requires a reevaluation of the negative security \n     assurances extended to non-nuclear-weapon states.\n       (B) Classified report.--Accordingly, 180 days after the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall submit to the Congress a classified report \n     setting forth the findings of a detailed review of United \n     States policy on negative security assurances, including a \n     determination of the appropriate responses to the use of \n     chemical or biological weapons against the Armed Forces of \n     the United States, United States citizens, allies, and third \n     parties.\n       (9) Protection of advanced biotechnology.--Prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, and \n     on January 1 of every year thereafter, the President shall \n     certify to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives that the legitimate \n     commercial activities and interests of chemical, \n     biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms in the United States \n     are not being significantly harmed by the limitations of the \n     Convention on access to, and production of, those chemicals \n     and toxins listed in Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.\n       (10) Monitoring and verification of compliance.--\n       (A) Declaration.--The Senate declares that--\n       (i) the Convention is in the interests of the United States \n     only if all State Parties are in strict compliance with the \n     terms of the Convention as submitted to the Senate for its \n     advice and consent to ratification, such compliance being \n     measured by performance and not by efforts, intentions, or \n     commitments to comply; and\n       (ii) the Senate expects all State Parties to be in strict \n     compliance with their obligations under the terms of the \n     Convention, as submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification;\n       (B) Briefings on compliance.--Given its concern about the \n     intelligence community's low level of confidence in its \n     ability to monitor compliance with the Convention, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch of the Government to offer \n     regular briefings, not less than four times a year, to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives on compliance issues related to the \n     Convention. Such briefings shall include a description of all \n     United States efforts in bilateral and multilateral \n     diplomatic channels and forums to resolve compliance issues \n     and shall include a complete description of--\n       (i) any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     at meetings of the Organization, in advance of such meetings;\n       (ii) any compliance issues raised at meetings of the \n     Organization, within 30 days of such meeting;\n       (iii) any determination by the President that a State Party \n     is in noncompliance with or is otherwise acting in a manner \n     inconsistent with the object or purpose of the Convention, \n     within 30 days of such a determination.\n       (C) Annual reports on compliance.--The President shall \n     submit on January 1 of each year to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a full and complete \n     classified and unclassified report setting forth--\n       (i) a certification of those countries included in the \n     Intelligence Community's Monitoring Strategy, as set forth by \n     the Director of Central Intelligence's Arms Control Staff and \n     the National Intelligence Council (or any successor document \n     setting forth intelligence priorities in the field of the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction) that are \n     determined to be in compliance with the Convention, on a \n     country-by-country basis;\n       (ii) for those countries not certified pursuant to clause \n     (i), an identification and assessment of all compliance \n     issues arising with regard to the adherence of the country to \n     its obligation under the Convention;\n       (iii) the steps the United States has taken, either \n     unilaterally or in conjunction with another State Party--\n\n       (I) to initiate challenge inspections of the noncompliant \n     party with the objective of demonstrating to the \n     international community the act of noncompliance;\n       (II) to call attention publicly to the activity in \n     question; and\n       (III) to seek on an urgent basis a meeting at the highest \n     diplomatic level with the noncompliant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n\n       (iv) a determination of the military significance and \n     broader security risks arising from any compliance issue \n     identified pursuant to clause (ii); and\n       (v) a detailed assessment of the responses of the \n     noncompliant party in question to action undertaken by the \n     United States described in clause (iii).\n       (D) Countries previously included in compliance reports.--\n     For any country that was previously included in a report \n     submitted under subparagraph (C), but which subsequently is \n     not included in the Intelligence Community's Monitoring \n     Strategy (or successor document), such country shall continue \n     to be included in the report submitted under subparagraph (C) \n     unless the country has been certified under subparagraph \n     (C)(i) for each of the previous two years.\n       (E) Form of certifications.--For those countries that have \n     been publicly and officially identified by a representative \n     of the intelligence community as possessing or seeking to \n     develop chemical weapons, the certification described in \n     subparagraph (C)(i) shall in be unclassified form.\n       (F) Annual reports on intelligence.--On January 1, 1998, \n     and annually thereafter, the Director of Central Intelligence \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed \n     Services, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate and to the Committees on International Relations, \n     National Security, and Permanent Select Committee of the \n     House of Representatives, a full and complete classified and \n     unclassified report regarding--\n       (i) the status of chemical weapons development, production, \n     stockpiling, and use, within the meanings of those terms \n     under the Convention, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (ii) any information made available to the United States \n     Government concerning the development, production, \n     acquisition, stockpiling, retention, use, or direct or \n     indirect transfer of novel agents, including any unitary or \n     binary chemical weapon comprised of chemical components not \n     identified on the schedules of the Annex on Chemicals, on a \n     country-by-country basis;\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\n       (iii) the extent of trade in chemicals potentially relevant \n     to chemical weapons programs, including all Australia Group \n     chemicals and chemicals identified on the schedules of the \n     Annex on Chemicals, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (iv) the monitoring responsibilities, practices, and \n     strategies of the intelligence community (as defined in \n     section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947) and a \n     determination of the level of confidence of the intelligence \n     community with respect to each specific monitoring task \n     undertaken, including an assessment by the intelligence \n     community of the national aggregate data provided by State \n     Parties to the Organization, on a country-by-country basis;\n       (v) an identification of how United States national \n     intelligence means, including national technical means and \n     human intelligence, is being marshaled together with the \n     Convention's verification provisions to monitor compliance \n     with the Convention;

and\n       (ii) an identification of the priorities of the executive \n     branch of Government for the development of new resources \n     relating to detection and monitoring capabilities with \n     respect to chemical and biological weapons, including a \n     description of the steps being taken and resources being \n     devoted to strengthening United States monitoring \n     capabilities.\n       (11) Enhancements to robust chemical and biological \n     defenses.--\n       (A) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) chemical and biological threats to deployed United \n     States Armed Forces will continue to grow in regions of \n     concern around the world, and pose serious threats to United \n     States power projection and forward deployment strategies;\n       (ii) chemical weapons or biological weapons use is a \n     potential element of future conflicts in regions of concern;\n       (iii) it is essential for the United States and key \n     regional allies to preserve and further develop robust \n     chemical and biological defenses;\n       (iv) the United States Armed Forces are inadequately \n     equipped, organized, trained and exercised for chemical and \n     biological defense against current and expected threats, and \n     that too much reliance is placed on non-active duty forces, \n     which receive less training and less modern equipment, for \n     critical chemical and biological defense capabilities;\n       (v) the lack of readiness stems from a de-emphasis of \n     chemical and biological defenses within the executive branch \n     of Government and the United States Armed Forces;\n       (vi) the armed forces of key regional allies and likely \n     coalition partners, as well as civilians necessary to support \n     United States military operations, are inadequately prepared \n     and equipped to carry out essential missions in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments;\n       (vii) congressional direction contained in the Defense \n     Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 (title XIV of \n     Public Law 104-201) should lead to enhanced domestic \n     preparedness to protect against chemical and biological \n     weapons threats; and\n       (viii) the United States Armed Forces should place \n     increased emphasis on potential threats to forces deployed \n     abroad and, in particular, make countering chemical and \n     biological weapons use an organizing principle for United \n     States defense strategy and development of force structure, \n     doctrine, planning, training, and exercising policies of the \n     United States Armed Forces.\n       (B) Actions to strengthen defense capabilities.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall take those actions necessary to \n     ensure that the United States Armed Forces are capable of \n     carrying out required military missions in United States \n     regional contingency plans, despite the threat or use of \n     chemical or biological weapons. In particular, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall ensure that the United States Armed Forces \n     are effectively equipped, organized, trained, and exercised \n     (including at the large unit and theater level) to conduct \n     operations in a chemically or biologically contaminated \n     environment that are critical to the success of the United \n     States military plans in regional conflicts, including--\n       (i) deployment, logistics, and reinforcement operations at \n     key ports and airfields;\n       (ii) sustained combat aircraft sortie generation at \n     critical regional airbases; and\n       (iii) ground force maneuvers of large units and divisions.\n       (C) Discussions with regional allies and likely coalition \n     partners.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretaries of Defense and State \n     shall, as a priority matter, initiate discussions with key \n     regional allies and likely regional coalition partners, \n     including those countries where the United States currently \n     deploys forces, where United States forces would likely \n     operate during regional conflicts, or which would provide \n     civilians necessary to support United States military \n     operations, to determine what steps are necessary to ensure \n     that allied and coalition forces and other critical civilians \n     are adequately equipped and prepared to operate in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments.\n       (ii) Reporting requirement.--Not later than one year after \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     Secretaries of Defense and State shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the \n     Senate and to the Speaker of the House on the result of these \n     discussions, plans for future discussions, measures agreed to \n     improve the preparedness of foreign forces and civilians, and \n     proposals for increased military assistance, including \n     through the Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military \n     Financing, and the International Military Education and \n     Training programs pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961.\n       (D) United states army chemical school.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall take those actions necessary to ensure that the \n     United States Army Chemical School remains under the \n     oversight of a general officer of the United States Army.\n       (E) Sense of the senate.--Given its concerns about the \n     present state of chemical and biological defense readiness \n     and training, it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (i) in the transfer, consolidation, and reorganization of \n     the United States Army Chemical School, the Army should not \n     disrupt or diminish the training and readiness of the United \n     States Armed Forces to fight in a chemical-biological warfare \n     environment;\n       (ii) the Army should continue to operate the Chemical \n     Defense Training Facility at Fort McClellan until such time \n     as the replacement training facility at Fort Leonard Wood is \n     functional.\n       (F) Annual reports on chemical and biological weapons \n     defense activities.--On January 1, 1998, and annually \n     thereafter, the President shall submit a report to the \n     Committees on Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations, National Security, and Appropriations of the House \n     of Representatives, and Speaker of the House on previous, \n     current, and planned chemical and biological weapons defense \n     activities.

and\n       (xiii) a description of progress made in resolving issues \n     relating to the protection of United States population \n     centers from chemical and biological attack, including plans \n     for inoculation of populations, consequence management, and a \n     description of progress made in developing and deploying \n     effective cruise missile defenses and a national ballistic \n     missile defense.\n       (12) Primacy of the united states constitution.--Nothing in \n     the Convention requires or authorizes legislation, or other \n     action, by the United States prohibited by the Constitution \n     of the United States, as interpreted by the United States.\n       (13) Noncompliance.--\n       (A) In general.--If the President determines that \n     persuasive information exists that a State Party to the \n     Convention is maintaining a chemical weapons production or \n     production mobilization capability, is developing new \n     chemical agents, or is in violation of the Convention in any \n     other manner so as to threaten the national security \n     interests of the United States, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate, and promptly submit to it, a \n     report detailing the effect of such actions;\n       (ii) seek on an urgent basis a challenge inspection of the \n     facilities of the relevant party in accordance with the \n     provisions of the Convention with the objective of \n     demonstrating to the international community the act of \n     noncompliance;\n       (iii) seek, or encourage, on an urgent basis a meeting at \n     the highest diplomatic level with the relevant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (iv) implement prohibitions and sanctions against the \n     relevant party as required by law;\n       (v) if noncompliance has been determined, seek on an urgent \n     basis within the Security Council of the United Nations a \n     multilateral imposition of sanctions against the noncompliant \n     party for the purposes of bringing the noncompliant party \n     into compliance; and\n       (vi) in the event that the noncompliance continues for a \n     period of longer than one year after the date of the \n     determination made pursuant to subparagraph (A), promptly \n     consult with the Senate for the purposes of obtaining a \n     resolution of support of continued adherence to the \n     Convention, notwithstanding the changed circumstances \n     affecting the object and purpose of the Convention.\n       (B) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed \n     to impair or otherwise affect the authority of the Director \n     of Central Intelligence to protect intelligence sources and \n     methods from unauthorized disclosure pursuant to section \n     103(c)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     403-3(c)(5)).\n       (C) Presidential determinations.--If the President \n     determines that an action otherwise required under \n     subparagraph (A) would impair or otherwise affect the \n     authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to protect \n     intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \n     disclosure, the President shall report that determination, \n     together with a detailed written explanation of the basis for \n     that determination, to the chairmen of the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence not later than 15 days after making \n     such determination.\n       (14) Financing russian implementation.--The United States \n     understands that, in order to be assured of the Russian \n     commitment to a reduction in chemical weapons stockpiles, \n     Russia must maintain a substantial stake in financing the \n     implementation of both the 1990 Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement and the Convention. The United States shall not \n     accept any effort by Russia to make deposit of Russia's \n     instrument of ratification contingent upon the United States \n     providing financial guarantees to pay for implementation of \n     commitments by Russia under the 1990 Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement or the Convention.\n       (15) Assistance under article x.--\n       (A) In general.--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Congress that the United States shall not provide \n     assistance under paragraph 7(a) of Article X.\n       (B) Countries ineligible for certain assistance under the \n     foreign assistance act.--Prior to the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to the Congress that for any State Party the \n     government of which is not eligible for assistance under \n     chapter 2 of part II (relating to military assistance) or \n     chapter 4 of part II (relating to economic support \n     assistance) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961--\n       (i) no assistance under paragraph 7(b) of Article X will be \n     provided to the State Party; and\n       (ii) no assistance under paragraph 7(c) of Article X other \n     than medical antidotes and treatment will be provided to the \n     State Party.\n       (16) Protection of confidential information.--\n       (A) Unauthorized disclosure of united states business \n     information.--Whenever the President determines that \n     persuasive information is available indicating that--\n       (i) an officer of employee of the Organization has \n     willfully published, divulged, disclosed, or made known in \n     any manner or to any extent not authorized by the Convention \n     any United States confidential business information coming to \n     him in the course of his employment or official duties or by \n     reason of any examination or investigation of any return, \n     report, or record made to or filed with the Organization, or \n     any officer or employee thereof, and\n       (ii) such practice or disclosure has resulted in financial \n     losses or damages to a United States person,\n\n     the President shall, within 30 days after the receipt of such \n     information by the executive branch of Government, notify the \n     Congress in writing of such determination.\n       (B) Waiver of immunity from jurisdiction.--\n       (i) Certification.--Not later than 270 days after \n     notification of Congress under subparagraph (A), the \n     President shall certify to Congress that the immunity from \n     jurisdiction of such foreign person has been waived by the \n     Director-General of the Technical Secretariat.\n       (ii) Withholding of portion of contributions.--If the \n     President is unable to make the certification described under \n     clause (i), then 50 percent of the amount of each annual \n     United States contribution to the regular budget of the \n     Organization that is assessed pursuant to paragraph 7 of \n     Article VIII shall be withheld from disbursement, in addition \n     to any other amounts required to be withheld from \n     disbursement by any other provision of law, until--\n\n       (I) the President makes such certification, or\n       (II) the President certifies to Congress that the situation \n     has been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the United \n     States person who has suffered the damages due to the \n     disclosure of United States confidential business \n     information.\n\n       (C) Breaches of confidentiality.--\n       (i) Certification.--In the case of any breach of \n     confidentiality involving both a State Party and the \n     Organization, including any officer or employee thereof, the \n     President shall, within 270 days after providing written \n     notification to Congress pursuant to subparagraph (A), \n     certify to Congress that the Commission described under \n     paragraph 23 of the Confidentiality Annex has been \n     established to consider the breach.\n       (ii) Withholding of portion of contributions.--If the \n     President is unable to make the certification described under \n     clause (i), then 50 percent of the amount of each annual \n     United States contribution to the regular budget of the \n     Organization that is assessed pursuant to paragraph 7 of \n     Article VIII shall be withheld from disbursement, in addition \n     to any other amounts required to be withheld from \n     disbursement by any other provision of law, until--\n\n       (I) the President makes such certification, or\n       (II) the President certifies to Congress that the situation \n     has been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the United \n     States person who has suffered the damages due to the \n     disclosure of United States confidential business \n     information.\n\n       (D) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) United states confidential business information.--The \n     term ``United States confidential business information'' \n     means any trade secrets or commercial or financial \n     information that is privileged and confidential, as described \n     in section 552(b)(4) of title 5, United States Code, and that \n     is obtained--\n\n       (I) from a United States person; and\n       (II) through the United States National Authority or the \n     conduct of an inspection on United States territory under the \n     Convention.\n\n       (ii) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means any natural person or any corporation, \n     partnership, or other juridical entity organized under the \n     laws of the United States.\n       (iii) United states.--The term ``United States'' means the \n     several States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United \n     States.\n       (17) Constitutional prerogatives.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States \n     Constitution states that the President ``shall have Power, by \n     and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make \n     Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present \n     concur''.\n       (ii) At the turn of the century, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge \n     took the position that the giving of advice and consent to \n     treaties constitutes a stage in negotiation on the treaties \n     and that Senate amendments or reservations to a treaty are \n     propositions ``offered at a later stage of the negotiation by\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\n     the other part of the American treaty making power in the \n     only manner in which they could then be offered''.\n       (iii) The executive branch of Government has begun a \n     practice of negotiating and submitting to the Senate treaties \n     which include provisions that have the purported effect of--\n\n       (I) inhibiting the Senate from attaching reservations that \n     the Senate considers necessary in the national interest; or\n       (II) preventing the Senate from exercising its \n     constitutional duty to give its advice and consent to treaty \n     commitments before ratification of the treaties.\n\n       (iv) During the 85th Congress, and again during the 102d \n     Congress, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate \n     made its position on this issue clear when stating that ``the \n     President's agreement to such a prohibition cannot constrain \n     the Senate's constitutional right and obligation to give its \n     advice and consent to a treaty subject to any reservation it \n     might determine is required by the national interest''.\n       (B) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) the advice and consent given by the Senate in the past \n     to ratification of treaties containing provisions which \n     prohibit amendments or reservations should not be construed \n     as a precedent for such provisions in future treaties;\n       (ii) United States negotiators to a treaty should not agree \n     to any provision that has the effect of inhibiting the Senate \n     from attaching reservations or offering amendments to the \n     treaty; and\n       (iii) the Senate should not consent in the future to any \n     article or other provision of any treaty that would prohibit \n     the Senate from giving its advice and consent to ratification \n     of the treaty subject to amendment or reservation.\n       (18) Laboratory sample analysis.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that no sample collected in the \n     United States pursuant to the Convention will be transferred \n     for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the \n     United States.\n       (19) Effect on terrorism.--The Senate finds that--\n       (A) without regard to whether the Convention enters into \n     force, terrorists will likely view chemical weapons as a \n     means to gain greater publicity and instill widespread fear; \n     and\n       (B) the March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by the Aum Shinrikyo \n     would not have been prevented by the Convention.\n       (20) Constitutional separation of powers.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) Article VIII(8) of the Convention allows a State Party \n     to vote in the Organization if the State Party is in arrears \n     in the payment of financial contributions and the \n     Organization is satisfied that such nonpayment is due to \n     conditions beyond the control of the State Party.\n       (ii) Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution \n     vests in Congress the exclusive authority to ``pay the \n     Debts'' of the United States.\n       (iii) Financial contributions to the Organization may be \n     appropriated only by Congress.\n       (B) Sense of senate.--It is therefore the sense of the \n     Senate that--\n       (i) such contributions thus should be considered, for \n     purposes of Article VIII(8) of the Convention, beyond the \n     control of the executive branch of the United States \n     Government; and\n       (ii) the United States vote in the Organization should not \n     be denied in the event that Congress does not appropriate the \n     full amount of funds assessed for the United States financial \n     contribution to the Organization.\n       (21) On-site inspection agency.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the On-Site Inspection Agency of the Department \n     of Defense should have the authority to provide assistance in \n     advance of any inspection to any facility in the United \n     States that is subject to a routine inspection under the \n     Convention, or to any facility in the United States that is \n     the object of a challenge inspection conducted pursuant to \n     Article IX, if the consent of the owner or operator of the \n     facility has first been obtained.\n       (22) Limitation on the scale of assessment.--\n       (A) Limitation on annual assessment.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Convention, and subject to the requirements \n     of subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) the United States shall \n     pay as a total annual assessment of the costs of the \n     Organization pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article VIII not more \n     than $25,000,000.\n       (B) Recalculation of limitation.--On January 1, 2000, and \n     at each 3-year interval thereafter, the amount specified in \n     subparagraph (A) is to be recalculated by the Administrator \n     of General Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     State, to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the \n     immediately preceding 3-year period.\n       (C) Additional contributions requiring congressional \n     approval.--\n       (i) Authority.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     President may furnish additional contributions which would \n     otherwise be prohibited under subparagraph (A) if--\n\n       (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the failure to \n     provide such contributions would result in the inability of \n     the Organization to conduct challenge inspections pursuant to \n     Article IX or would otherwise jeopardize the national \n     security interests of the United States; and\n       (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     certification of the President.\n\n       (ii) Statement of reasons.--The President shall transmit \n     with such certification a detailed statement setting forth \n     the specific reasons therefor, and the specific uses to which \n     the additional contributions provided to the Organization \n     would be applied.\n       (D) Additional contributions for verification.--\n     Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for a period of not more \n     than ten years, the President may furnish additional \n     contributions to the Organization for the purposes of meeting \n     the costs of verification under Articles IV and V.\n       (23) Additions to the annex on chemicals.--\n       (A) Presidential notification.--Not later than 10 days \n     after the Director-General of the Technical Secretariat \n     communicates information to all States Parties pursuant to \n     Article XV(5)(a) of a proposal for the addition of a chemical \n     or biological substance to a schedule of the Annex on \n     Chemicals, the President shall notify the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate of the proposed addition.\n       (B) Presidential report.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     Director-General of the Technical Secretariat communicates \n     information of such a proposal pursuant to Article XV(5)(a) \n     or not later than 30 days after a positive recommendation by \n     the Executive Council pursuant to Article XV(5)(c), whichever \n     is sooner, the President shall submit to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate a report, in classified and \n     unclassified form, detailing the likely impact of the \n     proposed addition to the Annex on Chemicals. Such report \n     shall include--\n       (i) an assessment of the likely impact on United States \n     industry of the proposed addition of the chemical or \n     biological substance to a schedule of the Annex on Chemicals;\n       (ii) a description of the likely costs and benefits, if \n     any, to United States national security of the proposed \n     addition of such chemical or biological substance to a \n     schedule of the Annex on Chemicals; and\n       (iii) a detailed assessment of the effect of the proposed \n     addition on United States obligations under the Verification \n     Annex.\n       (C) Presidential consultation.--The President shall, after \n     the submission of the notification required under \n     subparagraph (A) and prior to any action on the proposal by \n     the Executive Council under Article XV(5)(c), consult \n     promptly with the Senate as to whether the United States \n     should object to the proposed addition of a chemical or \n     biological substance pursuant to Article XV(5)(c).\n       (24) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the Constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty. For purposes of this declaration, the term ``INF \n     Treaty'' refers to the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols, approved by the Senate on May \n     27, 1988.\n       (25) Further arms reductions obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (26) Riot control agents.--\n       (A) Permitted uses.--Prior the the deposit of the United \n     States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to Congress that the United States is not restricted \n     by the Convention in its use of riot control agents, \n     including the use against combatants who are parties to a \n     conflict, in any of the following cases:\n       (i) United states not a party.--The conduct of peacetime \n     muilitary operations within an area of ongoing armed conflict \n     when the United States is not a party to the conflict (such \n     as recent use of the United States Armed Forces in Somalia, \n     Bosnia, and Ruanda).\n       (ii) Consensual peacekeeping.--Consensual peacekeeping \n     operations when the use of force is authorized by the \n     receiving state, including operations pursuant to Chapter VI \n     of the United Nations Charter.\n       (iii) Chapter vii peacekeeping.--Peacekeeping operations \n     when force is authorized by the Securtity Council under \n     Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\n       (B) Implementation.--The President shall take no measure, \n     and prescribe no rule or regulation, which would alter or \n     eliminate Executive Order 11850 of April 8, 1975.\n       (C) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``riot control \n     agent'`` has the meaning given the term in Article II(7) of \n     the Convention.\n       (27) Chemical weapons destruction.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification of the \n     Convention, the President shall certify to the Congress that \n     all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\n       (A) Exploration of alternative technologies.--The President \n     has agreed to explore alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of the United States stockpile of chemical \n     weapons in order to ensure that the United States has the \n     safest, most effective and environmentally sound plans and \n     programs for meeting its obligations under the Convention for \n     the destruction of chemical weapons.\n       (B) Convention extends destruction deadline.--The \n     requirement in section 1412 of Public Law 99-145 (50 U.S.C. \n     1521) for completion of the destruction of the United States \n     stockpile of chemical weapons by December 31, 2004, will be \n     superseded upon the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to the United States by the deadline required by \n     the Convention of April 29, 2007.\n       (C) Authority to employ a different destruction \n     technology.--The requirement in Article III(1)(a)(v) of the \n     Convention for a declaration by each State Party not later \n     than 30 days after the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to that Party, on general plans of the State \n     Party for destruction of its chemical weapons does not \n     preclude in any way the United States from deciding in the \n     future to employ a technology for the destruction of chemical \n     weapons different than that declared under that Article.\n       (D) Procedures for extension of deadline.--The President \n     will consult with Congress on whether to submit a request to \n     the Executive Council of the Organization for an extension of \n     the deadline for the destruction of chemical weapons under \n     the Convention, as provided under part IV(A) of the Annex on \n     Implementation and Verification to the Convention, if, as a \n     result of the program of alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of chemical munitions carried out under section \n     8065 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1997 \n     (as contained in Public Law 104-208), the President \n     determines that alternatives to the incineration of chemical \n     weapons are available that are safer and more environmentally \n     sound but whose use would preclude the United States from \n     meeting the deadlines of the Convention.\n       (28) Constitutional protection against unreasonable search \n     and seizure.--\n       (A) In general.--In order to protect United States citizens \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall certify to Congress that--\n       (i) for any challenge inspection conducted on the territory \n     of the United States pursuant to Article IX, where consent \n     has been withheld, the United States National Authority will \n     first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon probable \n     cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and describing with \n     particularity the place to be searched and the persons or \n     things to be seized; and\n       (ii) for any routine inspection of a declared facility \n     under the Convention that is conducted on an involuntary \n     basis on the territory of the United States, the United \n     States National Authority first will obtain an administrative \n     search warrant from a United States magistrate judge.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of this resolution, the term \n     ``National Authority'' means the agency or office of the \n     United States Government designated by the United States \n     pursuant to Article VII(4) of the Convention.\n       (29) Russian elimination of chemical weapons.--Prior to the \n     deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the \n     President shall certify to the Congress that--\n       (A) Russia is making reasonable progress in the \n     implementation of the Agreement between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on \n     Destruction and Nonproduction of Chemical Weapons and on \n     Measures to Facilitate the Multilateral Convention on Banning \n     Chemical Weapons, signed on June 1, 1990 (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement'');\n       (B) the United States and Russia have resolved, to the \n     satisfaction of the United States, outstanding compliance \n     issues under the Memorandum of Understanding Between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral Verification \n     Experiment and Data Exchange Related to Prohibition on \n     Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on \n     September 23, 1989, also known as the ``1989 Wyoming \n     Memorandum of Understanding'', and the 1990 Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement;\n       (C) Russia has deposited the Russian instrument of \n     ratification for the Convention and is in compliance with its \n     obligations under the Convention; and\n       (D) Russia is committed to forgoing any chemical weapons \n     capability, chemical weapons modernization program, \n     production mobilization capability, or any other activity \n     contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention.\n       (30) Chemical weapons in other states.--\n       (A) Certification requirement.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification the President, in \n     consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, shall \n     certify to the Congress that countries which have been \n     determined to have offensive chemical weapons programs, \n     including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, the Democratic People's \n     Republic of Korea, China, and all other countries determined \n     to be state sponsors of international terrorism, have \n     ratified or otherwise acceded to the Convention.\n       (31) Exercise of right to bar certain inspectors.--\n       (i) In general.--The President shall exercise United States \n     rights under paragraphs 2 and 4 of Part II of the \n     Verification Annex to indicate United States non-acceptance \n     of all inspectors and inspection assistants who are nationals \n     of countries designated by the Secretary of State as \n     supporters of international terrorism under section 40(d) of \n     the Arms Export Control Act, or nationals of countries that \n     have been determined by the President, in the last five \n     years, to have violated United States nonproliferation law, \n     including--\n\n       (I) chapters 7, 8, and 10 of the Arms Export Control Act;\n       (II) sections 821 and 824 of the Nuclear Proliferation \n     Prevention Act of 1994;\n       (III) sections 11b and 11c of the Export Administration Act \n     of 1979;\n       (IV) the

Mr. President, I am pleased to join 31 of my \nfellow Senators in introducing a reauthorization of our Nation's \ntransportation legislation, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA]. This bill commits our country to sound \ntransportation planning and development and reflects the vital role \ntransportation plays in our expanding economy.\n  In 1991, I was proud to be a member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and an original author of ISTEA. This innovative law \nhas resulted in the development of efficient and effective \ntransportation throughout our country. ISTEA shifted decision making \nfrom Washington to local communities, enhanced air quality health \nstandards, increased mobility and allowed our economy to grow in an \nintelligent manner.\n  Today, I am equally honored to be involved in the introduction of \nISTEA WORKS, the continuation of this successful law. This bill retains \nthe basic structure of ISTEA, preserving the role of States and local \ncommunities in deciding transportation policies, continuing the \nemphasis on intermodalism and maintaining support for strong \nenvironmental provisions. The bill protects the important enhancements \nprograms, expands the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program and \nimproves safety.\n  This legislation also addresses an issue important to Vermont and the \nNation. As we have heard recently, Amtrak continues to struggle with \nits finances. Although I know Amtrak will survive, action must be taken \nto improve the system now. ISTEA WORKS grants States the flexibility to \nuse Federal transportation dollars for operating and maintaining \npassenger service. This flexibility is important to Vermont, where we \nare running two of the most successful passenger trains in the Nation. \nThe new authority will also enable our State to expand passenger rail \nand upgrade rail lines to benefit freight rail traffic.\n  Mr. President, this is a historic occasion. With the introduction of \nthis legislation, we begin to raise the awareness of the success of \nISTEA and the urgent need to reauthorize this important legislation \nwith few major changes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3380-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3380-S3381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NOMINATION OF PETE PETERSON TO BE AMBASSADOR TO VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was pleased to see the Senate consider \nthe President's nomination of Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson to be the \nUnited States Ambassador to Socialist Republic of Vietnam late last \nweek. I supported this nomination in the Foreign Relations Committee. \nBut I did so after careful consideration of the symbolism of this vote \nand of the signal it sends to Americans.\n  Mr. President, the appointment of an ambassador is a normal \nconsequence of having full diplomatic relations with a given country. \nAnd we have had diplomatic relations with Vietnam since July 1995 when \nthe President signed an executive order establishing such ties. So, \ntechnically, the Senate's view on this nominee does not represent a \nstatement of policy. It simply represents the normal procedure by which \nthe Senate provides its advice and consent to a Presidential \nnomination.\n  There has never been any serious question raised regarding the \nPresident's selection of Mr. Peterson to fill this position. Mr. \nPeterson is an outstanding citizen and public servant. He spent nearly \n30 years in the U.S. Air Force, including 6\\1/2\\ years as a prisoner of \nwar in Vietnam, and has received numerous awards for his valiant \nservice. As a three-term Member of Congress from the second district in \nFlorida, Mr. Peterson also has devoted significant energies to working \nwith both the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration to \nbolster the U.S.\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\nsearch program for POW/MIA's. There are few people who have as deep of \nan understanding of the uniqueness of America's relationship with \nVietnam, so I fully support the President's choice.\n  This does not mean that there do not remain myriad outstanding \nquestions and issues in our bilateral relations with Vietnam. One issue \nthat is of particular concern to me is the human rights record of the \nVietnamese Government which remains poor. According to the most recent \nState Department Report on Human Rights Practices, the Government of \nVietnam continues to restrict basic freedoms; of speech, of the press, \nof assembly, of association, of privacy, and of religion. Citizens can \nbe arbitrarily arrested or detained for trying to express political or \nreligious objections to government policies. And although the \nVietnamese Constitution provides for the right to privacy, according to \nthe State Department, the Vietnamese Government continues to operate a \n``nationwide system of surveillance and control through * * * block \nwardens who use informants to keep track of individuals' activities.'' \nThe Vietnamese Government also has in place a policy of forced family \nplanning.\n  Mr. President, this is not a country that shares with the United \nStates the principle that government should exist to promote the \ngeneral welfare of its people. Nor is it one that has respect for the \nrule of law.\n  But, as I said in 1995 when the President first announced his \ndecision to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam, I believe that \ndiplomatic relations actually enhance our ability to advocate for \nissues such as human rights and political freedoms. Through a \npermanent, high-level presence in the country, I believe the United \nStates can intensify the dialog on human rights, work more closely with \nVietnamese reformers, and more effectively monitor developments in the \nhuman rights situation.\n  Now I have listened carefully to the veterans in Wisconsin and to the \nnational veterans' organizations. I recognize that the veterans \nthemselves have differing opinions on the issue of diplomatic \nrelations, in general, and of Senate confirmation of this nomination, \nin particular. The concerns are two-fold: Does having an ambassador on \nthe ground in Vietnam actually help advance the accounting of POW and \nMIA cases? Or does the dispatching of a President's representative with \nambassadorial rank imply that the United States no longer thinks we \nhave reason to withhold a special privilege for Vietnam?\n  Mr. President, it is my view that having an ambassador resident in \nHanoi can serve to better advance U.S. interests, in human rights, as I \nsaid earlier, and on issues related to the continued accounting of our \nPOW's and MIA's. I salute the efforts of all those who have tirelessly \nsought details about missing U.S. service men and women, and, from most \nof their testimony, I am inclined to believe that we will enhance our \nability to collect more information about the remaining POW and MIA \ncases through fulfilling the President's commitment to full diplomatic \nrelations.\n  On the other hand, I think it is equally important to acknowledge \nthat sending a Presidential representative of ambassadorial rank does \nindicate a symbolic change in our relationship with Vietnam that I know \nsome observers still are hesitant to send. It is my view, however, that \nthe United States can serve two purposes by that change: Better advance \nour interests as described above, and better indicate our concerns \nabout Vietnam or its government through other actions. For example, \nthat is why I voted against lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam \nand why I have supported congressional efforts to limit United States \nassistance to Vietnam.\n  However, I believe that in an era of global engagement and \nintegration, it usually makes little sense to refuse diplomatic \nrelations with a country in the international community. Vietnam is a \nlarge presence in a fast-growing region where the United States has \never-increasing interests. We can no longer hope to isolate it, nor \nwill isolation serve to advance any of our goals.\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, I support the President's choice of Pete \nPeterson to be Ambassador to Vietnam because I believe that the United \nStates best serves its citizens by having a Presidential representative \nof the highest order resident in the country. Nevertheless, I remain \nconcerned about other aspects of our bilateral relations in that \ncountry and I will continue to scrutinize carefully the President's \npolicies in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3380-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMENDATION OF LT. COL. STEPHEN G. GRESS, JR.\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nLt. Col. Stephen G. Gress, Jr., who recently retired from the U.S. Air \nForce. A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Lieutenant Colonel Gress has served \nhis country with valor and distinction for more than 22 years as an \ninstructor pilot, a combat pilot, and as a member of the Air Force \nlegislative liaison.\n  One needs only to look at Steve's academic credentials to see that he \nis a man of exceptional achievement. In addition to graduating from the \nAir Force Academy, Lieutenant Colonel Gress earned a masters degree in \noperation research from the Air Force Institute of Technology at \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base. Likewise, Steve became a distinguished \ngraduate of the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base \nin 1987.\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant Colonel Gress was one of the military's \npremier pilots. He served as an instructor pilot for the T-38 at Webb \nAir Force Base, and later, for the T-41 at his alma mater, the U.S. Air \nForce Academy. In 1979, the Air Force chose Steve from a very select \nfew to become an F-15 fighter pilot. Steve also distinguished himself \nin the Air Force Special Programs Office, where he managed the \ndevelopment of future fighter weapons systems. During his tenure at \nBitburgh Air Force Base, Steve's extensive knowledge of fighter combat \noperations led to an appointment as the chief of wing inspections, a \nposition that is critical to the combat effectiveness of all Air Force \norganizations.\n  I would also note that Lieutenant Colonel Gress is a war hero. As an \nF-15 flight leader, he flew 19 combat missions in Operation Desert \nStorm.\n  Later in 1991, Steve returned to the Pentagon. Once again, the Air \nForce came to rely upon his keen understanding of fighter combat. As \nthe branch chief for both air to air weapons and fighter development, \nhe worked to ensure that the next generation of fighter systems would \nsecure American air dominance.\n  Steve moved to the Office of the Air Force Legislative Liaison in \n1993. He worked his way up from the branch chief for fighter and \nfighter weapons to the division chief of the weapons systems division. \nAs always, Steve took tremendous pride in his work. He strove to ensure \nthat critical military issues were presented to Congress in a clear and \nnonparochial manner. Over the years, many congressional staff members \nhave come to know Steve both as a serious professional and as a man of \nintegrity.\n  As Lt. Col. Stephen G. Gress, Jr. retires to private life, I ask my \ncolleagues will join me in commending the outstanding service he has \ngiven this country. On behalf of the Senate, I would like to wish \nLieutenant Colonel Gress and his family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3381-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3381-S3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FENTON A.J. PHILLIPS LIBRARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Fenton \nA.J. Phillips Library as it celebrates the 10th anniversary of \noperations in its current building. The history of the library dates \nback to 1906, when local industrialist A.J. Phillips bequeathed his old \noffice building to the community for use as a library. Since then, the \nlibrary has experienced many changes, but it has never stopped serving \nthe residents of Fenton. In order to properly celebrate this \nachievement, the city of Fenton and the Fenton Library Board is holding \na gala event which will include some of Neil Simon's hilarious \nsketches. These will be presented by the actors of the Readers Theatre \nat the library. Mayor Patricia Lockwood has proclaimed April 17, \n``Pride in the Fenton A.J. Phillips Library Day.''\n  The Fenton Library is one of 18 libraries in the Genesee County \nLibrary System. It serves over 10,000 residents of Fenton, Fenton \nTownship, and Tyrone Township. It contains over 55,000\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\nvolumes and offers online services to the community. It provides CD's, \nvideos, and books on tape. The library also offers special programs for \nadults and children, and complete reference services. In 1988, the \nlibrary was awarded the Michigan Municipal League's Municipal \nAchievement Award Honorable Mention for its outstanding work.\n  I recently visited the Fenton A.J. Phillips Library and saw the \npositive influence it has on the local community. In this era when \ninstitutions are being asked to do more with less, it is heartening to \nsee this library continue to provide quality service to the public. I \nknow my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring the Fenton A.J. \nPhillips Library on its 10th Anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3381-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMEMORATING THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF AMERICA\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Today the school is holding a celebration of \ncultural unity to recognize a wonderfully diverse student body made up \nof young Americans with family heritage from 33 different cultures \naround the world. To celebrate the day, the students of North Dallas \nHigh School have painted a mural titled ``Unity Among Cultures,'' which \nwill be unveiled today.\n  The Dallas Public School System, which administers North Dallas High \nSchool, covers over 300 square miles and 208 schools. Over 60 different \ncultural and linguistic groups are represented, from Amharic to \nVietnamese. Within this school system, and most notably at the newly \ndesignated First International School of America, these diverse \ncultures come together as they always have in this country to form the \ngreat American culture.\n  Since its very beginnings as an independent republic, Texas has been \na place to which people come to build their lives while helping build \nthe land.

OF LOS ANGELES AND REV. CECIL MURRAY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today \nand commemorate the 125th anniversary of the First African Methodist \nEpiscopal Church in Los Angeles, CA. First A.M.E., as it is known to \nmillions of southern Californians, is the oldest predominately African-\nAmerican church in Los Angeles. For the past 20 years, First A.M.E. has \nbeen led by the Reverend Cecil L. ``Chip'' Murray, who has \ndistinguished himself as one of the leading black clergymen in America \nduring his tenure at this church.\n  This year's anniversary celebration is about much more than \nlongevity. It is about a legacy of and commitment to leadership and \ninspiration. First A.M.E. is not only the oldest and most well-known \nAfrican-American church in Los Angeles, it is also the most highly \nrespected. Its reputation as a place of worship and a center of black \ncommunity fellowship and action is known to Angelenos of every social \nand ethnic background. Its voice has been an essential part of a city \nknown for dynamic civic dialog.\n  In addition to its central role as a church, First A.M.E. also \nprovides much-needed leadership and social service assistance in the \ncommunity. Church outreach efforts include providing food and housing \nassistance to families and individuals in need, job training and \nplacement services and working with young people to encourage them \nalong the paths of personal and spiritual fulfillment and social \nresponsibility. Although its focus is primarily local, First A.M.E. has \nalso hosted leaders of national and international stature at its Sunday \nservices. In so doing, First A.M.E. has provided a valuable forum, \nwhich has stimulated dialog and action in the community.\n  One-hundred and twenty-five years ago, a former slave, Biddy Mason, \nfounded the First A.M.E. in her home in what is now downtown Los \nAngeles. Today, the congregation worships in a beautiful building \ndesigned by the renowned black architect Paul Williams. When the first \nservice was held there were only 12 people in attendance. When I was \nthere last year, there were over 600 people at just one service, and \nthere were several held that day.\n  The Reverend Chip Murray joined First A.M.E. in 1977, when the \ncongregation had but 300 active members. Today, this number has \nincreased to over 9,000, representing all age ranges and every \nsocioeconomic group in Los Angeles' diverse African-American community. \nUnder Reverend Murray's leadership, First A.M.E. has developed 30 task \nforces that focus on such issues as health, substance abuse, aid to \nneedy families and the elderly, housing and economic development, job \ntraining, and tutoring. I cannot say enough about First A.M.E.'s \nefforts to reach out to people from all walks of life.\n  Reverend Murray's mission has been to expand the church beyond its \nwalls. As an example, every new congregant is asked to participate in a \ntask force. Efforts such as this help ensure that First A.M.E. remains \nintimately involved in the life and times of the great city which it \nserves.

Mr. President, on March 14, I came to the floor \nto introduce S. 445, the Waste Tire Recycling, Abatement, and Disposal \nAct of 1997. Today, I want to make sure that the record is clear on an \nissue relating to the retreading of radial-type tires.\n  It has come to my attention that my remarks regarding retreading have \nled to some concern on the part of those engaged in the retreading \nindustry. There are approximately 1,440 retreading plants in the United \nStates, and approximately 90 percent of the retreading plants are \nindependently owned small businesses.\n  In my oral remarks on March 14, I said ``the nature of modern steel \nbelted radial tires makes it very difficult to recycle these tires into \nnew ones. Once upon a time, old tires were retreaded, as we all know. \nYou cannot do that with radial tires.'' While that statement is true \nwith regards to recycling rubber from modern radial tires directly into \nnew radial tires, it is not accurate with respect to retreading of \nradials.\n  The Tire Retread Information Bureau and the International Tire and \nRubber Association recently provided me with the information on the \nretreading of tires in 1996, when a total of 29.1 million tires were \nretreaded in the United States. This breaks down to approximately 4.2 \nmillion passenger car tires, 99 percent of them radials; 7 million \nlight truck tires, 80 percent of them radials; and 16.5 million medium \ntruck tires--tires for so-called 18 wheelers, 89 percent of them \nradials. The remainder are off-road vehicle tires, aircraft tires, and \nspecialty tires.\n  My bill, S. 445, recognizes that retreading tires is an \nenvironmentally beneficial fate for tires that would otherwise require \nimmediate disposal. Proposed section 4011(d)(1)(B) provides tire \nretreaders with an exception to the general prohibition on storage of \nmore than 1,500 unshredded waste tires for a period greater than 7 \ndays. This section affirmatively promotes retreading by allowing \nretreaders to store at their plants the greater of either 2,500 tires; \nor a number equal to the number of tires to be retreaded over a 30-day \nperiod.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3382-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\n\n\n                   IN SUPPORT OF SENATE RESOLUTION 72\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nResolution 72, to allow disabled people with floor privileges to bring \nsupporting services onto the floor with them when appropriate. For \nyears, the disability community has fought for the right to be included \nand to be brought into the economic and social mainstream of American \nlife. This resolution represents one more step forward in that long \nstruggle to win equal treatment.\n  Throughout our history, the rules of the Senate have served us \nextraordinarily well. They enable us to preserve order and decorum so \nthat the affairs of our Nation can be debated, discussed, and \nconsidered in a reasoned, deliberate manner. Yet, as is true of any set \nof rules, occasionally the need for change becomes apparent. Such a \nmoment occurred in the Senate on Monday when a Senator sought floor \nprivileges for a member of his staff who is blind and utilizes a guide \ndog in her work.\n  As a body, we responded to this moment as we should have: Carefully, \ndeliberately, and swiftly. The staff member in question was granted \naccess to the floor, and Senate Resolution 72 was promptly referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration. I am hopeful that, in due \ncourse, we will revise our rules to allow all people with disabilities \nto bring supporting services with them to the floor when appropriate.\n  Former Senator Lowell Weicker of my home State once said that people \nwith disabilities spend a lifetime overcoming not what God wrought but \nwhat man imposed by custom and law. This resolution gratefully \neliminates some of those customs and laws. It is an important step for \ndisabled Americans, for the Senate, and for the entire country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3383-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      U.S. ATTORNEY CHUCK STEVENS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na trusted colleague and dedicated public servant, Chuck Stevens. During \nhis three-and-a-half-year tenure as the United States Attorney for the \nEastern District of California, he compiled an undeniably strong \nrecord. However, what may be most impressive about Chuck is his self-\neffacing demeanor in a position that often requires being pushed into \nthe limelight.\n  Chuck Stevens' career exemplifies the kind of integrity, dedication \nand skills essential for anyone who seeks to be an effective public \nservant. His success at the helm of the Eastern District in California \nso early in his career undoubtedly will be followed by great \naccomplishments in the future.\n  A native of Cranford, NJ, Mr. Stevens moved to California to study \nlaw at the University of California, Berkeley where he graduated in \n1982. Prior to his current position, he worked as a litigator in \ncomplex cases in the private sector and as an Assistant United States \nAttorney.\n  Mr. Stevens returned to public service when he was appointed by \nPresident Clinton in November 1993 to be the United States Attorney for \nthe Eastern District of California. I had the honor of recommending Mr. \nStevens to the President for appointment.\n  Since then, Chuck has succeeded in prosecuting a multitude of \ncrimes--from hate crimes to political corruption to halting health care \nfraud--with distinction and diligence. He was also appointed by United \nStates Attorney General Reno to serve on her advisory committee \nrepresenting United States Attorneys across the nation.\n  The Sacramento-based Eastern District of California is the tenth \nlargest of the Nation's 94 Federal judicial districts. It covers 34 \ncounties with 6 million residents scattered across 87,000 square miles \nfrom Oregon to Los Angeles and Nevada to the coastal range.\n  Members of the legal community and Federal investigative agents give \nMr. Stevens universally high marks for his job performance. He is \ncredited with having ``no ego about himself and his work, unlike most \nlawyers,'' according to Sacramento based Federal Defender Quin Denvir. \nAs anyone who has worked with Chuck knows, his work speaks for itself.\n  Recently, Mr. Stevens' office has handled the weighty responsibility \nof trying the Unabomber case for incidents that occurred in California. \nDue to Mr. Stevens' leadership, Sacramento was considered as a site for \nthe Federal trial against Ted Kacyzinski. It comes as no surprise that \nthis case has been handled without fanfare, but with the utmost \nprofessionalism Mr. Stevens is known for.\n  Chuck has always been ready and able to provide valuable advice on \nsome of the State's most troubling problems. He is one of the most \npractical problem solvers in the criminal justice system.\n  Chuck leaves the United States Attorney's office to form his own law \nfirm in California's capitol with his predecessor, former United States \nAttorney George O'Connell. I am sure this formidable pair will quickly \nmake its mark in the Sacramento legal community.\n  Congratulations, Chuck, on the great opportunities that lie ahead and \nthank you for your outstanding public service to the people of this \nState and this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3383-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3383-S3384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO DR. VARTAN GREGORIAN, PRESIDENT OF BROWN UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow \nRhode Islander and friend, Dr. Vartan Gregorian. On January 6, Dr. \nGregorian announced that he will leave his post as president of Brown \nUniversity in Providence, RI, to become President of the Carnegie Corp. \nAfter 9 years on College Hill, he leaves behind a flourishing campus \nand community. Brown has more than doubled its endowment during his \ntenure. An ambitious capital campaign has raised over $500 million \nunder Dr. Gregorian's leadership, and he has brought 275 new faculty \nmembers to Brown, including 72 new professors.\n  But, Mr. President, the true measure of Vartan Gregorian is not his \nskill as an administrator, booster, and fund raiser, it is his passion \nfor teaching and learning. Even in the midst of the demands of his \npresidency, he has managed to find time to continue to teach, and I \nunderstand that he also continues to serve as an advisor for several \nfortunate students. In this regard, he is unique among his peers, and \nthey recognize his prodigious efforts. James Freedman, president of \nDartmouth, said of Dr. Gregorian, ``He communicates the joy of \nlearning.''\n  Vartan Gregorian's interest in education is not limited to Brown or \nto other institutions of higher learning. He is deeply concerned about \nthe condition of the Nation's public schools. As his colleague, \nTheodore Sizer, said recently, ``No Ivy League president has put his \nshoulder to the wheel of public education more than Vartan Gregorian.''\n  Last month, Dr. Gregorian wrote an article in Parade magazine \nentitled ``10 Things You Can Do to Make Our Schools Better.'' Mr. \nPresident, I commend this article to my colleagues, and I hope all \nSenators read and benefit from Dr. Gregorian's observations, \nparticularly that it is everyone's job to help improve our public \nschools. Mr. President, I ask that Dr. Gregorian's article be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, no matter where he has gone, Vartan Gregorian has \ntaken his appreciation for education and left behind him successful \ninstitutions and inspired students. Brown, Providence, and Rhode Island \nwill miss him, but we know he will stay in close touch and that he will \ncontinue to lead at his new post at the Carnegie Corp. We wish him \nwell.\n  The article follows:\n\n            10 Things You Can Do To Make Our Schools Better\n\n                         (By Vartan Gregorian)\n\n       When I was invited by Parade to write an article about \n     improving our public educational system, I thought for a \n     moment of titling it ``In Praise of Public School Teachers.'' \n     This is because, while our schools badly need reform and \n     upgrading, the responsibility for their problems cannot \n     simply be dumped on our teachers, who by and large are a \n     dedicated, hardworking and undervalued corps of \n     professionals.\n       In fact, even as we acknowledge that our public schools \n     need help, we ought to recognize their achievements and \n     successes along with their shortcomings. They face problems \n     that reflect those of our entire society, and they have to \n     contend with burdens and restrictions that don't affect most \n     of the private and parochial schools with which they\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\n     are sometimes unfairly compared. Nevertheless, our public \n     schools should be better--much better--than they are, and \n     improving them is a job for everyone from parents to college \n     presidents.\n       What are some of the things that you, as a concerned \n     individual, can do right now to better the schools and the \n     educational process in your own area? Here are 10 practical \n     steps you can take in this direction.\n       1. Visit your schools. It's not enough for parents to go \n     once or twice a year for PTA meetings. I'd like to see \n     schools make it easier for parents to visit regularly, even \n     holding weekend and evening open houses for parents who can't \n     get there during their working hours.\n       2. Involve the grandparents. This is especially important \n     in cases of single parents.\n       3. Make the public school a magnet for the community. Hold \n     social and community functions in school buildings.\n       4. Volunteer to help in your school. When rules permit, \n     parents or others should offer to take over nonteaching jobs, \n     such as hall monitors or cafeteria supervisors. Teachers \n     should be treated as professionals whose job is teaching.\n       5. Read to your children. Nothing is more important than \n     this. Start your children with nursery rhymes and go on from \n     there.\n       6. Give every schoolchild a library card. When I was \n     president of the New York Public Library, we arranged with \n     Mayor Ed Koch to give one million library cards to the city's \n     schoolchildren. We found that the majority of them were put \n     to good use. Every town library should issue a card to each \n     child in the community.\n       7. Organize and attend shows that the children put on. They \n     encourage children to work together and also serve as a bond \n     with the community.\n       8. Recognize that too much television has a terrible \n     effect. Consider making television a chore rather than an \n     amusement. Let children watch four hours a day if they want \n     to, but require them to write papers on what they see. My \n     objection to television is not only the time it wastes but \n     also the passivity it brings. It produces isolation, not \n     communication. If children had to critique what they watched, \n     it might even serve to reduce the violence on the screen.\n       9. Let our children go. Schools should take children on \n     expeditions, and not just to a museum or zoo. Business and \n     civic leaders could invite whole classes to visit workplaces \n     for a day--banks, hospitals, universities, factories, police \n     stations, places of worship, government offices.\n       10. Restore the arts as a major element in education. We've \n     made a tremendous mistake in diminishing or eliminating art, \n     music and dance as fluff or frills. The arts like sports, \n     play a vital role in bringing students together and promoting \n     teamwork. Athletics provide stability and a way to release \n     energy. The arts allow children to develop creativity and \n     imagination. The Duke Ellington School in Washington, D.C., \n     has one of the lowest dropout rates anywhere. Ninety percent \n     of the participants in The Boys Choir of Harlem go to college \n     following high school. It's almost impossible to \n     overemphasize the significance of the creative arts in \n     education. Make sure that your own school district recognizes \n     this.\n       An important challenge faced by today's schools that didn't \n     exist in the past is the changed expectations of the public. \n     Today, it is assumed that almost everybody has to go to \n     college. A university education is regarded more as a \n     necessity than as something extraordinary. And we glamorize \n     the past. The 1930s and '40s had high dropout rates too, but \n     fewer people then were deeply concerned about that. American \n     society has changed and raised its expectations of what an \n     educational system should provide.\n       How can we meet those expectations? The core of the \n     teaching process is, and always will be, the teacher. I \n     believe that to become a teacher is to join a noble \n     profession. Teachers have an awesome responsibility: We \n     entrust our sons and daughters to teachers to help prepare \n     them for life. Yet too often teachers are held in low esteem. \n     We pay them less than we pay plumbers and mechanics, and we \n     complain about them more readily. As I have suggested, \n     teachers today are not just teachers--they're called upon to \n     be supervisors, custodians, counselors, hall and cafeteria \n     monitors, law and order officers. Despite all this, thousands \n     and thousands of men and women are public school teachers \n     because they are dedicated people.\n       Are teachers' unions part of the solution? Yes. They are \n     interested in the economic aspects of teaching, and they \n     should be. But they have a moral; professional and historical \n     obligation to help rescue and reform our public schools. The \n     burnout rate among teachers in our nation's public schools is \n     very high. Unions should join in an effort to allow teachers \n     to be retrained, re-educated and immersed in the very \n     disciplines in which they need renewal so they can further \n     the horizons of education and knowledge.\n       There is a great need for strengthening the schools of \n     education in our colleges and universities, so we can raise \n     our standards of teaching. This is something in which college \n     presidents can play a part, for too often the school of \n     education is not regarded as highly as the rest of the \n     university. The arts and science faculties in many \n     universities have no close affinity with the schools of \n     education. Schools of education often stress the technique \n     rather than the substance of the subject matter. We really \n     need to rethink our teacher-education and teacher-retraining \n     programs.\n       I don't agree with those who feel that school vouchers are \n     a panacea for our educational ills. Vouchers may solve \n     individual problems, but not society's. Choice is meaningless \n     for the millions of Americans who live in rural areas with \n     few schools. Choice between bad schools is not useful to city \n     dwellers.\n       Parents who want their children to attend private schools \n     learn quickly that parents don't choose private schools--\n     private schools choose children. I have a drastic solution \n     for a school that is bad: Shut it down. We don't allow a bad \n     hospital to function: why should we allow a bad school?\n       A national consensus exists on the need for school reform. \n     According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken just \n     before the election, four in 10 voters said education should \n     be one of the next President's two top priorities. It ranked \n     evenly with keeping the economy healthy as the No. 1 concern. \n     During the last decade, there has been a nationwide movement \n     for school reform, and there is a major national effort now \n     being made to bring this about--the Annenberg Challenge, \n     which deserves to be widely recognized.\n       The Annenberg Challenge is a metaphor for change in our \n     schools. It was launched in 1993 with a five-year, $500 \n     million grant by Walter Annenberg, our former ambassador to \n     Great Britain. Since it was a 2-for-1 matching challenge, the \n     total amount will reach $1.5 billion, the largest such grant \n     ever made to American public education. The Annenberg \n     Challenge is not for budget relief; it is for enhancement. A \n     full 90 percent must go to teaching and to the classroom, \n     with only 10 percent to be spent on overhead.\n       The Annenberg Challenge operates on a variety of fronts. It \n     includes grants to some of the nation's largest urban school \n     systems, a rural schools initiative and an arts initiative, \n     as well as aid to such organizations as the New American \n     Schools Development Corporation, the Education Commission of \n     the States and the Annenberg Institute of School Reform to \n     carry forward their respective programs.\n       Wherever it has been put in operation, the Annenberg \n     Challenge has required a cooperative effort by the school \n     boards, labor leaders and legislators, as well as corporate \n     and foundation executives. In New York City, Chicago, \n     Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit and other localities where \n     the Challenge now functions, I actually have witnessed the \n     encouraging phenomenon of such groups working together to \n     produce results. As of now, some 4500 schools throughout the \n     country are benefiting from the program. The Annenberg \n     Challenge money itself will not reform the entire system, but \n     it has created laboratories for change.\n       So I am optimistic about the possibilities of improving our \n     schools. As a college president, especially, I know how \n     important it is that we do so, for I do not want to see our \n     universities turn into remedial schools. The superstructure \n     cannot stand without a healthy infrastructure. When the \n     Titanic sinks, you cannot say, ``I was traveling first \n     class.'' We all are our future's guardians, and our future is \n     our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3383-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3384-S3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PATRICK H. WINDHAM\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to \nremark on the outstanding Senate career of my long time science \nstaffer, Pat Windham, whose last day on the Senate Commerce Committee \nstaff will be tomorrow. At the end of this month, Pat will be returning \nto the San Francisco area where he grew up. With his wife Arati and \ntheir cute infant daughter Katie, he will be living within shouting \ndistance of Stanford University, his undergraduate alma mater, and \nacross the bay from the University of California at Berkeley where he \nreceived his masters in public policy.\n  Pat first came to the Senate in the late 1970's for a 2-year stint on \nthe Commerce Committee staff as a congressional fellow in connection \nwith his doctoral program at Berkeley. He returned in 1982, when he \nserved for 2 years as a legislative assistant on my personal staff. \nSince 1984 he has been the Commerce Committee's resident expert on \nscience policy, touching on virtually every science and technology \nissue you can imagine.\n  Early in his career here Pat was deeply involved in the ocean and \ncoastal issues that are so important to the recreational and commercial \nneeds of South Carolinians. On my personal staff he also mastered the \nmyriad complexities of the Nation's nuclear energy policy, acquiring \ndetailed knowledge of nuclear powerplant technology and waste storage \nproblems.\n\n  In his service for the Commerce Committee's Science, Techology, and \nSpace Subcommittee, he has had principal responsibility for overseeing \ntechnology policy and industrial competitiveness. I strongly believe \nthat the key to our national economic strength is the link between \ntechnology and industry. Pat shares this vision, and has made an\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\nenormous difference to me in developing programs that are targeted at \nforging that link. One such program is the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, which facilitates the transfer of manufacturing technology \ndirectly from the laboratory to the operations of the small- and \nmedium-sized firms that carry out the bulk of U.S. manufacturing. \nThanks in large part to Pat's tenacity in working to steadily improve \nthe program, there are now locally run and cost-shared manufacturing \nextension centers in South Carolina and throughout the Nation that \nprovide essential technical assistance to thousands of small \nmanufacturers.\n  Another such program is the Advanced Technology Program [ATP], \noverseen by the National Institute of Science and Technology within the \nDepartment of Commerce. ATP recognizes the intense investor pressure on \nAmerican companies to cut costs and spend limited research dollars on \nprojects with short-term payoffs. It is a peer-reviewed, industry-led \nundertaking that provides matching funds for the development of \nadvanced technologies--in areas like electronics, information \ntechnology, robotics, advanced materials, and biotechnology--that will \nbe central to the formation of new industries in the 21st century. Pat \nspearheaded the creation of ATP in the late 1980's, and now that ATP is \nbeginning to bear fruit, he has fought tirelessly against efforts to \nundercut its effectiveness.\n  During his 17 years of Senate service, Pat has earned wide respect \nand affection from Members of Congress and staff, administration \nofficials, and the scientific community for his commitment to the \ndevelopment of sound science and technology policy. He has an \nextraordinary capacity to digest large amounts of highly technical \ninformation in a number of scientific fields and communicate it clearly \nto decisionmakers. Further, in spite of his intense dedication to \nachieving his legislative goals, Pat has made loyal and enthusiastic \nfriends among allies and adversaries alike.\n  I have no doubt that in his new surroundings Pat will find ways to \nfurther his splendid contributions to our Nation's industry and \ntechnological progress. He has certainly been everything I have wanted, \nand more, as a staff professional, and I thank him for his excellent \nwork.\n  I wish Pat, Arati, and little Katie the best of fortune in all their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3384-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3385-S3386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JACKIE AND RACHEL ROBINSON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this past Tuesday, more than 34,000 \nbaseball fans, including President Clinton, came to Shea Stadium in New \nYork to honor Jackie Robinson on the 50th anniversary of his breaking \nthe color barrier for major league baseball. For all Americans, and \nespecially for African-Americans, Jackie Robinson's historic \nachievement was a source of inspiration, and it forever changed the \nface of our society.\n  Jackie Robinson's legacy is of particular importance to the State of \nConnecticut, because Jackie Robinson's family retired to Stamford in \n1956. Among those in attendance at Shea Stadium on Tuesday were 640 \nchildren from Stamford, who are participants in the Jackie Robinson \nPark of Fame project. The project's goal is to celebrate Jackie \nRobinson's life and instill our young people with courage and \nconfidence.\n  Hopefully, these children will learn about Jackie Robinson's heroic \nfeats on the baseball diamond, and, most of all, the grace with which \nhe overcame the many obstacles that were placed in his path as he \nsought to almost single-handedly integrate our national pastime. More \nimportant, I hope that these children and all Americans will learn \nabout Jackie Robinson's sacrifices away from baseball and his undying \ncommitment to uplifting his race and his country.\n  For anyone who saw Jackie Robinson play, they would probably be \nsurprised to learn that some believe baseball was Jackie's worst sport. \nHe was UCLA's first-ever four-sport letterman, starring in football, \nbasketball, and track, as well as baseball. While there were many Negro \nLeague players who were talented enough to play in the major leagues, \nJackie Robinson was a special person whose intelligence, character, and \nathleticism uniquely qualified him to become major league baseball's \nfirst African-American player.\n  When Brooklyn Dodgers' President Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson \nto break baseball's color line, Jackie had to agree that, for two full \nseasons, he would turn the other cheek no matter what abuse was \ndirected at him by opposing players and fans. Jackie Robinson withstood \na seemingly endless barrage of verbal, physical, and psychological \nassaults and was still able to excel in nearly every facet of the game \nwith an uncommon dignity. When Robinson would slide into second base \nwith an easy double, the opposing shortstop would sometimes slam Jackie \nin the face with his glove so hard that you could hear it in the \ndugout. In response, Jackie Robinson would simply stand up, dust \nhimself off, and then steal third on the very next pitch.\n  Jackie Robinson's quiet humility and devotion to principle stand in \nsharp contrast to today's pro athletes who seem more interested in \ncorporate sponsorships and performance bonuses in their multimillion \ndollar contracts than in giving back to their communities. For Jackie \nRobinson, baseball was about more than individual statistics and \nlucrative contracts. It was about breaking down barriers and instilling \nothers with a sense of hope.\n  Jackie Robinson's silence did not last forever, and his actions after \nretiring from baseball are often overlooked but equally deserving of \npraise. Many would argue that, by integrating baseball, Jackie Robinson \nhad done more for the cause of racial justice than any other individual \nof that era. But Jackie Robinson did not view his baseball career as \nthe peak of his life, and his greatest contributions to American \nsociety may have come after his retirement.\n  Whereas his fame and wealth would have allowed him to enjoy a very \ncomfortable retirement, Jackie Robinson remained committed to the fight \nagainst racism and social injustice until his death. He helped to \nestablish the Freedom National Bank in Harlem, which provided loans to \nAfrican-Americans trying to start their own businesses. He also founded \nhis own construction company which built housing for low-income \nfamilies in New York.\n  Jackie Robinson was also active politically. He spoke throughout the \ncountry in support of civil rights, participated in protest marches, \nand raised large sums of money for civil rights organizations. He also \nworked actively for several politicians who promoted the cause of \nracial equality.\n  Despite all the sacrifices in his life, Jackie Robinson always \nmaintained that there was more work to be done. Hence, he entitled his \nautobiography, ``I Never Had It Made.'' He wrote, ``I am grateful for \nall the breaks and honors and opportunities I've had, but I always \nbelieve I won't have it made until the humblest black kid in the most \nremote backwoods of America has it made.''\n  Unfortunately, 50 years after the fall of baseball's color barrier \nand 25 years after Jackie Robinson's death, America still has a long \nway to go if it hopes to ever meet Jackie Robinson's vision of what \nAmerica should be. But while we still have not evolved into a society \nthat is completely free from prejudice and social injustice, there are \ncountless visible signs of Jackie Robinson's impact on this country.\n  Last week, we all witnessed a true testament to Jackie Robinson's \nlegacy as we watched 21-year-old Tiger Woods become the first person of \ncolor to win the Masters--golf's most prestigious tournament. But \nperhaps the most encouraging aspect of Tiger Woods' performance came \nduring his acceptance speech. Tiger Woods specifically credited Lee \nElder, Charlie Sifford, and Teddy Rhodes, the first African-Americans \nto ever compete at Augusta, for opening doors for him. He acknowledged \nthat, without the sacrifices of trailblazers like these men and Jackie \nRobinson, very few of today's minority athletes would know the success \nthat they have grown accustomed to. This is why we must celebrate the \nachievements of Jackie Robinson and other pioneers, because the lessons \nthat they taught us are as relevant today as they were decades ago, and \nwe must heed their words and actions or we will cease to be a \nprogressive society.\n  Tuesday night's event at Shea Stadium had many special moments, but\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\nthe most touching came when Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, spoke in \nhonor of her husband, and the audience gave her the warm ovation that \nshe so richly deserved. Her sacrifices were as great as her husband's, \nand too often we forget that Jackie Robinson, who was described as the \nloneliest man in sports, endured and prevailed only with the support of \nhis partner Rachel, who was always by his side.\n  Rachel Robinson sacrificed her own personal aspirations during \nJackie's playing career and dedicated herself to raising their children \nand supporting her husband. But upon their retirement to Connecticut, \nshe earned her master's degree in psychiatric nursing at Yale. She \nlater operated a day clinic for acutely ill psychiatric patients, \ntaught at Yale's School of Nursing, and served as director of nursing \nfor the Connecticut Mental Health Center. Despite her own personal \nsuccess, Rachel Robinson again displayed tremendous selflessness after \nJackie's death in 1972.\n  Upon his passing, it would have been easy for Rachel Robinson to \ncontinue the pursuit of her own career, but instead she gave up her \nmedical career and dedicated her life to preserving the legacy of her \nhusband. In 1973, she formed the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which has \nawarded more than 450 college scholarships to minority and \ndisadvantaged students who have exhibited leadership potential and \nshown a commitment to community service. Throughout his life, Jackie \nRobinson always stressed the importance of education, and for a man \nwhose life was dedicated to creating opportunities for others, \nproviding young adults the chance to go to college is perhaps the most \nfitting tribute one could ever pay to this great man. I am proud to say \nthat Rachel Robinson still resides in my home State of Connecticut, and \nwe are truly fortunate to call her one of our own.\n  While many glorious words have been spoken in honor of Jackie \nRobinson, I truly believe that the greatest tribute that we could ever \npay to this man would be through our actions. As Rachel Robinson \neloquently said, ``This anniversary * * * has given us an opportunity \nto reassess the challenges of the present. It is my passionate hope \nthat we can take this reawakened feeling of unity and use it as a \ndriving force so that each of us can recommit to equality of \nopportunity for all Americans.'' I hope that America will listen to the \nwords of Rachel Robinson and work together to fulfill Jackie's and her \ndream.\n  America is a better place because of Jackie and Rachel Robinson, and \nI want to thank both of them for their courage and sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3385-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BABY TALK\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngroup of citizens in Decatur, IL, who noticed a serious problem in \ntheir community, banded together to develop a solution to this problem, \nand then saw this practical solution through with a strong sense of \ncommitment and compassion.\n  All over this country, communities like Decatur are responding to the \nrealization that the experiences of the earliest years of life have a \npowerful influence on how human beings develop. Research indicates that \nyoung children are developing brain patterns which will affect \neverything they do for the rest of their lives. The way they process \ninformation, the way they relate to other people, their abilities in \nevery domain--these important human functions are being written on the \nminds of children at a time in their lives when basic needs often go \nunmet. We often realize the importance of this time only when it is too \nlate to go back and fill in the gaps--when these children fail in \nschool or commit a crime or become a burden to society.\n  The people of Decatur, IL realized that the most important resource \nevery child must have is a loving adult who cares for them, understands \ntheir needs, and makes that child a priority. How can we encourage \nparents to nurture their own children? How can we take advantage of \nthis wonderful window of opportunity for young children by making sure \nthey are loved and encouraged to develop?\n  My friends in Decatur pondered these very questions in 1986 and the \nresult is Baby Talk. Baby Talk is a community collaboration that \nreaches out to all parents of very young children and gives them the \nsupport that they need. This project is a joint effort of schools, \nhospitals, libraries, health clinics, Head Start, literacy projects, \nand local government. Baby Talk establishes a relationship with every \nfamily who has a newborn child in order to offer encouragement and \nsupport for the most important task they will ever undertake--raising a \nchild.\n  Baby Talk delivers programs where parents and children already are. \nIn this way, Baby Talk reaches the entire population of child raising \nfamilies casting a net of support over the community. Every parent of a \nchild born in one of Decatur's two hospitals, receives a personal visit \nfrom Baby Talk to learn about their newborn's abilities and needs. \nParents receive a book and advice about how to read aloud with their \nchild. They also receive a magnet with the Baby Talk telephone number \nto call for assistance.\n  Information about predictable challenges and encouragement for \nparents are provided at child clinics and through letters sent to \nfamilies every 2 to 3 months through the child's first 3 years. ``Baby \nTalk Times'' and ``Lapsit'' groups meet weekly at many locations where \nparents and children play, sing, read books, and share their challenges \nand achievements.\n  Parents who did not finish high school participate in Baby Talk's \nEven Start program where comprehensive family literacy programming is \noffered at the health department and Head Start.\n  Baby Talk makes 4,000 contacts monthly with parents and children of \ndifferent backgrounds and income levels. Fortunately, this service does \nnot exist only in Decatur. Professionals from 30 States and Canada have \nreceived training and materials from the Baby Talk organization to \nserve families in their communities.\n  Baby Talk has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for \nmeeting Goal One of the America 2000 Strategy: ``That by the year 2000, \nall children will start school ready to learn.''\n  Recently, Baby Talk celebrated its 10th anniversary with the \nannouncement that it has served the families of 20,000 babies. I would \nspecifically like to commend the efforts of Claudia Quigg who was the \ninitial pioneer of this effort and currently acts as Baby Talk's \nexecutive director. Through the efforts of Ms. Quigg and many other \ndedicated Baby Talk staff members, the city of Decatur is investing in \nits future and putting into practice their belief that a stitch in time \nsaves nine.\n  We are looking forward to the years ahead when thousands of Baby Talk \nchildren grow up to be caring, successful, and productive citizens. I \npresent Baby Talk as an example of what can be accomplished when a \ncommunity pulls together and stays committed to an important goal. I am \nvery proud to have this organization performing their good works in my \nState and I hope others can learn from the accomplishments that Baby \nTalk has had in Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/17/senate-section/article/S3386-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
