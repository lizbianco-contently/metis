Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on one of \nthe amendments that will be considered this morning, an amendment by \nSenator Craig of Idaho.\n  Senator Craig is an outstanding Member of this body and one of my \nclosest friends, but I reluctantly will oppose the amendment he \noffered. I think he knows that I opposed the President's decision to \ndeploy U.S. Armed Forces to Bosnia in 1995. I continue to have major \nproblems with the situation there and questions about what the end game \nis. But I don't look at Bosnia in a theoretical sense only or without \nconsidering the history of that part of the world.\n  I have traveled to Brussels to meet with all of our NATO allies and \ndiscuss the situation in Bosnia. I spent the last 4th of July in \nBosnia, Sarajevo, and Tuzla. I have looked at the situation firsthand. \nI spent many hours with administration officials and outside experts \ndiscussing the situation in Bosnia. I have grave concerns about the \nadministration's completely open-ended commitment to remain in Bosnia. \nWe were solemnly given dates and unequivocal assurances that U.S. \ntroops would be out by December 1996. They weren't. Then it was July \n1998. The President intends not to meet that date. The assurances we \nwere given were wrong.\n  The fact that the administration has been so often wrong raises \nquestions about their overall policy. Do we want peace there? Yes. Have \nwe been willing to make a commitment? Yes. But the question is, How \nmuch, how long, and for what? Is the situation under control there? \nWhat is happening in Kosovo? Did the administration turn a blind eye \nand ignore that problem and only now realize the ramifications, the \nimplications, that Kosovo has in the region?\n  There has been some progress in Bosnia. Many time lines and the \nagreements that were supposed to have been met, however, have not been \nmet. We do need to continue to move forward and to encourage peace, \ndemocracy and freedom--not fighting and killing--in that part of the \nworld.\n  But the U.S. taxpayers have already spent some $8 billion in Bosnia \nsince December of 1995. Our European allies have been reluctant to \nshoulder more of the burden. There are even credible reports that a \nFrench military officer tipped off the most notorious war criminal and \nhelped him avoid apprehension. Basically, they say, You are the world \nleader; without you, it won't be done. We assume a very serious \nresponsibility and maybe a certain degree of pride in that. But I think \nmore needs to be done by our European allies and there needs to be a \nplan, some way of dealing with this problem, just like there should be \na long-term plan in dealing with Saddam Hussein. There is no plan \nthere, no plan to find a way to remove Saddam Hussein so the people in \nIraq can be free.\n  The pattern begins to be clear. I have been very careful as majority \nleader to try to rise above politics or partisan politics. I have taken \na pounding from some sources for that. I did support the Chemical \nWeapons Treaty and I do support NATO. But there is a limit to how far I \nwill go. I will not support the administration unconditionally--\nparticularly if there is no policy, no clear plan. I think that is the \ncase in Iraq, where the policy of containment is not working. So what \nis next? Quite frankly, it falls to the Congress to try to say: How \nabout this? Would you consider that? Develop a plan to do something, \nanything. We are prepared to do that if we have to because of the \nabsence of action by the Administration.\n  For all those reasons, I am concerned about the administration's \npolicy in Bosnia. This issue should be addressed by the Senate on \nmerits later on this year in the appropriations process. But we should \nnot use it as a way to delay the decision to enlarge NATO.\n  NATO enlargement is the right thing to do. But it should rise and \nfall on its own merits. We should not allow it to tangle up our \ndecision into issues like Bosnia. I agree with Senator Craig's \nconcerns, but I don't think this is the place to have the debate or \naction based on what may or may not be the future in Bosnia to \ndetermine what would happen in NATO. We should not make the legitimate \naspirations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic subject to our \ndifferences with the executive branch on Bosnia policy. I hope the \nSenate will defeat this amendment and move to conclusion and pass NATO \nenlargement.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3810-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the Craig amendment, No. 2316, with the time \nuntil 12 noon to be equally divided.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday I put before the Senate a very \nstraightforward amendment to our resolution of ratification that speaks \nto the responsibility of the President as it relates to getting \nauthorization for the continued mission of our U.S. military in Bosnia. \nI say that in the context of us debating NATO expansion because I think \nit is appropriate. It is appropriate because of the way this President \nhas characterized the need to expand NATO from his perspective. He \nspeaks about it no longer as just a defense mechanism for Europe; he \nspeaks of it as a mechanism for the purpose of peacekeeping.\n  We have heard several of our colleagues come to the floor in the last \ngood number of days as we have debated this issue, frustrated by what \nwill be the role of a new NATO, and how should we define that--at least \nfrom our understanding--as we move for the purpose of ratification, \nupholding our constitutional responsibilities, which are paramount on \nthis issue.\n  I am one of those Senators who has said very openly that I don't \nbelieve we ought to be expanding NATO at this time. We ought to be \nencouraging the European Community to reach out to those nations that \nhave now emerged from behind the fallen Iron Curtain--reach out to them \nin an economic way, bringing them into the economic union, creating \ngreater economic stability rather than, if you will, offering them the \nolive branch of inclusion into NATO as some coming of age process, and \nturning to the United States and, in essence, saying, now you have to \npay for it or you have to play a greater role--especially when I don't \nthink any of us sense the dramatic urgency of an expanded defensive \nmission for the whole of a freer Europe. That strength would come \nthrough the economic growth of those countries and the greater strength \nof their democracies because of the economic growth. Some of us have \nalso expressed concern about, of course, Russia and how it feels as we \ntend to expand a defensive peacekeeping mechanism toward them, and not \nbeing willing to focus as much as we should on assisting, ensuring the \ndemocratic processes in Russia itself.\n  As a result of that, I think it is tremendously important that we \ncause this administration to define what its intent is. As you know, \nMr. President, we are now in a period of time in Bosnia where we are \noperating without authorization from Congress. Costs are mounting in a \ntremendous way, and as\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\na result of that, we have no end game in mind, no mission intent at \nthis moment.\n  My amendment is clearly straightforward. It is something the \nPresident should have done some time ago. But, of course, when he seeks \nauthorization, then he can't keep diverting money out from under the \ndefense system itself to fund an unending operation in Bosnia, or at \nleast unending by his current definition.\n  So what I am saying is really very straightforward: Mr. President, as \nyou move forward with your commitment to an expanded NATO, come to us \nand ask for an authorization and ask for a definition, if you will, in \ncooperation with us on the role in Bosnia. I think this becomes \nincreasingly important. Colleagues from the other side of this issue \nhave said I am amending the treaty. Well, we all know that is not true. \nWhat we are talking about today is a resolution of ratification. I am \nputting within that resolution--if my amendment were to become part of \nit by this process--a condition which the President would have to \nrespond to prior to being able to move forward with the blessings of \nCongress in a confirmation of the resolution of ratification. That is \nthe intent of my amendment. It is very straightforward, clear, and it \nis quite simple. I don't believe it is convoluted or confusing in any \nsense of the words. Maybe there are those who don't want the President \nto seek authorization. But I can't imagine any of us who are willing to \nfund and participate in putting the men and women of the U.S. armed \nservices in harm's way--that we don't, for some reason, define how that \nall ought to be. It is with that intent that we bring forward this \namendment.\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. It would throw \nreal doubt and uncertainty into the NATO ratification process by \nlinking the completion of that process to a subsequent action of \nCongress, specifically authorizing continued deployment of our forces \nin Bosnia. It is that doubt, that uncertainty, that complication, that \nambiguity, creating an additional step before the ratification process \nis completed, that this amendment would create.\n  We simply should not do that, no matter how we feel on the Bosnia \nissue. I must tell my good friend from Idaho that I have been one who \nhas been very cautious about our continuing to be in Bosnia. I have \nindeed offered and have had amendments accepted on this floor \nreflecting that caution. We can stop, should we choose, our presence in \nBosnia at any time we want through the power of the purse. We are not \nlacking in tools to control our participation in the NATO operation in \nBosnia. We have those tools. We have used those tools. We may not have \nused them to the extent that my good friend or I would have liked, but \nwe have used them. We used them in the authorization bill last year. We \nused them in the appropriations bill last year. We have a supplemental \nappropriation right now that we have recently passed for our troops in \nBosnia. People who opposed that continuance or wanted to attach \nadditional conditions to that continuation could have attached those \nconditions, or sought to attach those conditions, in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I offered an amendment that was accepted on the \nsupplemental appropriation bill, which required certain milestones that \nwe say are our goals for Bosnia, requiring that those milestones be \npresented to NATO so that we could have NATO consideration of \nmilestones which would lead us to exit Bosnia which would allow us to \nremove our combat forces from Bosnia. We have the tools.\n\n  I understand linking things where it is necessary in order to gain \nfor us a power we might not have otherwise. I could understand that. \nBut where we have the power of the purse and could exercise that power \nto control the presence of combat forces in Bosnia, it seems to me that \nwe are creating a needless ambiguity, a needless uncertainty, that we \nare throwing a monkey wrench into the ratification process by creating \na subsequent step after the Senate votes on ratification. It is \ncreating that doubt. It is the uncertainty. If we voted to ratify now, \nthe instruments of ratification will not be deposited until the \nCongress takes an additional step. Again, if that were the only way of \nobtaining a power, then it would seem to me that there might be some \nargument for it despite the confusion. But where we have the power of \nthe purse, we know how to exercise it. We have exercised it relative to \nBosnia, not only in the supplemental but in the prior authorization and \nappropriations bills of defense. One other element is that another \ndefense authorization will be coming to the floor hopefully in the next \nfew weeks. We have another opportunity to exercise the power of the \npurse within the next month relative to our forces in Bosnia.\n  So this is not only confusing and I think harmful in that regard, \nintroducing really a monkey wrench into a process where we already have \nplenty of tools to exercise our will, it is needlessly being done. The \npower of the purse is one of the most important powers this Congress \nhas, and this Congress has, when it has chosen, exercised that power. \nWe can exercise it again.\n  Just one final comment about this. In the supplemental appropriations \nbill, the amendment which I offered required that the President take to \nNATO the so-called benchmarks that were detailed in the President's \npresentation to the Congress. Last year we told the President in our \nappropriations bill that we want an exit strategy; we want to phase out \nAmerican presence in Bosnia; we want to put more responsibility on the \nEuropeans. By the way, I share those sentiments. I think the Europeans \nshould take more responsibility and should take over that operation \nmuch more fully, and we should find a way to exit promptly in a \nreasonable period of time, removing our combat forces and instead \nsupporting the operations with logistics and intelligence and certain \nother support. But that we should try to find a path for the removal of \nour combat forces from Bosnia. We have stretched our forces too many \nplaces around the world.\n  My amendment on the supplemental bill, which is presently in \nconference, tells the President to enter into an agreement with NATO on \nthe benchmarks which he detailed in the exit strategy and which he \npresented to us as required by the authorization and appropriations.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated because of the confusion that \nit would create relative to ratification, the uncertainty that it would \ncreate, the additional step, the roadblock that would be placed in the \nway of this process being completed and mainly, though, because it does \nall that, it does that damage unnecessarily. We have the power of the \npurse. We will have the opportunity to exercise that again within the \nnext month relative to Bosnia should this body choose to do so.\n  For those reasons, I hope my friend's amendment is defeated and that \nwe ratify this treaty, or not, but that we not say with our right hand \nwe are going to ratify it and then with the left hand say but that \nprocess cannot be completed until Congress takes an additional step \nrelative to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left to the opponents of this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder how much time the Senator from Idaho has \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The floor manager is not here. I would like to begin, and \nyield myself on the general issue of NATO, 5 minutes. I want to consult \nfor one moment before I do that.\n  Mr. President, unless my friend from Idaho wants to give himself time \nat this point, I yield myself an additional 5 minutes on the underlying \nNATO ratification.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak today about three aspects of NATO \nenlargement. First, I want to focus on the stabilizing effect that NATO \nhas had and that an enlarged NATO will continue to have on Europe; \nsecond I want to discuss the impact that NATO enlargement would have on \nRussia; and finally, I want to examine the common values that lie at \nthe heart of the question before us.\n  It will come as no surprise, based upon my floor speech on NATO \nenlargement that I gave on March 19, that I favor NATO enlargement. I \nam satisfied that it will help to enhance\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\nstability on the European continent, that it will not isolate Russia, \nand that the common values that undergird the Alliance are treasured in \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\n\n                           European Stability\n\n  Mr. President, Europe has experienced military conflict down through \nthe ages. Indeed, it has been a constant spawning ground for war. The \nsecurity of the United States is inextricably linked to that of Europe \nby a common heritage and shared values. Because of those links, twice \nthis century, America has shed blood and treasure in major wars in \nEurope.\n  In my view, one of the two major accomplishments of NATO, the first \nbeing deterring the former Soviet Union, has been its serving as a \nbalance wheel to keep the peace in Western Europe. The NATO Alliance \nhas enabled Europe to experience peace for almost fifty years.\n  One of my home-town newspapers, the Detroit Free Press put it well \nwhen it said:\n\n       It (NATO) has been a vital means of maintaining a stable \n     balance between Germany and its neighbors. That was a major \n     unavowed purpose of NATO in the years after World War II. To \n     manage Germany's role in Europe may have been a secondary \n     purpose, but it was important in providing stability while \n     Europe evolved toward unity and reconciliation. Preventing a \n     recurrence of Europe's chronic civil wars is an important \n     NATO function.\n\n  NATO has helped keep the peace in many ways.\n  As a defensive Alliance, one of NATO's major strengths is that member \nnations are able to pool their complementary military assets rather \nthan developing totally separate and redundant military capabilities.\n  This pooling of assets allowed the Alliance to present a strong and \nunited front to deter aggression from the Soviet Union. This pooling of \nassets precluded the need for any one European NATO nation to build up \nits own military arsenal of a type that would threaten its neighbors \nand destabilize the continent.\n  The Alliance has also had a moderating influence on its member \nnations and has served to prevent the inevitable frictions that arise \namong nation states from erupting into armed conflict. When \nRepresentatives and military officers of different nations meet and \nwork together on a daily basis in Brussels and elsewhere, disagreements \namong those nations are more likely to be subordinated to common \ndefense requirements. For instance, Europe is more secure with Greece \nand Turkey as members of the NATO Alliance than if one or both of them \nwere not members.\n  The prospect of NATO membership has already had a moderating \ninfluence on events in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. They are \nall downsizing and reorganizing their militaries, thus avoiding the \nexpenditure of scarce resources that are needed for economic \ndevelopment. If rejected for NATO membership, they will almost surely \nrenationalize their approach to defense, with potentially destabilizing \nimpacts on their neighbors and on their neighborhood.\n  The Alliance contributes to European stability in a number of other \nways.\n  NATO's military might has the potential for application in so-called \n``out-of-area'' conflicts, but which affect stability in Europe. For \nexample, NATO's air bombing of Bosnian Serb targets served to bring the \nwarring parties to the negotiating table and led to the Dayton Peace \naccords. NATO then led a military mission to implement the military \naspects of the Dayton accords and to provide a secure environment for \nimplementation of the civilian aspects of the accords.\n  This action by the Alliance ended a conflict that posed a real threat \nto European stability and demonstrated a willingness of Alliance \nmembers to take action before its members were drawn into the conflict. \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have all provided military \nforces to the NATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia, and Hungary has \nprovided facilities for logistic support and training for United States \nand allied forces in support of that same effort in Bosnia.\n  The Bosnian conflict demonstrates that NATO provides the \nmultinational mechanism that we and our European allies need to deal \nwith small conflicts that threaten to spread and involve all of Europe. \nThe addition of these three new members will strengthen NATO's \ncapability to deal with such threats.\n  NATO's action in Bosnia could pave the way for Alliance action if the \nworld's energy supplies were threatened in the future as they were in \n1991 in the Persian Gulf. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have \npromised military support in the event that the United States has to \nuse force to ensure the destruction or rendering harmless of Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction. This leads me to believe that enlargement \nof the Alliance will increase support for our actions in pursuit of our \nnational interests in other regions either in the form of formal \nAlliance action or coalitions of the willing.\n  This type of cooperation and common action is already taking place in \nsituations that, while not representing direct aggression against a \nNATO member nation, are examples of the new threats we face. In the \narea of counter-proliferation, at NATO's January 1994 Summit, Heads of \nState and Government formally acknowledged the security threat posed by \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and associated \ndelivery means. NATO noted that this threat was not confined to nations \nor non-state actors, such as terrorists, on the periphery of the \nAlliance and specifically cited the cases of Iraq and North Korea. \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can contribute to NATO action in \nthis matter by political and diplomatic means and, in the defense area, \nby the sharing of intelligence and detection technology.\n  Finally, with respect to European stability, the very prospect of \nNATO membership has also produced significant positive results in \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in terms of resolution of border \ndisputes and relations with their neighbors, civilian control of their \nmilitaries, and protection of minority rights and advancement of the \nrule of law. The September 1995 NATO Study on Enlargement, while noting \nthe there was no rigid criteria for inviting new members to join the \nAlliance, did state that possible new member states would be expected \nto take these positive actions.\n  Poland has signed friendship agreements with all seven of its \nneighbors--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Slovakia, the Czech \nRepublic and Germany. Poland has reached out to its neighbors and has \ncreated one joint peacekeeping battalion with Lithuania and another \nwith Ukraine. Poland's laws now subordinates the Chief of General Staff \nto the Minister of Defense and shifts control of the budget, planning \nand military intelligence from the General Staff to the Defense \nMinistry. Poland's press is free and the government maintains a strong \nrecord in support of basic human rights. It has held six fully free and \nfair elections at various levels since the fall of communism in 1989.\n  Hungary concluded Basic Treaties on Understanding, Cooperation, and \nGood-Neighborliness with Slovakia and Romania in 1996. Hungary has \nentered into a Bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement with Slovenia in \n1996 and has signed bilateral cooperation agreements with Ukraine \ndealing with organized crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking. It has \ngood relations with all its neighbors. Hungary has legislative and \nconstitutional mechanisms in place to guarantee extensive oversight of \nthe military by the Defense Ministry and by the parliament. Hungary \nupholds Western standards on human rights, freedom of expression, the \nrule of law, checks and balances among branches of government, and an \nindependent judiciary.\n  The Czech Republic now enjoys very good relations with all of its \nneighbors and has no border dispute with any country. The Czech \nRepublic signed a formal reconciliation pact with Germany in January \n1997. Under the Czech Constitution, the President is Commander-in-Chief \nand governmental authority is exercised through a civilian Minister of \nDefense. The Czech people enjoy free speech, free assembly and a free \npress. The Czech Constitution guarantees human rights and provides for \nan independent judiciary.\n  In sum, NATO and its enlargement enhance the stability of Europe in \nmany ways: it fosters good relations among its members; avoids the \nnationalization of members' defense; prevents frictions among its \nmembers from erupting into conflict; provides a mechanism to deal with \nsmall conflicts in Europe before they spread; provides\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\na mechanism to address threats outside of Europe but which could affect \nEurope and the United States, including new threats, such as the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and, indeed, just the \nprospect of membership has served as a moderating influence in Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic to encourage settlement of border \ndisputes, civilian control of their militaries, and the advancement of \nthe rule of law.\n\n\n                            Impact on Russia\n\n  But what about the impact on Russia?\n  Mr. President, how we enlarge NATO is critically important, along \nwith whether we enlarge NATO, since we do not want to isolate Russia \nand contribute thereby to the very instability that NATO enlargement is \naimed at deterring.\n  At the Armed Services Committee's first hearing on NATO enlargement \non April 23, 1997, more than a year ago, at which Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified, I \nstated, with specific reference to Russia, that I believe that we must \ndo everything we reasonably can to enlarge NATO in a way that \ncontributes to greater, rather than less, stability in Europe.\n  The Administration has worked hard and worked successfully to do just \nthat. On May 27, 1997, subsequent to NATO's decision to expand, Russian \nPresident Boris Yeltsin, President Clinton and leaders of the other \nNATO countries signed the ``Founding Act on Mutual Relations, \nCooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation.'' The \nsecond paragraph of the Founding Act succinctly states the relationship \nbetween NATO and Russia and the goal of the Act. It reads as follows:\n\n       NATO and Russia do not consider each other as adversaries. \n     They share the goal of overcoming the vestiges of earlier \n     confrontation and competition and of strengthening mutual \n     trust and cooperation. The present Act reaffirms their \n     determination to give concrete substance to our shared \n     commitment to a stable, peaceful and undivided Europe, whole \n     and free, to the benefit of all its peoples. By making this \n     commitment at the highest political level, we mark the \n     beginning of a fundamentally new relationship between NATO \n     and Russia. They intend to develop, on the basis of common \n     interest, reciprocity and transparency a strong, stable and \n     enduring partnership.\n\n  As part of the Founding Act, the NATO member nations reiterated that \n``they have no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear \nweapons on the territory of new members.'' NATO also reiterated that \n``in the current and foreseeable security environment, the Alliance \nwill carry out its collective defense and other missions by ensuring \nthe necessary interoperability, integration, and capability for \nreinforcement rather than by additional permanent stationing of \nsubstantial combat forces.''\n  The Founding Act sets up a NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council to \n``provide a mechanism for consultations, coordination, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, where appropriate, for joint decisions and \njoint action with respect to security issues of common concern.''\n  It is surely noteworthy that the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the \nPermanent Joint Council it created were adopted after NATO's decision \nto enlarge. The Act represents both NATO's acknowledgment of Russia's \nimportant position and Russia's acceptance of NATO's enlargement.\n  Mr. President, subsequent to NATO's decision to invite Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic to join the Alliance, Marshal Igor \nSergeyev, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation, wrote an \narticle entitled ``We are not adversaries, we are partners,'' for the \nSpring 1998 edition of the NATO Review. It is significant that he even \nwrote an article for the NATO publication. Even more importantly, in \nthat article, Marshal Sergeyev wrote the following:\n\n       It is my profound conviction that, in spite of the problems \n     that exist, the NATO-Russia Founding Act provides extensive \n     opportunities for creating an atmosphere of trust. This can \n     facilitate settling existing differences in our relations as \n     well as establishing efficient and productive machinery for \n     cooperation between the military establishments of Russia and \n     NATO member states. Only in this way can we complete the \n     common task of creating a community of free and democratic \n     states from Vancouver to Vladivostok.\n\n  Again, the signal from Russian Defense Minister Sergeyev is \nacceptance and cooperation with NATO, not hostility and withdrawal.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton and the other NATO leaders are to be \ncommended for the manner in which they have sought to carry out NATO \nenlargement in a way that minimizes any possible negative reaction in \nRussia.\n  Some of the strongest evidence of the success of their efforts is \nthat Russia ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in November 1997, \nfour months after NATO invited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nto join the Alliance. Some of the most recent evidence of the success \nof their efforts is that just two weeks ago Russian President Boris \nYeltsin resubmitted the START II Treaty to the Russian parliament for \nratification. In other words, on the eve of Senate action on the \nResolution of ratification of NATO enlargement, President Yeltsin took \na critical step towards continuing the mutual reduction of nuclear arms \nby the United States and Russia.\n\n  The clear message was--``we know NATO is about to enlarge and we are \nprepared to ratify START II anyway.'' The message wasn't--``we will \nwithhold acting on START II until we see what you do about NATO \nenlargement,'' or that--``we won't proceed to ratify START II in this \nenvironment.''\n  Beyond the clear evidence of the acceptance of NATO enlargement by \nthe Russian leadership, there is some evidence of support among the \nRussian people. A Gallup poll conducted in Moscow and released in March \nrevealed that 57 percent of Muscovites supported the Czech Republic's \nbid to join NATO, 54 percent supported Hungary's admission, and 53 \npercent said Poland should be allowed to join NATO. More than a quarter \nof those polled had no views on the subject.\n  Finally, I would note that United States and Russian troops are \nserving side-by-side in Bosnia, are conducting joint patrols, and, \nbased upon my personal conversations and observations, have developed \nan appreciation for each other's soldierly skills and a comraderie that \nbenefits both our nations. On March 18, Russian Foreign Minister \nPrimakov stated that if the U.N. Security Council passes the \nappropriate resolution, ``Russia will be ready to take part in this \noperation.'' There hasn't been even the slightest hint by any official \nin the Russian government or parliament that ratification of NATO \nenlargement by the United States Senate or the parliaments of our NATO \nallies would threaten the continued participation of Russian troops in \nthe NATO-led peace operation in Bosnia.\n\n  Mr. President, we should care about our relationship with Russia and \nwe do. Other countries also have a great interest in their relationship \nwith Russia. That why it is so important to note that thus far all the \nParliaments of our NATO European allies that have taken up the issue \nhave overwhelming ratified NATO enlargement. The three countries--\nDenmark, Norway, and Germany--are much closer geographically to Russia \nthan we are. As a result, they are more likely to feel the impact of a \nreversal of democratization in Russia, and they are very likely to pay \ngreat attention to Russian sensitivities. Based upon the voting margins \nin those countries--the Danish Parliament voted 97 to 17; the German \nBundestag voted 553 to 37 and the vote in the Bundesrat was unanimous; \nand Norway's Storting voted 151 to 9--it appears that the parliaments \nin those countries are satisfied that NATO enlargement will not play \ninto the hands of anti-Western forces in Russia or otherwise negatively \nimpact relations with Russia.\n\n\n                             Shared Values\n\n  Mr. President, that brings me to the last subject I want to discuss \nbriefly today--shared values.\n  The Preamble to the NATO Treaty expresses the reasons why the United \nStates and its partner nations decided to create NATO. It states in \npart that ``They are determined to safeguard the freedom, common \nheritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles \nof democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.''\n  Mr. President, those are words that resonate very well with all \nSenators, indeed with all Americans. How much those words--democracy, \nindividual liberty and the rule of law--must mean to the people of \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic! During the twentieth century, \nthose countries have faced\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\nfirst Nazi aggression and then communist oppression. How much it means \nto their peoples to be joining an organization that is dedicated to \nsafeguarding their freedom, common heritage and civilizations.\n  Mr. President, I and those of my generation remember when the Red \nArmy moved in and crushed the Hungarian freedom fighters in 1956. Many \nHungarian refugees fled to my home state and were present when we \ngreeted Cardinal Mindszenty in Detroit after his release from the \nUnited States Embassy in Budapest in 1971, where he had spent more than \n15 years. More recently, we watched with admiration as the Solidarity-\nled movement of Lech Walesa guided Poland to democracy. Many Polish-\nAmerican families and indeed all of us took great pride in Solidarity's \nsuccess in helping to bring down the Soviet Empire. In Czechoslovakia, \nformer dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, who was named President in \nDecember 1989, guided first Czechoslovakia and then, after the split, \nthe Czech Republic with a steady hand ever since. My wife Barbara and I \nwere visiting Prague after Vaclav Havel had been elected but before he \nassumed the office of the presidency. We recall with admiration and \ndraw inspiration from the memory of the people of Prague massing to \nensure that the election results were upheld and how they escorted \nVaclav Havel to the castle where he would assume his office. Some of \nthe most powerful blows that eventually demolished the Berlin wall were \nstruck by the brave people of these three nations. They laid their \nlives on the line to bring down the Soviet empire and to promote \ndemocratic values. I am confident that they, having experienced tyranny \nfirst hand, can be counted on to do what is necessary to protect \nfreedom recently regained.\n  Mr. President, President Havel put it this way:\n\n       Our wish to become a NATO member grows out of a desire to \n     shoulder some responsibility for the general state of affairs \n     on our continent. We don't want to take without giving. We \n     want an active role in the defense of European peace and \n     democracy. Too often, we have had direct experience of where \n     indifference to the fate of others can lead, and we are \n     determined not to succumb to that kind of indifference \n     ourselves.\n\n  Mr. President, if we reject the accession of Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic to the NATO Alliance, we will be effectively dimming the \nflame of liberty that sustained these courageous peoples through \ndecades of first Nazi and then communist darkness.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote for the accession of the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary and Poland to NATO membership.\n  The enlargement of NATO does not violate any treaty between the \nUnited States or any NATO country and Russia, does not pose a threat to \nRussia and will not contribute to a reversal of Russia's course towards \ndemocratization and a market economy.\n  The accession to NATO of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic does \ncontribute to European stability, and does promote the spread of \ndemocratic values and will fulfill the democratic yearnings of their \npeoples.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am going to note the absence of a quorum \nfor the purpose of the Presiding Officer having an opportunity to speak \nto this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the situation in Bosnia and the \ncontinued participation of U.S. soldiers in the NATO operations is an \nissue about which many Senators have very strong opinions.\n  I agree with my colleague from Idaho that the decision to keep U.S. \ntroops there is one that the administration did not adequately discuss \nwith the Congress. The past actions of the administration on this \nquestion, promising twice that American soldiers would come home by a \ndate certain and twice breaking that promise, rightly gives the Senate \nreason to wonder if the administration is serious about its commitment \nto withdraw U.S. soldiers from Bosnia.\n  However, I want to be clear about what this amendment does. Simply, \nit punishes Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These are three \ncountries that have all met the criteria for NATO membership and have \nchosen the path of democracy and freedom after 50 years of Communist \ndomination. I remind my colleagues that the troops from Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic are, as we speak, standing side by side \nwith American soldiers serving in Bosnia. Earlier this year, all three \ncountries publicly stated that they were willing to commit troops if \nthe U.S. showdown with Iraq led to military action. I am convinced that \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be among our strongest \nallies in NATO, and preventing them now from fulfilling this role \nsimply does not serve American interests.\n  I support a vigorous debate on the merits of U.S. participation in \nthe NATO force which is keeping peace in Bosnia, but I do not believe \nthat the resolution of ratification to enlarge NATO is the appropriate \nplace for this debate.\n  I think Senator Craig's concern that NATO should not be reformulated \ninto a peacekeeping organization is right on target. NATO is the most \neffective collective defense alliance in history, and to maintain its \ncritical article V capabilities we cannot allow the NATO mission to \ndrift towards peacekeeping and nation building. The amendment offered \nby Senator Kyl, however, on Tuesday, approved by a 90 to 9 vote, \nclearly states the U.S. view of what the mission of NATO should be and \nwhat it should not be. However, I cannot support delaying action on \nNATO enlargement until Congress has authorized the U.S. troop presence \nin Bosnia.\n\n  My colleagues well know, in December of 1995, the Senate approved the \nDole-McCain resolution on the deployment of U.S. forces to Bosnia by a \nvote of 69 to 30. Since then, the Senate has, on at least two \noccasions, approved appropriations to support U.S. troops in Bosnia. I \nunderstand that many Senators do not want U.S. forces in Bosnia, but \nthe Senate has had the opportunity to speak on this issue and we will \nagain in the future. Now is simply not the time, and the expansion of \nNATO ought not to be the vehicle. So I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the amendment of my friend from Idaho.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I just turned to my staff and I said, ``I'm \ngoing to wait to deliver my statement until Senator Craig is on the \nfloor,'' not realizing Senator Craig was presiding. I am delighted he \nis here.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me state my opposition and why I oppose the Craig \namendment.\n  I find this debate over the last several weeks to be, in a sense, \nfascinating--fascinating in this regard. The Members of the Senate who \nexpress the greatest concern about the ability of Russia to veto any \naction NATO takes, the Senators who--with the exception of the \nPresiding Officer now, who expressed that concern himself--the Senators \nwho have been most vocal about a NATO-Russian accord are now on the \nfloor being the most vocal about their concern about how Russia is \ngoing to greet our expanding NATO or voting to expand NATO. So that is \none thing I find somewhat anomalous.\n  Yesterday, I found it somewhat strange that those who did not want us \nentangled in border wars in Europe, as they phrased it, or ethnic \nconflicts in Europe, were the very people who wanted to give up our \nveto power to be involved in those. That is, right now, under the \norganizational structure of NATO, if all 15 NATO nations say we should \ngo in and settle this dispute here in Europe and we say no, that is it, \nwe don't go. I found it somewhat anomalous that they were, yesterday, \nprepared to say: Look, let's have this new dispute resolution mechanism \nwhich forced us, whatever iteration it would have come out in, to give \nup our veto power over that.\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\n  Now, today, Senator Craig, who has been one of the most outspoken \nopponents, to his credit, to the former Soviet Union, concerned about \nRussian interference in American affairs--I may be mistaken, but I \nthink he has a very healthy skepticism about any aid to Russia--is now \non the floor. He, I think--I know unintentionally, at least in my \nview--is on the floor unintentionally giving Russia another veto power.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, the amendment of Senator Craig would \ndelay U.S. approval of the accession of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech \nRepublic to NATO until Congress passes specific authorization for the \ncontinued deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia. This amendment should be \nrejected because it mixes two vital questions of national security that \ndeserve to be debated and decided, each on its own merits.\n  On Bosnia, the U.S. has led successful IFOR and SFOR missions there \ncomposed primarily, but by no means exclusively, of NATO forces. The \nSenate will continue to address the question of whether and how we \nshould continue our participation in the Bosnia mission just as we did \nduring the emergency supplemental budget appropriation adopted prior to \nthe Spring Recess.\n  Today, we face an entirely different question: should we vote to \nbring three worthy countries into NATO as new allies?\n  If we are using contributions to the Bosnia mission as a criterion \nfor NATO membership, then all three of the applicants before us are \nhighly qualified.\n  Hungary provided a 400-500 troop engineer battalion to IFOR, and a \n200-250 troop group to SFOR, as well as a staging area for some 80,000 \nAmerican troops on rotation through Bosnia at one of its air bases.\n  The Czech Republic has been one of the largest per capita \ncontributors with an 870-person mechanized battalion for IFOR, and a \n620-person battalion for SFOR.\n  Poland, with troops already deployed in half a dozen U.N. \npeacekeeping missions, contributed a 400-troop airborne infantry \nbattalion to SFOR.\n  All three nations provided these assets well before they were \nformally invited to accede to the North Atlantic Treaty, demonstrating \nearly their willingness to share this burden with us.\n  The Senate should reject this amendment. Let us decide these two \nimportant questions as they should be--separately, with due \nconsideration for the merits of each case.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Craig \namendment that would require specific congressional authorization for \nthe deployment of troops to Bosnia.\n  However, I would like to make clear that I am supporting this \namendment for reasons that I think differ slightly from the intentions \nof its author, the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  As my colleagues in this Chamber know well, I have always had serious \nquestions about U.S. involvement in this mission. I was the only \nDemocrat to vote against the deployment of U.S. troops back in 1995, in \nlarge part because I did not believe the United States would be able to \ncomplete the mission in the time projected and for the price tag that \nwas originally estimated.\n  Now--more than two years later--I think I have been proven right, and \nI take no pleasure in it.\n  But, regardless of my objections to the mission, I have always felt \nit is vitally important that when large-scale deployment of U.S. troops \nis involved, it is necessary to have specific congressional \nauthorization for it. And I have tried on several occasions to move the \nCongress to enact such authorization. In that light, I view the Craig \namendment as another such attempt.\n  Unlike Senator Craig, however, I support the expansion of NATO and do \nnot feel this amendment is inconsistent with that support.\n  Unlike Senator Craig, I am not necessarily opposed to the involvement \nof NATO in peacekeeping missions.\n  There may be times in the future when it would be appropriate for \nNATO to become involved in peacekeeping missions when conflicts \nthreaten the security of NATO members.\n  But I do agree with Senator Craig that if and when these situations \narise, if the deployment of U.S. troops is proposed, it will be \nnecessary to get specific Congressional authorization for such \ndeployment.\n  It is for this reason that I support Senator Craig's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time available to the opponents of the \namendment has expired. The proponent, the Senator from Idaho, has 7 \nmore minutes.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to make a couple of comments, a \ncouple of observations, one along the line of connections. Some people \nhave said there should not be a connection between what is happening in \nBosnia and the proposal to expand NATO to the three countries; and, \nsecond, as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, how this impacts--\nhow Bosnia has impacted our state of readiness.\n  I think in the first case, as we stood on this floor in November of \n1995 and we talked about where we were going to go and how we were \ngoing to stop the deployment of troops into Bosnia, where we had no \nsecurity interests, I was somewhat in the leadership of that losing \nbattle--but we only lost it by three votes.\n  I think if you could single out one thing that had a major impact \nthat persuaded those three more people or four more Senators to vote in \nfavor of allowing our troops to be sent to Bosnia, it would be our \ncommitment and our obligation to NATO. There was not a discussion on \nthis floor where NATO wasn't brought out and it was said, we have to do \nthis to protect the credibility of NATO; to protect our status with \nNATO and our leadership in that part of the world, it is going to be \nnecessary to send our troops into Bosnia.\n  We know what happened after that. We know they went over with the \nidea they were going to be back in 12 months. We were told the total \ncost would be $1.2 billion. Now our troops, 2\\1/2\\ years later, are \nstill over there, with no end in sight. Our direct costs have exceeded \n$9 billion, and I suggest that it is actually more than double that, \nbecause if you take the cost of the operations in the 21 TACCOM in \nGermany, take the cost of the 86th Airlift in Ramstein--all of them \ndedicating almost their entire operation to supporting the operation in \nBosnia--then the cost is much, much greater. So there is a relationship \nbetween NATO and our troops in Bosnia.\n  I see this as something that is very critical, because so long as we \nare supporting the Bosnia operation, we are not in a position to be \nable to logistically support any type of a ground operation anyplace \nelse in that theater.\n  Let's keep in mind that theater area does include the Middle East. It \nwas not long ago when it was pretty well publicized that we might have \nto do surgical airstrikes on Iraq. They are talking about that again \ntoday. While the general public is deceived into thinking that we can \ndo this without sending in ground troops, they are wrong. There is not \nanyone that I know of, who has a background in the military, who would \ntell you that you can go in and accomplish something from the air \nwithout ultimately sending in ground troops. We are not in a position, \nas a result of Bosnia, to support ground troops anywhere else in that \ntheater.\n  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind, all they have to do is call \nthe commanding officer of 21 TACCOM in Germany, and they will tell them \nthere is not the capacity to send one truck to logistically support an \noperation anywhere else in the theater. It is not that they are 100 \npercent occupied by Bosnia, they are 115 percent occupied with their \nsupport of Bosnia. So that has had a dramatic effect on our state of \nreadiness.\n\n  Second, we are using our troops at such a high OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO \nthat we are not in a position to retain these people. And the cost of \nthis is incredible. Mr. President, it costs $6 million to put a guy in \nthe cockpit of an F-16. These people are leaving. Our retention rate \nhas now dropped below 28 percent. That is unprecedented, and that is \nexactly what has been happening.\n  So I do applaud the Senator from Idaho for bringing this up and \nmaking\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nan issue out of this, because there is a definite connection. I think \nit is perfectly reasonable for us to have to give some type of \napproval, on an annual basis, for our troops being someplace where \nthere are no national security risks at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support, strong \nsupport, of the Craig amendment and commend the Senator for offering \nit. It is a very reasonable amendment that simply says, prior to the \ndeposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification, that there must be \nenacted a law containing specific authorization for the continued \ndeployment of troops in Bosnia. I don't know how--if Congress wants to \nexercise its responsibility--I don't know how anyone could object to \nthe amendment. Surely, if the comments that I have heard on and off the \nfloor over the past couple of years regarding the issue of troops in \nBosnia are any indication, this vote ought to be overwhelming in \nsupport of the Craig amendment. I certainly don't think anyone has any \nright to complain ever again if they are not going to vote to at least \nhave the opportunity to say that we ought to have a vote here in the \nSenate to put forces in Bosnia.\n  I hope those who have been doing all of this complaining over the \npast couple of years will vote for the Craig amendment so that we can \nget a vote by the Congress to authorize the extension of having troops \nin Bosnia as part of the ratification process.\n  When the Congress first considered the President's plan to send \ntroops to Bosnia in 1995, the administration placed clear limits on the \nduration of that commitment. On every single occasion that I can think \nof, that I know of, administration officials stated that U.S. troops \nwould remain in Bosnia for 1 year--1 year. That was 3 years ago. They \nare still there.\n  Secretary Perry said on December 1, 1995:\n\n       We believe the mission can be accomplished in 1 year. So we \n     have based our plan on that time line. This schedule is \n     realistic, because the specific military tasks in the \n     agreement can be completed in the first 6 months and, \n     therefore, its role will be to maintain the climate of \n     stability that will permit civil work to go forward. We \n     expect these civil functions will be successfully initiated \n     in 1 year. But even if some of them are not, we must not be \n     drawn into a posture of indefinite garrison.\n\n  That is what Secretary Perry said on December 1, 1995. He used the \nterm ``indefinite garrison.'' And 3\\1/2\\ years later, we are still in \nBosnia with no end in sight, no plan to get out, and here is the \nopportunity for Congress, certainly the U.S. Senate in this case, to \nspeak up.\n  I hope the Senate will speak responsibly here and agree with the \nCraig amendment.\n  Let me give you some more testimony. Secretary of State Holbrooke on \nDecember 6, 1995:\n\n       The military tasks in Bosnia are doable within 12 months. \n     There isn't any question.\n\n  That is a quote--\n\n       The deeper question is whether the nonmilitary functions \n     can be done in 12 months. That's the real question. But it's \n     not NATO or U.S. force responsibility to do that. It's us on \n     the civilian side working with the Europeans. It's going to \n     be very tough. Should the military stick around until every \n     refugee has gone home, until everything else in the civilian \n     annexes has been done? No. That is not their mission.\n\n  That was Secretary Holbrooke on December 6, 1995, and yet troops \nremain. There are still troops there sitting in the middle of a war \nzone between warring factions. Yes, holding the peace, but the \ncommitment that was made to the American people and to this Congress by \nthis administration in 1995 was that we were not going to keep them \nthere beyond 12 months, and he said there isn't any question about \nthat, we don't need to keep them there.\n  Nothing has changed. There is nothing different today than there was \n3 years ago regarding that kind of comment. He says the deeper question \nis whether nonmilitary functions can be done in 12 months. That is the \nquestion. But the military is still there, and they are using the \nmilitary to try to accomplish nonmilitary functions, which in and of \nitself is a real problem.\n  Many of us who closely studied the conflict in Bosnia saw this, \nfrankly, as an unrealistic comment. We didn't believe--I certainly \ndidn't believe and I know many of my colleagues didn't believe--that \nthis made sense. There was no way that you could make that kind of a \nmilitary commitment and allow this whole situation to become resolved \nin less than 12 months. But, what choice did the American people have \nbut to take the President and the Secretary of State and others at \ntheir word? That is what we did, we took them at their word. What do we \nhave for it?\n\n  I was disappointed, but not surprised, when right after the 1996 \nelections, the President said that we are going to continue this \nmilitary commitment for an additional 18 months, until June of 1998. I \nhappen to be a veteran of the Vietnam war. This has a familiar ring to \nit, a very familiar ring to it. I can remember the McNamara charts and \nthe one more battle and, ``In just another year or two, we'll wrap this \nup.'' Mr. President, 58,000 lives and about 13 years later, we got out \nof Vietnam.\n  That could happen here. This is an extremely sensitive area that has \na lot of problems that could escalate in a hurry.\n  Last December, the President said that he acknowledged that our \ncommitment to Bosnia is open-ended, but he is still talking about clear \nand achievable goals. If you have an open-ended policy, you don't have \nclear and achievable goals. They are two direct opposites. There is no \nclear and achievable goal. There is an open-ended policy, and as long \nas it is open-ended, we are just going to give a blank check to the \nadministration to stay in Bosnia and do what? To nation build, is that \nwhat our troops are there for?\n  This policy must come to a vote in this Congress. We have to act \nresponsibly, otherwise, another Vietnam could occur. After people are \nkilled or injured or maimed, it is too late to debate it. It is too \nlate for those people. We need to be debating it now, and the Craig \namendment is simply asking for a vote in the affirmative if we are \ngoing to continue the policy and continue to keep troops in Bosnia. I \ndon't know what the policy is. The policy to me is just open-ended. \nJust keep them there, keep them there, keep them there; make another \npromise, another promise, another promise.\n  The administration has had a free ride in Bosnia now for 2 years. It \nis wrong, to put it very bluntly, for this Government to conduct its \nforeign policy without the participation of Congress and the public. \nFor the life of me, I don't understand how anyone could oppose the \nCraig amendment.\n  The American people need to understand what is at stake and either \nagree to the commitment or not. We represent the American people, \nsupposedly. The President has stated what he wants to do and he said \nwhy. He said, ``I want an open-ended policy in Bosnia, and I want to do \nit because I feel like I have a clear and achievable goal.'' He hasn't \nsaid what it is, just to keep the peace.\n  War has been going on in Bosnia for a thousand years. I am not sure \njust how long we have to hold American military forces there. Under \nthis open-ended policy, maybe it is another thousand years. I don't \nknow. But Congress has to act. The President gave his reasons, and now \nthe American people ought to hear Congress' debate on this proposal, \nand that is what this amendment is about. This is no longer a \nPresidential use of force based on his judgment of an immediate threat. \nIt is nation building in Bosnia. That is what we are talking about. It \nis now a deliberate foreign policy, and it must be approved and funded \nby Congress or not.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining in the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter to me from President Clinton dated \nApril 20, 1998, in which he said:\n\n       To ensure that NATO functions as effectively in the next \n     century as it has in this one, we must preserve its ability \n     to respond quickly, flexibly and decisively to whatever \n     threats may arise.\n\n  It is the ``whatever threats may arise'' that bothers me in this \ndebate, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Ethics,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter on United \n     States and NATO involvement in Bosnia. You raise important \n     questions about our mission and the impact of our military \n     operations in Bosnia on U.S. security interests around the \n     world.\n       Since you wrote your letter, I have forwarded to Congress \n     my certification and report regarding our mission in Bosnia. \n     This document includes detailed answers to the range of \n     issues you raise in your letter and I am enclosing a copy for \n     your review.\n       I strongly believe that our mission in Bosnia is critically \n     important to the security of Europe. We are making increasing \n     progress in implementing the Dayton agreement and \n     establishing conditions under which Bosnians can live \n     together in peace. In the past six months, we have seen \n     rising returns of refugees, reform and restructuring of \n     police and media, emerging anti-corruption efforts, capture \n     or surrender of more than a dozen war criminals and improved \n     cooperation among the parties. Most significant is the recent \n     installation of a pro-Dayton government in Republika Srpska. \n     SFOR's support for civilian implementation was essential to \n     achieving this result.\n       We must succeed in Bosnia if we are to prevent instability \n     from spreading to other volatile parts of the region such as \n     Kosovo and Macedonia. Broader instability could threaten the \n     vital interests of NATO allies Greece and Turkey, and \n     endanger the overall security and stability of Southeast \n     Europe. Success in Bosnia also reinforces the credibility of \n     American leadership in Europe and demonstrates the capability \n     of NATO to respond with its Partnership for Peace partners to \n     the security challenges of the twenty-first century.\n       The Bosnia mission also underscores NATO's value in \n     protecting the security and interests of its members, but it \n     does not signal a departure from the Alliance's enduring \n     purposes, as described by the Washington Treaty of 1949. Its \n     primary mission is, and will remain, the collective defense \n     of Alliance territory. However, as we have seen in Bosnia, it \n     is sometimes necessary for NATO to act beyond its immediate \n     borders in order to safeguard its members. To ensure that \n     NATO functions as effectively in the next century as it has \n     in this one, we must preserve its ability to respond quickly, \n     flexibly and decisively to whatever threats may arise.\n       Again, thank you for your letter. I am pleased that we have \n     had the opportunity for an extensive dialogue with members of \n     Congress on the continuation of our mission in Bosnia. We \n     will continue to work with you and other members of Congress \n     in the cause of peace in this important mission.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Craig amendment will now be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 12 noon having arrived, the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, is recognized to offer an \namendment on which there shall be 1 hour of debate.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2321\n\n  (Purpose: To express a condition regarding the relationship between \n             NATO membership and European Union membership)\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment for \nmyself and Mr. Warner and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] for himself and \n     Mr. Warner, proposes an executive amendment numbered 2321.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 3 of the resolution (relating to \n     conditions), add the following:\n       (  ) Deferral of ratification of nato enlargement until \n     admission of poland, hungary, and czech republic to the \n     european union.--\n       (A) Certification Required.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic have each acceded to membership in the European \n     Union and have each engaged in initial voting participation \n     in an official action of the European Union.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed as an expression by the Senate of an intent to \n     accept as a new NATO member any country other than Poland, \n     Hungary, or the Czech Republic if that country becomes a \n     member of the European Union after the date of adoption of \n     this resolution.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In the brief period that I will be speaking, I would \nlike to concentrate on the central issue: the dangers of nuclear war in \nthe years ahead.\n  Earlier, in an address to the 150th anniversary gathering of the \nAssociated Press, I cited a comment made last autumn by Richard \nHolbrooke, the American diplomat, now temporarily in private life.\n  Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton agreement regarding the \nformer Yugoslavia, commented that ``almost a decade has gone by since \nthe Berlin Wall fell and, instead of reaching out to Central Europe, \nthe European Union turned toward a bizarre search for a common \ncurrency. So NATO enlargement had to fill the void.'' As if this were \nan accidental policy that derives from the unwillingness of our \nEuropean friends--some of them our NATO allies--to engage in the more \nserious work of bringing the once more independent republics of the \nCzech Republic, Hungary, and Poland into the European Union, a common \nmarket from which their economic development can grow, that being \nclearly the single most pressing concern they have in the aftermath of \nthe half century of a Stalinist economy imposed upon them with the same \nresults for them--not quite so bad, but bad enough--that Russia itself \nexperienced.\n  The disaster of this era for the Russians cannot be exaggerated. I \nsay to my dear friend from Delaware, who has been so generous in \nletting us speak on these matters, Murray Feshbach has recently \nestablished that the life expectancy of Russian men dropped from 62 \nyears in 1989 to 57 years in 1996. There is no historical equivalent. A \ncentury ago, a 16-year-old Russian male had a 54 percent chance of \nsurviving to age 60. Two percent less than had he been born a century \nago. Such has been the implosion of Soviet society--in every respect, \nincluding the nuclear one.\n  Now, earlier on in a statement, I remarked, and I will take the \nliberty of remarking once again, that the origins of NATO seem very \ndistant to most Members of the Senate. That age seems like another era. \nAnd in a sense it was another era. But there are a few witnesses from \nthat era who are still active and who still speak.\n  George Kennan, who conceived the whole idea of containment, of which \nNATO was an expression and perhaps the most important one, George \nKennan has said NATO expansion, in the aftermath of the defeat of the \nSoviet Union, he says, would be ``the most fateful error of American \npolicy in the entire post-cold war era.'' ``The most fateful error.''\n  Paul Nitze, who was the principal author of NSC-68, the national \nsecurity directive written in 1950, which established the American \npolicy of containment, recently wrote to me to say, ``In the present \nsecurity environment, NATO expansion is not only unnecessary, it is \ngratuitous. If we want a Europe whole and free, we are not likely to \nget it by making NATO fat and feeble.''\n  In my remarks to the Associated Press, I simply said that expanding \nNATO at this time, and particularly should we move up to include the \nBaltic States, which we are pledged to support, would put us at risk of \ngetting into a nuclear war with Russia: wholly unanticipated, for which \nwe are not prepared, about which we are not thinking.\n  Professor Michael Mandelbaum, at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced \nInternational Studies, said ``that is not hyperbole.'' That is what we \nare dealing with here. And the reason, NATO expansion is viewed \nthroughout elements of the Russian political system as a hostile act. \nSome think of it as a hostile act they could live with; some think it \nis a hostile act they will have to defend against; and they have said \nif they have to defend their territory, they will do so with nuclear \nweapons; it is all they have left.\n  Their Army has all been disintegrated--not entirely, but they remark \nin a December 17 National Security memorandum signed by Mr. Yeltsin, \nthat stretches of their borders are undefended. Their Navy is rusting \nin a seaport, nominally part of the Ukraine.\n  They have nuclear weapons. After all we have gone through to achieve \nrational nuclear postures: a no-first-use policy, graduated response to \nthreats, only resorting to strategic nuclear weapons at the very last \nmoment when no other options are available--that is gone. We are back \nto the hair trigger that we knew when I was a young person in this \nGovernment, in this city,\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\nwhen we could imagine having use air-raid shelters. We could imagine \nit, because we could remember the Second World War.\n\n  I was called back into the Navy in 1951, briefly, as it turned out, \nbut found myself in Bremerhaven, in the submarine pens there that the \nNazis had built. The British finally got a bomb through one, but never \ndid during the war. We were sent on an expedition to Berlin. We had the \npractice of sending American officers on trains through Soviet-occupied \nGermany to establish the fact that we had the right to do so. I arrived \nin Berlin, and it wasn't there. Just ruined rubble; early in the \nmorning, a few men stumbling out of a few bars, lost to the world.\n\n  We knew what war meant, and we can imagine what nuclear war means. We \njust had dropped two bombs on Japan. From the time of President \nEisenhower, we have been negotiating ways to control atomic weapons--\nand we had success. Those early arms control agreements, apart from the \nagreement President Kennedy reached on atmospheric nuclear testing, \nthose early agreements typically just ratified the increases in nuclear \nweapons that each side wanted, but we got the START agreement and we \nreduced our nuclear arsenals.\n  The START Treaty, negotiated with the Soviet Union, was signed by \nfour entirely different countries, because by the time it was finished \nthe Soviet Union had disappeared. Russia has not yet ratified START II. \nThe idea of START III, to reduced deployed nuclear weapons ever \nfurther, hasn't even begun. They haven't ratified START II, not least \nbecause of NATO expansion. I don't claim to know what the actual \ndecisions in the Duma are, but that is what one hears, and one can \nimagine it.\n  Tomorrow there will be a report by the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, an American group, principally, that has won a Nobel \nPrize on the issue of preventing nuclear warfare. They will publish a \nreport in the New England Journal of Medicine which says that the \ndanger of nuclear attack continues and may even be thought to escalate. \nThe New York Times reports this in the terms we have been speaking \nabout on this floor, the exact same terms, with no idea that was \ncoming.\n  It says, ``Russia's Disarray Brings a Nuclear Risk to the U.S., Study \nSays.'' The Physicians write, ``Although many people believe that the \nthreat of a nuclear attack largely disappeared with the end of the cold \nwar there is considerable evidence to the contrary. Each side routinely \nmaintains thousands of nuclear warheads on high alert. Furthermore, to \ncompensate for its weakened conventional forces, Russia has abandoned \nits no-first use policy.''\n  Madam President, that is all I and my friend from Virginia has said \non this floor this week of debate and when the expansion of NATO was \ndebated a month ago. Suddenly we have it in an article in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine, saying to those who think this threat is \nbehind us. Indeed, it is ahead of us, and we must be very careful, so \ncareful, about what we do. That is why so many of us, starting with the \ngreat men--Kennan and Nitze--who conceived the strategy for the cold \nwar, which we won, are saying, ``Don't do this.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \nfrom the New England Journal of Medicine and the New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 30, 1998]\n\n    Russia's Disarray Brings a Nuclear Risk to the U.S., Study Says\n\n                            (By Tim Weiner)\n\n       Washington, April 29.--Russia's deteriorating control of \n     its nuclear weapons is increasing the danger of an accidental \n     or unauthorized attack on the United States, a Nobel Peace \n     Prize-winning group warned today.\n       A dozen missiles fired from a Russian nuclear submarine \n     would kill nearly seven million Americans instantly, and \n     millions more would die from radiation, according to a study \n     conducted under the auspices of Physicians for Social \n     Responsibility, which won the Nobel Peace Prize for its work \n     in nuclear weapons in 1985. The study is to be published \n     tomorrow in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n       Thousands of Russian and American nuclear weapons remain on \n     hair-trigger alerts, despite the end of the cold war, and \n     Russia formally abandoned its longstanding policy that it \n     would never be the first nation to use those weapons four \n     years ago, the study noted.\n       Repeated assurances from President Clinton that the two \n     nations are no longer aiming their nuclear weapons at one \n     another are ``a gross misrepresentation of reality,'' said \n     Bruce Blair, an author of the study and a former Strategic \n     Air Command nuclear weapons officer. In fact, the study said, \n     Russian missiles launched without specific targets would \n     automatically aim themselves at their cold war targets: \n     American cities and military installations like the Pentagon.\n       Nor are these weapons necessarily in safe hands. Russia's \n     once-elite nuclear weapons commands are suffering housing and \n     food shortages, low pay, budget cuts, deteriorating \n     discipline, desertions and suicides. Such problems are not \n     unique. The study says that about 40,000 American military \n     personnel were removed from nuclear-weapons responsibilities \n     from 1975 to 1990 for alcohol, drug or psychiatric problems.\n       Neither nation has abandoned its cold war doctrine of \n     launching its missiles after receiving warning that the other \n     side is attacking. Each nation gives itself 15 minutes to \n     decide that the attack is real; both nations have experienced \n     major false alarms over the last two decades.\n       The study considered what would happen if the captain and \n     crew of a Russian submarine decided to carry out an attack \n     without authorization, or went mad and fired off their \n     arsenal. This, Mr. Blair said, would require ``a conspiracy \n     of some magnitude'' between a captain and three or four \n     officers.\n       The missiles could also be fired after a false alarm or an \n     unauthorized order from a political or military leader in \n     Moscow. Once launched, they would reach their targets across \n     the United States in 15 to 30 minutes.\n       The blast and shock of the fireball from each of the \n     exploding warheads would kill nearly everyone within three \n     miles instantly; people living in a swath up to 40 miles long \n     and 3 miles wide would receive a lethal dose of radiation \n     within hours, the study said. It assumed that one-quarter of \n     the missiles would malfunction, and that 12 missiles would \n     reach their targets in eight American cities in the middle of \n     the night.\n       In New York City, more than three million people would die \n     immediately; in San Francisco, 739,000; in Washington, \n     728,000--in all, some 6,838,000 deaths within hours of the \n     attack, the study said, which would ``dwarf all prior \n     accidents in history.'' A near-complete breakdown of systems \n     delivering food, water, electricity and medicine would follow \n     and millions more Americans would die as a consequence, the \n     study said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       [From the New England Journal of Medicine, Apr. 30, 1998]\n\n           Accidental Nuclear War--A Post-Cold War Assessment\n\n  (By Lachlan Forrow, M.D., Bruce G. Blair, Ph.D., Ira Helfand, M.D., \nGeorge Lewis, Ph.D., Theodore Postol, Ph.D., Victor Sibel, M.D., Barry \n    S. Levy, M.D., Herbert Abrams, M.D., and Christine Cassel, M.D.)\n\n\n                                Abstract\n\n       Background.--In the 1980s, many medical organizations \n     identified the prevention of nuclear war as one of the \n     medical profession's most important goals. An assessment of \n     the current danger is warranted given the radically changed \n     context of the post-Cold War era.\n       Methods.--We reviewed the recent literature on the status \n     of nuclear arsenals and the risk of nuclear war. We then \n     estimated the likely medical effects of a scenario identified \n     by leading experts as posing a serious danger: an accidental \n     launch of nuclear weapons. We assessed possible measures to \n     reduce the risk of such an event.\n       Results.--U.S. and Russian nuclear-weapons systems remain \n     on high alert. This fact, combined with the aging of Russian \n     technical systems, has recently increased the risk of an \n     accidental nuclear attack. As a conservative estimate, an \n     accidental intermediate-sized launch of weapons from a single \n     Russian submarine would result in the deaths of 6,838,000 \n     persons from firestorms in eight U.S. cities. Millions of \n     other people would probably be exposed to potentially lethal \n     radiation from fallout. An agreement to remove all nuclear \n     missiles from high-level alert status and eliminate the \n     capability of a rapid launch would put an end to this threat.\n       Conclusions.--The risk of an accidental nuclear attack has \n     increased in recent years, threatening a public health \n     disaster of unprecedented scale. Physicians and medical \n     organizations should work actively to help build support for \n     the policy changes that would prevent such a disaster. (N \n     Engl J Med 1998; 338:1326--31.)\n       During the Cold War, physicians and others described the \n     potential medical consequences of thermonuclear war and \n     concluded that health care personnel and facilities would be \n     unable to provide effective care to the vast number of \n     victims of a nuclear attack. In 1987, a report by the World \n     Health Organization concluded, ``The only approach to the \n     treatment of health effects of nuclear warfare is primary \n     prevention, that is, the prevention of nuclear war.'' Many \n     physicians and medical organizations have argued that the \n     prevention of nuclear war should be one of the medical \n     profession's most important goals.\n\n\n                  continued danger of a nuclear attack\n\n       Although many people believe that the threat of a nuclear \n     attack largely disappeared with the end of the Cold War, \n     there\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\n     is considerable evidence to the contrary. The United States \n     and Russia no longer confront the daily danger of a \n     deliberate, massive nuclear attack, but both nations continue \n     to operate nuclear forces as though this danger still \n     existed. Each side routinely maintains thousands of nuclear \n     warheads on high alert. Furthermore, to compensate for its \n     weakened conventional armed forces, Russia has abandoned its \n     ``no first use'' policy.\n       Even though both countries declared in 1994 that they would \n     not aim strategic missiles at each other, not even one second \n     has been added to the time required to launch a nuclear \n     attack: providing actual targeting (or retargeting) \n     instructions is simply a component of normal launch \n     procedures. The default targets of U.S. land-based missiles \n     are now the oceans, but Russian missiles launched without \n     specific targeting commands automatically revert to \n     previously programmed military targets.\n       There have been numerous ``broken arrows'' (major nuclear-\n     weapons accidents) in the past, including at least five \n     instances of U.S. missiles that are capable of carrying \n     nuclear devices flying over or crashing in or near the \n     territories of other nations. From 1975 to 1990, 66,000 \n     military personnel involved in the operational aspects of \n     U.S. nuclear forces were removed from their positions. Of \n     these 66,000, 41 percent were removed because of alcohol or \n     other drug abuse and 20 percent because of psychiatric \n     problems. General George Lee Butler, who as commander of the \n     U.S. Strategic Command from 1991 to 1994 was responsible for \n     all U.S. strategic nuclear forces, recently reported that he \n     had ``investigated a dismaying array of accidents and \n     incidents involving strategic weapons and forces.''\n       Any nuclear arsenal is susceptible to accidental, \n     inadvertent, or unauthorized use. This is true both in \n     countries declared to possess nuclear weapons (the United \n     States, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and China) and in \n     other countries widely believed to possess nuclear weapons \n     (Israel, India, and Pakistan). The combination of the massive \n     size of the Russian nuclear arsenal (almost 6000 strategic \n     warheads) and growing problems in Russian control systems \n     makes Russia the focus of greatest current concern.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, Russia's nuclear command \n     system has steadily deteriorated. Aging nuclear \n     communications and computer networks are malfunctioning more \n     frequently, and deficient early-warning satellites and ground \n     radar are more prone to reporting false alarms. The saga of \n     the Mir space station bears witness to the problems of aging \n     Russian technical systems. In addition, budget cuts have \n     reduced the training of nuclear commanders and thus their \n     proficiency in operating nuclear weapons safely. Elite \n     nuclear units suffer pay arrears and housing and food \n     shortages, which contribute to low morale and disaffection. \n     New offices have recently been established at Strategic \n     Rocket Forces bases to address the problem of suicide (and \n     unpublished data).\n       Safeguards against a nuclear attack will be further \n     degraded if the Russian government implements its current \n     plan to distribute both the unlock codes and conditional \n     launch authority down the chain of command. Indeed, a recent \n     report by the Central Intelligence Agency, which was leaked \n     to the press, warned that some Russian submarine crews may \n     already be capable of authorizing a launch. As then Russian \n     Defense Minister Igor Rodionov warned last year, ``No one \n     today can guarantee the reliability of our control systems. . \n     . . Russia might soon reach the threshold beyond which its \n     rockets and nuclear systems cannot be controlled.''\n       A particular danger stems from the reliance by both Russia \n     and the United States on the strategy of ``launch on \n     warning''--the launching of strategic missiles after a \n     missile attack by the enemy has been detected but before the \n     missiles actually arrive. Each country's procedures allow a \n     total response time of only 15 minutes: a few minutes for \n     detecting an enemy attack, another several minutes for top-\n     level decision making, and a couple of minutes to disseminate \n     the authorization to launch a response.\n       Possible scenarios of an accidental or otherwise \n     unauthorized nuclear attack range from the launch of a single \n     missile due to a technical malfunction to the launch of a \n     massive salvo due to a false warning. A strictly mechanical \n     or electrical event as the cause of an accidental launch, \n     such as a stray spark during missile maintenance, ranks low \n     on the scale of plausibility. Analysts also worry about \n     whether computer defects in the year 2000 may compromise the \n     control of strategic missiles in Russia, but the extent of \n     this danger is not known.\n       Several authorities consider a launch based on a false \n     warning to be the most plausible scenario of an accidental \n     attack. This danger is not merely theoretical. Serious false \n     alarms occurred in the U.S. system in 1979 and 1980, when \n     human error and computer-chip failures resulted in \n     indications of a massive Soviet missile strike. On January \n     25, 1995, a warning related to a U.S. scientific rocket \n     launched from Norway led to the activation, for the first \n     time in the nuclear era, of the ``nuclear suitcases'' carried \n     by the top Russian leaders and initiated an emergency \n     nuclear-decision-making conference involving the leaders and \n     their top nuclear advisors. It took about eight minutes to \n     conclude that the launch was not part of a surprise nuclear \n     strike by Western submarines--less than four minutes before \n     the deadline for ordering a nuclear response under standard \n     Russian launch-on-warning protocols.\n       A missile launch activated by false warning is thus \n     possible in both U.S. and Russian arsenals. For the reasons \n     noted above, an accidental Russian launch is currently \n     considered the greater risk. Several specific scenarios have \n     been considered by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization \n     of the Department of Defense. We have chosen to analyze a \n     scenario that falls in the middle range of the danger posed \n     by an accidental attack: the launch against the United States \n     of the weapons on board a single Russian Delta-IV ballistic-\n     missile submarine, for two reasons. First the safeguards \n     against the unauthorized launch of Russian submarine-based \n     missiles are weaker than those against either silo-based or \n     mobile land-based rockets, because the Russian general staff \n     cannot continuously monitor the status of the crew and \n     missiles or use electronic links to override unauthorized \n     launches by the crews. Second, the Delta-IV is and will \n     remain the mainstay of the Russian strategic submarine fleet.\n       Delta-IV submarine carry 16 missiles. Each missile is armed \n     with four 100-kt warheads and has a range of 8300 km, which \n     is sufficient to reach almost any part of the continental \n     United States from typical launch stations in the Barents \n     Sea. These missiles are believed to be aimed at ``soft'' \n     targets, usually in or near American cities, whereas the more \n     accurate silo-based missiles would attack U.S. military \n     installations. Although a number of targeting strategies are \n     possible for any particular Delta-IV, it is plausible that \n     two of its missiles are assigned to attack war-supporting \n     targets in each of eight U.S. urban areas. If 4 of the 16 \n     missiles failed to reach their destinations because of \n     malfunctions before or after the launch, then 12 missiles \n     carrying a total of 48 warheads would reach their targets.\n\n\n              potential consequences of a nuclear accident\n\n       We assume that eight U.S. urban areas are hit: four with \n     four warheads and four with eight warheads. We also assume \n     that the targets have been selected according to standard \n     military priorities: industrial, financial, and \n     transportation sites and other components of the \n     infrastructure that are essential for supporting or \n     recovering from war. Since low-altitude bursts are required \n     to ensure the destruction of structures such as docks, \n     concrete runways, steel-reinforced buildings, and underground \n     facilities, most if not all detonations will cause \n     substantial early fallout.\n     Physical Effects\n       Under our model, the numbers of immediate deaths are \n     determined primarily by the area of the ``superfires'' that \n     would result from a thermonuclear explosion over a city. \n     Fires would ignite across the exposed area to roughly 10 or \n     more calories of radiant heat per square centimeter, \n     coalescing into a giant firestorm with hurricane-force winds \n     and average air temperatures above the boiling point of \n     water. Within this area, the combined effects of superheated \n     wind, toxic smoke, and combustion gases would result in a \n     death rate approaching 100 percent.\n       For each 100-kt warhead, the radius of the circle of nearly \n     100 percent short-term lethality would be 4.3 km (2.7 miles), \n     the range within which 10 cal per square centimeter is \n     delivered to the earth's surface from the hot fireball under \n     weather conditions in which the visibility is 8 km (5 miles), \n     which is low for almost all weather conditions. We used \n     Census CD to calculate the residential population within \n     these areas according to 1990 U.S. Census data, adjusting for \n     areas where circles from different warheads overlapped. In \n     many urban areas, the daytime population, and therefore the \n     casualties, would be much higher.\n     Fallout\n       The cloud of radioactive dust produced by low-altitude \n     bursts would be deposited as fallout downwind of the target \n     area. The exact areas of fallout would not be predictable, \n     because they would depend on wind direction and speed, but \n     there would be large zones of potentially lethal radiation \n     exposure. With average wind speeds of 24 to 48 km per hour \n     (15 to 30 miles per hour), a 100-kt low-altitude detonation \n     would result in a radiation zone 30 to 60 km (20 to 40 miles) \n     long and 3 to 5 km (2 to 3 miles) wide in which exposed and \n     unprotected persons would receive a lethal total dose of 600 \n     rad within six hours. With radioactive contamination of food \n     and water supplies, the breakdown of refrigeration and \n     sanitation systems, radiation-induced immune suppression, and \n     crowding in relief facilities, epidemics of infectious \n     diseases would be likely.\n     Deaths\n       Table 1 shows the estimates of early deaths for each \n     cluster of targets in or near the eight major urban areas, \n     with a total of 6,838,000 initial deaths. Given the many \n     indeterminate variables (e.g., the altitude of each warhead's \n     detonation, the direction of the wind, the population density \n     in the fallout zone, the effectiveness of evacuation \n     procedures, and the availability of shelter and relief \n     supplies), a reliable estimate of the total number of \n     subsequent deaths from fallout and other sequelae of the \n     attack is not possible. With 48 explosions probably resulting \n     in thousands of square miles of lethal fallout around urban \n     areas where there are thousands of persons per square mile, \n     it is plausible that these secondary deaths would outnumber \n     the immediate deaths caused by the firestorms.\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\n     Medical Care in the Aftermath\n       Earlier assessments have documented in detail the problems \n     of caring for the injured survivors of a nuclear attack: the \n     need for care would completely overwhelm the available health \n     care resources. Most of the major medical centers in each \n     urban area lie within the zone of total destruction. The \n     number of patients with severe burns and other critical \n     injuries would far exceed the available resources of all \n     critical care facilities nationwide, including the country's \n     1708 beds in burn-care units (most of which are already \n     occupied). The danger of intense radiation exposure would \n     make it very difficult for emergency personnel even to enter \n     the affected areas. The nearly complete destruction of local \n     and regional transportation, communications, and energy \n     networks would make it almost impossible to transport the \n     severely injured to medical facilities outside the affected \n     area. After the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, which \n     resulted in a much lower number of casualties (6500 people \n     died and 34,900 were injured) and which had few of the \n     complicating factors that would accompany a nuclear attack, \n     there were long delays before outside medical assistance \n     arrived.\n\n\n                       from danger to prevention\n\n       Public health professionals now recognize that many, if not \n     most, injuries and deaths from violence and accidents result \n     from a predictable series of events that are, at least in \n     principle, preventable. The direct toll that would result \n     from an accidental nuclear attack of the type described above \n     would dwarf all prior accidents in history. Furthermore, such \n     an attack, even if accidental, might prompt a retaliatory \n     response resulting in an all-out nuclear exchange. The World \n     Health Organization has estimated that this would result in \n     billions of direct and indirect casualties worldwide.\n\n    TABLE 1.

Intercepting a launched \n     ballistic missile might appear to be an attractive option, \n     since it could be implemented unilaterally by a country. To \n     this end, construction of a U.S. ballistic-missile defense \n     system has been suggested. Unfortunately, the technology for \n     ballistic-missile defense is unproved, and even its most \n     optimistic advocates predict that it cannot be fully \n     protective. Furthermore, the estimated costs would range from \n     $4 billion to $13 billion for a single-site system to $31 \n     billion to $60 billion for a multiple-site system. In either \n     case, the system would not be operational for many years.\n     A Bilateral Agreement to Eliminate High-Level Alert Status\n       Since ballistic-missile defense offers no solution at all \n     in the short term and at best an expensive and incomplete \n     solution in the long term, what can the United States as well \n     as other nations do to reduce the risk of an accidental \n     nuclear attack substantially and quickly? The United States \n     should make it the most urgent national public health \n     priority to seek a permanent, verified agreement with Russia \n     to take all nuclear missiles off high alert and remove the \n     capability of a rapid launch. This approach is much less \n     expensive and more reliable than ballistic-missile defense \n     and can be implemented in short order. In various forms, such \n     an agreement has been urged by the National Academy of \n     Sciences, the Canberra Commission, General Butler and his \n     military colleagues throughout the world, and other experts, \n     such as Sam Nunn, former chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, and Stansfield Turner, former director of \n     the Central Intelligence Agency. The Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     and an interagency working group are completing a detailed \n     study of de-alerting options that will be presented to \n     Defense Secretary William Cohen.\n       Major improvements in nuclear stability can be achieved \n     rapidly. In the wake of the 1991 attempted coup in Moscow, \n     Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev moved quickly to \n     enhance nuclear safety and stability by taking thousands of \n     strategic weapons off high alert almost overnight. Today, \n     there are specific steps that the United States can take \n     almost immediately, since they require only the authority of \n     a presidential directive. These steps include putting in \n     storage the warheads of the MX missiles, which will be \n     retired under Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) II in \n     any case, and the warheads of the four Trident submarines \n     that will be retired under START III; placing the remaining \n     U.S. ballistic-missile submarines on low alert so that it \n     would take at least 24 hours to prepare them to launch their \n     missiles; disabling all Minuteman III missiles by pinning \n     their safety switches open (as was done with the Minuteman II \n     missiles under President Bush's 1991 directive); and allowing \n     Russia to verity these actions with the on-site inspections \n     allowed under START I. Similar measures should be taken by \n     the Russians. These steps--all readily reversible if \n     warranted by future developments or if a permanent bilateral \n     agreement is not reached--would eliminate today's dangerous \n     launch-on-warning systems, making the U.S. and Russian \n     populations immediately safer. Both nations should then \n     energetically promote a universal norm against maintaining \n     nuclear weapons on high alert.\n     The Role of Physicians\n       In awarding the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize to International \n     Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, the Nobel \n     Committee underscored the ``considerable service to mankind'' \n     that physicians have performed by ``spreading authoritative \n     information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic \n     consequences of atomic warfare. This in turn contributes to \n     an increase in the pressure of public opposition to the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons and to a redefining of \n     priorities. . . .'' No group is as well situated as \n     physicians to help policy makers and the public fully \n     appreciate the magnitude of the disaster that can ensue if \n     changes in the alert status of all nuclear weapons are not \n     instituted.\n       The only way to make certain that an accidental (or any \n     other) nuclear attack never occurs is through the elimination \n     of all nuclear weapons and the air-tight international \n     control of all fissile materials that can be used in nuclear \n     weapons. In 1995, the World Court stated that the abolition \n     of nuclear weapons is a binding legal obligation of the \n     United States, Russia, and all signatories to the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty, under Article 6. Preferring the term \n     ``prohibition'' to ``abolition,'' the Committee on \n     International Security and Arms Control of the U.S. National \n     Academy of Sciences concluded in its 1997 report, ``The \n     potential benefits of comprehensive nuclear disarmament are \n     so attractive relative to the attendant risks--and the \n     opportunities presented by the end of the Cold War . . . are \n     so compelling--that . . . increased attention is now \n     warranted to studying and fostering the conditions that would \n     have to be met to make prohibition desirable and feasible.''\n       Leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American \n     College of Physicians and the American Public Health \n     Association, have already joined Physicians for Social \n     Responsibility, International Physicians for the Prevention \n     of Nuclear War, and over 1000 other nongovernmental \n     organizations in 75 nations to support Abolition 2000, which \n     calls for a signed agreement by the year 2000 committing all \n     countries to the permanent elimination of nuclear weapons \n     within a specified time frame. The American Medical \n     Association has recently endorsed the abolition of nuclear \n     weapons, as have the Canberra Commission, military leaders \n     throughout the world, major religious organizations, and over \n     100 current and recent heads of state and other senior \n     political leaders. Some supporters of the abolition of \n     nuclear weapons have specifically called for immediate steps \n     to eliminate the high-level alert status of such weapons, as \n     urgent interim measures. All parties should cooperate to \n     ensure that these measures are implemented rapidly.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       The time, place, and circumstances of a specific accident \n     are no more predictable for nuclear weapons than for other \n     accidents. Nonetheless, as long as there is a finite, \n     nonzero, annual probability that an accidental launch will \n     occur, then given sufficient time, the probability of such a \n     launch approaches certainty. Until the abolition of nuclear \n     weapons reduces the annual probability to zero, our immediate \n     goal must be to reduce the probability of a nuclear accident \n     to as low a level as possible. Given the massive casualties \n     that would result from such an accident, achieving this must \n     be among the most urgent of all global public health \n     priorities.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I conclude by saying, I just happened 20 minutes ago to \nbe speaking to our revered former majority leader, Howard Baker, who \nwas in the Capitol to testify before the Finance Committee. I said I \nwas coming over to offer this amendment. He and Sam Nunn, Brent \nScowcroft, and Alton Frye have said, ``Don't do this.'' He said with \nrespect to Russian nuclear weapons; they have them, but they don't know \nhow many they have and they don't know who controls them. The whole \nsituation of command and control is very limited and weak and \nuncertain.\n  Not many years ago, after the end of the cold war, Norway put up a \nrocket\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\nfor purposes of research which put the Russian on nuclear alert. They \nhad 15 minutes to decide whether to go to launch on warning. It was \nthat close. We were that close to nuclear war. We will be closer in the \naftermath of NATO expansion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will yield to my colleague, who has somewhere to go, but \nI want to ask the Senator from New York a question. Is he aware that \nthe point he is making about a hair trigger--that is, that the Russians \nhave moved to a doctrine of not eschewing the doctrine of first use, \nthat they are now saying they may have to rely on the first use of \nnuclear weapons? Is he aware that that doctrine which was changed in \n1992 had nothing to do with the expansion of NATO?\n  In 1992, when the Russian military realized that they, in fact, had \nimploded when they were incapable of defending their borders, they did \nexactly what NATO did when we concluded we did not have the \nconventional force capacity to stop an all-out attack in Europe and \nindicated that we would use nuclear weapons if, in fact, we were \nattacked.\n  I ask my friend--I am fascinated by his rendition, and I share his \nconcern about the hair trigger. But is he suggesting the decision in \n1992 where Russia declared that it would not any longer abide by its \nprevious policy of no first use of nuclear weapons--is he aware that \nwas long before the contemplation of expansion of NATO?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Is the Senator aware of how little time I have to \nrespond? He put that question on his time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I put that question on my time, and then I will yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, I do. I am very much aware of that. But I am also \naware, on December 17, in the context of NATO expansion, a formal \ndocument was put out saying, ``we may not have much else but we do have \nnuclear weapons.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. On my own time, if I might say, that is a little bit like \nmy wife deciding that she is no longer going to cook dinner because she \nis receiving her Ph.D. and is taking too much time in class, and then 6 \nmonths later, after having made that decision, when I, in fact, do \nsomething she does not like, she says to me, ``I want to formally tell \nyou I haven't been cooking dinner, but I want you to know the reason I \nam not cooking dinner now is because you were late coming home tonight \nbecause you didn't call me from Washington and we missed going to that \nplay.''\n  That is what it is like. It has nothing to do--she didn't cook me \ndinner before for reasons unrelated to me coming home late, but if she \nwants to make a point that I missed a play, she may very well \nreiterate, bring out of an old bag something that is already being \nused.\n  That is what the Russians have done, and Mr. Kennan, a revered figure \nwe both know--you know him better than I--believes this is dangerous. \nPaul Nitze thinks it is dangerous for totally different reasons. Kennan \nthinks it is dangerous because he thinks it will exacerbate the \nprospects of any democracy occurring in Russia. Nitze thinks it is \ndangerous because he is worried that NATO will get fat and flabby now \nand not be available as a significant military force, were things to go \nback in Russia.\n  I think it is comparing--with all due respect to my learned friend--\napples and oranges.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might, on the time of the Senator \nfrom New York----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon yield time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will take the time jointly of my \ncolleague from New York. I am privileged to be a cosponsor of this \namendment. Of course, I will grant the Senator the opportunity to \nspeak, and then I will follow the Senator from Oregon.\n  The point is, to Senator Biden's comment on the issue of the nuclear \nweapons. The Senator from New York and I are not rattling the nuclear \nsaber and trying to utilize fear as a point. There is a very logical \nargument as it relates just to the Baltics, that that is part of the \nequation if indeed they are admitted, and indeed NATO has to become a \npart of the defense system. But let's put that to one side. What the \nSenator from New York was trying to say, and did say very eloquently, \nis that since 1992 the Russian military, across the board, with the \nexception of their nuclear arsenals, has suffered severe degradation. \nHow well we all know, their officer corps has no housing, their \nmilitary enlisted no pay, and they haven't put a surface ship of any \nsignificant numbers to sea in a long time. The one system that \nthreatens the United States, and always will, is the strategic nuclear \nsystem.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, as the Senator knows, they are routinely \ndismantling that system under Nunn-Lugar, in the face of expansion of \nNATO. I find that fascinating, and I also find it fascinating that they \noverwhelmingly ratified the CWC in the Duma. And as recently as two \nweeks ago, the number two man in the Kremlin is here telling us--excuse \nme, the foreign minister is here in the United States saying, by the \nway, by the end of the summer we are going to ratify START II. I don't \nfail to share the concerns of my friends about the nuclear hair \ntrigger.\n  My point is, as we are talking about expanding NATO, what they have \nbeen doing is exactly the opposite of what is being implied here. They \nhave continued to move forward on arms control agreement, they have \ncontinued to destroy their nuclear arsenal, they have continued to go \nalong with the CFE arms agreement and other treaties and destroyed \ntheir conventional weapons, saying they will no longer abide by the \ndoctrine of no first use, which occurred in 1992 when they realized \nthat all they had left was their nuclear arsenal. That is my point.\n  It is non sequitur to suggest that the reason why we should be \nconcerned is we are expanding NATO. That has nothing to do with it. \nThere is not a shred of evidence of that. Now, there may very well be a \nhardening of positions in the domestic political situation in Russia. \nIt may very well be that the browns and the reds get a little more \nmuscle and the nationalists gain some. I don't think so, but I \nacknowledge that it may be. But their nuclear doctrine is unrelated, \nput in place 5 years before NATO was a glint in the eye of President \nClinton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to my good friend that he is quite \nright in his recitation. There has been an active number of steps taken \nby Russia. We are still in question as to whether the Duma is going to \nmove and approve the pending arms control. I do not yield that point. \nIn an hour or so, I will be addressing the moratorium of 3 years. \nRussia has more or less accepted the fact that, in all likelihood, \nthese 3 nations will come in. But I say to my colleague, they may draw \nthe line with those 3. That is why I am going to ask this body to \nconsider very carefully a time period in which to assess the impact of \nthe 3 before we move forward with further consideration. We will wait \nan hour or so to address that.\n  I take strong disagreement with the fact that the Russians are going \nalong with everything we are doing.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is why the Senator should vote against his first \namendment and for the second amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I find it very humbling to be \namong these giants as a newcomer to this body. I feel something like \nthe student questioning the wisdom of his professor because when it \ncomes to names like Pat Moynihan, John Warner, and Sam Nunn, these are \nmen whom I admire and whom I have read about for years in history \nbooks.\n  Yet, I rise to oppose this amendment for reasons that I think are \nvery, very important. I wonder as we consider the feelings of the \nRussians--and I am not saying those considerations are illegitimate, \nbut what are the feelings of the Pols, the Czechs, and the Hungarians? \nDo they have no right to qualify to self-determination to be a part of \nthe western alliance? I have had officials from all of those countries \ntell me that if they had to choose between the EU or NATO membership, \nthey would take membership in NATO; whether right or wrong, they are \nafraid of Russia. I believe they have a right to qualify to be a part \nof the west. And, yes, strong\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\neconomies are so important; but, frankly, they recognize that security \nprecedes strong economic growth.\n  Madam President, the European Union may be many things, but it is \ncertainly not a substitute for U.S. leadership in Europe. The EU has \nproved time and again that it is incapable of acting together on \nmatters of foreign and security policy. Its military arm, the Western \nEuropean Union, refuses to take action when European interests are \nthreatened and, instead, turns to NATO or individual member states to \naddress problems on the continent of Europe.\n  The political vision of the European Union extends no further than \nits trade interests, shown most recently by its rush to reengage the \nregime in Iran and its refusal to jeopardize commercial contacts by \neven mentioning the civil rights record of the Chinese government.\n  In contrast, for 50 years, NATO has been the defender of freedom and \ndemocracy and has shown that it is willing to make the necessary \nsacrifices to assure the success of these valued principles. In its \nmembership, NATO includes two countries that will apparently never be \nin the European Union--the United States and Canada. It includes \nNorway, which rejected EU membership in a public referendum, and it \nincludes Turkey, whose application to the EU has been repeatedly \nrebuffed.\n  How ironic it would be if we pass an amendment here that says before \nthese countries can be in NATO, they must be in the EU, but, by the \nway, Turkey, which is a member of NATO, apparently will never be a \nmember of the EU. Austria, Finland, and Sweden are all members of the \nEU, with continued neutrality policies. It is not just the different \nmissions of NATO and the EU that made denying NATO enlargement to EU \nmembership untenable, but the different membership of the two \norganizations lead it to take varying positions on issues of importance \nto both.\n  Further, the economies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are \ngrowing faster than almost all of the countries of the European Union. \nConsider some recent statistics that demonstrate the disparity between \nthese 3 countries and the current EU members. In 1997, Italy's \nestimated economic growth rate was 1.5 percent, Germany's was 2.2 \npercent, France's was 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, Poland's growth rate was \nan astounding 7 percent. Hungary's economy grew by a healthy 4 percent. \nGrowth in the Czech Republic was less impressive in 1997, due to severe \nflooding in that country, but their economy is expected to rebound in \n1998. The European Union's regulation, taxes, subsidies, and labor laws \ncould very well hurt the economic development and growth potential of \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. The pursuit of membership in \nthe EU should be a careful decision made by countries in Central and \nEastern Europe and should not be a requirement for NATO membership. \nEven if these countries elect to seek EU membership, the European Union \nhas made it clear that it will take years for them to conform their \nlegislation to the multitude of EU laws and regulations.\n\n  In short, the amendment of my friend from New York is a delaying \ntactic that runs counter to U.S. security interests. Therefore, I \noppose any effort to link NATO enlargement to membership in the \nEuropean Union, and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to follow along. The Senator from \nOregon touched on the historical context of how nations are admitted \ninto NATO, and there was some thought that Turkey--regrettably they are \nnot a member of the EU, but we must remember that at the time Turkey \nwas admitted it was really at the height of the cold war. NATO made the \ndecision that it was imperative. In 1952, Europe was facing the \npinnacle of that tragic period, and Turkey brought with them an \nenormous military strength which was proven.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. On the southern flank.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely right. On the \nsouthern flank. It was in NATO's interest at that time to admit Turkey. \nTurkey, of course, throughout their participation in NATO, has been in \nthe forefront of strength on the southern flank as it is today. It is \nmy hope--indeed, my expectation--that someday the EU will have a \nrealization of that contribution and consider their membership. But I \ndon't think this argument that NATO has admitted nations without EU \nmembership carries any weight in the face of the historical context in \nwhich Turkey was admitted.\n  I wish to engage my colleague from New York. I am privileged to be a \ncosponsor.\n  The struggle today of the three nations that we are considering for \nmembership is not a military one. There is no threat. The \nadministration candidly admits that. I think the Senator from Delaware \nwould admit that there is no significant military threat. Russia today, \nin terms of its land forces, engaged them in the battle of Chechnya. \nThat dragged on for an almost interminable period. It really ended by \nvirtually exhaustion of both sides militarily as opposed to a military \nvictory. Certainly they don't have the forces to mount any aggression \nin the context of a land attack on the three nations the subject of \nwhich we are discussing today. The military put it aside. It is an \neconomic struggle all through the former Warsaw Pact to have their \ndemocracies, to have their participation in a free market system.\n  Along comes the conferring of NATO membership, presumably, on these \nthree nations. Immediately, in my judgment, that gives them a very \nsignificant advantage over the others who are waiting for admission \ninto NATO and the world market. It is not unlike the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation. You put your money in our bank. It is guaranteed \nby the Federal Government. They can advertise in the world market. We \nare now a member of NATO. You build your plant here. Invest your \ndollars in our countries. It is a lot safer than it would be in, say, \nRomania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, or other areas of the world. It is going \nto give them an enormous advantage economically over those nations \npatiently waiting in line. I think it will breed friction. That \nfriction could, indeed, involve confrontation, hopefully not with the \nuse of arms.\n  But I ask my distinguished colleague if he agrees with that thought.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, with a measure of trepidation I hear \nthe former Secretary of the Navy refer to me as a distinguished \ncolleague, I certainly am honored to be with him in this debate, I say \nthat I completely agree. Just the fact of NATO's guarantee of the \nborders of these three countries gives them an advantage over the rest \nof Eastern Europe. That is formidable, among other things.\n  Could I just take a moment to agree that the idea that Turkey can't \nget into the EU is appalling. When we were fighting in Korea in the \nfirst real war of the cold war, the Turks were there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I remember it well because their units \nwere alongside the Marines.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That the Senator from Virginia was in.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was in the air part. I went up to the division, and I \nremember the Turkish units, and they were superb fighters.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I couldn't agree more. The EU should be extending \nmembership to Turkey, in my view. Why not? When Europe was in ruins we \nwent to rescue them by creating NATO. Now, by God, it would be not too \nmuch to hope that their precious Common Agricultural Policy might be \nadjusted to include Poland, if it costs them a little. It would cost \nthem a great deal more if instability returns to Europe.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Of course.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Does this mean that Turkey has to get out of NATO now?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Good. I thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware for \nbringing up that point.\n  But, if I may further engage my friend and colleague, if I had to \nlist my concerns in this debate on this amendment and the others today, \ncost always comes back and rings in my ear, as well as the security of \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, who in \nyears forward\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\nwill be a part of our NATO force. But let's go to cost.\n  I have said it before. The distinguished Senator from Iowa has said \nit. There is a blank check involved in these votes today. EU membership \nwould be a way to evaluate the economic ability of these three \ncountries to meet their financial obligations to NATO. Should those \nfinancial obligations fall short, Madam President, guess who is going \nto pick it up. The United States of America, in participation with \nnations and other countries, by virtue of the EU giving their \nimprimatur on these countries will be further assurance that they will \nhave economic productivity and the like to generate the dollars to meet \ntheir requirements to pay the bill to upgrade their militaries, \nmilitaries which today are largely equipped with old Soviet equipment, \nwhich has to be replaced if you are to have interoperability with the \nNATO forces. All of that is going to be a very, very hefty bill. I \nwould like to see the EU pronounce their economic viability as nations, \nwhich gives us a certain amount of assurance in return that the \nAmerican taxpayer will not be picking up a greater and greater portion \nof their obligation to modernize their forces.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, it must be that I am a little slow on the \nuptake here, because it seems to me that my friends are making my case. \nLet me explain what I mean by that, and they can correct me.\n  First of all, in the Foreign Relations Committee, I recall when we \nhad this vote--and I say it again--in Europe, farm--f-a-r-m--policy \nalways trumps foreign policy. Both have made my point. They acknowledge \nthat. There is no possibility that Europe is going to do the right \nthing. They have not thus far. The reason, in my view, we must stay as \na European power is that they have continued to demonstrate their \nimmaturity over the past, and not much has changed in 50 years in terms \nof the willingness of anyone to lead.\n  If we acknowledge that farm--f-a-r-m--policy always trumps foreign \npolicy in Europe--I challenge anyone to give me an example where it has \nnot--then I ask you: Is this not a red herring? Join EU first before \nyou can get into NATO.\n  The second point I will make: No one knows the history of this nation \nand Europe on this floor better than my friend from New York. As I said \nbefore, and I mean this sincerely, I am always uncomfortable when I am \non the opposite side of an argument with my friend from New York.\n  Let me review very, very briefly the history of NATO and its \nfounding, and the relationship between the economic health of a nation \nbeing invited in, and the ability or the willingness of the United \nStates and other NATO members to invite that nation in.\n  From a policy perspective, NATO membership and EU membership--that is \nwhat this amendment is about, EU membership first before NATO--it is \nsupposed to, and has been suggested by my two friends who are the \nsponsors of this amendment, somehow put the cart before the horse, that \nis, military alliance before economic unity, economic growth, economic \nsecurity.\n  I quote from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee report of 1949, \nthe document that was brought to the floor of the Senate urging us to \nsign the Washington treaty. It said:\n\n       This treaty is designed to contribute toward the further \n     development of peaceful and friendly international \n     relationships, to strengthen free institutions of the \n     parties, and promote better understanding of the principles \n     upon which they are founded, to promote the conditions of \n     stability and well-being, and to encourage economic \n     collaboration. It should facilitate long-term economic \n     recovery through replacing the sense of insecurity by one of \n     confidence in the future.\n\n  That was the original purpose. The original purpose was to promote \neconomic stability. Nobody said then nor has--and I will quote Acheson \nand a few others in a moment. Nobody has said then or at any moment in \nour history since that time that, by the way, a condition of joining \nNATO must be economic integration first, should be economic integration \nfirst, must be a demonstration of a strong economy first. No one has \never said that, including George Kennan. George Kennan argued and \nthought this would promote economic stability as well as military \nsecurity.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my friend yield for a quick question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Does it occur to him that that passage in the Foreign \nRelations report referred to economic cooperation between France and \nGermany, the Schuman Plan?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, it clearly did.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That finally led to the iron and steel community.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It clearly did.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In time to be the European Union?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It clearly did. But they needed military security----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. To be able to ensure their economic stability. There is no \nquestion it referred to that. And there is no question that Acheson, \nreferring to the relationship in 1952, said so in his testimony before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee when he urged Greek and Turkish \nmembership by first recalling that the two nations already joined us in \nan associate status with NATO, as do the countries we are talking about \nnow, and Acheson emphasized that ``the positive action rested not on \ntheir military contributions to the alliance but on their advances in \ndemocracy, rule of law, western orientation and the likelihood that \nNATO membership would deepen this.''\n  The only point I am trying to make is the obvious one we keep \nforgetting. My colleagues who oppose expansion and wish to slow it or \nchange it or alter it come to the floor and argue that this was \nuniquely a military alliance; its soul purpose was to make sure the \nFulda Gap was not wide open for Warsaw Pact units to come pouring \nthrough.\n  That was its essential purpose. It is still its essential purpose. \nBut it was not its only purpose in the beginning, in the middle, in the \nend. And so I would suggest that we tend to intentionally confuse our \ncolleagues and the public when we say that we raise all these questions \nabout the economic stability. The economic stability of the countries \nin question coming in is relevant in terms of whether they can pay \ntheir freight. That is an important question.\n  But this notion of winners and losers, now, I would ask the \nrhetorical question, if in fact by bringing the Czech Republic, Poland \nand Hungary into NATO, that would in fact seriously disadvantage \nRomania, Slovenia, and all the other countries in question, does anyone \never stop to ask themselves the question, why is Romania ardently for \nHungary's membership? Is it because they like being put at an economic \ndisadvantage? Is it because they think this is a good idea; it will \nspur the competitive juices of our people? Is that why? If this is \ngoing to be so debilitating because there is going to be losers, that \nthis is a zero sum game, why are they all for it? Not for it tepidly, \nnot for it on the margins, but for it with an enthusiasm to the degree \nthey send their Foreign Ministers to this country to importune me and \nmany others. Please.\n\n  Now, obviously, they want to get in. They want to get in in the \nfuture. They have no promise of getting in. They have the hope of \ngetting in. But the idea that we are going to debilitate, we are going \nto worsen, we are going to put at a serious disadvantage the economy of \nour other friends seems either to suggest that our other friends are \ntoo stupid to know what their own economic interests are--and they \nclearly are not, in my view--or it is not debilitating to their \neconomies.\n  Madam President, it seems to me if you want to take a further look at \nthis, in 1955, the Foreign Relations Committee report welcomed West \nGermany as ``not only a major step toward the elimination of intra-\nEuropean strife but in a broader sense these agreements provide the \nfoundation for close cooperation and integration among European allies. \nThe committee was impressed with particularly Secretary Dulles' \nstatement on the psychological impact of this association, the \nincreased effectiveness of the sense of duty, and the cohesion which \nwill be brought about in Western Europe by Germany's participation in \nthe Western European Union as well as NATO.''\n  Again, to make the point. Spain, in 1982, bears the closest \nresemblance to the current applicants. Spain, having\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nreturned to democracy only 5 years earlier, believed NATO membership \nwould consolidate Spanish democracy and assist at a lesser cost, as the \nPoles believe, the process of military modernization it had to \nundertake regardless of membership. And aside from geography, Spain was \njudged to offer little in the way of military assets useful to the \nalliance in 1982 prior to the completion of its modernization. Spain \ndid not enter the EU until 1986, 4 years after, 4 years after NATO.\n  Madam President, historically, the economic component of the impact \non the relationship with NATO of a new member state has been considered \nfrom 1949 on, and every time since, and it has been viewed consistently \nas better for the economies of the countries that have been unable to \ngain these larger economic relationships to join NATO first. That has \nbeen a stated purpose of bringing them in as well as the military \ncomponent. Historically, membership in NATO has preceded membership in \nthe European Common Market, or any economic grouping, in every \ninstance.\n\n  Reserving the remainder of my time by saying this--when I finish this \none comment. Why in the Lord's name would we, unless we just were \nsimply flat against expanding NATO--which I understand. If this is \ndesigned as a killer amendment, it is a good strategy, but the logic of \nit I am lost in trying to comprehend. I find no logic to it, other than \nit being a killer amendment. You might as well attach an antiabortion \namendment to the treaty. That would kill it. I don't want to give \nanybody any ideas. In this place, it may generate some ideas, but not \nby any of the Members on the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Hyperbole. Hyperbole.\n  Mr. BIDEN. But--it is hyperbole that I am engaging in now, it was \njust pointed out by my friend from New York. But let me tell you what \nis not hyperbole. There is no historical precedent for this. There is \nno logical rationale as to why this would, in fact, facilitate NATO \nmembership down the road, because we all know farm policy will prevail \nover foreign policy.\n  And lastly, I respectfully suggest that it bears no relationship, no \nrelationship whatsoever, to anything anyone in the past has thought was \nnecessary to strengthen NATO--none, zero, none, historically, \npolitically, economically, socially, in any way. It may be a good idea, \nand I have been battling the Europeans, in my capacity as the chairman \nof or the ranking member of the European Affairs Subcommittee, for \nyears, to ``do the right thing. Do the right thing. Let your brothers \nin.''\n  Let me point out, if tomorrow you went to the Russians and said, ``I \nhave a deal for you; here is what we are going to do: All those \nEuropean countries or former satellite states will become part of the \nEU and you will never be a member of the EU; or they will not be \nmembers of the EU, but they will be members of NATO, which you may be \nable to do; you choose''--there is not an economist, there is not a \ndemocrat, in Russia who would choose the former over the latter, in my \nhumble opinion, not a one.\n  So the fear--if you are worried about Russia being isolated, then \nisolate Russia economically from the rest of Europe as a condition \nbefore they can enter, anyone can enter, NATO.\n  The Europeans may grow beyond that and show their largess and bring \nin Russian farmers and all that wheat--all that wheat, as we give them \nthe technological capability and the transportation infrastructure to \nbe able to transport it to Europe. You watch. You watch. I am willing \nto bet any of you anything you would like, the likelihood of the EU \nbeing economically generous, extending any largess to the East, is \nzero, as distinguished from this defensive military alliance that \nprovides political security for Russia on her border and diminishes the \nrealistic prospect that any demagoguing nationalist will be able to \ninflame people enough to think that they could, in fact, realize any \ndead dreams.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, first I ask the Parliamentarian to \nadvise the Senate with regard to the balance of the remaining time, if \nthe Chair would address that issue, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 2 minutes remaining, and \nthe Senator has 3 minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course, I urge the proponent of the pending amendment \nto proceed with the remainder of his time. Then we have the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey, who has been patiently waiting. \nAt the appropriate moment, if the Chair will advise the Senator from \nVirginia, I will introduce my amendment, which then begins a 2-hour \ntime equally divided. I am certain the leadership entrusted to us the \nmanagement of these two amendments in such a way that we stay on \nschedule, because the Senate has a very heavy load with regard to this \ntreaty for the remainder of the day. I personally said to the \nleadership--and I will stand by it--we will do everything we can to see \nthat this vote, final vote on this treaty, is cast tonight in a timely \nway, hopefully earlier than later, to accommodate a number of Members.\n\n  I yield the floor at the moment. The distinguished Senator from New \nYork is seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, may I express my gratitude to the \nSenator from Delaware for his thoughtful comments. Might I simply \nrespond that the behavior of the Western Europeans and the European \nUnion has been self-interested. But perhaps, after half a century of \nour defending them, having in the first instance liberated them, we \nmight hope for a more open view.\n  For half a century, half the defense expenditure of the United States \nhas gone to NATO. I believe that is correct--half. We have had American \ntroops on the Rhine since 1944. That, Madam President, is the stuff of \nRoman Legions. But out of that commitment which we have made--an \nunparalleled act of generosity and self-interest, but informed self-\ninterest and extraordinary generosity--has grown a vibrant and wealthy \nEuropean community. On Saturday, many of its members will form a common \ncurrency. It is not too much to ask them to do themselves and Europe \nthe favor of extending membership to these newly independent nations. I \ncan imagine that they will if we make the effort. We are the ones who \nfirst came along with the proposal to expand NATO and therefore expand \nAmerican force. Isn't a half-century enough? I would have thought it \nwas. I would not give up hope that we might see some enlightened self-\ninterest in Brussels. There is really reason to hope for that.\n  When the Senator from Delaware mentioned the economic divisions of \nthe Washington treaty as reported by the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthey were talking about the Schuman Plan, an unheard of plan to have \nFrance and Germany unite in a common market--common production of iron \nand steel and the coal that goes with it. The disputes over Alsace-\nLorraine, which they fought over for all those years, might come to an \nend. It did. And it could happen again.\n  I thank the Chair. I very much appreciate the courtesy that has been \nshown to Senator Warner and myself. I see Senator Torricelli is on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Madam President, the Treaty of Rome wasn't until the mid-1950s, and \nit was unheard of in 1949, as the Schuman Plan was. The only point I am \nmaking is, any cooperation in Europe was one of the purposes of NATO; \nit was to encourage that cooperation. But what they had in mind in May \nof 1949 may have been only the Schuman Plan and/or something else. The \nEU wasn't even around until the mid-1950s. That wasn't even thought of \neither.\n  So the whole notion was that economic cooperation in Europe produced \nstability, enhanced democracy, and, in turn, allowed for military \nsecurity. It is still the case.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 30 seconds of the time has expired. The \nSenator has all the remaining time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I beg your pardon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to my friend from Texas the remainder of time on \nthis amendment, if I may yield him a total of 5 minutes, whatever that \ntakes off of\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\nthe Warner amendment--if I am able to do that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, whenever the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from Virginia offer an amendment, we know it is well reasoned \nand we know it is well intended and so I think, as a result, we are \nalways correct in being cautious in opposing such an amendment.\n  But I am opposed to this amendment because, while I think their \nargument is well reasoned as far as it goes--it is certainly well \nintended--I think it is an amendment which does not belong in this \nlegislation and which is fundamentally destructive.\n  If our colleagues want to encourage the European Union to expand and \nto grant membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, I am \nfor that. I think that EU membership expansion to Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic should occur, I strongly support it, and if we were \nvoting on that issue, and that issue alone, I would vote for this \namendment.\n  I remind my colleagues that NATO membership today is not made up of \ncountries that are solely members of the European economic community. \nIceland, Norway, Turkey, Canada and the United States are not members \nof the European Union. I, for one, would support American membership in \nthe European Union, but I don't think they are going to let us join.\n  Might I say that while we are encouraging the European Union to \nexpand its membership, we ought to start with Turkey. It is absolutely \noutrageous that the opposition of one country is preventing Turkey from \nhaving an opportunity to be part of the European economic community \nwhen Turkey has been an anchor of NATO for 46 years, when Turkey did as \nmuch as any other country to keep Ivan back from the gate, when Turkey \nprovides the largest land army of any European NATO nation. These \ncontributions ultimately helped check the Soviet expansion and through \nthe power of ideas and freedom tore down the Berlin Wall, liberated \nEastern Europe, and freed more people than any victory in any war in \nthe history of mankind.\n  If our objective is to start urging the European Union to expand its \nmembership as a precondition for membership in NATO, let's begin by \nurging them to expand their membership to nations which are already \npart of NATO and which contributed greatly to winning the cold war.\n  I think this is an arbitrary distinction that does not belong in this \nbill. If we want to do something to encourage the European Union to \nexpand, I am in favor of that. I would certainly vote for a resolution \nurging them to expand, to take in Poland and Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic, but I think we ought to begin with Turkey.\n  But that is not what is before us today. What is before us today is a \nfundamental decision as to whether we are going to let an arbitrarily \ndrawn line, a line drawn by Stalin in Europe through the Iron Curtain \nat the end of World War II, stand as a permanent division of Europe in \nterms of military alliance.\n  I am not oblivious to concerns that have been raised about the cost \nof expanding NATO. I am not oblivious to other concerns with regard to \nRussia and to its response, but in the end, I am sway by the argument \nthat we should not allow communism, which is now on the ash heap of \nhistory, to determine the composition of our military alliance in \nEurope. Therefore, I intend to vote to expand NATO, but I do not \nbelieve that that expansion should be conditioned on membership in the \nEuropean Union.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that Austria, Finland, Ireland, and \nSweden are members of the European Union, but they are not members of \nNATO.\n  This is a clear-cut choice. I think this amendment is the wrong thing \nto do, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it would be a great mistake to condition the \nfuture of the NATO, a transatlantic military alliance of unparalleled \nsuccess led by the United States, to actions and decisions of the \nEuropean Union. The EU is a strictly European political-economic \norganization of which the United States is not a member and has no say. \nFor this reason, it is with great regret that I stand in opposition to \nmy good friend, the Senator from New York, and urge my colleagues to \nvote against this amendment.\n  EU enlargement is highly desirable on its own merits. Indeed, the \nResolution of Ratification specifically states it is the policy of the \nUnited States to encourage EU enlargement.\n  However, as worthy as EU enlargement is, it should not be formally \nlinked to NATO enlargement. Nor should EU membership serve as a \ncondition for NATO aspirants. Let me emphasize three basic reasons:\n  First, this amendment is inconsistent with the Washington Treaty. \nArticle 10 of the Treaty states that membership in NATO is open to, and \nI quote, ``any European State in a position to further the principles \nof this treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic \narea.''\n  The North Atlantic Treaty makes no mention of the European Union. \nMoreover, several NATO member states are not EU members, including the \nUnited States, Canada, Turkey, Iceland and Norway. Are they any less \neffective members of the Alliance because they are not part of the EU? \nThe answer is unambiguously NO.\n  And what if Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic decide, as Norway \nhas--a founding member of NATO-- that membership in the European Union \nin not in their interests? I point this out to highlight that this \namendment establishes an arbitrary standard that is not necessarily a \nreflection of a NATO aspirant's state of economic and political well-\nbeing.\n  Second, Mr President, by conditioning NATO membership on attainment \nof EU membership, this amendment would strip the Alliance of control \nover its own future--specifically its decisions over future \nmembership--and transfer it over the European Union. The EU is not a \ntransatlantic organization. It has no effective security or defense \ncapability or policy for that matter. Let us not forget, it was a \ncomplete failure in the effort to end to the conflict in Bosnia. Do we \nreally want the EU to have such significant influence over NATO?\n  And, let us not over look the fact that this amendment could well \nsuspend NATO enlargement indefinitely. EU enlargement is far from \ncertain. It is far from clear when the EU will extend its membership to \nPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. It could be a decade, if not \nmore for all we know. There are still significant political forces and \neconomic interests within the EU deeply opposed to EU enlargement.\n  Third, this amendment would undercut U.S. leadership of NATO by \nrelegating the United States--and the United States Senate for that \nmatter--to a second class tier of Alliance members. Why? because NATO \nmembers who are not in the European Union would be denied the same \nvoice and authority over the future of the Alliance that this amendment \nwould reserve for those NATO countries that are members of the European \nUnion.\n  In one fell swoop, this amendment would: impose an unprecedented \nrestriction upon the Washington Treaty; transfer key decisions over \nNATO's future to the EU, an European institution that lacks an \neffective security policy; demote the United States to a new second-\nclass tier of Alliance members; and, thereby weaken U.S. leadership of \nNATO.\n  I am sure that these are not the intentions behind this amendment, \nbut they would clearly be the consequences. My colleagues, we have no \nchoice but to vote this amendment down.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, from a strictly American foreign policy \nviewpoint, requiring EU membership first is sheer folly. Why would we \nwant to place such a key element of our national security \ndecisionmaking in the hands of the European Union--an organization to \nwhich we do not belong?\n  Already we are seeing the EU members disagreeing over how quickly \nthose invited should be allowed in.\n  To give the EU, in effect, a veto over NATO membership, might \nencourage the creation of an EU caucus within NATO, limiting the United \nStates'\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nability to advance our diplomatic and military goals in the committees \nof the Alliance.\n  Moreover, advocates of this amendment have misunderstood the \nimportance of NATO membership prior to EU membership, both from a \npolicy and historical context.\n  From a policy perspective, NATO membership in advance of EU \nmembership will provide the security these countries need to continue \ntheir economic reforms and help to ensure a climate of confidence \nessential for continued foreign investment and economic integration.\n  From a historical perspective, in all its reports on all three rounds \nof NATO enlargements that took place from 1952 to 1982, the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee cited European economic development and \nintegration as one key benefit of expanding NATO's zone of stability.\n  I would like to briefly quote from these Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reports:\n  1949 Report establishing NATO:\n\n       The treaty is designed to contribute toward the further \n     development of peaceful and friendly international relations, \n     to strengthen the free institutions of the parties and \n     promote better understanding of the principles upon which \n     they are founded, to promote conditions of stability and \n     well-being, and to encourage economic collaboration. It \n     should facilitate long-term economic recovery through \n     replacing the sense of insecurity by one of confidence in the \n     future.\n       The Committee believes that the [1949] North Atlantic Pact, \n     by providing the means for cooperation in matters of common \n     security and national defense, creates a favorable climate \n     for further steps toward progressively closer European \n     integration * * *\n\n  In 1952, Secretary of State Acheson, in his testimony before the \nForeign Relations Committee, urged NATO membership for Greece and \nTurkey first by recalling that these two nations already enjoyed an \nassociate status with NATO's activities in the Eastern Mediterranean. \nIt was in response to Athens' and Ankara's formal request--their belief \nthat associate status was inadequate to their national defense needs--\nthat they were favorably considered for NATO membership. Acheson \nemphasized that positive action rested not only on their military \ncontributions to the Alliance, but on their advances in democracy, rule \nof law, and Western orientation, and the likelihood that NATO \nmembership would deepen this.\n  It should be noted that Greece did not enter the European Union until \nnearly twenty years after its accession to NATO. Turkish membership in \nthe EU remains a contentious, unresolved issue. Are we supposed to kick \nTurkey out of NATO because it doesn't belong to the EU?\n  The 1955 Foreign Relations Committee report welcomed West German \naccession:\n\n     * * * not only as a major step toward the elimination of \n     intra-European strife but in a broader sense, these \n     agreements provide the foundation for close cooperation and \n     integration among European allies . . . The Committee was \n     impressed in particular with Secretary Dulles' statement on \n     the psychological impact of this association--the increased \n     effectiveness and the sense of unity and cohesion which will \n     be brought about in Western Europe by German participation in \n     NATO and the Western European Union.\n\n  Of all the examples, the last one--Spanish accession to NATO in \n1982--bears the closest resemblance to that of the current applicants.\n  Spain, having returned to democracy only five years earlier, believed \nthat NATO membership would help consolidate Spanish democracy and \nassist, at lesser cost, a process of military modernization it had to \nundertake regardless of membership.\n  Aside from its geography, Spain was judged to offer little in the way \nof military assets useful to the Alliance in 1982 prior to the \ncompletion of its modernization.\n  Nevertheless, in favorably reporting Spanish accession to NATO to the \nfull Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee recorded a brief exchange \nbetween then-Chairman Charles Percy and then-State Department European \nBureau Chief Larry Eagleburger explaining why Spanish accession to NATO \nwas so important to broad U.S. national security interests. Because \nthis exchange is so similar to our situation today, I would like to \nquote from it. Chairman Percy noted:\n\n       At a time when NATO's cohesiveness and viability is being \n     critically questioned in the press, I find Spain's NATO \n     membership application a reaffirmation of the fundamental \n     principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a group \n     of sovereign nations sharing common values and aspirations \n     and committed to working together despite differences to \n     guarantee the security, prosperity, and defense of Western \n     democracy.\n\n  Assistant Secretary Eagleburger replied:\n\n     * * * in terms of that question of Spanish democracy, it is \n     terribly important that we do everything we can to tie Spain \n     to Western institutions, to have those people be able to deal \n     with Western parliamentarians who also have a commitment to \n     democracy * * * Every tie we can create between Spain and \n     Western Europe and the United States, institutional tie, in \n     fact, I think, strengthens the whole process of democracy in \n     Spain.\n\n  Spain did not enter the EU until 1986, four years after accession to \nNATO.\n  Historically, membership in NATO has preceded membership in European \ncommon market or economic integration groupings.\n  It is much easier to develop habits of cooperation in common defense \nas a precursor to the much more complex negotiations leading to \neconomic integration.\n  If we wait for the EU to act, we may be waiting for a long time. For \nexample according to recent polls, the Austrian public opposes EU \nmembership for four of the five recent EU invitees.\n  Finally, recent history has shown that, in European capitals, when \npresented with a choice between farm policy and foreign policy, farm \npolicy always wins.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, I oppose the Moynihan amendment \nand urge my colleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized to \noffer an amendment if he chooses to do so.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2322\n\n (Purpose: To express a condition regarding the further enlargement of \n                                 NATO)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof myself and the distinguished senior Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan. We are joined by Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Hutchison and Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Moynihan, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Hutchison and Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an executive amendment numbered 2322.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in section 2 of the resolution, \n     insert the following:\n       (  ) United states policy regarding further enlargement of \n     nato.--Prior to the date of deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate that it is the policy of the United States not to \n     encourage, participate in, or agree to any further \n     enlargement of NATO for a period of at least three years \n     beginning on the earliest date by which Poland, Hungary, and \n     the Czech Republic have all acceded to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment by the senior Senator from New York and myself and on my \namendment in which I am joined by the senior Senator from New York, the \ntwo amendments which are before the Senate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request on both \namendments? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I point out in the beginning that this \namendment does not affect the decision with respect to Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic, nor does this amendment concede what I believe \nis the right thing to do in voting against the admission of those \ncountries. But this amendment is sent to the desk simply because, in \nrecognition of the reality, through conversations personally between \nmyself and many, many Members of this Chamber, indeed, with the \nPresident and the Secretary of State and many others, the likelihood \nthat the resolution of ratification will be approved.\n  Given that reality, I think it is imperative that this body have \nbefore it an amendment, which has just been\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nsent to the desk, which indicates there will be a pause, so to speak, a \nstrategic pause of 3 years only before our country, our President, \nwhoever will be President at that point in time, can agree to accession \nof additional countries.\n  Mr. President, I established in my opening statement my strong \nallegiance to NATO in the past, and now and forevermore that I am \nprivileged to be a Member of this body. I said the importance of \nAmerica to have a voice, and how this treaty for 49 years has surpassed \nthe expectations of all and remains the most important military \ndocument apart from our own Constitution in many ways, and that is why \nI ask for these 3 years. I will recite the reasons, one, two and three.\n  Should not another President duly elected by the people of the United \nStates have a voice in further modifications by virtue of further \naccession of additional nations to this alliance?\n  If the Good Lord gives me the strength and the breath in the \nconsideration of that next Presidential election, I will do everything \nwithin my power to make sure that is an issue that is debated among \nthose candidates seeking that high office. Regrettably, in the last \nelection very little attention was given to national security policy. \nBut the world is rapidly changing. The world is becoming a more \ndangerous place. Indeed, in the next election I will do my part, as I \nam sure others will likewise, to see that the security policy of our \nNation and the free nations of the world will be a subject of \ndiscussion in that election.\n  I think the next President should be given the opportunity to assess \nthe merits and such disadvantages as may arise by virtue of the \naccession of three more nations before we leap forward under pressure, \nwhich will be unrelenting. That pressure will begin the day 1 year from \nnow when these three nations will be accessed. That pressure will begin \nthe day after. The bugles will sound. The march will begin to bring in \nother nations perhaps numbering as many as nine.\n  I say to my colleagues, should not the next President be given the \nopportunity to study the record, make an assessment, and then give his \nadvice or her advice, as the case may be, to the people of the United \nStates?\n  That is my first reason for asking for reasonable delay of but 3 \nyears. This amendment will avoid that stampede. This amendment in \nfairness will say to the other nations it is not only to the advantage \nof the NATO countries but, indeed, it is to the advantage of the other \nnations to let this experiment ferment for a period to determine the \npurity, or the lack thereof, of the decision.\n  Then I turn to a second reason. That is the cost. Whether it is $1.5 \nbillion over the next 2 years or $125 billion, there will be no piece \nof evidence before this body which has sound credibility as to the cost \nassociated with accession of these three nations.\n  This afternoon we will have further amendments on the question of \ncost. But we are dealing from an unknown. NATO is studying the question \nof cost, and is studying the question of the degree to which these \nnations must rebuild and modernize their military. But those studies \nwill not be available until later this summer. Yet our vote will be \ntaken before the sun falls on this day on two very vital pieces of \ninformation, totally lacking. We have, therefore, a blank check. We do \nnot know the cost now. We will not know for months even the opinion of \nthe NATO Council, which is really the organization that can best \nevaluate these costs. But there is credible evidence on both sides. The \nrange of costs go from $1.5 billion over 2 years to $125 billion.\n  I want to touch a sensitive nerve among my distinguished colleagues. \nThose listening and those advising Members might just take their pencil \nand put a little asterisk by this point.\n  America is in its 14th year of decline of funding to the U.S. Armed \nForces of the United States, a collective decision by a series of \nPresidents. This is not a political argument. We have irrefutable \nevidence that our Armed Forces today are behind in their modernization \nprogram. They are stretched too thin. They are over committed \nworldwide. We see that in the retention rates. There is all sorts of \nmounting evidence that we are asking our military to do the same as \nthey have boldly and bravely for years with less and less--less in \ndollars, less time at home with their families, and with fewer and \nfewer pieces of equipment.\n  Shipbuilding: A handful of combat ships every year in the budget. We \nare rapidly approaching a Navy that could be well below the 300-plus, a \nfew ships of today, in the year 2000. We, a maritime nation faced with \nthat small Navy. Dollars from the American taxpayer profits have been, \nare being, and will be committed to these three nations.\n  We have been contributing money regularly to the establishment and \nrefurbishment of their military at the same time we are denying to our \nmilitary what, in my opinion, are the necessary dollars to perform \ntheir mission. We will be taking those dollars and putting them through \nNATO into other nations, the three that are our subject, for their \nmilitary, to help them come up so that they have the capability to take \non a full partnership commensurate with their size in the NATO \nalliance. Think about it. You are taking from your military and giving \nto another military.\n  Now, as a part of the consideration of this year's military \nauthorization bill, there will be discussion, indeed, there could be \nlegislation, about a future base closure. That should ring a bell--a \nfuture round of base closures in the United States. That should get the \nattention of some Members.\n  Secretary of Defense Cohen has made an admirable and, in my judgment, \na credible appeal to the Congress of the United States to address that \nquestion and address it now. If we do not, he has little alternative \nbut to literally starve a base, turn off the current, transfer the \npeople, and leave the buildings standing unattended because he is \nproperly exercising his judgment that the dollars are needed for \nmodernization, the dollars are needed for the ever-rising number of \ncommitments beyond our shores rather than keeping in place a base that \nno longer contributes to our overall national security.\n  Tough decision. What do you say, colleagues, when you go home to \ndefend a base closing in your State, as you will do and as you are duty \nbound to, and at the same time we are contributing money to build new \nbases in these three countries, and unless my amendment passes I \ndaresay in other countries in a very short period of time.\n  They have to modernize more so than the United States. They have to \ntake their old infrastructure which was designed for Soviet military \ntactics, take their old tanks and artillery pieces which are, by and \nlarge, old Soviet weaponry and modernize so they have interoperability \nas a nation with NATO.\n  That is a further drain on the American taxpayer at the very time \nwhen in your State the next round of base closures may have a potential \nimpact. And you will be fairly asked by your constituents: do you mean \nto tell me they are closing our beloved hometown base that has been \nhere defending America all these years and you are helping to build \nbases abroad? Do you not have a conflict?\n  Those are questions that are fairly to be asked in the not too \ndistant future if we allow a stampede of three now and three in the \nnext 18 months and three thereafter, up to as many as 28 nations \npotentially to join NATO.\n  We are also asked to approve this measure without full knowledge as \nto the strategic concept of what NATO is and is not going to do in the \nyears to come. We are operating under a 1991 doctrine today. Listen to \nthe Secretary of State, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri \npointed out yesterday, who desires to expand the missions of NATO far \nbeyond the borders of their nations, to be involved in the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There may be some merit. \nBut should we not fully have in mind before we begin to add country \nafter country what is to be the mission of NATO?\n  Ironically, it is not until 1 year from this month, April, at the \nsummit at which these three nations will be admitted when NATO will \nfinalize the doctrine for the future. Yet, we are asked to vote today \nto change the bases of this treaty by virtue of new membership not \nknowing the risks that will face the men and women of the U.S. Armed \nForces as well as the other NATO nations. I ask you, is that the way to \ndo business? Not in my\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\njudgment. And that is why I say if three are a reality, then we should \nstop and study a reasonable period of time. Let another President, let \nthe American people in the context of the next election, let the \nAmerican people at that time have a careful examination of what NATO \nbrings forth a year from today as to the new mission and adoption. \nThose are just reasonable requests. And time, and time alone, can \nestablish the record on which those important decisions can be made. \nThree years, in my judgment, is not an unreasonable period of time.\n\n  Lastly, I refer to Russia, not in the sense that I fear Russia, not \nin the sense that Russia--and I have said this consistently--should \nhave any veto power as to any decision which is in the security \ninterests of the United States of America. The Founding Act was \nestablished, I think, as a quid pro quo for the accession of these \nthree nations. Russia signed on. But there is mounting evidence that \nyou cross over and begin another three, and particularly when you get \nto the Balkans, all the arguments which we have heard in favor of \nvoting yea tonight will fall. I believe this Chamber will resonate with \ndeep concern as reflected by the instabilities in Russia that could \nexist in the year 2000 when they are moving on possibly to another \npolitical structure, another President. There is a great deal of \nuncertainty in Russia today--economically, politically, and \nmilitarily--in their struggle to survive as a fledgling democracy, as \nthey struggle to survive in a free-market world, and I think the next \nPresident should be given the opportunity to make an assessment as to \nthe measure of threat posed by Russia in the context of any further \naccession of new nations to this most valuable of all treaties. Time \nand time alone can achieve that purpose.\n  So they should not have a veto. We do not act out of fear. But we act \nout of reality, that that is the only nation that possesses weaponry \nwhich poses a direct threat to the United States of America; namely, \ntheir strategic forces. You cannot be unmindful of that fact.\n  Therefore, I think a period of 3 years is appropriate to allow \nanother President, to allow the studies to be performed, to allow the \nAmerican people to better understand the value of this NATO alliance \nand what should be done for the future, and, therefore, I respectfully \nask my colleagues to consider to vote in favor of the Warner-Moynihan \namendment for a 3-year moratorium.\n  Mr. President, other Senators have been waiting patiently. I wish to \ncontinue my remarks and will do so momentarily. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey has been here for some time. \nTherefore, I yield him 10 minutes off the time under the control of the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Virginia and, \nindeed, the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, in each of their \namendments and speak to them today.\n  It is, I think, worth noting that the decision before this Senate is \nneither new nor without the apprehension that should come with historic \nexperience.\n  On March 31, 1939, Neville Chamberlain rose in the British Parliament \nand announced unambiguously, unequivocally, the British will defend the \nPolish frontier with the threat of war. To be certain, it was a war \nthat inevitably was going to be fought and should have been fought. But \nwhat is instructive about the experience, as Winston Churchill later \nnoted, ``Here was a decision at last taken at the worst possible moment \nand on the least satisfactory ground.''\n  More than a generation later, the Senate has a chance to ask all the \nquestions that were not asked in the British Parliament on that day, \nbecause before this Senate is the most solemn question that the \nrepresentatives of any free people can ever ask.\n  We are pledging the good name of this country to go to war, to \nconsume the lives of our sons and our daughters for the defense of \nanother people. That does not mean it is a pledge that sometimes should \nnot be made. Maybe it should be made in this instance. But there are \nquestions that should be raised that are the foundation of the \namendments offered by the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan.\n  Those questions are, in my judgment, whether or not, having made this \npledge, the United States and our NATO allies genuinely have the \nmilitary capability, in our resources, to fulfill the obligation, \nwhether or not the United States and our NATO allies have the political \nwill to lend credibility to this pledge, and whether or not this \npromise of defense enhances or detracts from the general security of \nthe United States and the NATO alliance.\n  Let me begin, Mr. President, by addressing the question of the \nmilitary feasibility of this most expansive American pledge to defend \nother nations since the NATO alliance itself and the Japanese-American \nsecurity agreement. Indeed, this expansion of our security guarantee is \nbased on an unspoken but a very real sense of a change in historic \nrealities in this Chamber. It is based on the belief that Russia is \nweakened, an historic opportunity has arisen, and that the views of \nRussia are either no longer relevant or that she is without choice in \nthis question.\n  Mr. President, the current state of affairs with regard to the \nmilitary and economic power of Russia is an aberration. Russia has been \na great power for more than 1,000 years; and it will be a great power \nagain. Its affairs are part of the calculus of American security and \ncannot be discounted.\n  It is a nation of nearly 150 million people with over 6.5 million \nsquare miles of territory. It possesses 40 percent of the world's \nnatural gas reserves and rivals any power on Earth as a source of \nnatural resources, including petroleum. Russia is a technological \nleader. It is a major industrial power. And it continues, in spite of \nits current economic difficulties, as the only source of military \ntechnology, production and power that potentially rivals the United \nStates.\n  So, Mr. President, there may be many things uncertain about the \nfuture, but this much is certain: Russia will continue in the future to \nbe a great power. And yet while it may not be spoken on this floor, \nthis calculation of immediately extending the American security \numbrella to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary is based on the \ncalculation that at some point Russia might be a threat to their \nfrontiers, and we will provide for its defense.\n  Mr. President, I know us as Americans to be an ambitious people and a \nconfident people. But this is an extraordinary guarantee the people of \nthe United States are extending to these three new democracies in \nEastern Europe.\n  No nation in history has been able to defend against the territorial \nambitions of Russia when she was an imperial or in an imperialistic \nmode. It is worth noting, from Napoleon to the Third Reich, people have \nmiscalculated on their abilities to deal with Russian ambitions in \nEastern Europe.\n  Russia was challenged in the borders of Poland by the Third Reich and \n162 divisions of the Wehrmacht. We are an ambitious people, Mr. \nPresident. The U.S. Army today, 4,000 miles from our borders, has three \ndivisions.\n  What military means is it by which we are going to give credibility \nto this pledge? Not next year, not 10 years, not at some point in the \nfuture, but the day this treaty is signed. Three divisions, half a \nworld away on the borders of Russia herself?\n  There is, Mr. President, another irony to this military pledge \nrelated to the comments of the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, in noting \nthat in some ways the current borders of NATO are a relic of the Iron \nCurtain of Josef Stalin. Well, now, Mr. President, we are to draw a new \nline. And it may have its benefactors and its beneficiaries. But what \nof those nations not inside this new line? The great lesson of Yalta \nwas that those nations that fell on the other side of the line were \nlost to a Stalinist equation and calculation that they were now in a \nnew sphere of influence.\n  This Senate is faced with a question of tomorrow, next month, this \nyear, drawing a new line in Europe that may bring Poland and the Czech \nRepublic and Hungary in, but leaves the Baltics and Romania and the \nUkraine out. How would a future adversary, not in a democratic Russia \nbut in a possible\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nsuccessor Government, interpret this new sphere of influence? Not as a \ncheck on ambitions but as an invitation to ambitions?\n  Equally important, I believe, Mr. President, from my first, and in \nthis instance, military review of this instance, is that we are \nentering ourselves again into a military calculation that for 50 years \nwe have wanted to escape. Because if we are to make this pledge of \ndefending these three new democracies, and we do so with three \ndivisions of the U.S. Army and no indigenous military capability \nwhatsoever, we are entering into, again, something which we feared and \nhave so fought to escape. The only means of defending these governments \nis through atomic weapons. We are pledging unmistakably a nuclear \nexchange to defend the Polish frontier from possible future invasion. \nIt is where we were during the cold war with New York for Berlin, \nChicago for Paris, San Francisco for Rome.\n  It is easy to make the pledge, Mr. President. The question is whether \nto do so without military resources is responsible. It is not simply \nthat our own resources are insufficient. My friend, the Senator from \nDelaware, has drawn a parallel between this expansion and the initial \nNATO treaty or expansions in other instances. In this instance, we are \nnot joining in mutual defense with the British army or the Germans or \nthe French; we are pledging to defend Poland, whose armed forces \nconsist of 1,700 Soviet tanks designed for the 1950s and 1960s, a \nHungarian air force which will contribute to its own security 50 aging \nSoviet MIG fighters, and the Czech air force whose pilots fly an \naverage of 40 hours a year in training for their own self-defense.\n  The Senate can make this judgment. You can decide to extend the \nAmerican security umbrella all over Eastern Europe, even though there \nare insufficient American forces to contribute to their defense, and \nrely on indigenous forces. But at least make the decision based on the \nreality that there are no indigenous forces. It is a military pledge \nwithout military capability.\n  Second is the issue of whether or not there is the political will in \nthe United States and in Western Europe to give this promise meaning. \nThe NATO treaty is the most successful military alliance in history. At \na time when the Soviet Union had overwhelming military means, it was \nthe foundation of the defense of Western Europe, but it was not based \non the fact that the United States signed a treaty. It was based on \nhistoric and economic realities. Through two world wars the American \npeople had demonstrated they were prepared to defend one Europe because \nthey believed that the security of Western Europe and the United States \nwere inseparable. Our quality of life, our security, our economic \nfuture could not be distinguished from Great Britain, France, in the \nfirst instance, Italy and Germany and other member states at other \ntimes.\n  In a free society, the President of the United States may sign a \ntreaty pledging to defend Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, but \nif the economic realities are not such that the American people believe \nthat our futures are indistinguishable, it is a dangerous promise \nbecause it is a hollow pledge.\n  The reality is today that there may be a time when each of these \nrepublics have sufficient economic intercourse with the United States \nand Western Europe that we believe they are part of the Western \nalliance by economic and cultural and historic definition and this \npledge has meaning. But no one can argue--indeed, this is the \nfoundation of the rationale of the amendment by Senators Moynihan and \nWarner--no one can argue that that reality is true today.\n  Total economic intercourse with the Czech Republic today is .09 \npercent of American exports.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield 10 additional minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. I grant another minute and a half.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Is that all the time the Senator has?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has other time under his control, but there \nare a number of Senators who wish to speak. Perhaps, if there is more \ntime in the course of this debate, I am certain both sides would be \nhappy to have the contribution of the Senator.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, no one can argue that we have reached that state of \neconomic dependency at the moment. That is the rationale of the delay, \nto allow these bonds to form and to give this pledge meaning.\n  Finally, the foundation of American security in this generation and \nas far as the eye can see is the Russian-American relationship. Any \njudgment we make which enhances Russian democracy enhances American \nsecurity. Most fundamental to this debate is the fact that Eastern \nEurope and the NATO alliance's first line of defense is the Russian \nballot box. If Russia is democratic and capitalistic and free, Eastern \nEurope is secure. If it is not, no force on Earth is going to defend \nthe Ukraine, the Baltics, or even these republics.\n  I believe strongly this pledge and this NATO expansion will be \nenhanced by both of these amendments. I accept the reality that NATO is \ngoing to be expanded, but I believe it is a more responsible judgment \nif we address these questions, allow for this delay. I believe it would \nlead to a better expansion of NATO, and we would be pleased and proud \nthat we made these exceptions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator from New Jersey leaves the floor, I \nwant to briefly make two points. I find his argument absolutely \nfascinating that economic dependence or integration with the United \nStates is a prerequisite for NATO membership. I wonder if he could \nexplain to me what that dependence was we had with Norway or that \ndependence we have with Denmark or Portugal or Spain?\n\n  As each came in, as each of these nations came in, if there is a \nnotion that there is a prerequisite of an economic dependency--we have \nmore invested in Poland, more in Poland now than we did at the time of \nthese countries coming in.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator will yield, I would be glad to address \neach of those.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me make a second point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the time be allocated?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I make a point, I have the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I appreciate that, but the Senator asked a question \nthat deserves to be answered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I also find this notion, and it is repeated in different \nways but never in a more articulate fashion than just done by my friend \nfrom New Jersey, no force on Earth will be able to defend Poland or the \nBaltics, and he may have mentioned another country, Ukraine, if Russia \nis not a democracy.\n  One of the secondary reasons why people want to expand NATO is \nbecause we fundamentally reject that notion, but fundamentally reject \nthe notion that if things ``go south,'' to use the colloquial \nexpression, in Russia, that someone will be there to never let it \nhappen to Poland again, just like we defended Germany, just like we \ndefended Turkey, just like we defended Norway.\n  Now, I am going to, at a later point, speak at length about this iron \nring notion my friend from Virginia and my friend from New York talk \nabout and point out that there has been a border shared between Norway \nand Russia that is one of the most heavily fortified places in the \nworld, and during the period when the Soviet Union was at its zenith, \nwe made a judgment as a people that we would defend Norway.\n  Now, I know my friend is not suggesting this, but is anyone implying \nthat peace and stability in Europe is any less at issue if Poland, \nafter having received their independence, were now or again to be \ninvaded as compared to Norway? What are we saying here? And the notion, \nwill we use nuclear weapons to defend Warsaw, do you think anybody in \nour respective constituency is going to say, yes, let's use them to \ndefend Turkey, Ankara?\n  I respectfully suggest that we can use rhetorical devices to make a \npoint, but that they are able to be used in more than one instance. \nMaybe you are not going to get a consensus to use the requirement, the \nnuclear protection in NATO, the consultation provision where we are \nrequired to go to the mutual defense, I believe article V--and\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\nwe always used to hear, when the Soviet Union existed, how many \nAmericans are prepared to trade Bonn for Washington, Bonn for New York \nCity. Well, now to say how many people will be prepared to defend \nWarsaw, I suggest you might get more people to say they are prepared to \ndefend Warsaw than they are prepared to defend Ankara or Oslo. That is \nmy guess, because there are a heck of a lot more Polish Americans than \nthere are Turkish Americans. I don't think it is a useful, in terms of \nwhat our national policy should be, particularly useful point to make \nbecause it could be made about every capital in Europe, I suspect, if \nit were put to the American people today.\n  But the real question to be put to the American people is--I think \nthey answer affirmatively on it--is peace and stability in Europe in \nour national interest, and it is one of those things that we either pay \nnow or pay later, because Americans have good memories. They understand \nthat every time chaos has reigned in Europe, we have been dragged in \nthis century. And so I suggest further that to denigrate the forces of \nPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, who were equally, or better \nsituated than Spain and Portugal were when they came in, in terms of \nforces, or to suggest the only way to defend Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic is nuclear weapons is simply militarily not accurate. \nAnd so I think what we are really debating here--and I will say it \nagain--and I don't think people really want to speak to it directly--\nand what this is really about is whether we should have NATO, period--\nnot whether we should expand it, but whether we should have it now. \nBecause if a test as to whether or not we are going to admit Poland is \nwhether or not we are going to use nuclear weapons--and it is not an \noption because there is no serious problem about conventional forces \noverrunning Poland today--none--you could scramble enough jets, \nbombers, fighters out of Germany to get to the Polish border without \nhaving to have them in Poland at all, to withstand any reasonable \nconventional capability that is available to the Russians or anyone \nelse right now. But the question is: Would we defend Warsaw? If we \ndon't believe that resoundingly the American people would say that, \nthen we should not let Poland in.\n\n  I think really what you are saying is that you have to ask the honest \nquestion to the folks in Salem, New Jersey, across the river from \nDelaware, and up in Trenton, and further up in Newark: Are you willing \nto go to war to save Oslo? I would be willing to make my friend a bet, \nand let my vote depend on it, that if he got more people to say, yes, \nwe are willing to go to war to defend Oslo, then I will vote against \nadmitting Poland. But my guess is, if you ask any capital in any city \nin any European country--say possibly London--are you willing to go to \nwar to defend Oslo, I am not sure you would get much of a different \nanswer, no matter where you asked. So if that is the question--and the \nPresiding Officer knows this issue well--aren't we really asking: Do we \nwant NATO, period? If that is the case, why doesn't someone introduce \nan amendment, straight up, and stop all this foolishness--I take that \nback. I withdraw that statement. I don't mean that. Stop all the \ntangential attacks on expansion and get right to what this is about--\nintroduce an amendment saying that we no longer need NATO. We can save \na lot of money. We spend well over $120 billion a year on the deal--\nnothing to do with expansion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of working out with the \ndistinguished majority and minority leaders, and others, a time \nagreement for the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, it had been \nmy hope to have an up-or-down vote. Last night, in the course of \ndeliberations on time agreement, that was stated, but there may be some \nfeeling--if I could get the attention of the Senator from Delaware, I \nhope that we can have an up-or-down vote on my amendment. That would be \nmy hope.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That was my assumption all along, to have an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I say to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Delaware, believe me, there has been no stronger supporter of \nNATO, I say with humility, than the Senator from Virginia throughout my \n19th year in the Senate. I am sure that colleagues' comments were \nserious, but with a note of jest.\n  NATO is so vital to the United States of America. It gives us the \nlegitimate presence with our military in Europe. It gives us the \nlegitimacy of a strong voice in Europe. Indeed, this country has \nresponded, with others, in two major wars to preserve the integrity of \nEurope.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Just one sentence and I will yield. There has been a \nhistorical--over a 100 years--inability of the major nations of Europe \nto live in peace with one another. Indeed that is the principal purpose \nof NATO--the U.S. presence, both with military there, with a strong \nvoice so as to ensure the tranquility this treaty has preserved for 49 \nyears. It has exceeded every expectation of the drafters of the treaty \nand those who promoted and supported it in these 49 years. It is a \nmagnificent document. I have fought hard with others to preserve the \nintegrity of that document. Does the Senator wish to say a word?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I can ask a question on my time. Does the Senator \nthink--and he is a strong supporter of NATO, and if he thought I was \nimplying that he wasn't, I was not. There are others who believe very \nstrongly that it is no longer as relevant. You and I think it is.\n  Let me ask you, do you think this is a relevant question, a threshold \nquestion? Would the American people defend Warsaw? Do you think if that \nquestion were not answered in the affirmative, that that should be the \ntest as to whether a nation should come in or not, or whether one \nshould stay in, or we should stay in NATO or not?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on my time, the very short answer to that \nis that the American people will defend, under article V, the integrity \nof all the existing members. Should it be the wisdom of this body that \nif three additional members are admitted, article V becomes the very \nheart of the action that will be taken by this distinguished body \nbefore the close of this day.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his answer. The \nSenator from New Jersey raised a point with me. I raised three \nquestions and several rhetorical questions about his comments. He \npointed out that because I didn't want to use my time, I did not yield \nto him, and he did not think he had an opportunity to respond, and he \nwishes to respond. I am delighted to yield him a couple of minutes on \nmy time at the appropriate time. I don't want to interfere with my \nfriend's comments to respond to the issues I raised.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, like the Senator from Virginia, my \nremarks are not based on a belief that the cause and reasons for NATO \nhave expired. Quite the contrary. My concern is that whatever we do in \nthe expansion of NATO has real credibility. I raise the military \nquestion of whether or not the Polish frontier is defendable with this \npledge, simply because of this: It never has been.\n  There is not a historical basis by which the ambitions of an imperial \nRussia has ever been checked, nor will we. I, too, believe that Poland \nshould be defended.\n  I will vote for NATO expansion, but under the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from New York, they are \nsuggesting a strategy whereby the political and economic bounds be \ngiven meaning, or there be time. It is not an honest assessment of the \nsituation of the people of Poland to tell them that three American \ndivisions with no indigenous forces are going to be positioned to \ndefend them against a revitalized, or ambitious future Russia. It is \nnot an accurate situation.\n  If this is worth doing, it is worth doing with real resources based \non a real assessment of costs, based on bonds that have meaning, not \nover a period of time. It is based on that realistic military situation \nthat I join with the Senator from Virginia. I, too, like the Senator \nfrom Delaware and the Senator from Virginia, believe the United States \nwill stand by its credibility and its pledges in each of these \ninstances. But it is one thing to do it; it\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\nis another thing to do it contrary to historic experience, or military \nreality.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding me the time so I could \nclarify my views.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make a geographic point. The Polish \nborder, I am guessing, is about 200 miles from the Russian border, if \nyou do not count Kaliningrad where there are not Russian divisions, et \ncetera. If you were to take a look--my friend says that if in fact this \nthreat, any threat, to Poland from Russia, a NATO commitment to defend \nwould not be credible because of three American divisions. The fact of \nthe matter is Poland is on the Russian border. From the Russian border \nto the far border of Poland to Belarus is essentially the same distance \nfrom the main body of Russia to Poland. The number of American NATO and \nother divisions that sit in Germany are by a factor of 25 more credible \nthan any force Russia now or in the near term could use to threaten \nPoland. So the idea we do not have the physical capability, which I \nunderstand is the point being made, the physical capability of \ndefending Poland once the pledge is made is in fact, I think, \ninaccurate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the time \ncontrolled by the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  If I may, I would like to take the liberty of speaking both on the \nprevious amendment, which would have required these three nations to \nobtain membership in the European Union before ultimately becoming \nmembers of NATO, and this amendment as well. I think they both spring \nfrom a common core, certainly have a common effect, and the effect \nwould be to move the goalposts, to change the rules of the NATO \naccession game as defined in article X of the NATO treaty, to frustrate \nthe hopes of the people of these three nations and the other nations of \nCentral and Eastern Europe who lived for four decades under the tyranny \nof Soviet communism, to say to them now that they want to voluntarily \nassume their place in the NATO community and more broadly in the \ncommunity of free nations that we are not ready. OK, there was plenty \nof time in the late forties after the Second World War for Stalin and \nothers to carve up Europe and take you in involuntarily, but now that \nthe cold war is over, no, we didn't learn the lesson. We are going to \nsnatch defeat from the jaws of victory. We are going to snatch the \ndefeat of principle and security, freedom and democracy from the jaws \nof our victory in the cold war.\n  The first amendment says to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, \nyou have come this far, we have a whole procedure that we have \ndeveloped. You have democratized your country. Go back a little bit. \nYou had the courage to rise up against a powerful central government \nwhich subjugated you, which did not give you political freedom or \nreligious freedom or economic opportunity, and you have achieved your \nindependence and your freedom. You are developing a market economy and \ndemocracy and have met all the standards that have traditionally been \nassociated with access to NATO under article X--oh, no, now you have to \ngo to the European Union and be accepted there.\n\n  As I said the other day, on the first day of this debate, to ask \nthese nations to now obtain membership in the European Union before \nthey do in NATO is not only unfair--in the sense that it moves the \ngoalposts, it changes the rules of the game, it applies to them a \nstandard not applied to other NATO members, four of whom are not now \nmembers of the European Union--but it puts them in a very, very \ndifficult position. It says to them that all the effort they made is \nnot going to be justified, and it has an effect that is extremely \nunfair and inequitable. It puts the cart before the horse. It says that \ncommerce should precede the principles of freedom and security, when \nthose principles are what the cold war was all about. It puts the cart \nof commerce before the sturdy horses of democracy and security. It puts \nthe cart of the European Union before the horses of NATO. And that is \nnot the order that is appropriate. That is why I oppose that first \namendment and hope my colleagues will as well.\n  Of course, both of these amendments, including this one now that asks \nfor a 3-year moratorium, I think spring--as some of the proponents of \nthe amendment have said--from a concern about the effect on Russia. Our \nSecretary of State printed an op-ed piece in the New York Times \nWednesday, April 29, yesterday--Madeleine Albright. It is a brilliant \npiece, eloquent, right to the point. Headline: ``Stop Worrying About \nRussia.''\n\n       The most fundamental argument the critics have put forward \n     is that the admission of even a single new ally from Central \n     Europe will harm our relations with Russia.\n\n  Secretary Albright says:\n\n       My first response is to wonder why some people cannot \n     discuss the future of Central Europe without immediately \n     changing the subject to Russia. Central Europe has more than \n     20 countries, and 200 million people, with its own history, \n     its own problems and its own contributions to make to our \n     alliance. Most of these countries do not even border Russia. \n     But their security is and always has been vital to the future \n     of Europe as a whole.\n\n  Mr. President, I heard my friend and colleague from New Jersey say \nsomething I find very unsettling, arguing for the pause, arguing for \nthe earlier amendment about European Union membership first; wondering \nwhether we were true to our pledge, as part of NATO accession under \narticle V, to defend member states. We wouldn't make the pledge if we \nwere not sincere about it. Of course we are prepared to defend these \nnations if necessary.\n  I found the references to Chamberlain in the 1930s particularly--I \nsay this respectfully--inappropriate. If there was any sincerity behind \nthe pledge that Chamberlain made in 1939 to defend Poland from the \nNazis, as was stated, the history of the 1940s might well have been \ndifferent. The lessons are clear. The best way to secure peace is to \nremain strong. And that is what this is all about, access to NATO, a \nmilitary alliance in defense of a principle.\n  The Senator from New Jersey said imperial Russia has never been \ndefeated. Who is talking about imperial Russia? We, who are supporting \nthe extension of NATO, believe there is a new Russia. We don't see an \nimperial Russia. We believe that these new countries, adding 200,000 \ntroops to NATO forces, will help us meet common threats from ethnic \ndivision, international conflict, in some of the emerging democracies. \nWe have seen it in Bosnia. We see it in Kosovo today. And it will help \nus meet the common threats of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, \nballistic missiles, coming particularly from the south of the NATO \nregion but perhaps from elsewhere.\n\n  Let me go to this amendment requiring a pause, a 3-year pause. The \nSenator from Virginia says we ought to let some future President decide \nthis. There is a process under article X. There is nothing inevitable \nabout it. We are not on automatic pilot. No other nation is \nautomatically going to be admitted to NATO. There is a process. NATO \nmembers will consider it, presidents--administrations will decide, and \nthen always the Senate will have the option of ratifying or not \nratifying accession of anyone else to this great treaty in defense of a \nprinciple. So why the pause? Presumably to reassure Russia again. But \nwhat are the effects of that? The effects of that are destructive in \nthree regards.\n  First, on the other nations of Central Europe who may dream of \nmembership in NATO, and, on the basis of which dreams, they are acting \nin exactly the way we would have them act to develop their democracies \nand market economies. Again, I refer to the New York Times, this time \nSunday, April 26.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks an article by Jane Perlez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That article makes very clear that the goal of access \nto NATO, in this case of the article in particular regard to the three \ncountries we are considering today--\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--has moved those countries. The \npromise of inclusion in NATO has helped the cause of moderate \ngovernment, the reporter says, during a tough period of economic and \npolitical transition. I quote Marek Matraszek, Warsaw director of the \nCEC Government Relations, a political consulting firm, who says:\n\n       The promise of NATO has defused destabilizing forces from \n     the left and right.* * * If NATO had not been offered, Poland \n     could have been in a disastrous situation, externally and \n     internally.\n\n  If we now slam the door closed on the dreams of every other nation in \nCentral and Eastern Europe to join this family of freedom, this \nmilitary alliance, I fear that we will set back the onward march of \nfreedom and a market economy for which we fought the cold war.\n  Second, it will reduce the ability of NATO and the dream and goal of \nNATO membership to resolve conflicts that now exist among various \nnations in Central and Eastern Europe. The Hungarians and the \nRomanians, because of their desire to join NATO, settled age-old \nproblems. Poland and Lithuania began talks about concerns they had for \nthe same reason, to put themselves in the same position. The nations in \nthat region have not lost sight of the reaction of NATO to the movement \nwithin Slovakia toward a less open, less free government--which is to \nsay that Slovakia has dropped down in the chain of those who are being \nconsidered for NATO membership.\n  Finally, a third consequence of imposing this pause.\n  Mr. President, I note you moving toward the gavel, and I ask simply \nfor an additional minute, if I may, from the time of the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The final loss from imposing an arbitrary 3-year pause where none is \nnecessary because no action is required will be on us, on the United \nStates, on our credibility, on what we stand for, on the principles \nthat the rest of the world now, most of it, want to emulate and aspire \nto.\n  If we say to these other nations of Central and Eastern Europe, \n``Forget about it, we are more worried about Russia, we are more \nworried about a renaissance of imperialist Russia, we are more worried \nabout affecting the feelings of people who may be aggressive than we \nare about honoring your dream and effort to achieve freedom and \ndemocracy and security,'' then we will have abandoned our principles, \nour first principles as a country. When we do that, we lose our \nstrength, because ultimately those principles underlie the power of \nAmerica in the world community.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to defeat these two amendments \nand to put ourselves on the right side of history.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the New York Times, April 26, 1998]\n\n              With Promises, Promises, NATO Moves the East\n\n                            (By Jane Perlez)\n\n       In the United States, the question of whether to expand \n     NATO eastward has been debated only in fits and starts, and \n     then most passionately on the issues of how the Russians feel \n     about it and whether it might cost too much.\n       But another question figures in the debate too: What effect \n     has the lure of NATO membership had on the way the proposed \n     new members--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--govern \n     themselves and behave toward their neighbors after nearly \n     half a century under Communism?\n       No one of these questions alone will decide the debate, \n     which the Senate is scheduled to resume on Monday. Opponents \n     of the Clinton Administration's proposal to expand NATO will \n     doubtless emphasize the questions of money, Russia, and how \n     many other new members this precedent will open the door to.\n       Still, it is on the question of how the prospective members \n     are behaving that some of the hardest evidence is in, and it \n     adds up to this:\n\n\n                          agreement on a goal\n\n       While all three have a way to go on meeting Western \n     standards of democratic rule and stable market economies, no \n     issue has dominated the internal political behavior of the \n     three Central European countries as much as the aspiration to \n     belong to the Western security alliance.\n       In all three prospective new members, former Communists and \n     anti-Communists alike have agreed on NATO membership as a \n     national goal, and as a result all have tried with varying \n     degrees of sincerity to meet the alliance's broad \n     requirements of democratic rule and free enterprise.\n       In other words, the promise of inclusion in NATO has helped \n     the cause of moderate government during a tough period of \n     economic and political transition. And there is little doubt, \n     analysts say, that trying to lay the political groundwork to \n     satisfy NATO has left Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic \n     better positioned for sustained economic growth.\n       Such growth, in turn, could also help these countries join \n     the European Union--another goal they share, and one they are \n     pursuing in negotiations that opened in Brussels last month \n     and that promise to be tough.\n       One lesson clearly taken to heart by Poland, the Czech \n     Republic and Hungary was the elimination of Slovakia from the \n     list of potential NATO members after its Prime Minister, \n     Vladimir Meciar, became increasingly authoritarian. \n     Similarly, the European Union has cited Slovakia's lack of \n     democratic progress as a reason for its inclusion from the \n     first round of the economic union's eastward expansion.\n       The new American Ambassador to Poland, Daniel Fried, who \n     helped formulate the arguments for expanding NATO when he \n     worked at the National Security Council before coming to \n     Warsaw last fall, likes to point to the way the three \n     countries have behaved toward each other. ``When Poland and \n     Hungary became more confident of their NATO membership,'' he \n     said, ``they increased their outreach to their neighbors--\n     Hungary to Romania, and Poland to Lithuania.''\n       A decade ago, when the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe was \n     evaporating, one worry for NATO was that old national \n     resentments would resurface in the form of border disputes \n     and mistreatment of minorities, creating instability in \n     the region. So when NATO decided it might enlarge, it made \n     it clear that aspirants to membership had to avoid that \n     kind of thing.\n       Now Hungary and Romania have signed a treaty guaranteeing \n     each other's borders and respecting the right of the large \n     Hungarian minority in Romania. And tense relations between \n     Poland and Lithuania have improved to the point that they \n     have created a joint peacekeeping battalion.\n       Another benchmark set down by NATO, and in particular by \n     the Pentagon, was that the military in new members had to be \n     subordinate to civilian control. This was a prickly subject \n     in Poland, where former President Lech Walesa wanted to keep \n     broad authority in the hands of his generals. Only since the \n     defeat of Mr. Walesa in elections in 1995 and the adoption of \n     a new Constitution calling for subordination of the general \n     staff to the Minister of Defense has the strong political \n     influence of the Polish military brass diminished.\n\n\n                          Changes in the Brass\n\n       Last year, to the relief of the Pentagon, President \n     Kwasniewski fired Gen. Tadeusz Wilecki, a Walesa appointee, \n     who had shown open contempt for the civilians at the defense \n     ministry.\n       Now Henry Szumski, a younger general who has United Nations \n     field experience, is at the top, and Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an \n     ardent proponent of civilian control of the military, is \n     defense minister. NATO specialists say they are satisfied \n     that the Polish military is on the right track, but another \n     challenge remains: to clear out many of the Communist-era \n     holdovers in the military intelligence service.\n       In another example of changing attitudes, the Hungarian \n     Government passed over Soviet-trained generals for the post \n     of chief of the general staff and reached down to the third \n     level of the military hierarchy for Lieut. Gen. Ferenc Vegh, \n     and English-speaking graduate of the United States Army War \n     College. Now 7 of the top 10 generals in Hungary are Western \n     trained.\n       Last month, the Czechs appointed a new chief of the general \n     staff, Jiri Sedivy, 45, who stands out for his experience as \n     a battalion commander in Bosnia and for his choice of \n     military heroes: Eisenhower, Patton and Schwarzkopf.\n       Along with elevating military officers who think like those \n     in the West, the three countries have been encouraged by NATO \n     to get serious about parliamentary oversight committees. On \n     this point, they still have a long way to go; the defense \n     committee in the lower house of Poland's Parliament has no \n     staff, and the enthusiastic members of Hungary's \n     parliamentary defense committee have little background in \n     military affairs.\n       No one would argue that Poland, Hungary and the Czech \n     Republic are mature democracies with classic capitalist \n     economies. Progress toward the rule of law and the protection \n     of minority rights is far from perfect. In all three \n     countries, the judicial systems are fragile and financial \n     corruption widespread. There are still huge disparities in \n     terms of wealth between the European Union and its \n     prospective new eastern members.\n       But Marek Matraszek, the Warsaw director of CEC Government \n     Relations, a political consulting firm that has worked on \n     NATO related issues, believes that without the prospect of \n     membership in NATO, Poland might easily have fallen under the \n     sway of nationalist and populist politicians. Now it seems \n     reasonable to believe that Poland, a land with 40 million \n     people and a bounding economy growing at six percent a year, \n     may reach its goal of being a middle-size Western European \n     power within the next decade.\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\n       ``The promise of NATO has defused destabilizing forces from \n     the left and right.'' Mr. Matraszek said. ``If NATO had not \n     been offered, Poland could have been in a disastrous \n     situation, externally and internally.''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes remaining in \nopposition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sure all 7 minutes will be worth yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Warner \namendment to freeze NATO membership and, if time permits, to also \ncomment on the Moynihan amendment regarding the necessity for EU \nmembership for these countries before being included in NATO.\n  It is very difficult--like you when you spoke earlier and said you \nhad great admiration for both the Senator from New York and the Senator \nfrom Virginia as I do, we have such constructive relationships, and I \nadmire their grasp on policy and their desire to move ahead on \nconstructive foreign policy.\n  As well-intentioned as the Warner proposal is, its acceptance would \nbe inconsistent with the NATO treaty itself. It would unnecessarily \nlimit U.S. flexibility in pursuing further enlargement should the \nUnited States of America determine that such enlargement would be in \nits national interest. It would also undercut the tremendous gains for \npeace accomplished over the last decade in Central Europe, including \nthe historic reconciliation now underway between Russia and the West.\n  Article X of the Washington treaty, which was the alliance's founding \ncharter nearly 50 years ago, states that membership is open to ``any \nother European state in a position to further the principles of this \ntreaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.''\n  NATO has been an unprecedented success in deterring conflict and \npromoting peace and stability. Toward these ends, NATO has been \nexpanded three times in the past. To remain relevant and successful in \nthe future, NATO must keep its doors open to those European democracies \nready to bear the responsibilities, as well as the burdens, of \nmembership.\n  NATO enlargement is a policy deeply rooted in this principle, often \ndriven by moral imperatives, but equally important strategic self-\ninterest and objective criteria concerning military readiness and \npolitical and economic reform.\n  It is not easy to become a NATO member. This is not like signing up \nfor an American Express card. New NATO members must meet stringent \nmilitary base criteria. They must also demonstrate a commitment to \nresolve ethnic disputes and territorial disputes by peaceful means. In \nfact, the prospect of NATO membership has led newly free countries in \nEurope to settle border disputes.\n  Potential NATO members must also show a commitment to promote \nstability and well-being by promoting economic liberty, social justice \nand environmental responsibility. They must establish democratic and \ncivilian control of their military, a transparent military budget and \nbe fit for duty, as well as using diplomacy as its first tool of \ndispute resolution.\n  You have to do that in order to even be considered. So, therefore, I \noppose the Warner amendment because it would freeze or reduce U.S. \nflexibility within the alliance and, at the same time, close the door \nthat article X gave as a message of optimism and hope.\n  The Warner amendment would repudiate article X and its message of \noptimism and hope, which is what a freeze on enlargement would do. It \nwould be seen by reformist countries of Central Europe as a door being \nshut. Do we really want to send such a disillusioning message to those \nother countries that are working for democracy, economic reform and \ncivilian control of their military?\n  Article X of the Washington treaty was a source of hope to Central \nEurope during Soviet oppression. The prospect of NATO membership \nremains an important incentive for democratic and economic reform. It \nhas already motivated the reconciliations between Germany and the Czech \nRepublic, Germany and Poland, Romania and Hungary, Romania and Ukraine, \nand Italy and Slovenia, among others. The civil and military agreements \nbetween these countries have helped to consolidate peace and stability \nin Central Europe, and these things must be protected and not undercut.\n  Third, a mandated pause would create a new dividing line in Europe. \nIf Central European countries not invited into NATO conclude that the \nprocess of enlargement has not only been stalled but stopped, a key \nincentive behind their current participation in NATO's Partnership for \nPeace Program, a military partnership, would be eliminated. A key \nachievement of this program is the coordination that it now fosters \nbetween their defense planning and force structure development. Thus, a \nfreeze on enlargement would impede, if not reverse, this remarkable \ndevelopment of European security around an alliance-determined agenda. \nThis is what NATO is all about.\n  Fourth, an arbitrary freeze on NATO enlargement would harm Russia's \nhistoric reconciliation with NATO and the United States. A freeze would \nappear to give Moscow a veto over NATO enlargement. It certainly would \nbe interpreted as a victory for the hard-liners by those who still \nadvocate a Russian sphere of influence over its neighbors, those who \nwish to see that Russia could deny the entry into NATO of these three \ndemocracies.\n  Worse, it could lead others to draw the conclusion that they will \nnever ever have a chance to join NATO and never ever get out of the \nRussian sphere of influence. A freeze would undercut the basic \nprinciples that all of Europe's states have a right to choose their own \nsecurity arrangements--a principle that must be one of the cornerstones \nof Russia's relationships with the United States and NATO membership.\n  Mr. President, the resolution of ratification passed the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations 16 to 2, and on that day that it voted, \nMarch 3, 1998, it explicitly addressed the concerns of those accusing \nthe alliance of moving too fast on enlargement. It states:\n\n       The United States will not support the admission of, or the \n     invitation for admission of, any new NATO member, unless . . \n     . (I) the President consults with the Senate consistent with \n     article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States . . . and (II) the prospective members can \n     fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of membership, \n     and its inclusion would serve the overall political and \n     strategic interests of NATO and the United States.\n\n  That is what the committee voted on, that we just would not have an \nopen door but it would be an open door according to article X of the \ntreaty we already adopted.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues, no matter how well-\nintentioned--no matter how well-intentioned the Warner amendment is, I \nthink it would absolutely undercut peace and stability.\n  Mr. President, also in terms of the Moynihan amendment, I want to \nassociate myself with your remarks in which you said we could not be \npart of NATO under that, Canada could not, Turkey could not. And if we \nthen would adopt the Moynihan amendment, should we then consider an \namendment that would remove from NATO any members that are now part of \nEU?\n  What would that mean? It would take us out. It would take Canada out. \nIt would take Turkey out. I do not think it is logical.\n  I know there are many concerns about Russia. I know my time is \nlimited and others wish to speak on this amendment. Later on this \nafternoon I will give my thoughts on Russia. I wish to maintain a \nconstructive relationship with Russia, but I do not think this is the \ntime nor the place to then give in to the Russian hard-liners but to \nfocus on the new Russia, which I believe is not an imperial Russia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator \nfrom Virginia, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to accommodate the Senate on the schedule \nthat Mr. Smith and I are working on, from the standpoint of the \nproponents of my amendment, following Mr. Dorgan, it would be desirable \nto have the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, follow for a period \nof 5 minutes, and then Mr. Smith would care for about 3 or 4 minutes. \nNow, there is time within which the opposition, of course, will want to \nintervene, and we certainly will go back and forth on this.\n  We also wish to accommodate the senior Senator from Alaska. He has \ntwo amendments, is that correct, I say to the Senator?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. The time that the Senator from Alaska desires under his \ncontrol would be how much?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Well, 30 minutes. I am willing to have a time agreement \non the amendments. It was my understanding, Mr. President, one of them \nwould be accepted. That may have changed in the last few minutes. But \nin any event, I do not need more than 20 minutes myself to explain my \ntwo amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that the votes, then, on the two \nWarner amendments and the one on Senator Craig's from last night be \ndeferred until the Senator from Alaska has had an opportunity to \naddress his two amendments, and such time as whatever opposition there \nmay be required, and then we vote on the five amendments in sequence \nthereafter, with the normal time allocated to the first vote and for 10 \nminutes allocated to each of the other four votes, with a total of \nfive. I would suggest that request, on my behalf, be considered by the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and \nothers before it is finalized, but that is a suggestion.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. The suggestion I made, I say to my colleague, is that the \nsenior Senator from Alaska wishes perhaps 20 minutes on his two \namendments, and such time as you have, the votes scheduled for 3 p.m. \nbe deferred until his amendments are discussed by the senior Senator \nand yourself, and then we take five consecutive votes, with the normal \ntime allocated to the first vote, and 10 minutes to each vote \nthereafter.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me say that, first of all, I do not know what the \nStevens amendment is, so I do not want to agree to a time agreement. He \nis a very formidable adversary on these issues, and I am not about to \nagree to a time agreement on what I do not know, No. 1.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could I respond to that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendments have been submitted. It is \nmy understanding that one of them was cleared on both sides. That may \nhave changed within the last 30 minutes. The second one will be \nmodified, as requested by the Secretary of Defense and the vice \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We have modified that at their \nrequest to make the portion dealing with reduction in the U.S. \ncontribution to NATO to be a sense of the Senate rather than mandatory. \nBut there is a mandatory cap in that amendment. And it will be \ncontroversial, I do admit.\n\n  Why do I need unanimous consent? I will wait my turn.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No. I am not trying to be an obstructionist at all. No. 1, \nI am told by my staff--A, I don't know about the amendment, \nnotwithstanding it has been filed. I have been concentrating on other \nthings. No. 2, I am told by my staff--and they may be incorrect; staff \nas well as Senators often are--the fact is that I am told that Senator \nHelms has not signed off on any amendment yet.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not asking for people to sign off on the amendment. \nI am only asking for time to debate it and have a vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to have time to debate it. That is why I \nthink we should just go ahead, have the two amendments, vote. And then \nthe Senator and I and others who wish to debate it from 3 o'clock on, \nto debate as long as you want. That is fine by me.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All I am trying to do, Mr. President, is accommodate the \nSenate. I thought instead of having three votes, have five votes after \nwe are finished. It is all right by me. I will wait. I want to be \nassured some time--I am leading a delegation, pursuant to the Byrd \namendment to the supplemental bill, to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia tonight. \nI would prefer that we were going to finish this or postpone it until \nwe get back, one or the other.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, every effort is being made to accommodate \nthe important mission undertaken by the Senator from Alaska and to have \nthe final votes on this treaty tonight. This Senator has given his \ncommitment to the leadership of the Senate. I suggest that we continue \nwith this debate now and that the colleagues confer on the Stevens \namendments and then revisit the possibility of five consecutive votes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the order of business after the--\nif I may, with the Senator's permission?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the order of business after the Warner vote, \nafter the three votes scheduled at 3 o'clock? Is there an agreement \nafter that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have two pending amendments that we would \ngo back to after the vote. They would have to be disposed of and then \nother amendments offered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course, Mr. President, they could be laid aside to \naccommodate the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to lay them aside \nafter the scheduled votes at 3 o'clock and take up my two amendments at \nthat time before I leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I do not intend to object, but I wonder, before the \nSenator from Delaware leaves the floor, prior to his arriving, the \nSenator from Virginia outlined a series of speakers who will speak in \nsupport of the amendment, but we did not establish a lineup for \nspeakers who would speak in opposition to Senator Warner's amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield 5 minutes to my \nfriend from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I believe we established Senator Dorgan would speak \nnext. And if we could establish as part of that unanimous consent \nthat----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, those \nwishing to speak in opposition to the amendment, that I have been told \nof, who have not yet spoken, two of them, who are here, are the Senator \nfrom Michigan and the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, with the \npossibility of the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, all of whom are against the amendment, I \nbelieve all of whom wish to speak against the amendment, two of whom \nare here. And since I have very limited time left, the two who are here \nI am very happy to give 5 minutes to, and those who show up next I will \ngive 5 minutes, and then I am out of time. It is my full intention to \nyield to the Senator from Michigan to speak in opposition.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request made by the \nSenator from Alaska?\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. One additional request, if I may. I ask that my second \namendment be modified. I have that right without unanimous consent. And \nI send it to the desk so that it can be reproduced so all Senators have \na copy of it when I call it up after the 3 o'clock votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator can modify a \npreviously submitted amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Although I have no objection--I realize we have gotten \nunanimous consent already with the Senator from Alaska going next--as \nsoon as I did not object, I was informed by my Cloakroom that Senator \nConrad, whose amendment is one of those listed as next, objected to it \nbeing put aside. I wanted Senator Conrad to know I did not realize he \nwould object to that. I\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\njust want the Record to show that I was unaware of that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not wish to inconvenience Senator Conrad. I would \nbe perfectly willing to wait if he is the next one in line. So I can \nget in line and I know what the time is, so I can plan the day. And I \ncan tell the Senator, I will not take longer than 30 minutes on my \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point I ask the Chair to advise \nthe Senate with regard to the remaining time under the pending \namendment, the Warner-Moynihan 3-year moratorium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 16 minutes 18 \nseconds and 17 minutes 2 seconds to the opposition.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. So the time has been consumed by this important colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that 10 minutes equally divided \nbe restored, given that this colloquy was essential.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The order is that Senator Dorgan will now proceed. If the Senator \nwould limit remarks to 8 minutes in favor of the amendment, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota would take 5 minutes, and the Senator from New Hampshire \ntakes 3 minutes, that would enable the Senator from Virginia 2 or 3 \nminutes in conclusion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor of the \nSenate to support the amendment offered by Senator Warner. I have not \nyet been part of this debate. I have followed it closely and read a \ngreat deal and want to speak about the larger issue and then explain \nwhy I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia.\n  The proposal brought to this Senate to expand NATO raises a range of \nquestions that will still be unanswered as we vote on this treaty later \nthis evening. Let me just describe a couple of them.\n  First of all, the cost. The cost estimates for the enlargement of \nNATO range from a few billion dollars to $125 billion. Our major \nEuropean allies have made it clear that they have little intention of \nspending another lira, another franc, another pound, to pay for the \nexpansion of NATO. The question, then, is: What will be the cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer? We don't yet know.\n  Further, will there be a second round to expand NATO? The NATO \nSecretary-General said that there will be a second round, possibly \nincluding Romania, Slovenia, and three Baltic States. If there is a \nsecond round, what will that cost be? And if there is a third round, \nwould it include some of the 19 other members of the Partnership for \nPeace in Central and Eastern Europe? Where does NATO expansion stop? We \ndon't yet know.\n  The other question is: What is the threat that requires the \nenlargement of NATO? What is the threat to Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic that justifies NATO expansion? I am convinced these \ncountries need economic integration into Europe rather than military \nintegration into NATO.\n  The Warner amendment says, let us take the time to answer these basic \nquestions. Let's wait for three years before we admit any more nations \ninto NATO. Let's pause and try to understand what all of this will \ncost, what exactly is the threat, and what our response should be.\n  But more importantly, a three-year pause also will enable us to work \nwith Russia to ensure our relations with Russia do not suffer as a \nresult of the policy we seem about to endorse this evening.\n  NATO expansion, make no mistake about it, will play a large role in \ndetermining whether we will have a cooperative or a confrontational \nrelationship with Russia in the years to come. I don't say this because \nI am sensitive to the feelings of Russia. I say it because I am \nsensitive to our own security interests.\n  I take a moment of the brief time that I have to describe why our \nrelationship with Russia should play a role in this decision.\n  I wonder how many of my colleagues are aware of an incident that \noccurred on December 3, 1997, in the dark hours of the early morning, \nnorth of Norway in the Barents Sea. Several Russian ballistic missile \nsubmarines surfaced on December 3, last year, and prepared to fire SSN-\n20 missiles. Each of these missiles can carry 10 nuclear warheads and \ntravel 5,000 miles--far enough to have reached the United States from \nthe Barents Sea. Those submarines surfaced and launched 20 ballistic \nmissiles. Roaring skyward, they rose to 30,000 feet. U.S. satellites \ntracked their path.\n  Last December 3, the radar and satellites in our Space Command NORAD \ncomplex and elsewhere saw that at 30,000 feet those Russian missiles \nexploded, they were destroyed. Why? Because this was not a Russian \nmissile attack. In fact, seven American weapons inspectors were \nwatching from a ship a few miles away as the missiles were launched. \nThese self-destruct launches were a quick and cheap way for Russia to \ndestroy submarine-launched missiles, which it is required to do under \nthe START I arms control treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, let me present one more piece of evidence about what \nis really important. This is a hinge, and with the permission of the \nPresiding Officer, I show it to my colleagues on the Senate floor. This \nis a hinge that comes from a missile silo in the former Soviet Union. \nThis belonged to a silo that housed an SS-19 with warheads poised at \nthe United States. This piece of a missile silo, with a missile and \nwarhead aimed at the United States, comes from a silo that doesn't any \nlonger exist. This comes from a silo which this picture shows is now \ngone. Silo removed, gone. The missile is gone. The warhead is gone. And \nwhere a silo once stood, sunflowers are planted.\n  How did that happen, that a Soviet missile was destroyed by taking it \nout of its silo? This country, with a program called Nunn-Lugar, helped \npay for the cost of that. With that program, and under our arms control \ntreaties, we help destroy the weapons of potential adversaries so they \ncan never be used against us.\n  Now, the question for all of us is, What does enlarging NATO do to \nour relationship with Russia? There is no one on this floor who can \nstand and tell you with certainty what it does, but there is plenty of \nevidence that this is a step backward, not forward, with respect to our \nrelationship with Russia.\n  One of the great lessons of this century's history is that the United \nStates gains when we respect a former enemy. We have been through the \ncold war with the Soviet Union. They lost. The Soviet Union no longer \nexists.\n  Russia has enough fissile material to make 40,000 nuclear weapons if \nit wanted to. That's why our relationship with Russia is critically \nimportant. That relationship will determine whether we will see more \nnuclear missile silos planted with sunflowers, whether we will see \nbombers having their wing cut off --as this picture shows--whether we \nwill see more progress in arms reduction.\n  The principal threat, in my judgment, to peace in this world is not a \nthreat of a land invasion of Poland, the Czech Republic, or Hungary. \nThe principal threat is the threat of nuclear weapons--loose nuclear \nweapons falling into the hands of terrorists, or proliferation of \nnuclear weapons to rogue nations, or a resumption of the nuclear arms \nrace. We are on a path in this country, because of our arms control \nagreements and cooperative relationship with Russia, where both sides \nare now destroying nuclear weapons. This is very, very important \nprogress for humankind.\n  We now are confronted here in the U.S. Senate with a question of \nenlarging NATO, a security alliance in Western Europe, at the expense \nof, in my judgment, our relationship with Russia. I don t want to see \nour relationship with Russia deteriorate into a new cold war \nconfrontation and a resumption of nuclear weapons production. In my \njudgment, we expand NATO at the potential risk of reigniting a cold war \nand impeding and retarding progress on arms reduction.\n  The Senator from Virginia brings an amendment to the floor that says \nif we go to a first round of NATO enlargement, and if the vote is \nsuccessful tonight, before we expand further let us at least pause for \n3 years to answer the\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\nquestions I posed at the start of my presentation. What will this cost? \nWhat will this cost, and who will pay the bill? What is the threat, and \nwhere does the threat come from? And what does this do to arms control \nagreements that now, as I speak, are resulting in the destruction of \nmissiles, the retirement of delivery vehicles, the sawing off of wings \nof Russian bombers?\n  What does it do to that progress, progress that comes from arms \ncontrol treaties and a bipartisan initiative here in Congress called \nNunn-Lugar to help implement those treaties? In the Nunn-Lugar program \nwe provide money to accommodate arms control agreements, to help the \nother side destroy their nuclear weapons. These are the weapons that \nwere once housed in a silo that contained this piece of metal, near \nPervomaisk, a former Soviet missile base. What does NATO expansion do \nto the progress that this piece of metal represents?\n  This piece of metal was in a silo that housed a missile with a \nnuclear warhead aimed at our country, but it is now just metal, and the \nground is now sunflowers. That is substantial progress, in my view, for \nthis world.\n  The question we need to ask, all of us, is, What does this issue, \nNATO enlargement, have to do with this progress? Will it impede this \nprogress? Will it retard the progress of arms control? No one here \nknows the answer for certain. Our Nation's foremost experts on foreign \npolicy are sharply divided. Yet, and I say this regretfully, the Senate \nseems prepared to vote on NATO expansion without understanding its \npotential consequences.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhis time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly in opposition to the \nWarner amendment. I will begin by saying that I think there are clear \nlessons that can be learned, but I disagree with my distinguished \ncolleague from North Dakota as to what they are.\n  I think the last half of the 20th century demonstrated that when \nAmerica did not assert itself adequately and act in its best interests \nafter World War II by embracing the nations of Central and Eastern \nEurope, we in fact contributed to the development of a cold war; that \nwhen we in fact invested in our national security and asserted \nourselves effectively--particularly during the 1980s--we brought the \ncold war to an end successfully. That is why I believe it is in our \ninterests to move forward with expansion of NATO at this time.\n  In light of these reasons, I think it is ill advised for us to set \narbitrary limits or deadlines or pauses in considering NATO expansion. \nIf it is in our best interests to expand NATO quickly, then I want to \nmaintain that possibility. If it is not in our best interests to expand \nNATO beyond the three countries under consideration today, then the \nprocess already established in the North Atlantic Council and our own \nconstitutional advice and consent ratification requirements provide us \nmore than enough protection against rash action.\n  Let me speak briefly and more specifically as to other reasons I \noppose the amendment offered by my colleague from Virginia mandating a \n``strategic pause.''\n  First, I believe such a pause would send exactly the wrong signal at \nthis critical point in history, as it would represent a drastic change \nin U.S. policy. The United States led the charge at last year's Madrid \nsummit to keep the door open for future NATO expansion. Throughout the \ngeneral discussion on expanding NATO, we also declared that any \npossible offer of NATO membership would be dependent upon successful \nimplementation of democratization and market reform programs. Taking \naway the possibility of NATO membership, even for just 3 years, may \nalso take away the incentive for completion of reform.\n  Second, I believe the Senate's position during any future membership \nnegotiations will be protected. During Foreign Relations Committee \nhearings on this issue, both Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright \nexpressed the administration's understanding of the need for \nconsultation with the Senate prior to any future round of expansion. I \nbelieve that commitment is secure, given their scrupulous consultation \nprocess with the Senate that has gone on throughout the current \nexpansion phase.\n  Finally, I think we must look at this round of expansion in its \nhistorical context. Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty specifically \nprovides for the expansion of NATO to any European state in a position \nto further the principles of the treaty and contribute to North \nAtlantic security. This article has been utilized over the past 50 \nyears for the accession of West Germany, Greece, Turkey, and Spain. \nThis is not a brand new process but one we have always kept open to \nreview.\n\n  NATO's Secretary General stated at the Madrid summit:\n\n       In keeping with our pledge to maintain an open door to the \n     admission of additional Alliance members in the future, we \n     also direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that process \n     under continual review and report to us. We will review the \n     process at our next meeting in 1999.\n\n  This shows that NATO enlargement is an issue regularly reviewed by \nthe North Atlantic Council, just as are the structure and requirements \nof the NATO armed forces.\n  In summary, I strongly oppose any measure which will place additional \nroadblocks in the way of future NATO expansion, roadblocks that are not \nneeded and will only lead to further feelings of abandonment and \nexclusion by nations wanting to join the West. A decision to enlarge \nNATO should not be based on a rigid time line; rather, it should be the \nnet result of thoughtful deliberation--a process already well protected \nby both the North Atlantic Treaty and our Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me associate myself \nwith the amendment earlier introduced by Senator Moynihan from New \nYork. I have said before on the floor of the Senate--and I will say it \nagain--the Senator from New York, I think, has said something very \nimportant with his amendment, which is that we should be using our \nprestige as a great country to really insist on membership to the EU \nfor Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland. That is what is most \nimportant to enable them to reach their goals.\n  Also, let me associate myself with the amendment of my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Warner. I think what he is saying in this amendment \nis: Colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, please go slowly.\n  Mr. President, many of us had the opportunity to serve with Senator \nNunn. I think more of us should talk about him and his wisdom. Senator \nNunn raised three questions about NATO expansion. The first question \nis: Will this help us in easing or dealing with the whole problem of \nproliferation of weapons that might go to Third World countries--the \nkind of cooperation we need with Russia? The answer that Senator Nunn \ngives to that question is no.\n  The second question Senator Nunn asked is: What about nuclear \nthreats? Is this going to help us in terms of further arms agreement \nwith Russia? Is this going to move the world away from reliance on \nnuclear weapons? The answer Senator Nunn gives is no.\n  The third question that Senator Nunn raised is: What about reform \nwithin Russia? What about the forces for democracy? What are the \ndemocrats--with a small ``d''--all trying to tell us? The answer, \nSenator Nunn says, is they are telling us with this NATO expansion, \nexpanding the military alliance against a Soviet Union that no longer \nexists, against a military threat that no longer exists, is a huge step \nbackward.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude this way. Other colleagues are on the \nfloor and want to speak. From Senator Sam Nunn to Senator Patrick \nMoynihan, to Senator John Warner, to George Kennan, to scholars like \nHoward Mendelbaum, to prophetic thinkers like George Kennan, and, more \nimportantly, the forces for democracy in Russia, there has been an \neloquent and powerful plea to all of us to understand that this could \nbe a tragic mistake.\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\n  Mr. President, I fear it will be a tragic mistake. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for Senator Moynihan's amendment. I hope they will \nvote for Senator Warner's amendments. I want to say one more time that \nI am in profound disagreement with NATO expansion. I think there will \nbe fateful consequences. If we approve this, I hope and pray that I am \nwrong, but I have to speak for what I believe is right for my country \nand the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have 16 minutes remaining in my control. \nFor the benefit of the Senators, so I don't get myself in more trouble \nin the allocation of time, I am going to yield, in the following order: \n5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia, 5 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware, and 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona. That will leave me \nprobably 10 seconds. I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, it is not my intention today to belabor the \npoints, so eloquently made by the principal proponents of this \nResolution of Ratification--including the President, the Secretary of \nState, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and by the leadership of this body, and the Chairman and Ranking \nMembers of the Foreign Relations Committee--about why enlarging NATO is \nin our national strategic interest.\n  The three national security committees on which I serve have \ndedicated an extraordinary amount of time to this issue, examining the \nfull ramifications of enlarging NATO in over a dozen hearings, and \nfollowing that intensive process I remain persuaded, that we ought to \nmove ahead.\n  I certainly don't discount the concerns, that have been raised, by a \nnumber of highly respected opponents of ratification, most of whom I am \nnormally in agreement with on national security matters, but I find the \narguments advanced by the advocates more persuasive.\n  I would like to focus my remarks more narrowly on the implications \nfor American leadership in Europe and beyond. The critical notion in my \nmind, is not simply that NATO is inviting Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic into its ranks, but that through our leadership, we've \nplayed a fundamental role in casting the light of freedom across \nEurope, and are prepared in peacetime or war, to guarantee the security \nof these new democracies.\n  Keeping the peace is something NATO has been doing well for 50 years. \nWhen an entity works as well as NATO has, in fact, the American people \ntend to either ignore it or take it for granted. Perhaps that explains \nthe lack of widespread public interest in expanding NATO.\n  We have come to think of Europe mostly as a market for our goods, no \nlonger as a territory under Soviet threat. Public apathy aside, we \nforget the lessons of history that made the 20th Century the single \nbloodiest of all, at our peril.\n  On two occasions American isolationism has led to world wars. What we \nthought was benign neglect of Europe turned out to be an abject failure \nof our leadership. Harry Truman was right when he said that if NATO had \nexisted in 1914 or 1939, we never would have seen the toll in human \nlives that followed.\n  Mr. President, it is an undeniable fact that NATO has contributed \ndramatically to Europe's peace, stability, and democracy the past 50 \nyears, and hence to our own security. The alliance was integral to the \ndissolution of the Warsaw Pact in the 1980s, to tearing down the Berlin \nWall in 1989, and to hastening the overall demise of the Soviet Union \nand the end of the Cold War.\n\n  Now, some wonder, if it is still relevant, and express serious doubts \nas to whether or not we should expand it.\n  Mr. President, it will be decades before we know with any certainty \nwhether central Europe establishes itself in toto as a model of \ndemocratic rule, or something less. But it is not difficult to conjure \nup images of exclusive ethnic and latent ultra-nationalism underlying \nfuture conflict.\n  The historical legacy of the region generally is worrisome. World War \nI started with a mere gunshot in Sarejevo. And even recent history in \nthe region shows that stability can't be treated as a foregone \nconclusion given the conflagration of the former Yugoslavia after Tito. \nAnd now Kosovo threatens to inflame the area all over again.\n  NATO has performed admirably in restoring a semblance of order in \nBosnia. Yet the job is far from finished. We face years of civil and \npolitical reconstruction. But NATO and American leadership have made \nthe difference in resuscitating that country.\n  Mr. President, Bosnia demonstrates that the stakes are far too great \nto view NATO as some kind of anachronism.\n  NATO is a vibrant, meaningful, omnipresent military institution that \nhelps preserve a favorable security environment. And let me emphasize \nthat it safeguards American vital interests. We don't lead NATO as a \nfavor to Europe.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the greatest challenge, or opportunity, in all \nthis lies in developing a partnership between Russia and an expanded \nNATO. The Permanent Joint Council we've established with the Russians \nsecures an important role for them in the new security architecture of \nEurope.\n  We should welcome their input and value their advice in charting a \nnew course for the Continent. Russia, after all, has been a player in \nEurope for better than 300 years. We can, and should, pursue those \nmutual security concerns with Russia that contribute toward peace and \nstability in the Euro-Atlantic area.\n  At the same time, an expanded NATO will retain the right to act \nindependently, as has been the case for fifty years. Its core purpose \nwill continue to be to ensure its own security through collective \ndefense.\n  Where there might be disagreements, Russia should not interpret NATO \nactions as trampling on its national security prerogatives.\n  Rather, the aim of the alliance, in Vaclav Havel's words, ``is first \nand foremost an instrument of democracy, intended to defend mutually \nheld and created political and spiritual values * * * [and is] the \nguarantor of Euro-American civilization.''\n  NATO's expansion will erase the artificial lines drawn by Stalin, but \nis not and should not be perceived as a threat to Russia's security.\n  It is in our interest, and we should provide tangible support to \nfurther develop Russia as a peaceful democracy. Expanding NATO helps \nconsolidate the hard fought gains of winning the Cold War, and sets a \nuseful example for Russia among its neighbors to continue with \ndemocratic reforms internally.\n  Mr. President, the working predicate of a number of the amendments \nbefore the Senate seem designed to make the accession process more \ncumbersome and unwieldy. I believe we need to distinguish this \nparticular matter, however, from common appropriations and \nauthorization legislation we amend and consider in the Senate.\n  I believe, ambiguity regarding the protocol terms of entry, for \nexample, will have a corrosive effect on our ability to lead the \norganization in the future. Existing and future members begin to focus \nmore on American conditions instead of affirmative American leadership.\n  Mandating a multi-year pause in expansion, for example, would lead us \ninto the same difficulty we encountered setting deadlines for troop \nwithdrawals from Bosnia. Critical national decisions based on carefully \nreasoned and supported judgments are subjugated to an artificial time \nline that could actually end up proving harmful to our military \ninterests.\n  We need to be flexible rather than arbitrary about future entrants \ninto NATO: If the first round goes well, the Partnership for Peace \nprogram will keep the door open for new members. Present and future \nsecurity considerations will then dictate the pace and scope of \nenlargement.\n  Along these same lines conditioning NATO membership on EU membership \nstrikes a discomfiting parallel between two organizations whose core \nmissions are fundamentally different, one being military and the other \neconomic and social.\n  The amendment would, in effect, allow a group of EU nations veto \npower over a critical decision affecting U.S.\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\nnational security: our choice of military allies in any future \ncontingency.\n  In all three previous rounds of NATO enlargement--Turkey and Greece \nin 1952, Germany in 1955, and Spain in 1982--it was clearly understood \nthat expansion presaged European economic development and integration \nas a key benefit, not the other way around. Now, inclusion in NATO will \nhelp establish a climate of confidence for these three countries as \nthey seek foreign direct investment and pursue economic integration.\n  Mr. President, strengthening NATO by expanding its ranks contributes \nto a peaceful, democratic, free and unified Europe. As the security \nlandscape of central Europe rapidly changes, we ought to take advantage \nof this historic moment. A static, cautionary approach misses the \nopportunity to extend democratic principles across Europe.\n  Vaclav Havel, perhaps better than anyone, has stripped away the \nlayers of argument on each side, observing that ``if the West does not \nstabilize the East, the East will destabilize the West.'' Europe looks \nto the United States for leadership, and it is time for us to act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Resolution of Ratification before \nus, and oppose burdensome amendments that would weaken an enlarged \nNATO.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished Senator from New York desires to speak \non behalf of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in brief, a moment of history about \nRussia.\n  On March 20, 1917, one of the most momentous Cabinet meetings in \nAmerican history took place in which Woodrow Wilson and his Cabinet \njudged that German submarine warfare had reached a point which left the \nUnited States with no choice but to enter the war on behalf of the \nAllied Powers. In 13 days Wilson would convened Congress and speak to a \njoint session asking for recognition of the state of war with Germany. \nAt the Cabinet meeting, Robert Lansing, as Secretary of State, spoke in \nfavor of doing this. He captured the meeting in a memorandum in which \nhe wrote: ``I said that the revolution in Russia which appeared to be \nsuccessful had removed the one objection to affirming that the European \nwar was a war between democracy and absolutism.''\n  Sir, in 1917, Russia had a democratic revolution. As a schoolchild in \nNew York, I can recall the head of that provisional government, Mr. \nKerensky, would come around to our assemblies to tell us about it. That \ndemocratic revolution was crushed by Lenin and the Bolsheviks in St. \nPetersburg. And the country lived a hideous 70 years under that regime. \nThen the Russians liberated themselves. They did it internally.\n  They had to face a second coup against Mr. Gorbachev with tanks \naround the government buildings. The tanks withdrew and the forces of \nan earlier protodemocratic government prevailed. There are Russians who \ngenuinely believe that they liberated their country. They now once more \nhave the possibilities they had at the beginning of the century before \nthe Bolsheviks took power. Why some of us here hated the Bolsheviks, \nhated Lenin and Stalin, and their successes, was not just for what they \nstood for but for what they had crushed.\n  There is a belief that is growing in Russia--one learns this; one \nhears this--that they not only freed themselves of the infamous Stalin \nand Lenin but also the countries around them; and that they should be \nseen now as a partner, not as the enemy. They were under the rule of \nthe their enemies.\n  I hope we will see this and not expand in their direction an alliance \nthat was formed against Joseph Stalin and his politburo. Give us a \nchance to bring Russia into the democratic world in which it almost \nentered and which will now be put in jeopardy, or so some of us \nbelieve. What a historic failure that would be.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by stating my \nopposition to the Ashcroft amendment which would too narrowly limit \nNATO's freedom of action by permitting NATO missions only for \ncollective self-defense, or in response to a threat to the territorial \nintegrity, political independence, or security of a NATO member.\n  I believe that is understandable--the concerns that have led to this \namendment being proposed, and some valid points have been made. \nClearly, the NATO military forces must not be used frivolously. I do \nnot believe that NATO is an organization that should take on worldwide \nmilitary missions that have nothing to do with European security.\n  I think these types of problems, however, should be avoided as NATO \nmakes decisions--not limitations to be placed on NATO's ability to make \ndecisions. When real-world challenges arise, we need the ability to \nhave free and unfettered consultations with our allies on all possible \ncourses of action before a decision is reached. Article IV of the NATO \ntreaty already permits this kind of unrestricted consultation, as it \nhas ever since Dean Acheson first presented it to the Senate 49 years \nago.\n\n  The Ashcroft amendment would for the first time restrict the scope of \nsuch article IV consultation by preventing NATO from considering taking \naction in many cases--even if we and our allies believed that such \naction would serve our common security interests. This is an \nunwarranted restriction on our freedom to consult and take joint action \nwith our allies through NATO.\n  The fear that NATO might take on missions that the United States \nopposes is unfounded. We already have all the safeguards we need at \nNATO because we have a veto. There can be no NATO mission, no military \noperation, no out-of-area deployment, unless the United States \nspecifically supports that decision. Mr. President, not only do we have \na veto but the United States is a leader of NATO. Rather than our \ngetting dragged into missions we do not want, the reality at NATO is \nthe opposite. The United States has always been the country to take a \nstrong leadership position and to seek support from our European \nallies. We are the ones who seek to spread the burdens of maintaining \nsecurity to our allies, not the other way around. The Ashcroft \namendment would give a powerful tool to those allies who may seek to \ndodge burden sharing, who may want to prevent an active NATO role, or \nwho would otherwise oppose a strong U.S. leadership role.\n  I suspect that part of the motivation behind this amendment is a lack \nof confidence that the current U.S. administration will say no to \nmilitary operations when it has to. That is a concern I fully \nunderstand. But a lack of confidence in the current administration is \none thing to be dealt with between the Congress and the White House. \nPutting a hard and fast limit on NATO, the most successful military \nalliance in history, and the best tool we have for spreading the \nburdens of common security, is quite another thing.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious amendment and one that I think would \nhave serious consequences on our alliance and our relations with our \nallies, as well as our ability to act in the United States vital \nnational security interests.\n  Finally, I oppose the Warner amendment because I believe it is an \nartificial barrier. I don't believe that we want to keep countries out \nof NATO. We can do that already because we have a veto of NATO. If the \nadministration were to make a bad decision, we in the Senate could \nstill withhold our consent at that time. But if we decide our own \nnational security interests warrant bringing a qualified country into \nNATO in less than 3 years, this amendment would prevent us from doing \nso. I don't see why we would want to limit ourselves in this way.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. After consultation with the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, in light of the fact several more Senators have asked to \nspeak, I would ask unanimous consent, if the Senator is listening, for \n10 additional minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, no objection.\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. My intention in terms of the now 10 minutes total time I \ncontrol, I will yield 5 to my senior colleague from Delaware, and then \nI will yield the remaining 5--and I think that will leave me 1 minute \nto close--to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, just so \npeople will know the order.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as well intentioned as the Warner amendment \nmay be, I urge my colleagues to oppose it. To accept it would be \ninconsistent with the NATO Treaty. It would unnecessarily limit U.S. \nflexibility in pursuing further enlargement. It is constitutionally \nunnecessary. And, above all, it undercuts the tremendous gains for \npeace accomplished over the last decade in Central Europe and in our \nrelationship with Russia.\n  What this amendment proposes is an arbitrary freeze--or a pause--in \nthe enlargement process. This, despite the fact that Article 10 of the \nWashington Treaty, the Alliance's founding charter, states clearly that \nmembership is open to, and I quote, ``any other European state in a \nposition to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to \nthe security of the North Atlantic area.''\n  Mr. President, we all agree that NATO is an unprecedented success in \ndeterring conflict and promoting peace and stability. Toward these \nends, NATO has been expanded three times in the past. To remain vital, \nrelevant, and successful in the future, NATO must remain consistent \nwith Article 10 and keep its doors open to those European democracies \nready to bear the responsibilities and burdens of membership.\n  NATO enlargement is a policy rooted in this principle and driven by \nmoral imperatives, strategic self-interest, and objective criteria \nconcerning military readiness and political and economic reform. Any \nproposal to freeze enlargement--whether it be permanent or temporary--\nsubordinates these factors to an arbitrary timeline. And it opens the \ndoor to other significantly adverse consequences for the United States \nand the Alliance:\n  First, a freeze would reduce U.S. flexibility and leverage within \nNATO. It would unnecessarily undercut our ability--and the Alliance's \nability--to respond to the inherent uncertainty of the future.\n  Second, it would send an unfortunate, and even dangerous message to \nthe reformist governments of Central Europe. They would suppose--and \nnot incorrectly--that the United States is slamming the door shut \nconcerning their possible accession into the Alliance.\n  Do we really wish to send such a disillusioning message?\n  Article 10 of the Washington Treaty was a source of hope to Central \nEuropeans during Soviet oppression. The prospect of NATO membership \nremains an important incentive for democratic and economic reform. It \nhas motivated the reconciliations between Germany and the Czech \nRepublic, Germany and Poland, Romania and Hungary, Romania and Ukraine, \nas well as Italy and Slovenia, among others. Their unprecedented \nefforts to cooperate among themselves and to jointly consolidate peace \nand security in that region must be strengthened, not undercut.\n  Third, a mandated pause created by this amendment would prompt a new \ndividing line in Europe. If Central European countries not invited into \nNATO conclude that the process of enlargement has not only stalled, but \nstopped, a key incentive behind the aforementioned regional \ncooperation, including their current participation in NATO's \nPartnership for Peace program, will be seriously undercut. Thus, a \nfreeze on enlargement would impede, if not reverse, the remarkable \ndevelopment of European security around an Alliance-determined agenda.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, an arbitrary freeze on NATO enlargement would \nharm Russia's historic reconciliation with NATO and the United States. \nA freeze would appear to give Moscow a veto over enlargement. It \ncertainly would be interpreted as a victory--proof of their own \nlegitimacy--by those who still advocate a Russian sphere of influence \nover its neighbors. Worse yet, it could lead others to draw the same \nconclusion. A freeze would undercut the basic principle that all of \nEurope's states have a right to choose their own security \narrangements--a principle that must be one of the cornerstones of \nRussia's relationships with the United States and NATO.\n  While I am sure the intentions behind this amendment are admirable, \nwe must recognize that its consequences would be potentially \ndisastrous. It would undercut U.S. leadership and influence within the \nAlliance. It would contradict the founding document of the Alliance. It \nwould threaten the historic progress we have witnessed in Central \nEurope--progress from which we all benefit. And It would reject a \nprinciple fundamental to establishment of a constructive relationship \nwith a democratic Russia.\n  I suspect, Mr. President, that one false premise behind this \namendment is that NATO enlargement has been a rushed process. Nothing \ncould be farther from the truth. The velvet revolutions that restored \ndemocracy and independence to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary \ntook place in 1989. Nearly a decade will have passed before these three \ncountries become NATO members in 1999.\n  Moreover, the Senate has not rushed, and is not being rushed, into \nendorsing NATO enlargement. This chamber and its committees have been \nexamining and promoting this initiative since 1993, if not earlier. \nAnyone concerned about the future enlargement process can be assured \nthat the same careful study, debate, and oversight that has attended \nthis past effort will attend those to come. Read the resolution of \nratification carefully. It explicitly requires extensive consultation \nbetween the Senate and the President about any such initiative.\n  It states that the ``United States will not support the admission of, \nor the invitation for admission of, any new NATO member, unless (I) the \nPresident consults with the Senate consistent with Article II, section \n2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States (relating to the \nadvice and consent of the Senate to the making of treaties); and (II) \nthe prospective members can fulfill the obligations and \nresponsibilities of membership, and its inclusion would serve the \noverall political and strategic interests of NATO and the United \nStates.''\n  Before, I yield the floor, Mr. President, let me reiterate a key \npoint to those who fear a rushed process of further NATO enlargement. \nThe bottom line, is that further expansion of the Alliance will always \nbe contingent on careful study, public debate, high-level \nconsultations, political consensus, and the strategic interests of NATO \nand the United States. Any further expansion will also be contingent on \nSenate ratification--the difficult hurdle of securing 67 votes.\n  For these and other reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against any \nproposal that undercuts the founding document and basic principles of \nthe NATO Alliance. The ratification of the accession of Poland, the \nCzech Republic, and Hungary to NATO will erase destabilizing lines, \nwhich are relics of the Cold War. This amendment portends only be a \nstep toward new, divisive lines in Europe--and, that is something we \nshould never accept.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. For purposes of informing the Senate, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following order take place and time for each vote. The \norder of votes will be that the Craig amendment which was finished last \nnight would come first, the Moynihan vote second, the Warner vote \nthird, that the normal time be given to the Craig amendment, that the \nsecond and third votes be 10 minutes each, and that they be up or down \nvotes on each amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will not object, but I would just like to ask would it \nbe appropriate to include in the unanimous-consent request time for me \nto speak after the vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Consent has been granted to recognize Senator \nStevens.\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I would ask unanimous consent to be recognized following \nSenator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator who is \nranking member of the committee who is managing this business in the \nChamber.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2316\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak with reference to the amendment \noffered by Mr. Craig that would, if adopted, require that the United \nStates adopt a specific authorization for the continued deployment of \nU.S. forces now in Bosnia prior to the deposit of the U.S. instrument \nof ratification of the protocols for NATO expansion. I have long \nsupported an active Congressional role regarding the ongoing U.S. \nmission in Bosnia. Congress does have a responsibility to carefully \noversee that mission, to ensure that it stays on track and that limits \nare placed on the U.S. role there that will safeguard our troops from \nbeing consumed in an ever-expanding nation-building crusade. So, I \nsupport what I think is the Senator's intent, which is to apply \npressure to the Administration and the Congress to fulfill their \noversight responsibilities with respect to Bosnia.\n\n  However, that being said, I do not believe that this amendment is \nnecessary. The Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense Authorization \nbill is likely to be considered by the Senate within the next several \nweeks, and the corresponding appropriations bill will also be taken up \nbefore we adjourn. These bills are the appropriate vehicles on which to \ndebate and act to place limits on the U.S. mission in Bosnia. They \nprovide a vehicle for establishing policy and then backing up the will \nof Congress with the power over the purse. We do not need this \namendment today to force us into taking action on Bosnia. We do not \nneed to hold these nations--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--\nhostage to any perceived inability or lack of will on our part to act \nindependently on Bosnia.\n  So I say to my colleagues that this Senator from West Virginia does \nnot lack the will to work to establish a policy and a specific, \ndetailed authorization for the U.S. mission in Bosnia. I do not favor \nopen-ended commitments to deploy forces to Bosnia, and I do not favor \ngiving this administration or any other administration a free rein to \ninvolve our men and women in uniform in the kind of policing actions \nthat got us into such trouble in Somalia. I am already working on such \nan amendment in concert with other Senators, with the intention of \noffering it to the Department of Defense Authorization bill or perhaps \nsome other vehicle. I welcome the participation of Senator Craig and \nhis cosponsors in this debate. But we do not need to act on this \namendment at this time. We do not need to leave this protocol bound and \ngagged in some dark closet until we ransom it with a debate and \nlegislative action that, I assure you, will take place without a \nhostage on another occasion on another day and on another measure.\n  Although I will vote against this amendment, I assure my colleague \nfrom Idaho, and the other supporters of his amendment, that it is not \nbecause I do not wish to have a concrete policy regarding Bosnia. I \nurge Senators to vote against the amendment offered by Senator Craig.\n  I thank the Chair, and, Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2322\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the senior Senator from New York may \ndesire. Could I inquire of the remainder of time on both sides, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 10 minutes. The \nSenator from Delaware has 2 minutes 8 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator from Delaware wish to let the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts proceed? Is that my understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 1 minute to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  I share the concerns of many Senators with respect to the \npossibilities of future rapid expansion, and there are serious \nquestions from the Congress about the control of that. But I do think \nthe constitutional issues of restraint of a President before the fact \non foreign policy are significant, and equally significant, I believe, \nthat we will have ample opportunity for consultation.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the President that I received on April 23. I call my colleagues' \nattention to one particular paragraph, which is, the President says:\n\n       I pledge to undertake the same broad pattern of \n     consultation before making any future decisions about \n     invitations of membership to other states, or making any \n     membership commitments.\n\n  In other words, no private membership commitments will be made \noutside of the process of the U.S. Congress consultation.\n  I might also add that that consultation in the past has taken over \nseveral years, with a number of different resolutions of support having \nbeen passed previously. So I think in that light I will oppose the \nWarner amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of the letter from the \nPresident be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 23, 1998.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: In the coming days the Senate will complete \n     consideration of the proposed accession of Poland, Hungary, \n     and the Czech Republic to NATO. NATO's enlargement offers our \n     country an historic opportunity to increase America's \n     security, improve Europe's stability, and erase the vestiges \n     of the Cold War dividing line. For these reasons, I \n     appreciate the support that you and a bipartisan majority of \n     your colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee gave this \n     initiative on March 3, when the Committee voted 16-2 in favor \n     of a resolution of ratification on NATO enlargement.\n       I know, however, that you and other senators have certain \n     concerns about the process of NATO enlargement. In \n     particular, I am sensitive to the questions you raised during \n     the Committee's March 3 meeting regarding future rounds in \n     the enlargement process. These same questions underlie \n     Senator Warner's proposal for a mandated pause in the \n     enlargement process after admission of these first new \n     members. Let me take this opportunity to comment on Senator \n     Warner's proposal and the issues it attempts to address.\n       I have long maintained that, as part of our broader \n     strategy to make Europe more united and stable, NATO should \n     keep its door open for other qualified states that aspire to \n     membership. I was pleased that NATO adopted this position at \n     the Madrid summit last July. The Alliance also declared in \n     Madrid that it would review the process of enlargement at our \n     next summit in Washington. Neither my Administration nor NATO \n     has made any decision about when the next invitations for \n     membership should be extended, or to whom.\n       Both the United States and or NATO will need to address \n     many complex questions before making decisions about the \n     admission of other new members, but I am convinced that such \n     a mandated pause is the wrong way to address these questions. \n     A mandated pause would reduce our own country's flexibility \n     and leverage in Europe, and it would fracture the open door \n     consensus we helped build within NATO. It would also \n     undermine support for reforms in the Central European \n     countries still aspiring to NATO membership and thereby \n     create a new and potentially destabilizing line across \n     Europe. In contrast, the Open Door policy retains the \n     positive incentives that have reinforced reforms and good \n     neighborly relations throughout the region over the last five \n     years.\n       For these reasons, I have urged the Senate in the strongest \n     terms to reject any effort to impose an artificial pause in \n     the process of NATO's enlargement, and I hope I will have \n     your support for that position. It is not necessary for the \n     Senate to mandate a moratorium on the enlargement process to \n     ensure that future steps proceed in a careful and deliberate \n     manner. I consulted extensively with members of both chambers \n     and both parties in Congress on the full range of decisions \n     concerning NATO's enlargement, including decisions on how \n     many and which states to support for membership. I pledge to \n     undertake the same broad pattern of consultation before \n     making any future decisions\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n     about invitations of membership to other states, or making \n     any membership commitments. Of course, the admission of any \n     additional new members also would require the advice and \n     consent of the Senate.\n       The end of the Cold War has given us an unprecedented \n     opportunity to help build an undivided, democratic, and \n     peaceful Europe. There are many elements in our strategy \n     designed to achieve that goal, including our efforts to make \n     further reductions in nuclear arms levels and to adapt the \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty; our bilateral \n     programs to support reform in Russia, Ukraine, and the other \n     new democracies; and our work with other institutions, such \n     as the European Union and the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe. A strong NATO remains the foundation \n     of our transatlantic security agenda and I am convinced that \n     continuation of our open door policy will advance our overall \n     interests and enhance NATO's capabilities.\n       I am grateful for the support and sound advice you and \n     other senators have provided as we pursue that agenda, and I \n     look forward to continuing our work on this and other \n     national security issues in the days to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Warner amendment that would \nmandate a pause of three years before the United States would \nencourage, participate in, or agree to any further enlargement of NATO \nafter the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n  At the outset, I would note that I am unaware of any rationale for \nchoosing three years for a pause--it appears to be an arbitrary number \nand I think it is inappropriate to legislate on such an important \nmatter on an arbitrary basis.\n  Article 10 of the NATO Treaty states in pertinent part that ``The \nParties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European state in \na position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute \nto the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty.'' \nNATO's door has been open since the establishment of the Alliance and \nhas resulted in the admission of Greece, Turkey, Germany and Spain over \nthe years. To mandate a three-year pause would be inconsistent with the \npolicy that has guided the Alliance since 1949.\n  Mr. President, the desire to join the Alliance has been a productive \nforce for candidate nations who have been seeking to establish their \ncredentials for admission by perfecting their laws relating to \ndemocracy, individual liberty, the rule of law, and the establishment \nof market economies and by reaching accommodations with their \nneighbors. We should not do anything to discourage these developments.\n  But also importantly, I am concerned that a three-year pause would \nimply too much--that after three years, the Senate would support more \nnations joining NATO. Mandating a pause is no more logical than raising \nexpectations as to when the next round of NATO accessions will occur. \nFurther enlargement of the Alliance should be judged by the \ncircumstances that exist at the time. I am not committed to further \nenlargement of the NATO Alliance after three years and I doubt that \nmost of our colleagues are so committed. I fear that, by passage of \nthis amendment, we would send a false signal to those nations that \ncontinue to aspire to NATO membership.\n  Mr. President, as noted in Foreign Relations Committee Report on NATO \nenlargement, Secretary of State Albright has committed the Executive \nBranch to keep the Senate fully informed of significant developments \nwith regard to possible future rounds of NATO enlargement and seek its \nadvice on important decisions before any commitments are made. More \nrecently, in a letter to Senator John Kerry that was released by the \nSpecial Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on NATO \nenlargement, President Clinton wrote in part that ``I pledge to \nundertake the same broad pattern of consultation before making any \nfuture decisions about invitations of membership to other states, or \nmaking membership commitments.''\n  Mr. President, those commitments and the Constitutional requirement \nfor Senate advice and consent to any future amendments to the NATO \nTreaty that enlarge the Alliance are all that is necessary. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Warner amendment as both arbitrary and \nmisleading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to point out, with regard to \nthe military credibility of NATO raised by my friend from New Jersey, \nin terms of protecting Poland, I remind him, West Berlin was militarily \nindefensible but the Warsaw Pact never attacked. Why? Because the \nSoviet Union knew what would happen.\n  The third point I would make is with regard to the 3-year pause.\n  The clearest reason this amendment is superfluous is in the \nResolution of Ratification itself, Section Two, Paragraph Seven. There \nit clearly states that the U.S. has not consented to invite any state \nother than the three before us today, and that many subsequent decision \nto do so would rest on that state's ability to fulfill the obligations \nof membership, as well as serve the overall political and strategic \ninterests of NATO and the U.S.\n  Further, Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty declares, and as the \nJuly 1997 Madrid NATO Summit Declaration repeats, that the door to NATO \nmembership is open to other European states able to further principles \nof the treaty and to contribute the security of the North Atlantic \narea. Each applicant country will be judged on its merits.\n  Moreover, in the Resolution of Ratification before us, Section 2, \nParagraph 7(A)(iv) requires prior consultation of the Senate by the \nPresident before the United States can support the invitation of any \nnew member, and recalls that ratification of any new NATO ally requires \nthe advice and consent of this body.\n  To mandate a pause would tie NATO's hands should an obviously \nqualified applicant such as Austria applies for membership. For the \nmoment, it appears that the Austrian government has decided against \napplying for membership, but that could change after elections next \nyear.\n  In fact, Austrian public opinion is already changing. Earlier this \nmonth when the Austrian public was informed of NATO's Article 5 \nguarantees, for the first time in a national poll a majority of \nAustrians said that Austria should abandon its neutrality and join \nNATO.\n  So if the Austrian government decides to follow public opinion, would \nwe then want to tell the Austrians, ``Sorry, no applications accepted \nuntil the year 2002''?\n  As you know, many, including myself, believe that Solvenia already \nmeets the criteria for NATO membership. I supported its entry in this \nfirst wave. There is every indication that Slovenia will be ready to \njoin the Alliance within the next three years.\n  To mandate a pause would take the urgency off the reform efforts that \nnations such as Bulgaria and Romania have stepped up, at great short-\nterm cost to their standard of living, precisely because they want to \nmake themselves NATO-qualified for the next wave.\n  Even Slovakia, a long-shot applicant because of its poor record on \ndemocratization and privatization, may have a dramatic turn-around as a \nresult of national elections this fall.\n  Such a decision would make NATO look like it can't be trusted to \njudiciously apply its own criteria; namely, that it cannot tell when \nand whom to invite to become new allies. This is no policy for a great \nnation like the United States or a great alliance like NATO.\n  Secretary of State Albright told the Foreign Relations Committee on \nFebruary 24 that just the possibility of joining NATO has inspired \ndeclared applicants to accelerate reform, to reach out to their \nneighbors, and to reject the destructive nationalism of their region's \npast.\n  As one of many examples of this, Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus \nsigned in March a border agreement paving the way for a final \ndemarcation of the 500-kilometer Baltic-Belarusian frontier.\n  Given these accomplishments, Secretary Albright warned:\n\n       A mandated pause would be heard from Tallinn to in the \n     north to Sofia in the south as the sound of an open door \n     slamming shut. It would be seen as a vote of no confidence in \n     the reform-minded governments from the Baltics to the \n     Balkans. It would diminish the incentive nations now have to \n     cooperate with their neighbors and with NATO. It would \n     fracture the consensus NATO itself has reached on the open \n     door. It would be dangerous and utterly unnecessary since the \n     Senate would, in any case, have to approve the admission of \n     any new allies.\n\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\n\n  There are many foreign policy experts who share these views. But let \nme quote one concerned American who urged me to oppose this amendment.\n  David Harris, Executive Director of the American Jewish Committee, \nwrote to me on March third, stating:\n\n       Last June 26, we [the American Jewish Committee] observed \n     that an enlarged NATO will mean greater security and \n     stability and also hasten the political and economic \n     integration of Europe. An expanded NATO means greater \n     stability and security for Central Europe, a region that was \n     the cockpit for the two world wars that brought such horror \n     to the world--and to the Jewish people.\n       For many of the same reasons we supported NATO expansion we \n     now oppose any effort to mandate a pause in initiating \n     procedures for a second round of its enlargement.\n       States throughout Central Europe that hope for eventual \n     membership would feel that the open door enunciated at Madrid \n     had been slammed shut in their face.\n       At a minimum these states would be discouraged, and a pause \n     might lead to instability in the region. Hardliners in the \n     Russian Federation would find vindication.\n\n  Supporters of this amendment appear to believe that they are stopping \na runaway train of immediate NATO membership for every state from \nCroatia to Kazakhstan.\n  They seem to be unaware that not every European state has declared an \nintent to join NATO. In particular, Ukraine, at its March 26 meeting \nwith NATO officials, restated its view that while it ``does not rule \nout'' joining the alliance, such a move is currently unrealistic.\n  Ukraine issued three conditions for joining NATO: (1) decisive public \nopinion in favor of accession; (2) interoperability of its armed forces \nwith those of NATO members; and (3) a guarantee that its accession \nwould not harm relations with neighboring states, particularly Russia.\n  Recognizing that we already have all the control we need over the \nspeed and choice of future NATO members, I urge my colleagues to vote \ndown this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, article 10 of the North Atlantic \nTreaty provides that NATO members, by unanimous agreement, may invite \nthe accession to the North Atlantic Treaty of any other European state \nin a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty \nand to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. The \nresolution of ratification notes that only Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic have been invited by NATO members to join the Alliance. \nNo other agreement or document, including the July 8, 1997 Madrid \nSummit declaration of NATO, or the Baltic Charter signed on January 16, \n1998, should be construed otherwise.\n  Much has been said about these documents, but I am not certain that \nall of my distinguished colleagues have read them carefully. In Madrid, \nNATO's Secretary General stated ``In keeping with our pledge to \nmaintain an open door to the admission of additional Alliance members \nin the future, we also direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that \nprocess under continual review and report to us. We will review the \nprocess at our next meeting in 1999.'' This is not a promise, a \ncommitment, or any other guarantee that countries in Central and \nEastern Europe will be invited to join NATO--it is merely a statement \nthat enlargement is a process that should be reviewed by NATO \nregularly.\n  Further, the Baltic Chapter, signed this past January by the \nPresidents of the United States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \ndeclares that the U.S. ``welcomes the aspirations and supports the \nefforts of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to join NATO. It affirms its \nview that NATO's partners can become members as each aspirant proves \nitself able and willing to assume the responsibilities and obligations \nof membership, and as NATO determines that the inclusion of these \nnations would serve European stability and the strategic interests of \nthe Alliance''. Mr. President, this last statement is important--the \nBaltic Charter clearly states that including any new members in NATO \nmust serve the strategic interests of the Alliance. All candidate \ncountries will be evaluated on these criteria.\n  The United States should not support the invitation to NATO \nmembership to any further candidates unless the Senate is first \nconsulted, unless any proposed candidate can fulfill the obligations \nand responsibilities of membership, and unless their inclusion would \nserve the overall political and strategic interests of the United \nStates. During Foreign Relations Committee hearings, both Secretary of \nDefense Cohen and Secretary of State Albright expressed the \nAdministration's understanding of the need for consultation with the \nSenate prior to any future rounds of expansion.\n  I strongly oppose, however, mandating a period of time during which \nthe United States is not permitted to pursue a policy of NATO \nenlargement that very well may be in our national interests. The \ndecision to enlarge NATO should be based not on an arbitrary timeline, \nbut should be the result of a thoughtful process--based on \nconsultations with the Congress--that considers the security interests \nof NATO and the qualifications of candidate states.\n  I strongly oppose the Warner Amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, 19 years ago when I was privileged to come \nto the U.S. Senate, the leadership had just a year or so before passed \nfrom one of our most distinguished Members, the senior Senator from \nMontana, Mike Mansfield. A few weeks ago in the old Senate Chamber, at \nage 95, he held forth in a magnificent review of history of the Senate \nwithout a flaw, without a quiver in his voice, and with an expression \non his face that conveyed the strength and the confidence that that man \nhad.\n  I missed the opportunity to serve with him. But one of his major \ngoals in the concluding years of his distinguished career was to come \nto this floor, time and time again, and call for reduction of our \ncommitment in troop size and financial commitment to NATO, saying that \nthe job had been done, it was time to come home and to apply those \ndollars to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  That was the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. I see my \ndistinguished colleague from New York. He recalls those speeches very \nwell.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I remind the Senate that Mike Mansfield was in the Navy \nat age 14 and the Marines at age 17.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, saying that he spoke from some \nexperience--having proudly worn the uniform of all three branches, by \nthe way.\n  That could recur again in the minds of the American people, that we \nhave spent enough, we have contributed enough, and the time has come \nfor us to reduce our presence in Europe--which I think would be an \nabsolute tragedy. I would fight against it, as I did in my earlier days \nin the U.S. Senate when, time and time again, Senator Jackson, Senator \nStennis, Senator Tower, Senator Goldwater, Senator Thurmond would \nmarshal the forces of those of us who had just joined the Senate on the \nfloor to stop and ask the Senate not to cut NATO's budget. We felt it \nshould be an orderly transition down in size. And that took place.\n  I just bring up this history to say that once again the taxpayers of \nthis country, when they begin to look at the cost attributed to the \naccession of these three nations, costs which will be diverted in \ndollars from our own needs of the Armed Forces today, costs for the \nrefurbishment and building of new bases in these three countries at the \nvery time when we are going to shrink and continue to shrink the base \nstructure in the United States--all of this to say that the magnitude \nof the decision to access countries to this treaty is just an important \none. We are acting without full knowledge as to the future mission of \nNATO. We are acting without full knowledge of the cost of having these \nthree nations build their military up to where they are a positive--not \na negative, a positive--contribution to NATO.\n\n  I say with deep humility and respect of my colleagues, why not give \nAmerica 3 years within which to study? Why not, I say to the leadership \nof the Senate, allow another President to give his or her wisdom to \nthis question of whether additional countries should come in, preceded \nby, I hope, an active debate in the next Presidential election on the \nentire issue of the security interests of the United States using as a \nfocal point NATO and the experience gained, in all probability, by \naccessing these three nations.\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\n  We owe no less to that future President, for he or she will have to \nincorporate in their budgets the costs of new accessions, will have to \nincorporate in their budgets the diversion of such funds as may be \nallocated to additional nations.\n  Furthermore, the changing face of Europe today from one of cold war \nto one our military leaders now refer to as instability--instability is \nthe enemy in Europe and elsewhere in the world, largely because of the \nuncertainty associated with weapons of mass destruction and, in the \nwake of the new democracies, the instability as it relates to ethnic \nproblems, religious problems and all those associated with these new \nnations trying to seek strength as democracies politically and strength \neconomically in a one-world free market. But it is the whole range of \ninstabilities and associated conflict with which we have had very \nlittle experience, other than Bosnia, possibly Kosovo. Should we not \nhave the opportunity to study what are the requirements associated with \nthese new instabilities? Learn from experience. Add up the costs in \nBosnia. There have been many billions of dollars now contributed to \nbring about peace in that region.\n  I listened to our distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia \ntalk about the policy in Bosnia. In many ways, I associate myself with \nhis remarks. But we need--we need--that learning curve to make such \nimportant decisions as would be involved in adding more nations as \nmembers of NATO. Indeed the other----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will yield in a moment. The other nations would like, I \nam sure, to have this period of time. This 3-year moratorium gives a \nperfectly logical, understandable tool to the current President of the \nUnited States, indeed a future President, to withstand the stampede \nthat I predict will occur if this is not put in place. Mr. President, I \nyield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I just ask my friend, and I know he will be aware of \nthis, on January 16 this year, the President and the Presidents of the \nthree Baltic States signed the U.S. Baltic Charter of Partnership, \nwhich states that the United States welcomes and supports the efforts \nof the Baltic States to join NATO, states that could only be defended \nby nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I addressed that on the floor of the \nSenate before. I think it was an unwise movement by the President. We \nall have great compassion for those three states, the courage of their \npeople, their desire to affiliate more and more with the Western World. \nBut to have held out that hope which, once it is translated from the \nUnited States across the ocean into the states and down to the people, \nalmost is equivalent to an absolute commitment to see that it is going \nto happen.\n  That is precisely why I am concerned about leaving open the \nopportunity for new accessions to begin tomorrow unless the 3-year \nmoratorium, which is a reasonable period for study, is put in place.\n  I close with, once again, do we not have that obligation to the \nAmerican taxpayers who pay the costs associated, do we not have that \nobligation to the men and women of our Armed Forces who will proudly \nwear their uniforms as a part of the NATO force to have  clarity with \nrespect to future missions, which we will not have until 1 year hence, \nApril of 1999?\n\n  I say to my colleagues, let's just pause and take stock and think \nabout the seriousness of the decisions we are about to make and \nconsider that it is not unreasonable to allow 3 years of experience to \ntranspire to make future decisions regarding other nations. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n\n\n                  Vote on Executive Amendment No. 2316\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2316 offered by Mr. Craig of Idaho.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think this has been a very good debate. \nThere have been significant amendments offered and now voted upon. I \nsee from the list we have before us as many as six or eight additional \namendments still pending, several of which we have not been able to \nwork out a time agreement on. I thank all Senators for being \ncooperative. We have had opponents and proponents who have been \ncooperative. I encourage that to continue.\n  I believe maybe a Senator or two indicated that they didn't know we \nwere going to try to finish this bill this week. I think I have said \nall along that we should have a focused, unobstructed debate, but the \nintent was to complete it Wednesday or Thursday. Here we are on \nThursday at almost 4 o'clock. I talked to Senator Daschle, and we are \nagreed that we are going to finish NATO enlargement either at a \nreasonable hour this afternoon, or a late hour tonight, or tomorrow, or \nSaturday, but we are not going to leave this week until we finish NATO \nenlargement and the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Now, we can do both of those in a very responsible way with still \nsome good debate remaining. We need cooperation and time agreements. We \nneed cooperation on the supplemental appropriations. We agree that \nthese two issues must be completed this week so that next week we can \nmove to IRS reform, or the Workplace Development Partnership Act, and \nperhaps even crop insurance and agriculture insurance. So we don't have \nthe luxury of rolling this over until next week.\n  Our first vote will not occur until Tuesday at 5 o'clock. Please work \nwith us, and we can complete this bill and have a vote by 6:30 or 7 \no'clock if everybody will agree to a reasonable time limit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2321\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on amendment No. 2321 offered by Mr. Moynihan of New York.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in the foreseeable future the central \nstrategic object of the United States and the world will be that of \ncontrolling the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in \nthe Near East, in\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\nSouth Asia, in East Asia, and the control of them in Russia itself.\n  If we can have the cooperation, however tacit, of the Russian \nGovernment in these affairs, we have great hopes and possibilities. If \nwe were to have their hostility, their opposition, it could be ruinous \nto the world. We are talking about nuclear war and biological and \nchemical war. That, in my view, is what is at issue in this decision we \nare about to make and the amendment I have offered.\n  I thank the Chair for its courteous attention.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is absolutely no evidence today that \nexpanding NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would \ndo anything to exacerbate the problem we all are concerned about--the \nproliferation of nuclear capability.\n  The truth is, notwithstanding the knowledge on the part of Russia \nthat we are going to expand, they continue to destroy their nuclear \nweapons under the Nunn-Lugar agreement, they have endorsed and have \nratified the CWC agreement, and they have committed to take up the \nSTART II agreement. Nothing we have done relative to expansion has any \nnegative impact on the continued cooperation between the United States \nand Russia to deal with the threat of nuclear warfare.\n  I respectfully suggest that to vote for this amendment turns over the \nfuture of what we think the defense architecture of Europe should be to \nan organization of which we are not a part, and that is the EU. It says \nthat no one can join NATO unless they are first a member of the EU. Why \nwould we turn our fate over to an organization of which we are not a \nmember? I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes for debate evenly \ndivided before the vote on amendment No. 2322 offered by the Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I say to my colleagues, think of the American taxpayer. Think of the \nparents of the young men and women who will today, tomorrow and in the \nfuture wear the uniform of our country as a part of the NATO force. We \ndo not have a firm estimate of the costs and therefore in all \nprobability there will be an expense to the American taxpayer \nassociated with including these three countries. Nothing in this \namendment precludes the Senate acting on the three countries, the \nsubject of this principal debate. It simply says let us wait a \nreasonable period, 3 years, to get an experience curve to make the \nsubsequent decision if it is the judgment of the President at that time \nthat we proceed with further Member negotiations, giving us firmer cost \nestimates, a clearer definition of the mission to be undertaken and the \nrisk to be assumed by the men and women who wear the uniform of our \ncountry.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, several points. One, this is superfluous. \nIn the actual resolution of ratification, we make it clear in paragraph \n7 it requires prior consultation by the President before the United \nStates can support even the invitation of any new member, No. 1. No. 2, \nwe have the advise-and-consent requirement. They have to come here and \nget our votes to begin with. No. 3, this has nothing to do with cost, \nnothing to do with cost. It doesn't mention cost at all. No. 4, to say \nnow there is an artificial pause is going to put on hold all those \nactions taking place in other countries to meet the criteria from \nborder disputes to ethnic disputes that exist within those countries \nthat would be necessary to be solved before they could be invited. It \nis absolutely superfluous, and I would argue it is dangerous in that it \nwill send a signal that there is an artificial pause that really means \nno one else will be considered.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it. It is totally unnecessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nadoption of the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska allow me to \naddress the Senate for a minute?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I yield for that purpose, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank all Senators for very, \nvery careful consideration of this amendment. It is a strong vote. It \nsends a very strong signal. I recognize the conflict that some had in \ncasting their votes, but I think it is important that we take a stand, \nas we did, with this very significant vote against the strongest of \nopposition to make that statement on behalf of the American taxpayers \nand the parents of the young men and women who one day must assume \nadditional missions and additional risks. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with the amount included in the emergency \nsupplemental, the United States will have expended over $7.5 billion \nfor operations in and around Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia by the \nend of this fiscal year 1998. It is estimated that the United States is \npaying over 50 percent of the cost of maintaining the peace in Bosnia, \nnearly $200 million a month in 1997 alone, and no end is in sight to \nthe United States presence there, with the current wish of the \nPresident to extend our mission there.\n  Defense overseas funding to NATO countries continues. The cost of \nmaintaining our U.S. forces there averages $10 billion a year. Let me \nstate that again. Defense overseas funding in NATO countries is such \nthat the cost of maintaining our forces there averages nearly $10 \nbillion a year. Security assistance alone to NATO allies since 1950, \nand that includes military assistance and military education and \ntraining, now totals over $19 billion.\n  No other member of NATO has the global defense role that the United \nStates has, nor the forward-deployed presence in potential flash-point \nareas such as the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. It is for this \nreason, Mr. President, that I wish to discuss the two amendments that I \nproposed. I presented them last month.\n  The amendments both deal with the challenges of defining and \ncontrolling NATO expansion costs. My original intent in proposing these \namendments was to bring some greatly needed accountability to the \ncritical issue of recognizing and clarifying all the costs to the \nUnited States to enlarge the NATO alliance.\n  My first amendment is No. 2065, which requires all costs related to \neither the admission of new NATO members, or their participation in \nNATO be specifically authorized by law. It is my understanding that the \nmanagers of the bill have not accepted this amendment for inclusion in \nthe resolution, and for that reason I will, in a moment, ask for the \nyeas and nays on that amendment. I will explain it further if anyone \nwishes me to do so, but I think it is very plain. It just says any \nfurther costs must be authorized by law.\n  The second amendment has evolved since I originally offered it for \nthe Senate's consideration. My original amendment would have restricted \nthe use of funds for payment of NATO costs after September 30 of this \nyear unless the Secretaries of Defense and State certified to the \nCongress that the total percentage of NATO common costs paid by the \nUnited States would not exceed 20 percent during the NATO fiscal year.\n  After the administration expressed their concern that this would be \ntoo difficult to achieve in such a time period, I redrafted this \namendment to reduce the total U.S. contribution by only 1 percent each \nyear over a 5-year period. That would have been no more severe a \nreduction than the Department of Defense has experienced as a whole in \nreal terms since 1995.\n  However, during the extensive consultation that I have had with the \nSecretary of Defense, our former colleague, Secretary Cohen, and the \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Ralston, they \nhave requested further changes to this amendment.\n  Subsequently, I have sent to the desk now a modification of the \nlatest version which is what I will ask the Senate to vote on, and that \nis a sense of the Senate, that beginning in fiscal year 1999 and over \nthe next 5 years, the President should require the U.S. representative \nto NATO to propose to NATO a 1-percent reduction in U.S. contributions \nto the common-funded budgets of NATO. Sixty days after the proposal has \nbeen made, the President is requested to submit to Congress a report \noutlining the action taken by NATO, if any, on this U.S. proposal.\n  Additionally, this amendment directs the limitation on the total \nexpenditures by the United States for payment to the common-funded \nbudgets of NATO to the fiscal year 1998 levels unless an increase over \nthat is specifically authorized by law.\n  Mr. President, a soon-to-be-released report of the General Accounting \nOffice that has been conducted confirms--and I have seen the draft--\nconfirms that NATO does not systematically review or renegotiate member \ncost shares for the common budgets. And it is well past time for this \npractice to be instituted. As I have stated before, this reassessment \nis long overdue in light of the United States' global defense \nresponsibilities.\n  No formal renegotiations have occurred in the military and civil \nbudgets in NATO since 1955. Let me repeat that. There have been no \nformal renegotiations in the military and civil budgets of NATO since \n1955.\n  When Spain joined NATO in 1982, there was a pro rata adjustment in \nthe civil and military budget shares based upon Spain's contribution. \nThe NSIP, or the NATO infrastructure budget, has been adjusted five \ntimes since 1960 because of changes in the way projects were approved \nor funded, but there was no attempt to reallocate the percentages.\n  Mr. President, I think that is long overdue. I understand there will \nbe no objection to my amendment, No. 2066. If that is the case, I would \nurge that it be adopted as soon as the managers have made their \nstatements.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2065\n\n(Purpose: To require a prior specific authorization of funds before any \n     United States funds may be used to pay NATO enlargement costs)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. In any event, Mr. President, if it is in order for me to \ndo so at this time, I would like to place before the Senate amendment \nNo. 2065 so I may ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner and Mr. Roberts, \n     proposes executive amendment numbered 2065.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 3(2) of the resolution, add the \n     following:\n       (C) Requirement of payment out of funds specifically \n     authorized.--No cost incurred by the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) in connection with the admission to \n     membership, or participation, in NATO of any country that was \n     not a member of NATO as of March 1, 1998, may be paid out of \n     funds available to any department, agency, or other entity of \n     the United States unless the funds are specifically \n     authorized by law for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is the amendment that I believe the Senator from \nDelaware will discuss.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. To me, this is a matter of simple justice. As the \nsurviving superpower of the world, we must take action to limit our \ninternational commitments at least to the extent that we have limited \nour own budgets within the United States for the Department of Defense. \nBoth of my amendments do that. They merely say there is a restriction \non the future obligation of funds of the United States to these NATO \nprocesses unless they are previously authorized by law.\n  There is no barrier to going above the 1998 limit, and there is no \ncompulsion to reduce down to 20 percent as far as the total overall \ncommitment to the common budgets. But my amendment will bring about a \nprocess by which further expenditures will have to be authorized by law \nand will give Congress a specific control every year over the \nadditional cost, if any, that may be incurred because of this NATO \nexpansion.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to yield, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent that Daniel G. \nGroeschen of Senator Inhofe's office be extended floor privileges for \nthe remainder of the NATO debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding to me.\n  And I say to my friend, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nI doubt whether, with the exception of two or three other people in \nthis body, there are as many people who know about the defense budget \nas my friend does. And I want to say at the outset, what I am about to \nsay is--I say this with all sincerity--I am a little bit confused about \nthe two amendments.\n  Let me be very specific. The first amendment--I should get the \nnumbers correct of the amendments. Amendment No.--I think it is 2066--\nthat is the amendment that speaks to two things, one, a sense of the \nSenate regarding the common-funded budget or put another way--and I \nagree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that it is--we \nare instructing the President to negotiate down the percent that we, \nthe United States, contribute to the common budgets of NATO. I think \nthat is appropriate. I think that is necessary.\n  In 1950, the percent of the common budget that the United States paid \nwas roughly 50 percent. And in the only renegotiation that took place, \nthat was cut in half and went down to approximately 25 percent. The \nSenator knows better than I do, there are three common budgets. They \nare slightly different in terms of percentages, but essentially it is \n25 percent. And it should be lower, in my view. I thank him for making \nit a sense of the Senate rather than a condition to passage of the \ntreaty.\n  The second part of that amendment states--and I have a little \ndifficulty with it, but I am prepared to accept it on our side--it \nsays--and I quote on page 2, line 19:\n\n       Annual Limitation On United States Expenditures For NATO. \n     Unless specifically authorized by law, the total amount of \n     expenditures by the United States in any fiscal year \n     beginning on or after October 1, 1998, for payments to the \n     common-funded budgets of NATO shall not exceed the total of \n     all such payments made by the United States in fiscal year \n     1998.\n\n  Now, that means, as I understand it, because a lot of our colleagues \nwho do not spend as much time on these issues because of their \ncommittee assignments as the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, the Senator from Delaware--we are on committees that \nhave these responsibilities--are somewhat confused, as I am, when we \nstart talking about HCFA and a whole range of issues relating to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n\n  The common budget of NATO are all those expenditures which all 16 \nNATO members have to pitch in to pay for. Now, above the common budget, \nwe have in the past, and we will continue in the future, I expect, \nexpend dollars on--military dollars, State Department dollars, Defense \nDepartment dollars--on NATO member countries that are not part of a \ncommon budget.\n  For example, as the Senator knows better than I do, we have come up \nwith subsidized sales of weapons systems to Greece or to Turkey. We \nhave done the same in terms of cascading down weapons we are no longer \nusing to other NATO countries. They do not fall within the common \nbudget; they are expenditures of American taxpayer dollars on European \ncountries that are members of NATO.\n  The way this amendment I am referring to would work, as I understand \nit, if in the year 1998 the United States of America spent $10--I am \ngoing to make this easy for me--$10 contributing to the common budget \nof NATO, that is, it represents 25 percent of all the expenditures, and \nall of NATO spent $40 on the common budget, we spent $10, in the year \n1999 or 2000, we would be limited to spending $10 toward the common \nbudget even if the total common budget went up to $110 because we would \nonly be able to spend $10, which would represent a lower percentage \nthan our 25 percent unless the authorizing committees in question \nspecifically authorized the additional expenditures.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think it is unnecessary, but I have no objection to that \namendment.\n  Now, the second amendment, the number of which I am not going to even \ntry to guess, because I will mess it up, but the second amendment is \nmore direct--not more direct--is shorter and straightforward. It says--\ndo I have a copy of it here? It says:\n\n       Requirement of payment out of funds specifically \n     authorized. No cost incurred by the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) in connection with the admission to \n     membership, or participation, in NATO of any country that was \n     not a member of NATO as of March 1, 1998, may be paid out of \n     funds available to any department, agency, or other entity of \n     the United States unless the funds are specifically \n     authorized. * * *\n\n  Now, the phrase ``no cost incurred by NATO'' by definition, as I \nunderstand it, means only one thing, the common budget--the common \nbudget.\n  Now, if the chairman is concerned that we are going to, out of U.S. \ntaxpayers' dollars, spend money on a new NATO admittee, Poland, let us \nsay, that is not part of the common budget by saying, ``You know, NATO \nhas agreed we're going to extend a runway in Warsaw'' or wherever we \nare going to do it. That is a common budget requirement. NATO must pay \nfor that. It is not the national defense budget of Poland that pays for \nthat. Since all of NATO is going to use it, we all are going to pay for \nit.\n\n  On the other hand, if you want to buy F-15 aircraft, we, the United \nStates, will sell them to you under a Foreign Military Sales Act which \nis subsidized. We will be taking taxpayers' dollars, subsidizing the \nPolish military, if we sell them under the Foreign Military Sales Act. \nThat is not out of the common budget.\n  Now, if what the chairman is trying to capture is those kinds of \nexpenditures that exceed the common budget, I understand that, and I \nwill support that, requiring a specific authorization. But if he is \ntalking about any common budget expenditures by NATO, I see no \ndistinction, by requiring a specific common budget expenditure that \nfalls under the $10 ceiling, because we will be limited by the first \namendment to spending no more than $10 the next year.\n  If, in fact, we require no specific authorization to extend the \nrunway in Germany, and if it is a common budget investment and a NATO \ninvestment to extend a runway on German land for a NATO facility, and \nwe don't have to have a specific authorization to do that as long as it \ndoesn't exceed the cap of $10 total spending, then I don't understand \nwhy we would have to have a specific authorization to do the same exact \nthing with an equal member of NATO--assuming Poland is admitted--in \nPoland. It is not doing anything other than meeting a NATO obligation \nwe will have had to sign on to.\n  Secondly, if I am right--and I may not be, because I may not \nunderstand the second amendment--when I read the phrase, ``No cost \nincurred by NATO in connection with admission of new members''----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am more than happy to put into the \nsecond amendment, which is 2065, the phrase, ``other than common funded \nbudgets of NATO.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to accept the amendment if the Senator \ndoes that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no intention, if the Senator will yield further, \nto cover the issues--he is talking about the one that puts a cap on the \n1998 expenditures--unless authorized by law. The other one is intended \nto cover those costs where I believe the United States is going to \nventure out and say we will do this.\n  We have had that experience with the expenditures before. I think we \nwill have it again in these new areas, and these new areas are the ones \nthat need the most in terms of expenditure. Very frankly, we cannot \nafford to go it alone anymore. We want to see a requirement that \nCongress review the expenditures of funds in these areas.\n  Mr. HELMS. I would like to send a modification to the desk so we can \naccept that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the chairman will withhold for just a minute, I have no \nobjection to agreeing to what you have stated. I would like to, and we \nhave plenty of time to do this, and you have my commitment we will do \nit if our staffs can make sure that I am not misunderstanding what is \nbeing said.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is fair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. But I am 99 percent certain we agree fully, I say to the \nSenator from Alaska, in what he is attempting to do, and if he just \nchanged\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nthe language ``any NATO expenditure'' and we say ``any U.S. expenditure \nbeyond a common budget affecting any of these three nations \nrequires''--I am not a draftsman--``requires the authorization \ncommittee to do it,'' I will accept that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I state to my friend from Delaware that I am preparing \nto change the amendment so that it reads, ``requirement of payments of \nfunds specifically authorized, no cost incurred by the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, NATO, other than the common funded budgets of NATO \nin connection with the admission of membership participation of any \ncountry not a member of NATO as of March 1, 1998, may be paid out of \nfunds from any agency,'' et cetera.\n\n  We do not seek to be redundant with the second amendment, but 2065 \naddresses the voyeurism of our people in Europe to go and do it alone \nin interoperability, in communications, in the whole series of things \nthat they wish to have these new members of NATO have, without regard \nto common funded budgets, and to go obligate the United States, and \nthen we get the bills brought to us in Appropriations without any \nauthorization, without any review of Foreign Relations Committee, of \nArmed Services Committee, and suddenly the Appropriations Committee is \nfaced with making decisions which we shouldn't have to make.\n  I am told all the time these areas should be authorized by law, and \nhere is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee saying why don't \nwe have a requirement they be authorized by law. It is sort of like a \nrole reversal here of the husband saying, ``I've got a headache \ntonight, dear.'' It is not quite the normal thing to be hearing from an \nauthorizer that this is wrong for us to say. Make them get the \nauthorization by law before they present the Appropriations Committee a \nbill to be paid.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, we have a unanimous consent we \nwould like to enter, and it would give the Senator a minute to see if \nthey can get an agreement on this point.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield.\n\n\n      Unanimous Consent Agreement--Conference Report to H.R. 3579\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as if in \nlegislative session, that the majority leader, after notification of \nthe Democratic leader, may proceed, after disposition of the NATO \ntreaty, to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3579, the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, and, further, the reading of the \nconference report be waived.\n  I further ask there be 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual \nform, and following the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object--I could not hear--the \nmajority leader intends to proceed to this after what?\n  Mr. LOTT. After disposition of the NATO treaty, with debate not to \nexceed 1 hour, and then a final vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Executive amendment No. 2065\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska, I am quite \nsure I can accept this amendment 2065, but I would like to not do it at \nthe moment. I want to make sure I run the ``traps'' with my counterpart \non the Armed Services Committee and to make sure it is right.\n  Secondly, I must tell him, as a former chairman of an authorizing \ncommittee and now a ranking member of an authorizing committee, I am \nheartened and my soul is soaring to hear a chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee say, ``First get an authorization.'' That is, \nall by itself, reason to be excited about this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am glad you don't have a headache tonight, dear.\n  Let me ask that this amendment 2065 be set aside temporarily until \nthe Senator from Delaware concurs in my revision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Executive Amendment No. 2066, as Modified\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the United \nStates share of NATO's common-funded budgets, and to require an annual \nlimitation on the amount of United States expenditures for payments to \n                   the common-funded budgets of NATO)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask now that amendment 2066 be placed before the \nSenate. It will be accepted, and I ask that 2066 be voted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the next amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Roberts, proposes an \n     executive amendment numbered 2066, as modified.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 3(2) of the resolution, add the \n     following:\n       (C) United states future payments to the common-funded \n     budgets of nato.--\n       (i) Sense of the senate regarding united states share of \n     nato's common-funded budgets.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, beginning with fiscal year 1999, and for each fiscal \n     year thereafter through the fiscal year 2003, the President \n     should--\n\n       (A) propose to NATO a limitation on the United States \n     percentage share of the common-funded budgets of NATO for \n     that fiscal year equal to the United States percentage share \n     of those budgets for the preceding fiscal year, minus one \n     percent; and\n       (B) not later than 60 days after the date of the United \n     States proposal under subparagraph (A), submit a report to \n     Congress describing the action, if any, taken by NATO to \n     carry out the United States proposal.\n\n       (ii) Annual limitation on united states expenditures for \n     nato.--Unless specifically authorized by law, the total \n     amount of expenditures by the United States in any fiscal \n     year beginning on or after October 1, 1998, for payments to \n     the common-funded budgets of NATO shall not exceed the total \n     of all such payments made by the United States in fiscal year \n     1998.\n       (iii) Definitions.--In this subparagraph:\n\n       (I) Common-funded budgets of nato.--The term ``common-\n     funded budgets of NATO'' means--\n\n       (aa) the Military Budget, the Security Investment Program, \n     and the Civil Budget of NATO; and\n       (bb) any successor or additional account or program of \n     NATO.\n\n       (II) United states percentage share of the common-funded \n     budgets of nato.--The term ``United States percentage share \n     of the common-funded budgets of NATO'' means the percentage \n     that the total of all United States payments during a fiscal \n     year to the common-funded budgets of NATO represent to the \n     total amounts payable by all NATO members to those budgets \n     during that fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We just discussed this, and both sides have agreed to \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2066), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. It is my understanding amendment \n2065 is temporarily set aside until a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, if I may, to \nspeak to the issue of the expansion. I have watched closely and \nparticipated closely as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nand I have a number of different thoughts about the place we find \nourselves in now with respect to this first Eastern European expansion \nof new democracies to NATO --first Eastern European, obviously, since \n1949.\n  I think most Americans who follow this kind of topic very closely are \nsomewhat surprised by the level of the debate, the nature of the debate \nover the past week, sort of interrupted as it was for a period of time, \nand also by the seeming lack of significant concern in the country \nabout this. There is, obviously, in the past weeks a sense by many of \nthe pundits watching this who have observed it and pointed it out that, \ngiven the momentous nature of the transfer that is taking place, there \nmight have been considerably more concern. Obviously, some of that \nconcern has been heightened in the last weeks.\n  Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say the American public is \nfundamentally relatively oblivious to the fact that we are extending \nNATO's geographic range and military commitments. The debate\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\nwe now find ourselves in certainly doesn't seem joined like past \ndebates of momentous impact on our foreign policy that many of us took \npart in and remember when Russia was the Soviet Union and issues of \narms control loomed larger on our horizon.\n  One might ask why that is. Why is there this lack of confrontation or \ndrama? I think it is quite simply because we are fundamentally \npresented with a fait accompli. It is true that the basic decisions \nhave fundamentally been taken by Europe, by the President, by NATO, and \nI might point out significantly by Russia. Russia, recognizing some \ntime ago that this was essentially a done deal, took steps to join in \nthe available opportunities for cooperation that were made available. \nBut at the highest levels of government it was very apparent to our \nleaders in bilateral discussions and otherwise that we were moving down \nthis road. I suppose we have to be careful here, because if they \nmistakenly believe that somehow if they had offered greater opposition \nit might have been otherwise, I don't think that is necessarily the \ncase, but clearly the debate would have been different, at least \nsomewhat different.\n  So here we are in the Senate constitutionally charged with the power \nof advising and consenting of treaties. But essentially the Senate \nitself has been packaged and delivered much as the treaty has. I know \nthat some outside of the Senate argued, ``Well, it is never too late. \nWe can always make a different decision.'' But I think everybody \nunderstands the reality of where we find ourselves.\n  I have talked to a great many of my colleagues, each of whom have \nexpressed the notion that perhaps a partnership-of-a-peace approach, or \nsome other approach, might have been more advisable, but finding \nthemselves where they were, they came out of that dilemma and that \nequation where we are today also.\n  It must also be pointed out, though, at the same time for those who \nhave been complaining about the process, that the U.S. Senate had ample \nopportunity to do what it seems to be expressing a desire to do at the \nnext stage, and that is be more a part of the process, impose itself \nmore, know the consultative process, and, frankly, be more vigilant \nwith respect to what the consequences are of some of the resolutions \nthat come to the floor in the meantime, it is clear, however, that one \nof the reasons of the sense of lack of engagement at this moment is the \nreality that the Senate has gone on record a number of times in the \nlast few years as being totally supportive of moving forward with \nenlargement.\n  So I think that all of this really underscores the dilemma of this \nratification process at this stage. It has been very hard for anybody \nto object also to the notion that reconnecting Europe's east and west, \nperforming modern diplomatic plastic surgery on a historical dividing \nline, which reminds everyone of Soviet oppression, and that post-World \nWar II allied lassitude is somehow wrong.\n  In addition, many have found it difficult to say no, even if they \nthought they had reservations, to the countries of people who have so \nconstructively and plentifully contributed to the life in the United \nStates in which we are so connected historically, culturally, and \npolitically; and many have found it difficult to even say no knowing \nthat those countries at some point in the future in the meantime--\ndepending on what Russia evolves into, depending on what history \ndecides to lay in front of us, what history ultimately will be in the \nregion--might someday ask the question that was on their lips in the \nnot so distant past, which is, Why didn't you help us when you could?\n  So we are engaged in a debate that is rooted significantly in the \nemotions and the memories of the cold war, and with only a minimal and \nlate reference to the changes that have already taken place, both in \nEurope and the rest of the world and in Russia, and to the full \nramifications of the process of enlargement once begun.\n  The truth is that NATO already is no longer the same entity that it \nwas a decade ago, and it no longer faces the same threat. For 40 years, \nNATO has stood as a bulwhark, preserving European security, and, by \nextension, our own security for one very simple reason. It was poised \nagainst the threat that was posed by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw \nPact allies. NATO was the simple wall of deterrence against Soviet \nexpansionism and nuclear Armageddon. It drew its power and its raison \nd'etre from the geopolitical circumstances of the times. It was there \nlike Everest, and it deterred because of its unwavering presence. It \nwas not because of what NATO did that it drew its power. It was because \nof what was on paper, and in possibility. But now, with the Soviet \nUnion's empire and the threat that they pose is gone, the truth is that \nso too is NATO's original mission. Today, democratic elements with \nvarying degrees of success are taking root where communism once held \nsway even in Russia. To my knowledge, not one military expert or \nintelligence analyst has suggested that a threat like the old threat \ncould emerge again without at least 10 years of buildup and warning. To \nbe sure, Russia continues to be a nuclear power, but obviously a very \ndifferent kind of nuclear power than the Soviet Union of yesterday. It \nis a country trying to make the transition to democracy and to Western \ninstitutions and values, both at home and abroad.\n  So while NATO continues to be a ``collective defense alliance,'' its \nmission today is not at least, so we state, to defend against the \nRussian threat, but nevertheless if we are to be honest, it is \ncertainly at least still a principal rationale of it that we maintain \nit for and enlarge it as a hedge against the potential of future \nthreats against the unknown, including that of the potential of \nrecidivism in Russia.\n\n  Now with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion, and the change in the nature of the threat, NATO has already \nbegun a kind of transition expanding its mission to include other \ntasks. For example, peacekeeping, as evidenced by the presence in \nBosnia, and the new NATO, if you will, has an expanded vision of the \nrange of potential threats that include not only challenges posed by \nethnic and political rivalries within Europe to global threats, such as \nterrorism or nuclear proliferation, but also a greater willingness to \nundertake certain kinds of missions to cope with those threats.\n  I know some of my colleagues find that transformation particularly \ntroubling. Some may believe that what we passed with respect to the \nlanguage and the scope of the NATO mission doesn't, in fact, change any \nof that. But I suspect as we go down the road and think about \nenlargement later on in other countries, the questions about those \nroles will become even more significant.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, notwithstanding some of those \ncautionary instincts that a lot of us have about this process, and \nnotwithstanding the potential difficulties that we may face down the \nroad, I believe it is clear that the three countries in question--\nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--meet the basic requirements \nfor membership in NATO, and that we need to recognize that in less than \na decade those nations have successfully transformed themselves from \nCommunist states into vital democracies with emerging market economies.\n  They have taken steps to establish civilian control over the \nmilitary, and as participants in NATO's Partnership for Peace programs \nsince 1994, they have already begun the process of integration into the \nNATO force structure and command. Each of these three nations has made \nit clear they are prepared to foot the cost of membership, and they \nhave taken the steps to improve relations with their neighbors in an \neffort to earn that membership.\n  I believe that the benefits of bringing Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic into NATO are real. It will heighten the sense of \nsecurity within those three countries not only through the extension of \nNATO's military guarantee but also through the psychological benefits \nof being a European member and a member of the NATO club, and \ninteractions within the alliance will clearly help to strengthen the \nnew democracies and their abilities to assimilate themselves into \nEurope both economically and politically, and obviously militarily \nwithin NATO's integrated force structure.\n  Their membership will enhance stability in Central Europe and \nstrengthen NATO itself through the acquisition of additional forces and \npersonnel to cope with future threats and missions.\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\n These benefits notwithstanding--I think they are real--I express the \nconcern that, as a number of colleagues have expressed it, admission of \nthese countries, unless we do our job properly in the Senate, unless \nthe consultation process is thoroughly pursued in the course of the \nnext year, and unless we measure carefully the aftermath of the process \nof integration, the questions raised by the Senator from Alaska about \nfunding, the questions raised by Senator Warner and Senator Moynihan, I \nthink, are legitimate questions, not sufficient in and of themselves to \nstop us from proceeding forward, but questions which will have to be \nanswered and addressed in order to be able to proceed forward.\n  It is important for us in the Senate not to permit the first tranche \nof admission to somehow create an automatic dynamic for further \nexpansion to countries whose membership in NATO could conceivably--not \ndefinitely, but conceivably--pose serious strategic implications for \nthe security of Europe and of the United States.\n  Personally, I believe, as others have expressed the fact, that it \nmight have been equally as sensible, perhaps more sensible but equally \nas feasible, to proceed along the same line of building our \nrelationships, building the democracies, integrating forces while \nsimultaneously achieving the goal of START II and force reduction in \nRussia and building the democracy of Russia by dealing with the \nPartnership for Peace.\n  That was not the choice that was made, so we cannot stand here and \ndebate what might have been. But I am convinced that a longer period of \nintegration of armed forces and economic development over the next \nmonths will be critical to making the judgment about the next tranche, \nand it is critical for all of us not to allow this first vote to \nsomehow create expectations that are unmeetable or create a dynamic \nthat takes control of the process in and of itself.\n  One of the reasons I think it makes so much sense, obviously, and so \nmuch easier to accomplish what we are accomplishing now, which is why I \nthink the vote will be significant in affirming it, is that \nhistorically these particular countries were a part of Europe before \nfalling prey to Soviet domination during the cold war and culturally \nthey do regard themselves as European. At the moment, there is no \nimmediate threat to the security of those countries, but perhaps most \nimportantly, the most significant component of Russia's leadership, \nbeginning with President Yeltsin, came to recognize the inevitability \nof our initial intentions as well as to work out a process with the \nUnited States to make that acceptance possible.\n  The real question that has been asked eloquently by a number of our \ncolleagues and needs to be watched carefully as we go forward from here \nis, when other countries of greater geographical or strategic \nsignificance to Russia push to admission, we have to carefully measure \nwhat the ramifications of that acceptance or rejection may be at that \ntime. And I am confident that because of this process in the last \nweeks, the Senate is more prepared to do that than it may have been \npreviously.\n  I believe the administration deserves significant credit for the way \nit has, in fact, managed this process. They have been, I think, \nparticularly adept at focusing on those issues which have been raised \nin the Chamber with respect to Russia, and in my judgment they have \nlaid the groundwork for our capacity to proceed down a cooperative, not \na confrontational, road with Russia as a result. But clearly \ntransitional politics in Russia, future issues about succession, and \nthe politics of that nation have to play into our consideration in \nsubsequent rounds.\n  We have to distinctly remember, I think, several critical facts. \nDemocracy in Russia is in its earliest stages; Russia is still a \nnuclear power and the principal potential threat to European and \nAmerican security; and, third, a good working relationship with Russia \nis clearly necessary if we are to achieve a whole set of other critical \nobjectives on our foreign policy agenda, particularly that of nuclear \nproliferation, nuclear weapons reduction, and the containment of Iraq \nboth now and in the future.\n  The rationale for NATO expansion is rooted in the presumption that \nthe continued existence of NATO is in our interests. It is the world's \nonly established, effective, integrated military force with readiness \nand training. It benefits both us and Europe by tying us together and \nanchoring our involvement with the continent. It acts as a stabilizing \ninfluence on members that might otherwise come to blows, such as Greece \nand Turkey. It helps to nourish and strengthen the shared values and \ninterests of its members and, through its security guarantee, it \npromotes the development of a united and secure Europe.\n\n  All of these offer very legitimate reasons for this current step that \nwe take, but, again, one should not assume that that process of \nexpansion or all of those interests will be served in the same way or \nbe risk free as we go down the road.\n  Russia, as Secretary Albright acknowledged during the Foreign \nRelations Committee hearings, has always had strong nationalist forces \nwhich interpret every move that the West makes as anti-Russian. And \nwhile these forces may not have prevailed during this first round of \nexpansion, there is no certainty as to what will happen in the future \nor that the next time we confront this issue, they may not be dominant \nwithin the life of the politics of Russia. In fact, the immediate \nprospect of NATO extending such an invitation could well propel those \nforces to dominance, given the transitional and tenuous aspects of the \ndomestic politics of Russia.\n  So I think the question has to be asked as we go down the road, Will \nwe and Europe be more secure if that were to occur or if Russia decided \nto enhance its security by increasing its reliance on nuclear weapons, \ntherefore reversing the course that began with the ratification of \nSTART I and the signing of START II? Clearly, a country not defined an \nenemy today is hopefully not going to be made an enemy in the future by \nour unwillingness to be sensitive to some of those kinds of \nconsiderations.\n  Administration officials have stated thus far that no commitments or \npromises have been made about other nations' membership, and I placed \ninto the Record earlier a letter from the President to the effect that \nhe intends to adhere to a very strict consultative process in the \nfuture and that no secret or private commitments regarding membership \nwill be made in the interval.\n  It seems to me that is the most important fact for us to focus on as \nwe consider the future and the potential of what the Senate may face \ndown the road. Some people may view that the assurances of the \nPresident are inadequate, but I disagree. I think when you really \nexamine the full nature of the consultative process that we have had \npreviously--the NAC visits, our visits to Europe, our discussions with \nNATO, our discussions in Brussels, the various meetings that took place \nbetween defense ministers and the Parliament and Congress--there has \nreally been, I think, a much more lengthy consultative process than \nmany Members have been willing to acknowledge.\n  In my judgment, as I said, Congress in many ways ratified most of \nthat by passing a number of different resolutions along the course of \ntime which stated that we were supportive of that particular \nenlargement. In light of that examination, of that process of \nconsultation, and the President's commitment to replicate it as well as \nto avoid any private commitments, I think Congress is going to have \nample opportunity, as we go down the road, to make the judgments about \nwhich some of our colleagues have expressed some concern.\n  I agree with the administration and with the Senator from North \nCarolina and others that we must never give Russia or any country a \nveto over our foreign policy. We certainly should not give them a veto \nover the question fundamentally of NATO enlargement. I agree with that. \nBut I also strongly believe we have a fundamental responsibility to \nconsider any country's likely reactions to the steps we take and other \nkinds of cooperative efforts that may be available to us at any point \nin time to secure the same interests that we may or may not be seeking \nto occur from actions that would, in fact, create a counterreaction.\n  I look forward to that future deliberation, and I also look forward \nto a greater clarity that will come through\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\nthe act of this first expansion with respect to the budgets and the \ntrue costs and true interests as they will define themselves as we go \ndown the road. The bottom line is, however, that this expansion of NATO \nat this point in time under these circumstances will make NATO stronger \nand will also protect, enhance, and serve the interests of the United \nStates of America. Those are the fundamental reasons for which we \nshould enter into any kind of treaty, and that is why I will vote for \nthis treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the Conrad amendment numbered 2320, \nthere be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form. I \nfurther ask that following the expiration of time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on or in relation to the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. This would occur when?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Upon the resumption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I could not hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Massachusetts restate \nhis inquiry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts was asking \nwhen this would occur. I understand it is when it is called up. And it \nis not being called up at this time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been called up.\n  Mr. KERRY. And it would have to be called up before we proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me say that I remember the old adage is, ``I like a \nfinished speaker. I really, truly do. I don't mean one who's polished, \nI just mean one who's through.''\n\n  I deliberately stayed away from the podium yesterday because I wanted \neverybody to have their say on this matter, and I think it is time for \nus to move along and become finished speakers. But before I do, I want \nto make a few comments that occurred to me when I listened in my office \nand on the floor--a combination of the two--to various statements that \nwere being made.\n  The Conrad amendment--and I have the greatest respect for Senator \nConrad--I must unalterably oppose because the United States has never, \nnever agreed to tactical nuclear weapons reductions with the Russians, \nor the Soviets, for good reason.\n  First, these weapons are essential to an equitable sharing of the \nrisk and burden associated with NATO's nuclear mission. Further, they \nare a visible sign that NATO is prepared to use any and all force \nnecessary to deter an attack. Finally, there is absolutely no way that \nthe United States can verify Russian compliance with an agreement to \neliminate tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I am increasingly fascinated by the wailing, tearing \nof hair, and gnashing of teeth engaged in by the more liberal of our \nbrethren, the news media, and otherwise, regarding the impact that NATO \nexpansion would have on the United States-Russian relationship. It \nseems that the only argument against NATO enlargement--aside from the \n``cost bugaboo''--is that Senate approval of this treaty will derail \nRussian ratification of START II, imperil future arms control \nagreements, and I have heard over and over again that it will turn \nRussia into a hostile power. I am going to agree to discuss these \nthings as time goes by, but not this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, there has been a surfeit of bellyaching about the \nSTART II treaty. It has been nearly 5\\1/2\\ years since the United \nStates and Russia signed that treaty. Since that time, Russia has used \nSTART II ratification as a pretext to hold hostage an ever-changing, \never-growing number of issues. And, of course, the weak-kneed arms \ncontrollers and Russia apologists in the United States have, in the \npast 5 years, been feeding the beast, encouraging the Russians to take \none hostage after another. I could walk you through the various Russian \nthreats, such as the Russians have threatened that there would be no \nSTART II treaty if the United States deploys a national missile \ndefense.\n  At a press conference before the March 1997 Helsinki summit, \nPresident Yeltsin criticized U.S. discussion of a national missile \ndefense stating, ``Well, you understand, of course, why it is that the \nstate Duma has not yet ratified START II--because ABM was suspended.''\n  Why does Russia not want the United States to abandon the ABM Treaty? \nBecause with it we are prevented from having a national missile defense \nand Russia can hold our citizens hostage to its intercontinental \nballistic missiles.\n  Then there is a second threat. The Russians have threatened that \nthere would be no START II unless the United States makes more foreign \naid concessions. In 1996, the chairman of the Duma's defense committee, \nSergei Yushkov, tied START II ratification not just merely to the ABM \nTreaty but to ``the provision of adequate funds for the maintenance of \nRussia's strategic nuclear arsenal.''\n  Threat No. 3: The Russians declared there would be no START II unless \nthe United States makes other, unspecified concessions. In September of \n1997, last year, there was a powerful voice that controls a sizable \nblock of Duma votes who declared that START II should not be ratified \nuntil ``a favorable moment'' and that Russia should hold out for more \nU.S. concessions. According to this man, this leader, ``We have created \na powerful missile complex, and we must use it to get certain \nadvantages.''\n  Threat No. 4: The Russians declared there would be no START II if the \nU.S. mounts air-strikes against Saddam Hussein. In connection with the \nU.S. military build-up in the Persian Gulf, the Deputy Speaker of the \nDuma declared that START II would never be approved if the United \nStates were to use force against Iraq.\n  In the wake of that particular threat, the Russian diplomats at the \nUnited Nations have been working overtime to phase out international \ninspections of Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological warfare \nfacilities. We already caught the Russians red-handed trying to sell \nthe Iraqis a fermenter specially-designed for biological weapons, and \nwithout UNSCOM inspectors poking around, Saddam's cooperation with \nRussia in developing these horrible weapons will be free and unimpeded.\n  Threat No. 5: The Russians declared there would be no START II unless \nthe U.S. agrees to allow continued Russian violation of the START \nTreaty. Most recently, U.S. arms control negotiators were told that \ntheir refusal to shelve U.S. concerns over repeated Russian violations \nof the START Treaty would jeopardize START II ratification.\n  I was amazed to hear some point to the recent, massive salvo of \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) which the Russians \nlaunched to their destruction as the kind of cooperation that will \ncease if NATO is enlarged. Senators should know, as should others in \nthe executive branch, that these SLBM launches were not emblematic of \narms control cooperation.\n  In fact, the Administration has noted that these SLBM launches were \nviolations of the START Treaty because Russia refused to provide \ntelemetry as required. They simply brushed aside our concerns and went \non with their plans.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the Russian threat over NATO \nEnlargement is just one in a long, tired litany of ever-changing \nexcuses for not ratifying START II. I urge the American people, and my \nfellow Senators, not to be taken in by this ludicrous argument.\n  I urge those who are bemoaning the abuse that we are doing to our \n``Russian friends'' to listen very carefully:\n  There is not one arms control treaty signed by Russia that it is not \nviolating! As I have said, Russia stands today in violation of its \nSTART Treaty obligations.\n  Likewise, Russia consistently has engaged in the worst, most \nabhorrent perversions of bio-chemistry known to man. Russian scientists \ncontinue to work overtime at weaponizing biological pathogens in \nviolation of the Biological Weapons Convention. According to key \nRussian defectors, Russia has placed enough biological agent--for \nexample, small pox and various fever viruses--on its intercontinental \nballistic missiles to wipe the human race from the face of the earth.\n  Similarly, as I warned during the course of debate on the Chemical\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\nWeapons Convention, Russia is violating that treaty by clandestinely \nproducing a series of nerve agents more lethal than any other chemical \nsubstance known to man.\n  And we have all read in recent days about the robust and continuing \nRussian assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program, in violation of \ntheir obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n  Mr. President, the list of arms control violations goes on and on. I \nam amazed that we are wringing our hands about antagonizing a country \nthat is engaging in such abhorrent, reprehensible behavior. I challenge \nanyone to defend that regime's record of flagrant disregard for its \ntreaty obligations, and its calculated assistance to regimes hostile to \nthe United States. In light of these facts, piling another item onto \nthe arms control agenda seems particularly ill-advised.\n  Russia is becoming, despite our best efforts to the contrary, a rogue \nnation bent on challenging the United States at every turn. Neither \ntactical nuclear weapons nor NATO expansion have anything to do with \nit.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2320\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I call for the regular order, the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 2320, previously proposed by the Senator from \n     North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, for himself and Mr. Bingaman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. HELMS. There is a 30-minute time limitation; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is correct.\n  If neither side yields time, time will run equally.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is the pending order the Conrad-Bingaman \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from North Dakota \nhas 13 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Conrad-Bingaman amendment is designed to address \nthe question of tactical nuclear weapons. Let me just review briefly \nthe circumstance we face, and remind my colleagues that unlike \nstrategic weapons, unlike conventional systems, we have no treaty with \nrespect to tactical nuclear weapons.\n  This chart shows the record on arms control. The red line is Russian \nforces; the blue line, U.S. or NATO forces. We can see under the \nConventional Forces Treaty we have had steep reductions. In terms of \nstrategic systems under the START accords, the same pattern--deep \nreductions on both sides on strategic systems. But on tactical nuclear \nweapons we don't know what has happened on the Russian side, although \nwe have an estimate from our strategic commander, General Habiger, that \nthey have 7,000 to 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons; we have about \n1,600.\n  Russia's tactical nuclear arsenal--we need to know more. In 1991, \nRussia had 15,000; the United States, 3,500 in Europe. Today, in Europe \nwe have roughly 400; they have between 7,000 and 12,000.\n  Terrorist use of a tactical nuclear weapons would be devastating. It \nwould make what went off in Oklahoma look like a firecracker. That was \na two one-thousandths kiloton equivalent, the bomb that went off in \nOklahoma. The bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima was 13 kilotons. The \nsmaller tactical weapons of the day run in the 10-kiloton range. The \nlarger tactical nuclear weapons are 300 kilotons plus.\n  There is also a strategic breakout danger. Under the strategic limits \nof START III, both sides would be at about 2,250 systems. Tactical \nnuclear weapons today: The United States, roughly 1,500 or 1,600; the \nRussians, 7,000 to 12,000. That becomes a strategic concern, that great \ndifferential between the tactical systems of the two sides.\n  This chart shows the strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. The \ndistinction between the two is disappearing. During the cold-war \nperiod, strategic systems ran 500 kilotons to 10 megatons. The tactical \nsystems currently run 10 kilotons up to 400 kilotons. But today's \nstrategic weapons have been dramatically reduced in yield, down to 300 \nkilotons to 1 megaton. So the difference between tactical nuclear \nweapons and strategic nuclear weapons is disappearing.\n  Let's listen to America's nuclear commander, the head of strategic \nforces. General Habiger said, ``The Russians have anywhere from 7,000 \nto more than 12,000 of these nonstrategic nuclear weapons and we need \nto bring them into the equation.''\n  That is what the Conrad-Bingaman amendment is about. It is not about \nreducing United States tactical nuclear weapons. It is not about taking \nUnited States tactical nuclear weapons out of Europe. It is not about \nthose things.\n  It is about saying that we ought to engage the Russians in a \ndiscussion on reduction of tactical nuclear weapons because of the \nenormous disparity that they enjoy in these forces. It is about asking \nfor a certification from the administration that they are engaged in \nthat course. It is about a report on what we know about these tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague and cosponsor, \nSenator Bingaman of New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nand compliment him on his leadership in proposing this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have expressed grave concern about this whole \nproposal to expand NATO. One concern that I have expressed is that it \ndiverts our attention from our real national security threats as I see \nthem today. This amendment by the Senator from North Dakota tries to \nbring us back to those real national security threats by talking about \nthe threat that is posed by these tactical nuclear weapons. For that \nreason I think it is a very good amendment and one that I am very \nhonored to cosponsor.\n  Let me point out that we have had various hearings on this issue in \nthe Armed Services Committee. There is no question but what the lack of \nagreement, the lack of progress, on dealing with tactical nuclear \nweapons is a serious concern for our military and a serious concern for \nour planners generally.\n  This amendment is extremely modest in its language. Let me just call \npeople's attention to specific provisions of it.\n  First of all, it is a sense of the Senate. It does not have binding \nlanguage in it. It essentially puts the Senate on record as favoring a \ncertain position.\n  It says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that . . . Prior to the \n     deposit of instruments of ratification, the Administration \n     shall certify to the Senate that with regard to non-strategic \n     nuclear weapons\n       (i) it is the policy of the United States to work with the \n     Russian Federation to increase transparency, exchange data, \n     increase warhead security, and facilitate weapon \n     dismantlement. . . .\n\n  It is hard for me to understand what kind of argument our colleagues \ncan make against that general proposition.\n  It is further stated that it is our policy that discussions toward \nthese ends need to be initiated with the Russian Federation.\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments I have heard people present in \nopposition to this is that, sure, it may be a decent amendment, but it \nis not appropriate to consider it in the context of NATO enlargement.\n  I think just the contrary is the case, because clearly NATO \nenlargement can only be justified if it adds to our security in the \nEuropean theater. This amendment will do more to add to our security in \nthe European theater than the expansion of NATO that is now \ncontemplated. For that reason, I think it is appropriate that we move \nahead, that we vote for this amendment.\n  Quite frankly, I have great difficulty understanding why it cannot be \naccepted by all parties. It clearly states a position I believe the \nAmerican people strongly believe in, which is that we need to do more \nto press the Russians to reduce their tactical nuclear weapons arsenal, \nand I hope very much we will do that in the very near future.\n  I appreciate the time that has been yielded, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It calls on the \nadministration to initiate arms control negotiations with Russia on \ntactical nuclear\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\nweapons in Europe. The amendment seeks to push the United States down \nwhat I think is an extremely ill-advised path.\n  First of all, tactical nuclear weapons are essential to NATO. A \ncredible alliance nuclear policy requires widespread participation in \nnuclear roles by our European allies.\n  The dual-capable aircraft and the few hundred substrategic nuclear \ngravity bombs which are deployed in Europe provide an essential \npolitical and military link between the European and the North Atlantic \nmembers of the alliance. The devices deployed on European soil are \nessential to an equitable sharing of the risk and burden associated \nwith NATO's nuclear mission.\n  Second, the presence of U.S. tactical nuclear systems in Europe is an \nimportant demonstration of the U.S. commitment to deterring all threats \nto the territory of the alliance. These weapons are a visible sign that \nNATO is prepared to use any and all force necessary to deter an attack. \nFor this reason, the defense ministers of the alliance have on multiple \noccasions expressed their support for the continued stationing of U.S. \ntactical nuclear weapons in Europe.\n  I ask my colleagues to ponder for a moment the message that this \namendment would send if the United States were to expand NATO while \nsimultaneously abandoning our nuclear commitments. Such a step would \nmean the hollowing out of the United States article V commitments and \nwould gut the world's most powerful, stable defensive military \nalliance. NATO is different and vastly superior to other multilateral \norganizations, such as the United Nations, because the members of the \nalliance do not merely pay lip service to the principles of collective \ndefense.\n  Third, the fact that we have tactical nuclear weapons in Europe has \nnothing to do with the existence of or the number of Russian tactical \nnuclear weapons. We maintain them in Europe for reasons that I just \nmentioned. Throwing our tactical nuclear weapons into an arms control \nagreement with Russian tactical weapons makes no sense.\n  Finally, in the past, the United States has refused to agree to \nnegotiate these weapons, for good reason. Simply put, it would be \nimpossible to verify that the Russians are, in fact, complying with any \nagreement. Instead, the United States prudently focused on limiting \ndelivery systems, such as missiles and bombs, which are large and \nobservable and, therefore, verifiable. Given the importance of these \nweapons to the United States and the NATO alliance, and given the fact \nwe would not be able to match the Russians cheating, as they have done \non every arms control treaty we have ever signed with them, this \namendment is conceptually flawed.\n\n  Again, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't know what amendment the Senator \nfrom Arizona is referring to, but it is not my amendment. It is not the \namendment that is before us. There is nothing in the Conrad-Bingaman \namendment that talks about taking U.S. tactical nuclear weapons out of \nEurope--nothing.\n  The point is, the Russians have an enormous edge on us with respect \nto tactical nuclear weapons. Let's review the facts. Today, the United \nStates has roughly 400 tactical nuclear weapons in Europe; the Russians \nhave between 7,000 and 12,000. How is it not in our interest to push \nthem to reduce their tactical nuclear weapons? It is absolutely in our \ninterest, just as it has been in our interest to get them to reduce \nconventional forces, as we have done by treaty negotiations, just as it \nhas been in our interest to reduce strategic systems. But it is, I \nbelieve, dangerous to allow the Russians to have this kind of edge on \nus in tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.\n  Again, I emphasize to my colleagues, there is nothing in my \namendment--nothing--that talks about taking U.S. tactical nuclear \nweapons out of Europe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. I will take 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think that the flaw in the argument just \nstated is obvious. It is true, as Senator Conrad points out, that there \nare no words in his amendment that talk about taking American tactical \nweapons out of Europe. That is not the point I was making. It is also \ntrue he could have said that there are no words in here that \nspecifically call for the United States to reduce the number of \nAmerican missiles.\n  He then makes the point that it would be desirable, since the \nRussians have more tactical nuclear weapons than we do, to get them to \nreduce those numbers. Indeed, it would. But I ask you, Mr. President, \nhow we are going to initiate discussions--which is what this amendment \nprecisely calls for as a condition to moving forward here--without \nputting at risk some of the American tactical nuclear weapons. I \ndiscussed all of the reasons why we need those tactical nuclear \nweapons. The very point that Senator Conrad makes, that the Russians \nhave a lot more than we do, makes the point that we can't afford to \nreduce the number that we have.\n  So, as a practical matter, while the words about reducing our \ntactical weapons are not in the amendment, there is no way to get the \nRussians to reduce their numbers unless we reduce our numbers as well. \nThat is why, as I said, Mr. President, this amendment, which would have \nthe effect, if these negotiations are in any way successful from \nSenator Conrad's point of view, of reducing American tactical nuclear \nweapons. That is why this amendment should be rejected.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Arizona, the \nargument that he advances makes no sense to this Senator.\n  On conventional forces we, by treaty, have gotten them to \ndramatically reduce their forces as have we. The same is true of \nstrategic systems. The place where there is an enormous disparity is \ntactical nuclear weapons. They have the advantage. And we are not \nengaging them in discussions on reduction?\n  I will tell you, if we could have a situation in which we take a 50 \npercent reduction and they take a 50 percent reduction, I would take \nthat deal right now, because we would lose 200 and they would lose \nbetween 3,500 and 6,000. For us not to engage in discussions on ``loose \nnukes,'' which are the very ones that are most subject to terrorists, \nto being used in ways that are totally against the U.S. interests, \nmakes no sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been here 25 years. The chairman of \nthe full committee knows that there may have been, and there are people \nwho have been, more effective people in pursuing arms control than the \nSenator from Delaware but none more consistently and more fervently \nthan the Senator from Delaware.\n  This is not the place for this amendment. This is a treaty. This is a \ntreaty. It is a treaty about expanding NATO. One of our colleagues on \nthe Republican side, I was told earlier, had an amendment on the Kyoto \nenvironmental treaty saying we could not--I am told; I did not see it; \nbut I am told he had been talked out of it, I believe--that we could \nnot expand NATO unless Kyoto was dealt with.\n  Another one has an amendment that may come up here tonight dealing \nwith--I believe, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, at least he \nwas talking about an amendment relating to a position I know the \nchairman shares, which I do not share, relating to strategic defense \ninitiatives. This is not the place for that.\n  Secondly, I find it absolutely fascinating that some of the very \nSenators who have come to the floor and said, look, what we want to do \nhere is we want to slow down passage, stop passage, or slow down new \nmembers coming in, because we are fearful it is going to offend the \nRussians or the Russians are going to get upset--a legitimate concern. \nBut then they come\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nalong and say, and by the way, before--before--we can deposit these \ninstruments, the Russians have to agree to cut their tactical nuclear \nweapons, or whatever.\n  Now, that is giving to Russia a veto power over expansion in NATO.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is there anything in the amendment that is before the \nSenate now that requires a reduction on anybody's part before there is \nratification?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Maybe the Senator can help me out.\n  Mr. President, maybe the Senator can help me out. It says, ``Prior to \nthe deposit of the instruments of ratification, the Administration \nshall certify to the Senate that with regard to [the following],'' and \nit lists the following nonstrategic nuclear weapons, that ``it is the \npolicy of the United States . . . that discussions toward these ends \nhave been initiated with the Russian Federation.''\n  All the Russian Federation can say is, ``I'm not going to discuss \nthis with you,'' done, period, over; they have vetoed it. Look, if I am \nsitting in the Russian Duma, I am going to--and we are all worried \nabout these reactionary nationalists who are the browns and the reds \nundercutting Yeltsin--I have got a real easy one. I go to Yeltsin and \nsay, I tell you what, you've indicated to us you don't want to expand \nNATO but there is nothing you can do to stop it. I've got the way to \nstop it right now. When the President picks up the phone and calls you \nand says, ``By the way, I want to initiate discussions relative to \ntactical nuclear weapons,'' tell him, ``No. No.''\n  Guess what? By definition, no expansion of NATO, because the \nPresident cannot deposit these instruments until--until--he can certify \nto the U.S. Senate that discussions with the Russian Federation have \nbeen initiated.\n  Now, call me paranoid, if you would like, but I know what I would do. \nI am a pretty good politician. The Senator from North Dakota is even a \nbetter politician. We are all politicians in here. They are not any \ndifferent in the Duma. They are no different in the Russian Federation. \nSo I have a real easy one. And by the way, if they had not figured it \nout, I just told them.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. On his time I would be delighted to yield, since I have \nvery limited time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, would the Senator refer to the bottom of \npage 2. It says there, ``Sense of the Senate. It is the sense of the \nSenate. . . .'' There is no binding language in this amendment. This \ncalls upon the administration to try to initiate discussion with the \nRussians.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It would not stop NATO enlargement from going forward. \nThis is not some scheme to stop NATO enlargement. I am opposed to NATO \nenlargement, but this does not stop enlargement. This does do something \nabout sending a signal we ought to do something about tactical nuclear \nweapons when they enjoy this incredible edge over us and we seem to not \npay much attention.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am confused then. I am confused. Why is certification--I \nhave never heard of a certification on the part of the President in a \nsense of the Senate. Explain that to me. Explain how a sense of the \nSenate requires a formal certification from a President. Like I said, I \nhave been here a while. That is a new one.\n  So you mean the President can say, when we pass this, ``You know, \nBingaman and Conrad are good guys, they're my buddies and allies, but \nI'm not going to pay attention to them; I'm not going to certify \nanything''? Can he just say, ``I'm not going to certify it''?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, I would point out that \nthere are many occasions where that has happened, and I am saying, it \ncould happen here. This is a statement by the Senate, if it were to \npass, a statement by the Senate, as I see it, that the Senate believes \nthat the President should initiate discussions and should certify to us \nthat he has done so. If he does not do so, he still has legal authority \nto go ahead and file the articles of ratification.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have a question. Is the Senator saying \nthat the President of the United States will fully be within the law \nif, when this passes tonight, if this were attached, if he is in a \npress conference and says, ``I want to compliment the Senate on \nexpanding NATO, and I want to tell Senator Conrad I'm not certifying \nanything''--would that be OK legally?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. This is a sense--I mean, I do not know----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Great. I think that is wonderful.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Nobody knows \nbetter than the Senator from Delaware a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nand its legal standing. What we are trying to do is direct the \nattention of this administration and our colleagues to the very real \nthreat that ``loose nukes'' present. And we are trying to take the \nwords of General Habiger, who has said to us they have 7,000 to 12,000 \nof these tactical nuclear weapons and we ought to address that \ndifferential.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute 57 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. First of all, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nDelaware and certainly support the points he made.\n  I think it is critical to go directly to the heart of what is behind \nthis amendment. It has been a longstanding objective of the Russians to \nbreak our tactical nuclear connection with our NATO allies; make no \nmistake about that. We should do nothing in the U.S. Senate that \nassists the Russians in achieving this long-term goal.\n  Secondly, we need tactical nuclear weapons in the so-called \ncredibility ladder. I would be very concerned if the only weapons we \nhad at our disposal to act as a deterrent were strategic nuclear \nweapons. Mr. President, sometimes you need a graduated response. And to \nsuggest that we should reduce the number of our weapons and we can do \nthat by cutting out half if the Russians cut out half, that would leave \nus very few weapons, not enough to pose a credible deterrence. To \nsuggest that we do that and then rely upon strategic weapons I think is \nsomething that no one in this Chamber would want to support.\n  And finally, as our colleague from Delaware said, we should not be \ntying up NATO expansion with this particular amendment. So I urge my \ncolleagues again to vote against the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. HELMS. No. Go ahead.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I just want to make a point. I may be mistaken, but I \nthink if my colleagues will look at this amendment, it is section (B) \nthat is a sense of the Senate. The sense of the Senate controls \nlanguage; only section B, a completely separate section is section C. \nIf my colleagues wish to make the title of this sense of the Senate, it \nwould be a different deal.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from North Dakota \nhas 25 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to answer, again, the Senator from \nArizona. There is absolutely no intent to require the United States to \nreduce its tactical nuclear weapons at all. The thrust of this \namendment is the concern that a number of us have that Russia has an \nenormous edge on tactical nuclear weapons, and we ought to engage in \ndiscussions with them to get a reduction in those tactical nuclear \nweapons. That is clearly in the U.S. interest.\n  I hope our colleagues would support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on this amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I was assigned this afternoon to make the train run and to \nsave Senators a lot of time. In that connection, I ask unanimous \nconsent the Conrad amendment 2320 be laid aside, and Senator Bingaman \nbe recognized to offer his amendment regarding strategic concept, and \nthere be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form; I \nfurther ask following the expiration time, the amendment be laid aside.\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President might I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nConrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I believe there are 15 minutes reserved on my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2324\n\n  (Purpose: To require a certification of United States policy not to \nsupport further enlargement of NATO (other than Poland, Hungary, or the \n  Czech Republic) until revision of the Strategic Concept of NATO is \n                               completed)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the Chair advise me when \n10 of those minutes have expired and that the remaining 5 minutes be \nreserved for me to use prior to the vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, without yet objecting, I would like to know \nif there is any time for a response to that prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator wishing to oppose the amendment \nwill have 15 minutes of time. It has not been allocated as to when that \nwill occur.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have no concern as to how you allocate that time.\n  Mr. KYL. I will not object.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me explain this amendment and use \nthe 10 minutes I have at this point. First, let me send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], proposes an \n     executive amendment numbered 2324.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The executive amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in section 3 of the resolution, \n     insert the following:\n       (  ) United states policy limiting nato enlargement until \n     the strategic concept of nato is revised.--Prior to the date \n     of deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, \n     the President shall certify to the Senate that, until such \n     time as the North Atlantic Council agrees on a revised \n     Strategic Concept of NATO, it is the policy of the United \n     States not to support the accession to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty of, or the invitation to begin accession talks with, \n     any European state, other than Poland, Hungary, or the Czech \n     Republic.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment relates to what is called \nthe NATO strategic concept. We have had quite a bit of discussion over \nthe last couple of days about the NATO strategic concept and the fact \nthat NATO countries, NATO members, including ourselves, have been \nengaged in serious discussions over the last year or two in an effort \nto revise the NATO strategic concept.\n  I think we are all aware that the current strategic concept for NATO \nis one that was arrived at back in 1991. It predates the disillusion of \nthe Soviet Union, and the resulting emergence of new independent \nstates. It does not account for the Civil War in Bosnia or NATO's \npeacekeeping operations there. It does not allow or contemplate the \ncurrent nuclear or strategic concept, does not contemplate the \ndenuclearization of Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and it does not \ncontemplate the special relationships that NATO has established with \nRussia and separately with the Ukraine. So there is clearly a need to \nrevise and update this strategic concept.\n  What my amendment says very simply is that the United States will \nwithhold consent to inviting any additional countries other than the \nthree we are talking about here today--Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic. We will not go forward with inviting any additional countries \nto join NATO until after NATO has approved this revised strategic \nconcept.\n  This is simply a matter of understanding what NATO is doing before we \nagree to take in more members in addition to these three. NATO members \nneed to decide on the alliance's mission before any new candidates or \nstates are asked to join in the future.\n  I have great difficulty seeing why anyone would object to this. The \nreality is that the revised concept is expected to be completed even as \nsoon as this summer. At the very latest it would be complete, as I \nunderstand it based on the statements by the NATO officials, before \ntheir meeting in 1999. So there is no attempt here to delay the \ninvitation to other members in the future.\n  It simply says let's figure out what NATO is intended to do in this \nnew post-cold-war world before we start inviting more people to join. \nNow, this doesn't strike me as a radical proposal. It is not radical \nfrom our point of view. It is certainly not radical from the point of \nview of potential new members. If I were representing a country that \nwas considering admission to NATO I would be interested in what NATO's \nmission is, its new revised strategic concept is, before I would want \nto sign up. I think that is a reasonable thing for new members to want \nto know, and it is certainly reasonable for current members to want to \nsettle on before we begin deciding which nations are appropriate new \nmembers and which are not. I think the amendment is very \nstraightforward.\n  Let me make it crystal clear once more. It does not in any way relate \nto the enlargement of NATO to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic. That is not part of my amendment. My amendment assumes we \nwill go ahead with the enlargement of NATO that is presently proposed \nby the administration in this treaty. But it says we will not go beyond \nthat. We will not invite others until we settle on what this revised \nstrategic concept is.\n  I have difficulty understanding, as I said, why this is \nobjectionable. It seems to me imminently reasonable that this would be \nour position.\n  Let me make it crystal clear what I am doing. Let me read the one \nparagraph of the amendment into the record so it is clear what we are \nsaying.\n\n       Prior to the date of deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate that, until such time as the North Atlantic \n     Council agrees on a revised strategic concept of NATO, it is \n     the policy of the United States not to support the accession \n     to the North Atlantic Treaty of, or the invitation to begin \n     accession talks with any European state, other than Poland, \n     Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n\n  Basically, what we would be saying is the President needs to tell us \nthat it is our policy, the U.S. Government policy, not to invite others \nto join until we get the strategic concept settled.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will support the amendment. To me, it \nis an imminently reasonable, common-sense approach and I hope we can \nadd it to the treaty.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have great respect for the Senator from New Mexico. Much \nof what he says makes sense, but basically what is happening here is we \nare having a rerun of the Warner amendment. We are basically saying \nhere that before any new members can come in, what has to happen is \nthere has to be a new strategic concept agreed to.\n  Now, if I can make an analogy, that would be like saying my friend \nfrom Utah, the Presiding Officer, or of my friend from New Mexico, I am \nnot certain what year their States came into the Union. The only claim \nto fame Delaware has is we are the very first State in the Union. I \nshouldn't say the only claim, one of the most notable claims. It would \nhave been a little bit like Delaware, in the Thirteen Original \nColonies, and the other States east of the Mississippi saying to you \nall out West, as long as the constitutional amendment for suffrage is \nunder consideration to amend our document that controls our national \naffairs, no new States can come into the Union. Nobody is allowed in. \nAs long as we are reconsidering--again, I don't know the years, and I \napologize, when your States came into the Union. But as long as we are \nconsidering the 17th amendment, whether or not Senators are popularly \nelected, we are going to put on hold any new State becoming a member of \nthe Union.\n\n  The 1991--and I don't have it with me--strategic concept was drafted \nby and agreed to by the 16-member nations after the Berlin Wall came \ndown\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\nand after the Soviet Union had disintegrated. The reason I bother to \npoint that out, Mr. President, as my friend from New Hampshire kept \nsaying yesterday--and appropriately--we have to look at the realities \nof the new world. This new strategic document took into consideration a \nnew reality that there was no Soviet Union, there was no Warsaw Pact, \nthere was a different world.\n  Now, what we said with the leadership of Senator Kyl of Arizona \nyesterday, by a vote of 90-9, was the following. We said any new \nstrategic concept that is to be agreed to in the future should \naccommodate the basic fundamental principles that we have adhered to \nthus far in NATO; and the Senator, with great skill, laid them out in \nspecific form for all of us to see, incorporating the strategic notions \nthat have underpinned NATO and the new reality.\n  So even though there is a consideration at the moment in NATO for an \nupdated strategic concept, that could happen in a week, a year, a \nmonth, 5 years, or it could never be agreed to. And by an overwhelming \nvote in the Senate, 90 percent of us said, Mr. President, before you \ncan agree to any new strategic concept, you have to make sure that what \nwe have laid out here as the fundamental principles to guide that are \nincorporated in that concept. So I fully appreciate and believe that \nthe Senator from New Mexico is concerned about strategic doctrine and \nis not using this amendment as a killer amendment to accomplish what \nSenator Warner was unable to accomplish--that is, a de facto slowdown \nof any new admissions, an arbitrary judgment made that, without a new \ndoctrine being consummated and another little blue and white book being \npublished, no one can come in.\n  I further point out that the strategic concept of NATO is always \nunder review, formally as well as informally. I assume the Senator's \namendment speaks only to the formal review, the formal reconsideration \nof what that concept should be. Since 1991, NATO has changed internally \nwith the creation of bodies such as the Partnership for Peace, the \nEuro-Atlantic Partnership Council, NATO-Russian Founding Act, NATO \nUkraine Commission, and a more distinct role for the European pillar of \nthis operation has emerged. The European politico-military situation \nhas also changed. There has been significant reduction in the \nconventional armed forces. Both Warsaw and the Soviet Union are \ndissolved. NATO subsequently decided, via the ministerial and summit \nstatements, to invite new members. We are doing all these things that \nwe are concerned about already. We sent out a glidepath and a guide \nbook to the administration as to how they must proceed with the next \none, and to say until that is all done, no new members, is another way \nof trying to do in a 15-minute debate what my friend from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Oregon and myself debated against for days.\n  So I respectfully suggest that our friend from Arizona has \naccommodated any concern about strategic doctrine with the amendment we \noverwhelmingly adopted, thereby clearing the way, and any justification \nfor suggesting that the doctrine might change so radically that it \nmight affect who we would be willing to bring in.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains of the 10 minutes \nthat I had?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just make clear what I intend by \nthis amendment and what I think the language of it says. As much as I \nlike to think that the U.S. Senate is all powerful, we are, in NATO, \nonly one of the members. NATO is an entire organization. The United \nStates and the other members have set about to develop this revised \nstrategic concept.\n  As I understand the history of this, in July of last year, in Madrid, \nthere was agreed upon--NATO Ministers agreed at that time to develop a \nrevised strategic concept, which would be presented to them in their \nplanned summit of April of 1999.\n  What my amendment says is that until such time as the North Atlantic \nCouncil agrees on a revised strategic concept, whatever it is, for \nNATO, then we will not go ahead. At least the U.S. position is that we \nshould not go ahead and participate in inviting new members. So I am \ntalking about a very formal procedure here which is well underway. It \nwas agreed to in July of last year in Madrid.\n  As I understand it, it is a three-stage process for conducting the \nreview of the strategic concept. That three-stage process is well \nunderway. There is no indication that I have seen that these deadlines \nwill not be met. In fact, I have heard from people in the \nadministration that they expect the revised strategic concept to be \nready this summer, not in April of next year. So all I am saying is, \nlet's figure out what NATO's purposes are and what its mission is \nbefore we take on additional members after we do these three.\n  So this is not an effort to delay, this is not an effort to postpone \nfor 3 years, or 5 years, or indefinitely. I say, quite frankly, if we \ndon't have agreement among the Council members, the Ministers of NATO, \nas to what the mission of NATO is, if we can't get agreement in the \nnext period of time, then we should have it come back to us, and we \nought to start thinking about how much more enlargement we want to do. \nThat is the purpose of the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will ask my friend a question on my time. \nWhat is the relevance of whether or not there is a new strategic \nconcept as it relates to whether or not Austria is a new member of \nNATO? Are you suggesting that if the 16 NATO members now agree--or 19 \nwhen we finish tonight--to a change in the strategic concept, that \nchange might or might not influence whether we should let Austria in if \nthey meet all other criteria?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I assume that part of what is being \nconsidered in this review of the strategic concept is the role that \nnuclear weapons would play in the future of NATO, where those weapons \nmight be stationed, what the policy of NATO would be in the use of \nweapons. All of these are factors that I think would be very important \nfor new members to know before they apply for membership and would be \nimportant for us to know before we agree to expand and expand and \nexpand. Every time a member comes into NATO, we are committing U.S. \nforces to defend that territory. I understand that. I think it is just \nappropriate that we have some caution in committing U.S. forces to \ndefend more and more and more territory, and that is the purpose of the \namendment--just to understand where we are before we keep moving ahead.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's answer. The \nrelevance is lost on me as to how that would affect who we would bring \nin or not. I understand the value of the strategic concept and why it \nis important that we should know it. These folks have already applied.\n  Let me point out one last thing. The Bingaman amendment would give \nsort of a pocket veto to further enlargement of certain countries. The \nFrench did not want the Slovenians in this time. But they didn't want \nto publicly say that they didn't want the Slovenians this time. This is \nmy interpretation. And they said no Slovenians unless Romanians, \nbecause it is not very politic in Europe to say you don't want someone \nin directly. If I were the French or Germans or anyone else, I just \ndon't agree to the new strategic concept. The present one works pretty \nwell--en bloc membership.\n\n  I just think, Mr. President, this causal relationship being asserted \nbetween the strategic concept and new membership is tenuous. In \nchanging the strategic concept, which we know has to follow the guide \npath of our friend from Arizona, we already know what it must contain \nfor us to sign on to it. I just think it is totally unnecessary.\n  If the Senator is willing, and with the permission of the chairman, I \nam willing to yield back our time if there is any left, and move on, if \nmy friend from New Mexico is willing to yield back his time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much of the 10 minutes is still \navailable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 13 seconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the 13 seconds. I still reserve \nthe 5 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My friend has kept 5 \nminutes prior to the vote. Is there any time in opposition prior to the \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 5 \nminutes prior to the vote in opposition, if we choose to use it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Does the Senator want to ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will respond. I did not yet. But I at \nthis time ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to propound a \nunanimous consent request regarding time for the next vote and the vote \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that the first vote to occur on \nthe amendment No. 2320, the Conrad-Bingaman amendment, be a 15-minute \nvote; that the second vote on this pending amendment, the Bingaman No. \n2324, be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time being charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just to give others an indication as to \nwhere I am and where some of the others are with amendments, I do have \nan amendment. It will take some time to get through, and yet I have a \nvery strong feeling I do not want to hold up the emergency \nsupplemental. I just want to make sure to get that on record so \neveryone knows. I certainly would not object to taking up the emergency \nsupplemental prior to completing the NATO expansion.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Let me also agree with my colleague. I \nwas somewhat surprised when the unanimous consent was offered, but I \njust want my colleagues to know I also have an amendment which is going \nto take a considerable amount of time, and I do not want to hold up \nMembers, who may wish to leave, who need to vote or feel we should vote \non the supplemental.\n  So let me echo the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma and indicate \nthat I am more than happy to agree to another UC to move the \nsupplemental ahead of NATO if, in fact, it comes here in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have examined the landscape, and it gets \nmore complicated as the returns come in. Now we cannot vote until 7 \no'clock, because several Senators are ``far afield.''\n  Then there is an agreement that was made without my knowledge--and \nnobody was required to get my knowledge, let alone consent--that the \nvote on the Bingaman amendment would not occur until the Ashcroft \namendment was dealt with. So we are not going to be able to vote at 7 \no'clock.\n  I ask unanimous consent that sharply at 7 o'clock the vote begin on \namendment No. 2320, and then we will proceed from there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded that I may speak on the ratification \nof NATO enlargement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we shortly will be entering into the \nclosing hours of this debate. I want to take this opportunity to offer \nsome observations about the ratification and also why this is so \nimportant.\n  I would like to take a minute, though, to really congratulate the \npeople of Israel on the 50th anniversary of the founding of that great \nstate, and how special, unique, that we are debating NATO expansion and \nbringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO on the 50th \nanniversary of the founding of Israel. Forever and a day, I will always \nremember that we will have taken this vote at the same date of the \nanniversary of that state.\n  It will be important because, as we commemorate, soon, the 50th \nanniversary of NATO and the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel, \njust like the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, as this century \ncomes to an end, we will look at what came out of the end of World War \nII that created the institutions that will take us, hopefully, to a new \ncentury and a new millennium, where we will not repeat the despicable \nand inhumane practices of the old century, or ever again have to fight \nanother war in Europe.\n  The Senate is about to take a historic vote and we are voting to make \nEurope more stable and America more secure. We are voting for a safer \nworld. This will be one of the most important votes I will cast. Voting \nfor a treaty is, indeed, a very special obligation, reserved only for \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  For those who have known me, they have known I have fought long and \nhard for Poland and other countries of Eastern Europe to become free \nand independent. I think about the dark days of martial law in Poland, \nwhen we worked to support the Solidarity movement in Poland. Since the \nend of the cold war, when the captive nations of Eastern Europe threw \noff the yoke of communism, I have yearned for this day. I have \nsupported the aid that the American people so generously provided to \nhelp the people of Eastern Europe build free-market democracies. I have \nintroduced legislation with former colleagues, Senator Brown of \nColorado and Senator Simon of Illinois, to nudge our Government toward \nwelcoming the newly freed countries into our Western institutions.\n  My passion for this issue, though, is based partly on my own personal \nhistory. Each ethnic group in America brings their own history to this \ncountry. My colleagues have heard me speak about Poland's history many \ntimes in the past, because I have never believed that America was a \nmelting pot. I always believed that America was a mosaic. We each come \nwith our history and our culture and become part of something bigger \nthan ourselves. So I come with thousands of years of history behind me, \nin terms of my heritage.\n  The history of Poland has indeed been a melancholy one, because every \nking, kaiser, czar or comrade who ever wanted to have a war in Europe \nstarts always, first, by invading Poland. It has been historically true \nfor a thousand years, and it has certainly been true for the last 100 \nyears. At the same time, Poland has always wanted to be part of the \nWest in terms of its values and in terms of its orientation.\n  It felt so passionate about democracy that when we fought our own \nrevolution it sent two of its finest heroes, Kosciusko and Pulaski, to \nfight in the war for America's freedom. Pulaski came and was a \nbrilliant soldier and led in the Battle of Savannah. Kosciusko was a \nbrilliant tactician and led in the founding and building of West Point \nand, at the same time, then, fought for the democracy and became a \ngreat friend of Jefferson. He returned to Poland to help the Polish \npeople of that time establish the first constitutional monarchy in \nEurope.\n  Poland thought it would be free and have a constitutional monarchy, \nbut that was not to happen. In the 19th century, Poland was divided \ninto three parts, under Russia, Prussia, and the Austro-Hungarian \nEmpire, and it remained that way. That is when my great-grandmother \ncame to this country. She came, not because she just wanted to come and \nstart a new life,\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\nshe came on a prearranged marriage, because she wanted to forever \nescape that kind of occupation.\n\n  This evening is not about history lessons, but Poland was occupied, \npartitioned, invaded in World War I, had a brief stint of democracy \nbetween World War I and World War II, only to be invaded by the Nazis \nin World War II and occupied.\n  For me, growing up as a Polish American in east Baltimore, I learned \nabout the burning of Warsaw. I knew about the occupation of Poland by \nthe Nazis. I have seen films of the occupation, in which the great \ncathedral had Nazi storm troopers in there, burning the statues of the \nSaints and our Dear Lord himself, with their weapons. I learned about \nthe burning of Warsaw at the end of World War II, when the Germans \nburned it because of the Warsaw uprising. Soviet troops stood on the \nother side of the Vistula River and watched it burn.\n  Then we learned about the Katyn massacre, where Russians murdered \nmore than 4,000 military officers and intellectuals in the Katyn Forest \nat the start of the Second World War, so there would not be an \nintellectual force in Poland, ever, to lead it to democracy. For 5 \nyears our family hoped and prayed, hoping World War II would end, with \nmy uncle serving in the military. And then, at end of the war only to \nsee Potsdam and Yalta occur, where Poland was sold out. My great-\ngrandmother had on her mantle, three pictures, one of Pius XII, one of \nmy uncle who had become a member of the police force, and the other of \nRoosevelt, because she believed in the Democratic Party. After Potsdam \nand Yalta, she took the picture of Roosevelt and turned him face down, \nuntil the day she died.\n  Those were the kinds of stories that I grew up with, looking at \nPoland as part of the captive nation. Then suddenly, in August of 1980, \nan obscure electrician, working in the Gdansk Shipyard, jumped over a \nwall proclaiming the Solidarity movement. And when he jumped over that \nwall, he took the whole world with him, to continue the push in this \npart of the century to free Poland. And then the movement, also of \ndissidents, spread.\n  These are the kinds of stories. What I wear here today is a picture \nof the Blessed Mother of Czestochowa. She is the Patron Saint and \nProtectress of Poland. Members of the Solidarity movement wore exactly \nthis emblem because they were forbidden under martial law to wear any \nsymbol related to Solidarity. So they wore a religious symbol. I wear \nthis symbol today because this, then, is the next step toward what we \nfought for in World War II, what dissidents in these countries have \nworked for--to create a democracy and a free-market economy, risking \ntheir lives, imprisoned, living under the boot of communism.\n  So now those are the kinds of things that we must grasp. This is a \nhistoric moment, when three countries whose heart, soul, and political \norientation is with us. So, I hope for those who worked so long and so \nhard, within Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, that we, then, \nunderstand the ratification of NATO enlargement.\n  Despite the importance of history, my support for NATO is based on \nthe future. My support is based on what is best for our country. NATO \nenlargement will make Europe more stable and America more secure. It \nmeans the future generations of Americans, I believe, will not have to \nfight or die in Europe. It will make NATO stronger. It will make \nAmerica stronger. And it will make Western civilization stronger.\n  Mr. President, I am only sorry my great-grandmother is not alive to \nsee this, because when we vote to ratify this treaty, we will undo the \nhistoric tragedy that has often engulfed these nations and forever and \never, in the next century, ensure not only their protection but also \nensure that despicable practices like the Holocaust will never again \nhappen. That is what the 21st century is all about. That is why I will \nenthusiastically vote aye, when my name is called.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for months and weeks and days, we have \nlistened to the intellectual exchange, the foreign policy \nconsiderations, the financial impact and what effect what we are about \nto do will have on bilateral-multilateral relations of the United \nStates with other nations. That gave a context for this debate.\n  My friend from Maryland showed us the soul of this debate. I am proud \nto have been on the floor to hear her at this moment make the statement \nshe made. Not only is it historically accurate, but it reflects the \nwave of emotion that tens of millions of Americans of Polish descent \nare feeling at this moment.\n  I would like to say something that is going to make her very angry. I \nwould like our colleagues to consider that when we get to 67--we are \ngoing to cast our votes from our seat; I don't know if it is possible; \nit has never been done before--I think she should have the honor of \ncasting the 67th vote for this treaty. I don't know mechanically how to \ndo that. But you have no idea how much this means to her. You have no \nidea how much this means to millions of people like my colleague from \nMaryland.\n  I don't know how to work this out, but I am going to try, with the \nDemocratic and Republican staff, to figure out whether there is a way \nwe can officially record that my friend from Maryland was the 67th vote \ncast to take care of a historic inequity that her grandmother brought \nas a burden to this country and she as a Senator will help end.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say thank you. I will be happy to vote \nwhen my turn comes. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the L's come before the M's. I will be very \nhappy to withhold my vote when it comes time, if that helps to get the \nSenator from Maryland in that sequence.\n  Mr. President, the vote on the resolution to admit Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic to NATO, as we have all said, is as important as \nany we have cast in many years.\n  The debate on this resolution has been gaining momentum for over the \nyear. The issues have been discussed, not always in the depth or with \nthe clarity that I would have liked, but I am not among those who feel \nthat we have not had an opportunity to seriously consider this \nresolution. I only wish that we had had this week's debate a year ago, \nwhen the outcome of the vote was not a fait accompli.\n  I deeply respect many of the people on both sides of the issue. None \nmore than Secretary of State Albright, an ardent proponent of NATO \nenlargement, with whom I spoke by telephone yesterday while she was in \nChina. I yield to no member of this body in my admiration of her.\n  I also give great weight to the views of the former Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn, and to my close friend Senator Moynihan, whose \nthoughtful speeches on the subject I have read with keen interest. I \nhave also appreciated the views of a number of Vermonters who have \nexpertise in arms control and U.S.-Russian relations. There have been \nwell-qualified and articulate Vermonters on both sides of the debate.\n  But despite that, I am no more convinced by the positions of either \nside than I was when the debate began. After everything that has been \nspoken and written, I remain profoundly troubled by this resolution, as \nI know many others are. It is not more debate that is needed, it is the \nability to predict the future, which of course none of us can.\n  It is because the future is so unpredictable, and I am still not \nconvinced on an issue of such historic importance, that I will vote \nagainst this resolution.\n  Mr. President, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been the \nworld's most powerful and successful military alliance. For half a \ncentury, NATO served as a deterrent to a Soviet invasion of Europe. It \nhas helped to keep the peace in a region that has seen countless wars \nover the centuries, including two world wars in this century. When \ngenocide erupted in Bosnia it was NATO, with, I might add, the help of \nRussian soldiers, that enforced the Dayton peace accords. The earlier \nfailure of the United Nations in Bosnia is but one example of NATO's \nrelevance today.\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\n  So I am not among those who believes that because the cold war is \nover NATO is no longer needed. Bosnia proved otherwise, and there are \nother threats to which NATO might be called upon to respond. One, \nalthough no one likes to contemplate it, is a Russia in which the \ndemocratic reformers are ousted by nationalists whose attitude is \novertly hostile and aggressive toward the West. I do not see that \nhappening, but it is possible.\n  Russia is in the midst of far-reaching changes. Much of what is \nhappening there is encouraging, even remarkable. The old Soviet Union \nis gone forever, of that I have no doubt. But democracy remains \nextremely fragile, and some of what is happening in Russia is \ndiscouraging, even alarming.\n  Some things in Russia have not changed. It continues to possess \nthousands of nuclear weapons, and while we and the Russians are \ncooperating on a wide range of issues including arms control, no one \nknows what Russia will look like ten years or even ten months from now. \nMore than anything else, to vote for this resolution one should feel \nconfident that enlarging NATO will lead to a closer and more \ncooperative relationship between Russia and the West. There is no more \nimportant issue for the security of Europe and the United States.\n\n  Reaching the decision to oppose this resolution was extremely \ndifficult. Over the past couple of months as the vote approached I have \nseen that, as in many debates, the issues are far from black and white. \nI finally settled on four questions. I decided that only if I could \nconfidently answer each of them in the affirmative could I vote for \nwhat amounts to a fundamental reshaping of NATO. I discussed these \nquestions with other Senators, with the Secretary of State, and with \nmany others whose judgment and opinions I respect.\n  I asked myself whether admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic to NATO result in a more united and secure Europe?\n  Would it result in a stronger, more effective NATO?\n  Would it improve our relations with Russia, especially Russia's \nwillingness to vigorously pursue deep reductions in nuclear weapons?\n  And would it result in benefits that justify substantial additional \nmilitary costs to the United States and the new NATO members?\n  These are not novel questions. Any one of them could occupy hours or \neven days of debate. They have been discussed at length by members of \nthis body, and by some of our most knowledgeable European and Russian \nscholars and analysts including former Secretaries of State and \nDefense. What has struck me as I have read and listened to their views \nis the certainty and conviction with which they express them. Perhaps \nthat is the nature of advocacy, but I find it interesting nonetheless \nbecause their conclusions, on a subject of such immense importance to \nour future security, are based on so much that is uncertain, indeed \nunknowable.\n  Mr. President, I began from the perspective that the presumption is \nagainst expanding NATO at this time. A rebutable presumption, but NATO \nhas served us well for over fifty years and we should be wary of any \nattempt to substantially alter its configuration.\n  That is not to say that NATO can or should remain static. Its mission \ndoes need to evolve with the changing times. But what is contemplated \nhere, by voting to admit these three invitees and opening the door to \nfurther admissions in the future, amounts to a fundamental reshaping of \nNATO. Before we take that step I want to be convinced that the benefits \nof enlargement justify the risks and the cost.\n  Would enlargement result in a more united and secure Europe? More \nunited, probably yes. But what if expansion does not extend to the \nrepublics of the former Soviet Union, or even to certain other Eastern \nEuropean countries. Then we have simply created a new dividing line in \nEurope, and new rivalries between those inside NATO and those that are \nexcluded.\n  Would enlargement result in a stronger, more effective NATO? Frankly, \nI have been disappointed with the direction and focus of NATO in recent \nyears. At times I have felt it was adrift, and at no time more than \nwhen NATO sat on the sidelines as the United Nations floundered in \nBosnia. NATO has redeemed itself there but not until many thousands of \ninnocent people had died, including in so- called UN safe-havens. NATO \nshould have acted sooner and with far more decisiveness.\n\n  The administration says that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \naccept the responsibilities of NATO membership and will contribute an \nadditional 300,000 troops. Others argue that by adding new members we \ndilute NATO's effectiveness with poorly equipped, Soviet-trained \nforces. As Ambassador Paul Nitze has said, NATO would become ``fat and \nfeeble.''\n  My own guess, and it is only a guess, is that NATO would probably not \nsuffer, it might benefit from admitting these three invitees, but if \nadditional countries are admitted next year or thereafter as most \nproponents of expansion anticipate, it would become unwieldy, even less \ndecisive, and weakened.\n  My third question, and perhaps the most important, is whether \nenlargement would improve our relations with Russia, especially \nRussia's willingness to vigorously pursue deep reductions in nuclear \nweapons.\n  Mr. President, the administration asserts that NATO expansion will \nlead to improved relations between the West and Russia because it will \nresult in a more stable and secure Europe, a more prosperous Europe, \nand a new relationship between Russia and the former Warsaw countries \nthat is based on partnership.\n  I do not see the evidence to support such a rosy picture. But whether \nor not it is true, is a military alliance the best or only way to \nachieve that new relationship? I do not see why. The enlargement of \nNATO, no matter how benign, can only strengthen the hand of left and \nright-wing extremists in Russia, while undermining the position of the \ndemocrats we support.\n  On arms control, the administration offers a litany of examples of \nhow Russia is continuing to engage and cooperate on a broad agenda of \nsecurity issues. There is cooperation, most visibly in Bosnia where \nRussian and American soldiers are enforcing the Dayton accords side-by-\nside. There is talk of the Duma ratifying START II in the near future. \nThere are other examples.\n  But it seems to me that the real question is how can we best take \nadvantage--not of Russia's weakness--but of the opportunity for a \nfundamentally different relationship, an opportunity that comes rarely \nin history, and which is fortuitously presented by the transitional \nstage in which Russia finds itself today.\n  In World War I, Europe isolated and alienated a defeated Germany, and \nin so doing sowed the seeds for World War II. After that war, through \nthe leadership of great Americans like General Marshall and President \nTruman, we embraced our former German enemies and in so doing fostered \none of the world's strongest democracies. It would be unforgivable to \nrepeat a mistake of such tragic proportions.\n  Do we build a closer relationship with Russia by enlarging a military \nalliance possibly to its very borders, an alliance that has served \nprincipally to deter Soviet aggression? The so-called ``iron belt,'' as \nSenator Warner has aptly called it? If Russia posed a serious military \nthreat today I would see things differently. But the only serious \nmilitary threat Russia poses is its arsenal of nuclear missiles, and I \nwould argue that that threat is not diminished by expanding NATO \neastward.\n  There is reason to suspect that NATO enlargement has already delayed \nDUMA ratification of START II, and that it has set back the cause for \narms control in Russia. It has abandoned its ``no-first-use'' policy \nand, as its security situation deteriorates, Russia is headed toward \ngreater reliance on nuclear weapons.\n\n  My point, Mr. President, is that while relations between Russia and \nthe West are obviously far better than they were during the cold war, \nthey are a far cry from what I believe they can and should be.\n  The Russians can be difficult to deal with. I am aware of that. They \nare obsessed with being treated as equals even though they are no \nlonger a superpower. Russia in many respects is a poor, backward \ncountry. As we have seen in the recent spat with Latvia over Russian \nimmigrants, Moscow is prone to reverting to its threatening, Cold War \nmanner of dealing with its former territories.\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\n  But Russia is a big country. Big countries expect to exert a certain \namount of power in their sphere of influence, and it will take time for \nRussia to recognize that those ways of acting are no longer acceptable.\n  No one knows who will follow President Yeltsin. Russia's future is \ntoo unpredictable for us to disband NATO, and in any event there are \nother important missions for NATO than to defend against Russian \naggression. On that point I fully agree with the administration. I have \nlived most of my life in a world with NATO. I want future generations \nto benefit from this unmatched military alliance led by democratic \nnations. It serves us well.\n  But the United States should be doing everything possible to build a \nnon-threatening, cooperative and stable relationship with Russia. \nRather than rush to extend an historically anti-Russia alliance and \nbuild up the military capabilities of its neighbors --an approach that \nhas undeniably caused great resentment and uneasiness in Russia, we \nshould be building alliances that do not create new divisions between \nus.\n  Mr. President, my fourth question is whether enlargement would result \nin benefits that justify substantial additional military costs to the \nUnited States and the new NATO members.\n  One of the most troubling issues in this debate has been the cost \nprojections. Estimates range from several hundred million dollars, \nwhich I find impossible to take seriously if these countries are to \npull their own weight in NATO, to tens of billions of dollars. The \nadministration's estimates have changed so many times that are \nvirtually devoid of credibility.\n  As best I can tell, we only know that we do not know how much the \nadmission of these three countries would cost, but that it would cost a \nlot and possibly a lot more than the administration says. When was the \nlast time the Pentagon overestimated the cost of anything? I cannot \nrecall a time.\n  Nor can I recall a time when we were asked to vote for something when \nthe cost estimates differed so dramatically--from as little as $400 \nmillion to as much as $125 billion. That is a difference of over 300 \ntimes.\n  Nor do we know what it would cost to admit additional members after \nwe cross this threshold. The President has said that ``no qualified \nEuropean democracy is ruled out as a future member.'' There are over \ntwenty. That is a potentially huge investment and a bonanza for the \narms manufacturers who are not surprisingly among NATO enlargement's \ngreatest champions.\n  The last thing we want to encourage is for the newly admitted \ncountries will go on a weapons buying spree when they should be \nspending their scarce resources on economic development and \ninfrastructure.\n\n  What would NATO be with 22 new members? That may sound farfetched, \nbut under the President's scenario it is at least a plausible outcome \nand one we must consider before we start down the path of enlargement. \nI am afraid it would be a much weakened alliance, and one that Russia, \nrightly or wrongly, could quite reasonably regard as a threat.\n  And what commitments would we be making to those future members? \nPresident Clinton has said that NATO ``enlargement requires that we \nextend to new members our alliance's most solemn security pledge, to \ntreat an attack against one as an attack against all.'' That is what \nthe NATO charter says, but it is far from obvious that the American \npeople are ready to accept that commitment. Others speak vaguely of \ndifferent types of missions. I have strongly supported international \npeacekeeping, but I am uneasy about the lack of specificity about what \nwe are committing to here.\n  Mr. President, I do not doubt that Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic have every reason to want to be part of NATO. I also recognize \nthat they have made tremendous progress in meeting the criteria set for \nNATO admission. But we must judge, above all, if enlarging NATO at this \ntime in history is in the best interests of the United States--not \nPoland, not Hungary, not the Czech Republic, but the United States and \nNATO itself.\n  I have considered this resolution carefully, but I have been unable \nto satisfy myself that it is either necessary, or in our best interest. \nGeorge Kennan, a man I admire greatly, called NATO expansion ``the most \nfateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.'' I \ndo not know if George Kennan is right. But neither am I confident that \nhe is wrong. I am not prepared to gamble on his being wrong.\n  I hope that I am wrong. It appears that two-thirds of the Senate will \nvote for this resolution. I sincerely hope that the admission of new \ncountries to NATO produces the desirable outcome the administration \nforecasts. If that happens I will be the first to admit that I was \nwrong, and to welcome that outcome.\n  As I said at the outset of my remarks, this has been a difficult \ndecision for me. I obviously share the administration's goal of a \nunited, secure and prosperous Europe. We all do. But I believe \ncontinued progress can be made to achieve that through Partnership for \nPeace and other means, without the risks and cost involved in enlarging \nNATO. Nothing, I am convinced, bears more directly on the future \nsecurity of Europe and the United States than a democratic Russia that \ndoes not fear the West.\n  That should be our priority, that is what is at stake, and so the \nSenator from Vermont will oppose this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before we proceed to a vote, may I ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, if he is satisfied now \nwith Ted Stevens' amendment?\n\n\n               Executive Amendment No. 2065, as modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am satisfied, and I will send to the \ndesk, if I may, with the permission of the chairman, a modification \nthat has been agreed to by Senator Stevens and myself.\n  On behalf of Senator Stevens, I ask that a modification to amendment \nNo. 2065 be sent to the desk. This adds one word to the amendment which \nI have cleared with Senator Stevens and with Chairman Helms. I want to \nstate my understanding about this amendment before we adopt it, which I \nhave also cleared with the Senator from Alaska.\n  First, this amendment does not affect the Partnership for Peace \nProgram.\n  Second, I understand this to mean that NATO cannot incur NATO \nexpansion costs for which the United States would be obligated to pay \nexcept through NATO's common-funded budgets unless specifically \nauthorized by law. And with those understandings, the amendment, as \nmodified, is perfectly acceptable to me.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of section 3(2) of the resolution, add the \n     following:\n       (C) Requirement of payment out of funds specifically \n     authorized.--No cost incurred by the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO), other than through the common-funded \n     budgets of NATO, in connection with the admission to \n     membership, or participation, in NATO of any country that was \n     not a member of NATO as of March 1, 1998, may be paid out of \n     funds available to any department, agency, or other entity of \n     the United States unless the funds are specifically \n     authorized by law for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. To keep the Record straight, that is No. 2066, as \nmodified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2065, as modified.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Amendment 2065, as modified.\n  Mr. HELMS. Amendment 2065, as modified. Very well.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Do we need to \nvitiate the yeas and nays?\n  I move to vitiate the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I urge its adoption by voice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The executive amendment (No. 2065), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think you have a UC, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2320\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on amendment No. 2320. By \nprevious order, the yeas and nays have been ordered to occur at 7 \no'clock. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Are we proceeding \non the basis of a unanimous consent request that was entered into \nearlier to vote at 7 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further parliamentary inquiry. Will there be a series of \nvotes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two votes currently stacked----\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is mistaken. There is only one vote \ncurrently called for under the previous order which was a result of the \nunanimous consent agreement. It is to occur at 7 o'clock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As soon as the vote is over, I assume the floor would be \nopen for further amendments and debate. Is that affirmative?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There have been amendments set aside. They \nwould recur, if called up.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. At the conclusion of \nthis vote, the regular order would be to return to the Ashcroft \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Return to the Ashcroft amendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Ashcroft.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is there a limited amount of time on that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So the floor would be open at that time. I thank the \nChair. Thank you.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, we have two votes; \nthe first would be 15, and the second 10?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was equally confused. But this is \nthe parliamentary situation. Under a standing unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senate should now vote on the Conrad amendment No. 2320. \nBy unanimous consent, there is a 10-minute limit on the vote on the \nBingaman amendment, but the agreement did not call for the Bingaman \namendment to occur immediately after the Conrad amendment. If that is \nthe desire of the Senator from North Carolina, he will have to ask \nunanimous consent that that happen.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, this whole situation is fraught with sideline \nagreements that nobody recorded. Now, the understanding was that at \nthis point--all right. So we will vote first on the Conrad-Bingaman; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. Amendment No. 2320, and then followed by 2324?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order for 2324.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest we get something done.\n  I suggest we proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from North Carolina asking that \nwe move to 2324 after 2320? That would require a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HELMS. We will do that afterwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All right. The question is on agreeing to the \nexecutive amendment No. 2320. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 16, nays 84, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 113 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--16\n\n     Bingaman\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Murray\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--84\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n  The executive amendment (No. 2320) was rejected.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2318\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto amendment 2318, the Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  That amendment is now in order.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong opposition to \nthis amendment and to urge my colleagues to vote this amendment down.\n  Before I start Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article published today on this amendment in the \nWashington Times by David Gompert, who served as senior director for \nEurope and Eurasia on the National Security Council staff under \nPresident George Bush. This is a very insightful piece, and I intend to \nreiterate and elaborate on the sound points raised by David Gompert.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          A Vote Against NATO\n\n                           (By David Gompert)\n\n       As the Senate prepares to ratify the enlargement of NATO, \n     the debate has taken a troubling turn. While not questioning \n     the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Sen. \n     John Ashcroft has offered an amendment to the ratification \n     resolution aimed essentially at limiting NATO's purpose to \n     the Cold War mission of defending the borders of the European \n     allies. Should such a new restriction be imposed, the big \n     loser would be the United States.\n       Needless to say Sen. Ashcroft has no intention of harming \n     U.S. security interests. His motivation, it seems, is to keep \n     the U.S. from being drawn into peacekeeping operations, like \n     Bosnia, that the Europeans ought to handle on their own. \n     Reasonable people can disagree about the merits of U.S. \n     involvement in Bosnia and other peacekeeping missions. In \n     some cases, the nation will opt to send forces, as in Bosnia; \n     in other cases, it will not, as in last year's crisis in \n     Albania. But let's be clear: The NATO treaty does not and \n     will not require the U.S. to participate in peacekeeping. The \n     Clinton administration has never claimed that the U.S. has \n     a treaty obligation to join its allies in Bosnia.\n       Thus, the Ashcroft amendment is at best unnecessary. Far \n     worse, it could foreclose a potentially crucial strategic \n     option for the United States, namely, to seek NATO's help in \n     confronting future threats to the common security interests \n     of the Atlantic democracies. In this world of rogue states \n     with biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons poised to \n     seize Western oil supplies, why would we want to restrict \n     NATO's purpose to our coming to the defense of European soil? \n     Why would we want to cut off U.S. options in this \n     unpredictable era? Why would we discard our chance to get \n     allied support for U.S. security interests?\n       Wisely, the drafters of the NATO Treaty 50 years ago \n     provided not only for the defense of the territory of the \n     European allies but also for the possibility of common action \n     to protect other interests. The United States wanted this \n     latter provision--not as an obligation but as an option. When \n     the treaty was signed, Secretary of State Acheson proclaimed \n     that it contained no limitations on alliance missions. As \n     long as the Soviets threatened Europe, the defense of allied \n     territory was NATO's overriding concern. But now, the U.S. \n     has begun to ask the Europeans to contribute more to the \n     protection of other common interests, such as oil and \n     security from weapons of mass destruction. It is time for the \n     U.S. not only to give but also to receive security benefits \n     from NATO.\n       Accordingly, since the Gulf War, when the U.S. had to send \n     nearly all the forces and run nearly all the risks, the Bush \n     administration and the Clinton administration have urged\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\n     the Europeans to move beyond the Cold War mission of border \n     defense and to join the United States in combating the new \n     threats. This work has just begun to bear fruit: The British, \n     French and Germans have, somewhat reluctantly, agreed to \n     build forces that could help out if, for example, another war \n     erupted in the Persian Gulf. The allies are becoming \n     convinced by the United States that NATO is too valuable--and \n     the world is too dangerous--to restrict its options.\n       The Ashcroft amendment could derail this effort. By \n     stressing that NATO's only business is to defend European \n     borders, it would remove any motivation for the allies to \n     field better forces for post-Cold War missions and give them \n     a perfect excuse to let their military readiness decline. By \n     suggesting that the U.S. will not support any other NATO \n     missions, it would guarantee that the allies will not. By \n     disapproving of the use of NATO to combat today's threats it \n     would signal that the U.S. sees the alliance as having little \n     value in the new era. Those Europeans that prefer to see the \n     U.S. face the new era's dangers alone would welcome the \n     Ashcroft amendment.\n       Worst of all, those who would threaten U.S. and European \n     common interests, such as Iraq, Libya, Iran and Serbia, might \n     be relieved, if also astounded, to learn that the United \n     States was not going to use NATO to face them with a common \n     U.S.-European front, in peacetime and war. These renegades \n     are already trying to split us from our allies. The only \n     thing that would bother and deter them better than U.S. power \n     is U.S. power backed by NATO. The Ashcroft amendment--\n     unintentionally, of course--could rule that out. Upon \n     admitting the three new democracies as members, thus \n     consolidating security within Europe, NATO will turn its \n     attention to how the U.S. and Europeans can work together to \n     combat common threats wherever they might arise. We will be \n     debating and refining such a concept for years to come, and \n     the Senate will have an important voice. By design, the \n     treaty itself neither requires nor forbids new missions. The \n     Ashcroft amendment would pinch off options that the treaty \n     was meant to provide and that the U.S., above all, can now \n     use to its advantage.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I fully recognize that the sponsors of this amendment are \nmotivated by the desire to preserve the vitality of NATO and the \ncentral priority of its collective defense mission. These are goals \nthat I fully endorse. However, the motivations behind this amendment \nand its real and potential impact upon the Alliance are leagues apart. \nMr. President, this amendment would do great damage to the Alliance and \nto the interests of the United States.\n  First, it intends to unilaterally impose for the first time in the \nhistory of the Alliance new restrictions on NATO's roles and missions. \nAnd it would do so, in absence of serious consultations within the \nAlliance.\n  Second, such a unilateral move by the Senate runs counter to the \nspirit and traditions of the Alliance. It would invite other allies to \nunilaterally impose their own restrictions and definitions on the terms \nof the Washington Treaty. We must not set the Alliance upon such a \nslippery and divisive slope.\n  Third, by imposing such restrictions, this amendment would undercut \nthe ability of the United States to prompt NATO to take actions \nnecessary to protect and defend the interests of the North Atlantic \ncommunity. Worse yet, the language of this amendment would undermine \nthe ability of the United States to call NATO to action in defense of \nAmerican security interests.\n  Fourth, this chamber has repeatedly called upon our Allies to stop \nthe decline of their defense establishments and do more to bear burdens \nof the Alliance. This amendment directly undercuts those efforts to \nattain more equitable burden-sharing within the Alliance and the \ntransatlantic community. It would do by granting our European allies \nyet another excuse to not improve their defense forces.\n  At its best this amendment in unnecessary to achieve the goals of its \nsponsors. At its worst, the amendment would undercut the Alliance's \nwill and capability to defend the security interests of the North \nAtlantic community of democracies.\n  This amendment is unnecessary to attain the goal of preventing the \nUnited States from being drawn into dangerous peace-keeping operations \nthat the countries of Europe should handle on their own. The United \nStates already reserves the right to veto any such initiative within or \nby the Alliance. Moreover, Article 5 of the Washington Treaty makes \nU.S. Participation in a NATO mission strictly a national decision. It \nis not an obligation. That has always been the case and will always \nremain the case in NATO.\n  It is quite evident that not everyone in the Senate supports the \ndecision of the United States to have NATO lead the effort to bring \npeace to the Balkans. Nonetheless, it was a national decision by the \nUnited States and the United States Congress to support the NATO \nmission in Bosnia. And, the fact is that this military operation is \ncompletely consistent with the Washington Treaty. We should not allow \ndisagreements with the foreign policy of the executive branch, as \nserious as they may be, to prompt dangerous revisions or restrictions \nupon a treaty that has been an unprecedented success for the deterrence \nof aggression and the preservation of peace. Yet, that is exactly what \nthis amendment would do.\n  I understand that one key intent of the amendment is to express the \nopinion that the Alliance must remain first and foremost an institution \nof collective defense. That goal is already accomplished through the \nresolution of ratification. Just read it.\n  Section 3.1.A of the resolution of ratification declares clearly that \nthe ``core purpose of NATO must continue to be the collective defense \nof the territory of all NATO members.'' The resolution makes crystal \nclear that the Senate firmly believes that NATO's first priority must \nbe the mission of collective defense.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment is not only unnecessary, it is \ndangerous. By attempting to define and restrict the missions that NATO \ncan and should undertake, it risks foreclosing the ability of the \nUnited States to seek NATO's assistance in confronting future threats \nto the transatlantic community of nations.\n  Ironically, this amendment's current construction would not keep the \nUnited States from becoming engaged in any future ``Bosnia-type \ncontingencies''--a core intent of its authors--because such \ncontingencies as Bosnia can be defined as meeting its requirements. \nIndeed, the U.S. Congress has done just that by supporting our troops \nin Bosnia. But, this amendment, could serve as an excuse for our allies \nto avoid sharing the risks and burdens of such contingencies with the \nUnited States.\n  In a world of rogue states with biological, chemical and nuclear \nweapons increasingly at their disposal, why would we, the United States \nSenate, want to undercut NATO's willingness and ability to defend the \ncommon interests of the North Atlantic community of democracies? Why \nwould we, the United States Senate discard one of the best vehicles \nthrough which to prompt allied support for U.S. security interests?\n  Some fifty years ago, the drafters of the Washington Treaty included \nprovisions not only to provide for the territorial defense of the North \nAtlantic region, but also for the possibility of common action to \nprotect other interests of the North Atlantic Community. It was the \nUnited States that insisted upon this provision--Article 4 of the \nCharter--and a construction of the Charter that would permit actions \nbeyond the narrow scope of territorial defense. Secretary of State Dean \nAcheson spoke to this point clearly before the Treaty went into force \nin 1949, and I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt of a memorandum of \nhis press conferences in which he spoke definitively on this point be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Excerpt of Memorandum of the Press and Radio News Conference, Friday, \nMarch 18, 1949\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       A correspondent asked the Secretary to consider a situation \n     which might arise if there was a demonstration of a power, \n     not a member of this group, in the direction of one of the \n     Middle Eastern countries such as Iran or Turkey which was \n     considered by one of the powers in the group to constitute a \n     threat to peace and security. He asked if there was any \n     provision in the Treaty beyond the provision for consultation \n     and Secretary Acheson replied in the negative. Asked if \n     Article 9 did not provide for a recommendation by the council \n     on a situation of this type, the Secretary replied that this \n     was correct. He said that it applied for recommendations for \n     carrying out or implementing the Treaty but said that this \n     did not change what he had said earlier. He declared that \n     there was no provision which looked toward these Parties \n     acting as a unit in regard to some matter not covered by the \n     Treaty and said they might act as a unit or they might not, \n     but that there was nothing in the Treaty which required them \n     to do so.\n       Asked if there was no provision for anything except \n     consultation, except actual\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\n     armed attack on one of the signatories, the Secretary replied \n     that there were Articles one, two, three and four. Asked if \n     there were no limiting clause the Secretary stated that there \n     was no limiting clause. A correspondent asked if the area of \n     the Treaty was specified but was not necessarily limited as \n     to what the Parties might do after they might consult, \n     considering the fact that an attack to security might \n     originate outside of the geographical limits of the Treaty. \n     The Secretary said that, in the first place, there was the \n     very first article of the Treaty which says that the Parties \n     affirm their obligations under the Charter of the United \n     Nations, to settle their disputes peacefully. He added that \n     he didn't know whether this would be called limiting but that \n     it was one of the great obligations of the Charter, and that \n     if it were carried out by all members of the United Nations a \n     great many problems in this world would disappear. In \n     conclusion, he said that he would think that it was quite \n     limiting. A correspondent said that geographical limitations \n     in Europe and the North Atlantic had also been set up in \n     Article 5 and the Secretary said that this was right.\n       Asked if the Treaty stipulated that if armed attack should \n     originate outside of the area no action might be taken, the \n     Secretary replied in the negative.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Mr. ROTH. The fact is that the policy of the United States and the \npolicy of NATO have always permitted actions by the Alliance that go \nbeyond the narrow scope of territorial defense. Yet, this amendment \nclearly attempts to constrict the interpretation of the Washington \ntreaty rendered by its founding fathers.\n  And, let us not underestimate what kind of example passage of this \namendment would set for our Allies. It would encourage our European \nAllies to impose their own unilateral reinterpretations or restrictions \nupon the Washington treaty. Imagine our reaction, if one of the \nparliaments or governments of our allies were to attach such conditions \nto NATO enlargement. How would we react, if for example, one ally were \nto prohibit the use of NATO-designated units against Saddam Hussein's \nregime in Iraq? Judging from recent events in the Persian Gulf, I \nimagine the reaction in this chamber would be one of complete outrage.\n  Mr. President, we must also be aware of the message this amendment \nwould send to our European Allies should the Senate make the profound \nmistake of accepting it.\n  For years, the United States, and especially the United States \nCongress, has worked arduously to make our European Allies more outward \nlooking in their security policies and to assume a greater share of the \nrisks and burdens in addressing common challenges and threats. We have \nrepeatedly called upon them to stop the decline of their defense \nestablishments and to devote the resources that will enable them to \nbetter contribute to the transatlantic security.\n  Yet this amendment, perhaps inadvertently, would signal that the \nbusiness of NATO is only territorial defense, and no more. It would \nthereby eliminate any motivation for the Allies to field the forces \nnecessary for post-Cold War missions. It would serve as an excuse to \nlet the military establishments continue an over decade long decline.\n  Worse, this amendment would infer that the United States views the \nAlliance as having limited value in the post-Cold War era. This is an \nimportant point made by David Gompert, and I fully agree. Passage of \nthis amendment could be interpreted by our allies and the detractors of \nthe Alliance that the United States no longer regards its vital \ninterests as being best secured through the fabric of the transatlantic \ncommunity and the NATO alliance. That would be a dangerously \ncounterproductive message--a message that would ignore the lessons of \ntwo world wars and the Cold War. I just don't believe that our memory \nis so short.\n  Mr. President, the Senate must reject this amendment. As I stated \nearlier, at its best, this amendment is redundant and unnecessary. At \nits worst, it is a radical and dangerous departure from the Washington \nTreaty of 1949 and the way in which the United States has over the \nyears used the Alliance to advance our own national interests.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I now move to table the Ashcroft amendment, \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Delaware to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Missouri. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 82, nays 18, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 114 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--82\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--18\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Craig\n     Faircloth\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2318) was agreed \nto.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2324\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Bingaman \namendment, No. 2324. By previous agreement, this is a 10-minute vote. \nWe have 10 minutes of debate equally divided. Then there is a 10-minute \nvote. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico will be recognized when the Senate is in \norder. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the members of NATO are engaged today in \nrevising and updating the so-called strategic concept of NATO. We are \npart of this ongoing review. It was agreed to in July of last year in \nMadrid, by the Council, that this revision of the strategic concept \nwould take place, and they set out a three-stage process to do it. They \nare well into that process now. The idea behind it was that the new, \nrevised strategic concept will be presented next April at the Ministers \nmeeting.\n  My amendment says that after the admission of Poland and Hungary and \nthe Czech Republic, it will be the policy of the United States not to \ninvite other members to come into NATO until that revised strategic \nconcept has been agreed to by the Council, by the NATO Council. To my \nmind, this is not a radical proposal in any respect. It is exactly the \nprocess that is intended to take place. It is very important, I \nbelieve, for ourselves to know what the new mission is and to have \nagreement on what the new strategic concept is before we take on new \nmembers and commit to defend their territory. Of course, I think it is \nalso very important that the new members who would like to become part \nof NATO understand precisely what this strategic concept is before they \nsign on to participate in it.\n  So that is the amendment. There is no great mystery about it. It is \nnot intended to subvert anything, to delay anything. It has absolutely \nno effect on the question of whether Poland and the Czech Republic and \nHungary should be admitted into NATO at this time. But it does say \nbefore we go beyond that, we should get this strategic concept agreed \nto. It is intended that that happen next year. I have every reason to \nbelieve it will happen next year. It is important that it happen before \nwe begin to invite others to join NATO after these three countries.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very, very brief. This is a rerun \nof the amendment by my distinguished friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner. This is\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\na means by which to artificially delay any new decision relative to new \nentrants. We already have the strategic concept that contemplated and \nreflected the changes that took place in 1991. You all voted 90 to 6 \nlast night on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, \nlaying out in detail what must be taken into consideration by the \nUnited States of America to sign on any new strategic concept. This is, \nin fact, not necessary. It is not needed, and it is an unnecessary \ndelay. So I am prepared--if my colleague will yield the remainder of \nhis time, I will yield the remainder of mine and I am ready to vote.\n  I urge you all to vote no.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to use an additional 1 minute of my time. \nHow much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes 33 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me just sum up my position. I do not think the \namendment by the Senator from Arizona is related to this. That is a \nstatement by the U.S. Senate as to what we think ought to be in the \nrevised strategic concept. It is not a statement by the Council, NATO \nCouncil, as to what ought to be in there. I think it is important that \nwe get agreement among our NATO allies as to what is in this strategic \nconcept before we go ahead to invite new members. That is what my \namendment says.\n\n  Unless someone intends that we invite new members in the next 11 \nmonths, there is no delay involved in this. So I hope very much my \ncolleagues will approve the amendment and add it to the treaty.\n  I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I see no purpose for this amendment. I hope my colleagues \nwill view it the same way.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered and the clerk will now call the roll on the \nBingaman amendment, No. 2324.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

It will be my intention to just speak for \na few minutes on the amendment, and then I will withdraw the amendment. \nAfter seeing how all of the amendments seem to be faring here, it \nseemed ridiculous to waste any more time of the Senate to be voting on \nthese amendments.\n  I feel strongly about this aspect of going into NATO enlargement. \nMore than anything else, I want to explain the purpose of my amendment \nand lay down a marker regarding an issue that I know concerns all of us \nhere and which could have very severe repercussions in an expanded \nNATO. That is the issue of the nonproliferation treaty of which the \nUnited States is a signatory and, of course, an issue that we have \npushed very hard.\n  Many of us have spoken many times about the importance of not slowing \ndown international arms control and nonproliferation efforts. This \namendment is simply a sense of the Senate regarding NATO's relationship \nto the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, and urges that the \nPresident should propose that NATO examine the compatibility--\n  Mr. President, could I have order? I have trouble hearing myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order so the speaker can be heard? \nHe is entitled to be heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President.\n  This amendment just urges that the President should propose that NATO \nexamine the compatibility of its nuclear-weapons-sharing programs with \nour obligations under the NPT, the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.\n  The NPT is one of our most important international agreements. Not \nonly is the United States a member of the NPT regime, we were a strong \nleader in establishing the treaty.\n  Its purpose, of course, is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. \nThrough a series of provisions, it helps halt the spread of nuclear \nmaterials and nuclear weapons knowledge. That is the important part of \nthis--the nuclear weapons knowledge.\n  The nonaligned members of the NPT have expressed great concern over \nNATO's nuclear-sharing programs. Let me make it clear. The United \nStates has nuclear weapons at U.S. bases in NATO nations. In time of \nwar the United States could release these nuclear weapons to these \nallied nations.\n  Of course, in peacetime our allies do not have control over them. We \nretain control. However, we do assist in training foreign militaries in \nnuclear-use capabilities.\n  For example, we train our NATO ally pilots how to drop nuclear \nweapons. We train their ground crews on how to store nuclear weapons \nand how to load them onto aircraft. And 110 nations have expressed \nconcern over NATO's expansion impact on the NPT.\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n  The first indication of this, Mr. President, was in an article that \nappeared in Defense News, on March 30, saying that:\n  ``The 113 members of the so-called nonaligned movement, none of which \nhave nuclear weapons, have asked conference leaders at the meeting to \ndiscuss assurances for parties to the NPT that they will not be \ntargeted by nuclear weapons.'' Stephen Young, of the British American \nSecurity Information Council was quoted in the article as adding, ``If \nNATO won't give nuclear weapons up, and in fact continues to publicly \ndeclare nuclear weapons as part of its strategy for the future of the \nalliance, the fear is that some states that do not currently have \nnuclear weapons may become frustrated and decide to acquire them for \nprotection.''\n  Now, we have a news release from the same organization that came in \njust yesterday that stated that: ``At the meeting of the member states \nof the nuclear non-proliferation treaty''--in Geneva on April 28, just \n2 days ago, 110 nations of the nonaligned movement--``demanded an end \nto NATO nuclear-sharing arrangements.''\n  A working paper representing the position of more than 110 states \ndemands that--and I quote--``the nuclear weapons states parties to the \nNPT refrain from, among themselves, with non-nuclear weapons states, \nand with states not party to the treaty, nuclear sharing for military \npurposes under any kind of security arrangements.''\n  Well, NATO is the only alliance which operates nuclear-sharing \narrangements. Under these arrangements, somewhere between 150 to 200 \nU.S. nuclear weapons are deployed in the six European States: Belgium, \nGermany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey.\n  NATO countries, of course, have always maintained that NATO nuclear \nsharing is legal under the NPT because it does not involve the actual \ntransfer of nuclear weapons unless a decision was made to go to war.\n  However, the NPT regime also involves, as I stated earlier, the \nsharing of nuclear knowledge. So I think it is a well-grounded concern \nof the nonaligned nations to express their concerns about the expansion \nof NATO and the fact that we will begin sharing nuclear knowledge with \nthe three new member nations. I think their fears are well founded and \nworth considering.\n  Will we now, of course, with the addition of these three new nations, \nbegin to share this nuclear knowledge? Are these three new nations full \nand absolute partners of NATO--as many have said here on the floor \nduring the course of the debate, that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic should not be second-class NATO partners but should have all \nof the rights, obligations, and powers inherent in any NATO member \nnation? If that is the case, then certainly we will begin to share \nnuclear knowledge with those three countries. I believe, Mr. President, \nthat this could fly in the face of our obligations under the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty. Therein lies the conundrum.\n  If we do proceed with NATO expansion--and it obviously looks like the \nvotes will be here to do that--and if these three nations become full \npartners in NATO, as many have said they should, and obviously they \nwill under the reading of the protocols, we then will proceed to share \nnuclear knowledge with those three nations. And what of nuclear \ncapabilities? I am not saying that we will turn over control of nuclear \nweapons--we have not yet done that to any nation of NATO--but we could \nget to the point where we might turn over nuclear weapons to those \nthree nations if, in fact, conditions warrant it.\n  There is one other aspect--and I was going to offer another \namendment, but I will not--the use and stationing of dual-use aircraft \nin these countries. Again, as members of NATO, we will be stationing \naircraft in the countries that have dual uses. They can be used for \nconventional weapons delivery, but if fitted with the proper hard \npoints and racks, they can also be used for nuclear weapons delivery. \nAnd will we then proceed to train ground crews and pilots in those \ncountries in the delivery of these nuclear weapons, in their storage, \nand in their handling and loading capabilities? Again, I believe that \nwe may do something which probably a lot of Senators have not thought \nabout. That is how NATO expansion affects our obligations and our \nstated interest in the nonproliferation treaty.\n  So I am hopeful that the President will give due consideration to \nthis. Quite frankly, I don't know what the President can do. Either we \nare going to adhere to the letter and the spirit of the NPT and not \nshare nuclear knowledge and capabilities and training with the three \ncountries coming in, or we will share nuclear capabilities, knowledge, \nand training with these countries, and violate the letter and the \nspirit of the nonproliferation treaty. You can't have it both ways.\n  Another reason why I believe this rush to approve these three \nnations' accession into NATO is a march to folly--to quote the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, who last night quoted Barbara Tuchman's book, ``The \nMarch to Folly''--is that it just seems that the expansion has not been \nfully thought through, especially in the nuclear regime. If in fact we \ngo ahead down that course, what then will Russia say? I know a lot of \npeople have said, ``Well, Russia, understands what we are doing; they \nhaven't raised a lot of objections.'' They have raised some.\n  Again, as Senator Bumpers said last night, it is not now, it is when \nthe elections are going to be held in Russia. That is when the hard-\nline right-wingers and the Communists will come out and say, see, we \ntold you so. They will say that an expanded NATO in violation of oral \nassurances given to Mr. Gorbachev. Not only that, they could say that \nwe have violated the nonproliferation treaty by providing nuclear \ncapabilities to those three countries.\n  Right now, the Duma has already delayed ratification of the START II \ntreaty. Nationalist elements have begun to gain power by accusing \nmembers of the democratic party with appeasement of the West. This will \njust give them another bullet in their arsenal in arguing that, in \nfact, Russia should change its course of action.\n  I was interested that former Ambassador Matlock, former Ambassador to \nthe Soviet Union under the Bush administration, opposes NATO expansion. \nHe stated, NATO expansion ``may go down in history as the most profound \nstrategic plunder made since the end of the cold war.'' Ambassador \nMatlock further stated NATO enlargement ``fails to take account of the \nreal international situation following the end of the cold war, and \nproceeds in accord with the logic that made sense during the cold \nwar.''\n  I agree with those words of Ambassador Matlock. I don't know \nAmbassador Matlock, never met him, as far as I know, but I think he has \ngiven us wise counsel. He is joined by many others across the Nation. I \nhave watched this debate unfold over the course of the last few months. \nAs more and more knowledge has gotten out around the country as to what \nNATO expansion really entails, the possibility of derailing START II \ntalks, the unknown factor of what the costs are eventually going to be, \nthe fact that once we have opened this door and with, I am sorry to \nsay, the defeat of the Warner amendment--it was close--with the defeat \nof his amendment, you can bet your bottom dollar next year elements \nwithin our country will start pushing for new nations to be brought \ninto the NATO umbrella.\n  How will we respond to those? By saying that they are less worthy \nthat Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic? Will we say that somehow \nthey are not ready, that we are going to have this hard dividing line \nin Europe? So it is going to exacerbate and cause even more tensions in \nEurope in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will allow me to comment with him. I \ntalked to former Ambassador Matlock today. I have known him since 1972, \nwhen he was part of our delegation that went over to work on the \nagreement. I have the highest regard for him. He confirmed to me very \nmuch what he advised the Senator. I just want to acknowledge that I \nthink he is an authority that should be listened to.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the Senator saying that. I have not met Mr. \nMatlock or talked to him personally. It is nice to know that even yet \ntoday he feels the same way. With words from respected people like \nMatlock, and with concerns such as what I have pointed out this evening \nin this amendment, more opposition has come out in\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\neditorials around the country opposed to NATO expansion. The Des Moines \nRegister, the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, the Salt Lake Tribune, \nand the Houston Chronicle--spanning the spectrum of the country \ngeographically, spanning the spectrum of the country, philosophically \nand ideologically.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some of these editorials \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Register's Editorials]\n\nWhy Rush? Why NATO?--Why Expand a Military Alliance That Has no Logical \n                                 Enemy?\n\n       The end of the Cold War should logically have meant the end \n     of NATO, the military alliance intended to offset the \n     military power of the Soviet bloc, in favor of formal and \n     informal alliances promoting more economic and social links. \n     But logic has run up squarely against the interests of the \n     defense industry. And far from disbanding NATO, the Senate is \n     scheduled to vote soon on expanding it--to include the former \n     Communist states of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n       Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Textron have already promised \n     to build arms factories in that area. The World Policy \n     Institute reports that $1.2 billion in U.S. tax money has \n     thus far been spent arming the countries in anticipation of \n     NATO membership, and billions more must follow.\n       Meanwhile, the proposed NATO expansion has been one of the \n     soundest sleeper issues in American politics. While the \n     defense industry has dumped millions on Congress to win a \n     favorable vote, the matter has rated the most meager of media \n     coverage. But both President Clinton and the Senate \n     Republican leadership favor it, and the skids are greased.\n       ``What's the rush?'' Republican Senator John Warner of \n     Virginia asked in a recent floor speech. Warner said \n     expanding NATO will isolate Russia, needlessly threatening an \n     already-insecure nation that retains a huge nuclear arsenal. \n     Our priority, Warner said, should be further reduction of \n     nuclear stockpiles. Instead, we seem intent on beefing up a \n     military alliance that has no logical opponent--unless we \n     succeed in creating one.\n       The Senate can vote to approve expansion, reject it or \n     delay action pending further discussion. Expanding NATO \n     without allowing reasonable time for considering alternatives \n     is reckless and foolhardy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The New York Times, April 29, 1998]\n\n                    NATO and the Lessons of History\n\n       The small but vociferous band of senators opposed to NATO \n     expansion retreated yesterday to trying to sell a series of \n     amendments they hoped would delay enlargement or limit the \n     financial costs to Washington. Only one, offered by Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan and John Warner, would put off this round of \n     growth by making NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic contingent on their gaining admission to the \n     European Union.\n       While it was encouraging to see the Senate at last \n     thoughtfully debating the merits of expansion, the \n     significance of the moment seemed to escape many members. \n     Pushing NATO eastward may, as its proponents argue, only \n     reinforce democracy and unity in Europe. We will be pleased \n     if that proves true. But with the Senate now moving toward \n     approval, the consequences could be quite different. The \n     military alliance that played such a crucial role in \n     preserving peace in Europe through the hard decades of the \n     cold war could become the source of instability on that \n     Continent.\n       The reason enlargement could prove to be a mistake of \n     historic proportions is best explained by comparing the \n     decision before the Senate with the far different course \n     America chose at the end of World War II. America acted then \n     not to isolate Germany and Japan, or to treat them as future \n     threats, but rather to help make them democratic states. It \n     was a generous and visionary policy that recognized that \n     America's interests could be best secured by the advancement \n     of its principles abroad and the embrace of its former \n     enemies.\n       Now, in the aftermath of the cold war, the United States is \n     taking an entirely different approach to the loser of that \n     conflict. Though it has offered financial assistance and \n     friendship to Russia, the Clinton Administration has made \n     NATO expansion the centerpiece of its European policy. It is \n     as if America had sent Japan and Germany a few billion \n     dollars when the the war ended while devoting most of its \n     energy to strengthening a military alliance against those \n     countries.\n       It is delusional to believe that NATO expansion is not at \n     its core an act that Russia will regard as hostile. At the \n     very moment when Russia is shedding its totalitarian history \n     and moving toward democracy and free markets, the West is \n     essentially saying it still intends to treat Moscow as a \n     military threat. The best way to defend Eastern Europe is not \n     to erect a new barrier against Russian aggression but to \n     bring democracy and prosperity to Russia so it will not be \n     aggressive. The genius of American policy toward Japan and \n     Germany was that it looked to the future rather than the \n     past. It is lamentable that Washington lacks the imagination \n     and courage to do so again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Chicago Tribune, February 1, 1998]\n\n                   A Case of Less is More With NATO?\n\n       Like a fighter aircraft flying just above treetop level to \n     evade detection by radar, the issue of expanding the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization is moving, all but unnoticed by \n     the American public, toward ratification by the Senate.\n       With formal consideration of the expansion treaty expected \n     to begin in March, most knowledgeable observers look upon \n     NATO membership for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as \n     an all but foregone conclusion. And with no serious \n     opposition among the 15 other current members of the \n     alliance--Turkey is the only one that has even feinted at \n     rejection--that conclusion seems well warranted, even if the \n     actual expansion is not.\n       This means that, very shortly, the U.S. will be committed \n     to treat an attack on Prague like one on Peoria, a blow to \n     Budapest like one to Birmingham. Since it is their sons and \n     daughters, husbands and wives who will put their lives on the \n     line. It would behoove the American people to give this issue \n     the most careful thought. Unfortunately, that has not \n     happened.\n       Indeed, the Clinton administration and its supporters in \n     the expansion effort also may not have thought as carefully \n     about it as they might, because expanding NATO could have the \n     ironic result of making Europe, in the end, less secure than \n     it otherwise would be.\n       Americans who supposed that the collapse of the Soviet \n     Union and the end of the Cold War meant that the U.S. could \n     finally lay down the burden of defending Europe may be \n     surprised to learn that that is not so--at least not in the \n     view of many in the foreign policy priesthood. What it has \n     meant, according to the new NATO theology, is that NATO's \n     raison d'etre has become not European defense from a \n     ferocious USSR but European security.\n       The difference may seem so subtle as to be insignificant, \n     but it is not. Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic, \n     summed it up as a matter of keeping the Europeans from \n     falling into a ``war of all against all,'' of becoming ex-\n     Yugoslavia on a continental scale.\n       That is not an ignoble thing to do. The question is why is \n     it the job of the U.S. any more than it is America's job to \n     keep Hutus and Tutsis from each other's throats in Rwanda or \n     to separate antagonists in any of the several dozen other \n     places in the world where they insist on killing each other?\n       Good question, and one that never gets satisfactorily \n     answered in discussions with European supporters of NATO \n     expansion--and virtually every European of any standing or \n     influence seems to support bringing in Poland, Hungary and \n     the Czech Republic.\n       We have argued in the past--along with such foreign policy \n     eminences as Henry Kissinger--that expanding NATO is a bad \n     idea mainly because it would feed Russia's centuries-old \n     insecurity about having foreign powers along its western \n     border.\n       Certainly the West should not kowtow to Russia out of such \n     concern, but neither should it needlessly antagonize Moscow \n     and strengthen the anti-democratic crazies who use NATO \n     expansion to promote themselves.\n       In interviews last week with NATO and American officials in \n     Brussels, it was clear they believe they have disarmed the \n     Russia argument by the friendship and cooperation treaties \n     and consultations that have been concluded with Russia over \n     the last year.\n       That's all very nice, but it's not at all clear that this \n     era of good feeling is all that good or that it will outlast \n     the perpetually infirm Boris Yeltsin. Even if Russia is \n     currently no threat militarily, it's a good bet that it will \n     not always be so weak.\n       Leaving Russia aside, the question remains: Is it wise for \n     the U.S. to make a commitment so grave as that implicit in \n     expanding NATO?\n       It is not, and for an ironic reason: The more such promises \n     America makes, the less seriously, ultimately, they will be \n     taken, by those to whom they are made and those who might be \n     tempted to test them.\n       Even without a NATO commitment, the U.S. probably would \n     treat an attack on Warsaw as it would an attack on London or \n     Wausau. But even with a NATO commitment, would it do the same \n     for Bucharest or for Prague (where there seems to be a \n     resounding public indifference to NATO enlargement)?\n       The very fact that the question can be asked--and it is \n     asked by serious thinkers on this issue in Europe--suggests \n     that, instead of increasing security in Europe, NATO \n     expansion could weaken it.\n       Philippe Moreau Defarges, an expert with the French \n     Institute of International Relations, sums up this irony with \n     a French proverb that, translated, means. ``He who seeks to \n     kiss everyone, kisses badly.''\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, March 8, 1998]\n\n                          Quash NATO Expansion\n\n       The expansion of NATO is a policy in search of a \n     justification. The U.S. Senate should reject it.\n       The pivotal truth in the debate is this: NATO was created \n     as a defensive alliance to contain the spread of Soviet \n     communism in Europe. When the Soviet Union died, the reason \n     for NATO died with it. Expanding an alliance which lacks a \n     reason for being makes no sense.\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\n       If NATO had been redefined to meet a new threat or to serve \n     a new purpose, the addition of Poland, the Czech Republic and \n     Hungary to its membership might be logical. But that has not \n     occurred, except on a basis that is ill-defined and ad hoc.\n       If the new NATO is to be the policeman of Europe--a force \n     to keep ethnic bloodshed and civil war in check in the \n     Balkans, for example--that job can be accomplished without an \n     expanded membership. Exhibit A is Bosnia, where NATO has \n     taken the lead but where peacekeepers also have been drawn \n     from nations outside the alliance.\n       The Clinton administration argues that adding the three new \n     members will integrate them back into the West after five \n     decades of separation. But NATO expansion is not necessary to \n     bring the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians back into Europe's \n     embrace. They already are there by virtue of having \n     established democratic governments and market economies. \n     Indeed, their inclusion in the European Union would be a \n     surer sign of their return to the democratic European family.\n       The largest challenge for genuine European integration is \n     not the three nations invited to NATO membership but rather \n     Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union. \n     Enlarging NATO toward the Russian frontier complicates this \n     task, not because NATO threatens Russia or vice versa, but \n     because, psychologically, the expansion looks backward to \n     Cold War hostilities and suspicions.\n       The NATO expansionists charge that it is old Cold Warriors \n     who cannot grasp the vision of a new, larger alliance. In \n     fact, the opposite is true. It is those who are still \n     thinking in Cold War terms who would expand an alliance whose \n     purpose no longer exists.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Houston Chronicle, Apr. 6, 1998]\n\n   Arms Cash--Don't Let Weapons Dealers Unduly Affect NATO Expansion\n\n       Like any group or individual, arms makers have a right to \n     petition the government. But America's six biggest military \n     contractors have spent $51 million over the last two years \n     mainly to promote North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     expansion, and that raises concerns. As does the fact that 48 \n     companies whose primary business is weaponry have given $32.3 \n     million to candidates to advance their companies' causes, \n     including NATO expansion.\n       American arms manufacturers stand to gain billions in \n     weapons and other military equipment sales if the Senate \n     approves the inclusion of Poland, Hungary and the Czech \n     Republic in NATO. New alliance members will be required to \n     upgrade their militaries, and there is absolutely nothing \n     wrong with weapons makers getting this business.\n       However, it is vital that lawmakers not be blinded by \n     lobbyist cash to the importance of approving NATO's eastward \n     expansion only if NATO retains its focus on military matters \n     and if enlargement costs are shared equitably among member \n     nations. Also, the United States must continue to insist that \n     the new NATO-Russian Council has no real or implied ``veto'' \n     of alliance matters--a move that had been designed to make \n     the expansion more cooperative with and palatable to Russia.\n       These are important conditions, and they will continue to \n     be important as perhaps a dozen other countries come to be \n     considered for NATO membership. So however arms dealers' \n     enthusiasm might infect senators considering expansion, \n     lawmakers must keep their focus on maintaining NATO's \n     integrity.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would have more articles, but I believe \nthese are representative, geographically and philosophically, as to why \nwe should not be rushing to expand NATO.\n  I will close by saying that I will withdraw my amendment, but I \nwanted to lay it down as a marker. We are going to hear more about the \nNATO expansion treaty and what it will mean to the nonproliferation \ntreaty with our sharing of nuclear knowledge with these three \ncountries, all of whom, I might point out, are signatories to the NPT. \nI think therein lies a dilemma. To this Senator's way of thinking, I \nbelieve the NPT is more important to us and more important to the world \ncommunity than the expansion of NATO to include these three countries. \nAgain, as Barbara Tuchman said in ``The March of Folly,'' ``I believe \nwe are rushing into this without considering all of its ramifications, \nespecially with nonproliferation.''\n  So, Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take the time of the Senate to \nrespond to all the Senator said. We have rehashed a lot of those \nthings. I will just note that a 59-41 vote--I have been here a long \ntime and I never thought that was a close vote. But let me say with \nregard to only one point, because a lot is not rehashed and lacking \nconsequence, but we have debated it a lot. One point was raised that is \nnew, and I thought it would be raised by someone.\n  The Senator from Iowa has just repeated the oft-heard assertion that \nthe United States promised Gorbachev during negotiations on German \nunification that we would not expand NATO.\n  This is an important assertion. It is also historically incorrect.\n  Since opponents of NATO enlargement have taken to repeating this \nassertion as if it were true--most recently in a full-page \nadvertisement in the New York Times, which contained other striking \nfactual errors--I think it is imperative to set the record straight.\n  Both Robert Zoellick, a senior State Department and later White House \nofficial in the Bush Administration who drafted the famous ``Two-Plus-\nFour'' Agreement with the Russians in 1990, Eduard Shevardnadze, the \ncurrent President of Georgia who was then Soviet Foreign Minister, have \nboth made clear the no such promise was ever made.\n  There is nothing in the ``Two-Plus-Four'' Agreement about NATO \nexpansion.\n  There is no secret addendum to the ``Two-Plus-Four'' Agreement.\n  U.S. Secretary of State James Baker did make a comment ``not one step \nfurther east,'' which has been intentionally or unintentionally \nmisinterpreted as having precluded NATO enlargement.\n  In actuality, according to Mr. Zoellick, the drafter of the \nagreement, this remark was related to what would be the status of U.S. \nforces if a united Germany were part of NATO. That is, there would be \nno permanent stationing of American troops east of Germany, a position \nwhich did become official NATO policy as enunciated by the well-known \nstatement of the North Atlantic Council on March 14, 1997:\n\n       In the current and foreseeable security environment, the \n     alliance will carry out its collective defense and other \n     missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability, \n     integration and capability for reinforcement rather than by \n     additional permanent stationing of substantial combat forces.\n\n  In fact, with possible NATO enlargement in mind, Zoellick made sure \nthat the ``Two-Plus-Four'' Agreement did not foreclose the possibility \nof forces transiting Germany to reinforce Poland.\n  The September 12, 1990 Treaty precluded stationing NATO-integrated \nGerman forces on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic \n(i.e. East Germany) until after the withdrawal of Soviet forces. These \nagreements explicitly did not apply to the rest of Europe.\n  Any agreement on the future security arrangements of other European \ncountries would have been inappropriate, since such countries were not \npart of the talks.\n  Mr. President, lest anyone believe that this is one-sided American \nhistorical analysis, I would like to quote from an article in The \nReuter European Community Report of February 13, 1997 entitled ``West \nMade No Pledge to Moscow, NATO Told'':\n\n       Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze told NATO this week \n     that the West did not offer Moscow any guarantees about the \n     alliance's future during talks over German unification in \n     1990...\n       ...Shevardnadze's comments, made to NATO Secretary General \n     Javier Solana during a meeting in Tbilisi on Wednesday, \n     contradict Russian claims that NATO's enlargement plans \n     represent broken promises by the West.\n       Shevardnadze, who was Soviet foreign minister when Moscow \n     cut the deal in 1990 with Western powers opening the way for \n     unification, told Solana that the talks only concerned \n     Germany...\n       President Shevardnadze told the secretary general that \n     during those two-plus-four-talks, no guarantees had been \n     given concerning NATO enlargement...\n\n  Mr. President, the striking fact that the chief negotiators of German \nunification on both the Soviet and the American side have made \ncategorical denials that any assurances were given about NATO \nenlargement should lay this specious claim to rest.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, now we get two sides. It seems \nto me if there is a meeting with the Secretary of State--it was James \nBaker at the time--and Mr. Gorbachev and our Ambassador, there would \nhave been--there has been at every meeting I have been to--a memorandum \ncalled MEMCOMS were sent back to the State Department. I wonder if we \ncan produce the MEMCOMS so we can look at those and see what did \ntranspire.\n  Mr. BIDEN. You could ask them.\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Who?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The President, the State Department. My understanding is \nthat they are never released. I would be happy to have them released.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the committee ask for that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will not ask for it because we have never asked for a \nrelease for those purposes, other than affecting the outcome of a \nsignificant debate or an issue of national consequence.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is a pretty significant debate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is ex post facto now. I would be happy to talk with the \nSenator about it. The Senator doesn't need me to ask. You are standing \nnext to a chairman of a powerful committee. I am a mere ranking member \nof a Foreign Relations Committee. So I am sure if you get him to do it, \nhe may be able to get others to do it. I have learned, even when I was \na chairman, there was not much consequence to what I did and how I was \nviewed. Now, as a ranking member--we all know that ranking members are \npeople who have no power. So I would find a Republican to help you out. \nYou have a very fine one standing next to you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My experience in my years here is that the distinguished \nchairman of the committee has been very successful in getting documents \nand papers out of the State Department in the past. I would hope that \nthe committee would at least try to get these MEMCOMS so we can see \nwhat the facts are.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will say this much to the Senator. I will inquire \nformally whether or not MEMCOMS have ever been released to the \ncommittee. If they were, I would be happy to talk with the Senator \nabout how to get this released. It would be worthwhile knowing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want everybody to know I am not usurping \nthe prerogative of the chairman. He has asked me to do this. So I \nunderstand the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has an amendment, \nwhich I believe, after some negotiation with the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, we are likely to be able to accept. Is that \ncorrect, I say to my friend?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding is that there is one change in those two \nwords near the end. I think it ought to be accepted with that change.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know it hasn't been introduced yet. Colleagues are \nsaying: What is the deal? What is the schedule? I think we can \nfacilitate rapidly a very important amendment which could have had a \nlong debate in just a moment here. And then, as I understand it, the \nSenator from New Hampshire has an amendment and the junior Senator from \nOklahoma has an amendment. To the best of my knowledge, they are the \nonly remaining matters relating to this treaty, other than final \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2327\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself and \n     Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2327.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In subparagraph (C) of section 3(1) of the resolution, \n     strke clauses (ii) and (iii) and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n       (ii) An analysis of all potential threats to the North \n     Atlantic area (meaning the entire territory of all NATO \n     members) up to the year 2010, including the consideration of \n     a reconstituted conventional threat to Europe, emerging \n     capabilities of non-NATO countries to use nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons affecting the North Atlantic \n     area, and the emerging ballistic missile and cruise missile \n     threat affecting the North Atlantic area;\n       (iii) the identification of alternative system \n     architectures for the deployment of a NATO missile defense \n     for the entire territory of all NATO members that would be \n     capable of countering the threat posed by emerging ballistic \n     and cruise missile systems in countries other than declared \n     nuclear powers, as well as in countries that are existing \n     nuclear powers, together with timetables for development and \n     an estimate of costs;\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment that I send to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and also Senator Smith of New Hampshire basically says \nthat under the report that is required by the resolution of \nratification right now, the report says that we should have a study \nconsidering the cost of deployment of a NATO missile defense system for \nthe region of Europe. I think, frankly, it should apply to all NATO \ncountries.\n  That is the essence of the amendment. This is a NATO treaty. This is \na mutual defense treaty for all NATO countries. All NATO countries are \nsaying that they will come to one another's aid for the following \nreasons. If we are going to have a missile defense study for Europe, it \ncertainly should have a missile defense study for the United States and \nfor Canada.\n  That is the essence of my amendment. It is to make sure that we are \nnot just having a treaty just to defend Europe but it is also to defend \nthe United States and, of course, Canada, which I believe, as both the \nUnited States and Canada are instrumental and very important members of \nNATO, should not be denigrated and should not be put in a separate \ncategory or separate class.\n  I want to compliment my colleague from North Carolina for his \nleadership on this issue. He has done a very good job, as has the \nranking member.\n  I will tell my colleagues. It has been I think a proud week for the \nSenate. We have not had a partisan vote yet. We have had a very, very \nsignificant foreign policy debate. I compliment my colleague from \nVirginia and my colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, for raising \nsome very important issues.\n  Some people said, ``Well, the Senate hasn't considered this treaty. I \nwill tell my colleagues, I think a lot of it has addressed this treaty \npretty closely and even the committee reports. This is the committee \nreport section. A lot of times some of us don't read those things. I \nhappened to read this, or my staff brought it to my attention. I said, \n``Wait a minute. This doesn't make sense. We are going to correct \nthis.''\n  I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their \nwillingness to accept this amendment. But I think we have had some good \ndebates. I think it has been very positive for the Senate and also \npositive for the mutual defense of all NATO countries.\n  I thank my colleagues. I also want to thank my colleague from New \nHampshire for his leadership on this amendment as well.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the treaty before us not only promotes \nstability of Europe but also adds a measure of security to the United \nStates. It also promotes universal values for freedom and democracy.\n  The amendment before us simply broadens the language of a study that \nis already required in the resolution to include the other NATO \ncountries besides those in Europe.\n  I am one of those who is opposed to the commitment of a deployment of \na national missile defense system before we know costs, threats, \nimpacts on arms reduction, and technological feasibility. But this \namendment does not call for any commitment to the deployment of a \nnational missile defense; it simply broadens the geographical area of a \nstudy which is already provided for in the resolution.\n  I believe with that understanding and those two words that have been \nstricken, I understand, on line 6 of page 2, this amendment should be \nacceptable to all of us.\n  I thank my good friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to compliment my \ncolleague on his amendment. As chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee \non the Armed Forces Committee, this has long been an irritation and \nfrustration for many of us, the fact that we don't have a national \nmissile defense. As it is right now, you have a provision in the NATO \nresolution that would exclude a missile defense system for Canada and \nthe United States, and, in turn, having specifically mentioned Europe \nwould be just outrageous.\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\n  I think that the fact that the Senator has identified this and \nbrought this forward is a huge plus to this debate.\n  I also would like to lend my remarks in support of the remarks the \nSenator made about the caliber of the debate here. We have had, as the \nSenator said, no partisan debate but rather a very academic debate for \nseveral days now and one which I think is very, very important and I \nthink will have a profound impact on our future and perhaps the future \nof the world.\n  I know people, as we get down to the latter part of the time here, \nget a little upset with planes to catch and so forth. But this is a \nvery, very important debate. Votes have been changing in the past \nseveral days. In one case somebody told me they were absolutely in \nfavor and are now opposed.\n  I think we are moving in the right direction. Even though this may \nseem dilatory, I am very much pleased with the debate and where we are.\n  I again want to say on this amendment that it is extremely important \nto identify and not to have this separation. To say in the NATO \nresolution that we would have Europe protected and not the United \nStates and Canada just wouldn't work.\n\n  Let me just make a couple more points.\n  The President's plan, as we know, does not cover all of the United \nStates. A plan for a missile defense system would comply with the ABM \nTreaty and, as required by the treaty, would be based out as a single \nsite. The evidence available shows the areas that the President's ABM \nTreaty compliance system would protect in the event of a ballistic \nmissile attack. As one can clearly understand, Alaska and Hawaii are \nleft vulnerable to a ballistic missile attack under the President's \nplan.\n  There are a whole number of other factors, which I will not go into \nat this point other than to simply say that I am very strongly in \nsupport of this relatively minor change in terms of semantics and \nwords. But a couple of words, where you change the word ``Europe'' and \nadd ``Europe and the rest of NATO,'' that is very, very important and \nsends a very, very strong signal.\n  Again, I strongly support the amendment, and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, the Nickles \namendment No. 2327.\n  The amendment (No. 2327) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what is the regular order? Are we \npermitted to speak at this point, or are there only amendments in \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that I be permitted to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, it was many days ago, \nit seems to me, that I spoke on this treaty. We have been on it for 4 \ndays. I accepted the invitation to speak early on, like the leadership \nsuggested. All this time has passed. Tonight, as we choose to do \nsomething rather historic, which I have no doubts about it in my mind \nand I believe it will be proper and I believe America will be very \nproud that we enlarge NATO tonight, all of the ominous predictions I \nbelieve will not happen and we will just have laid out another great \nbig giant American stake for freedom, prosperity, and democracy.\n  I believe that is the way it is going to work.\n  I was most impressed as I studied this and met with different people \nin my office. I met with the Ambassador of Hungary, Gyorgy Banlaki. He \nwas in my office visiting. My reason for being overwhelmingly in favor \nof this is what he said to me in the office. Let me quote it. It is \nvery simple. It is two sentences.\n\n       The people of my country would like to be able to choose \n     our own allies. We would like to enjoy all those things that \n     history has denied us.\n\n  A few days ago I was here to say this is the Senate's chance to make \nthe hopes of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic come true. Let \nthem choose their own allies, for they have been denied that in the \npast. They have been denied the right to choose their own allies. We \nall know that part of history. In fact, they have been forced to choose \ntheir allies and to be part of their international arrangement, which \nwas not for peace, as it turned out, but for nothing but troubles for \nthe world and for these countries. We all know that.\n  I believe what we are doing tonight is typically American. We are \nsaying to the three countries that were denied freedom and denied the \nright to choose their allies that we are glad that you are choosing the \nallied group that we are part of, and we are glad to have you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, I \nplan to speak for about 11 or 12 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, NATO has been the foundation of European \nsecurity since its creation in 1949, containing the Soviet Union for \nmore than forty years and providing security to Western Europe. With \nthe dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1989, and the breakup of the \nSoviet Union in 1991, NATO now stands as possibly the most successful \nalliance in history. Since that time, however, the Alliance has been \nforced to consider the continued relevance and future of NATO, and the \nUnited States has reviewed its role in Europe.\n  Since 1995, when the Alliance announced its intentions to enlarge \nNATO, the Armed Services Committee in particular, and the Senate in \ngeneral, have conducted numerous hearings on enlarging the Alliance.\n  On February 27, the Committee forwarded its views on NATO enlargement \nto the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Those views are incorporated \nin the Executive Report of the Committee, which is before members of \nthe Senate, along with the resolution of ratification.\n  During the Armed Services Committee's review of NATO enlargement, the \nfollowing concerns were raised: the cost of enlarging the alliance; \nadapting NATO to the post-Cold War strategic environment; and, NATO \nrelations with Russia.\n  Defense spending has declined steadily since 1985, from $423 billion \nto $257 billion--the amount of the defense budget request for fiscal \nyear 1999. Because of the increasing scarcity of defense funds, the \nCommittee focused extensively on the issue of costs, as the majority of \nthe funding for the NATO budget is requested through the defense \nbudget.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of enlarging the \nNATO to be as high as $125 billion over a fifteen year period, while \nthe NATO Military Committee estimated the cost of enlarging NATO to be \n$1.5 billion over ten years. I remind my colleagues that the \ndifferences in the cost contained in the four estimates are primarily \ndue to differing views on the threat, current and future military \nrequirements of NATO forces, the condition of infrastructure and \nfacilities in the prospective new member countries, and the activities \nidentified by NATO as eligible for NATO funding.\n  Concerns were also raised about the willingness and commitment of \ncurrent NATO members to bear their share of enlargement costs, as well \nas to continue to develop and modernize their military forces to defend \ntheir national borders and fulfill their Article V collective defense \nobligations as well.\n  Cost estimates developed by the Department of Defense for U.S. \nparticipation in the NATO operation in Bosnia raise concerns about the \nvalidity of cost estimates. In December 1995, the Secretary of Defense \ntestified to the Committee that the cost of deploying U.S. forces to \nBosnia for one year to implement the Dayton Agreement would be $1.5 \nbillion, and additional $500 million to provide logistical support. \nBefore the year was over, the Committee was advised that the cost of \ndeploying U.S. forces to Bosnia had increased to $3.0 billion. Mr. \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nyou are aware that the cost of deploying U.S. forces to Bosnia over the \npast three years is now approaching $10 billion. We may once again be \ndiscussing the need for funds for Bosnia, as there are no funds \navailable now in the budget resolution for the continued deployment of \nU.S. forces in Bosnia in fiscal year 1999.\n  The Senate has been assured by the foreign and defense ministers of \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic that they will live up to their \nfinancial commitments. Our current allies have likewise given us the \nsame assurances. If they fail to do so, the Senate can revisit the \nissue of burden sharing. Likewise, if the new NATO members, or current \nallies, do not live up to their financial obligations, I would expect \nthe Administration to take appropriate action in the NATO military \ncommittee to revise the amount of the U.S. contribution.\n  With regard to adapting NATO to a new strategic environment, the \ncommittee was very clear on its position that collective defense should \nremain the primary mission of NATO, and recommended in its letter to \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, that the resolution of ratification \ninclude an understanding to that effect. Regardless of changes in the \n1991 Strategic Concept of NATO's mission restructuring it to deal with \npotential new challenges of out of area operations and to support \npeacekeeping and peace enforcement operation, first and foremost, NATO \nis a military alliance. NATO must remain militarily strong in order to \nexecute its Article V obligations.\n  I understand that the NATO Policy Coordinating Group has developed \nsuggested revisions to the 1991 Strategic Concept, which were \ncirculated to Allies in late January. I also understand that the \nprocess in NATO for changes to be made to its strategic concept will \ntake over a year. I believe it is important that the Senate be advised \nof any recommended revisions to the Strategic Concept, before the \nUnited States agrees to them. In particular, I believe it is important \nthat the Senate be advised of any recommendations to change or dilute \nthe core mission of the Alliance, revisions that would affect the \ndistribution of forces in peacetime and redeployment capabilities, any \nrecommendations to further enlarge the Alliance, and revisions that \nwould affect the strategic balance in Europe.\n\n  As I stated earlier, since the dissolution of the Warsaw pact and the \nSoviet Union, many Americans wonder why we need NATO at all, much less \nan enlarged NATO with expanded security obligations. Skepticism about \nNATO's continued value is at least as widespread as support for an \nenlarged NATO. Frankly, I do not believe that the Administration has \nmade the case to the public, or the Congress on why NATO should be \nenlarged, and why the United States should remain engaged in Europe. As \na consequence, I worry that the lack of public support will result in a \nweak domestic political foundation, where the United States will find \nit difficult to maintain an expanded commitment in a future crisis.\n  We need to think about NATO enlargement in relation to national \ninterests of the United States and our global strategy, and not just \nnarrow political, organizational or even vital security interests. I \nbelieve NATO is still vital to U.S. interests. However, all Americans \nmust first understand the magnitude of the commitment we are \nundertaking, and why it should be made.\n  I support a renewed and enlarged NATO because it ensures a U.S. \ninvolvement in the European community, and a ``seat at the table'' to \nthe world's most vital, productive region. Quite simply, the U.S. has \nclear, abiding and vital interests in Europe. Europe is the soil where \nour deepest roots run. We are bound to Europe by innumerable links of \ntrade, finance, communications, and technology exchange; ties of \nhistory, culture and shared values, and nearly five decades of mutual \nsecurity arrangements.\n  A free and stable Europe has always been essential to the United \nStates. In this century we have intervened in two bloody world wars to \nprevent the domination of Europe by aggressive dictatorships. We paid a \nhigh price for forty-five years of Cold War to prevent the domination \nof Europe and the Eurasian landmass by Communist imperialism. This long \nU.S. involvement and stabilizing presence have made the United States \nin effect a European power.\n  I do not believe Europe can remain stable and prosperous, to the \nmutual benefit of the United States and our European allies, if its \npost-Cold War boundary is drawn along the borders of Germany and \nAustria. Such an artificial division would leave a power vacuum in each \ncentral Europe, and consign millions of people who share our democratic \nvalues and aspirations to an uncertain fate. I do not believe a new \nEuropean security framework will hold up unless it reflects the \nrealities of the political upheaval that marked the end of the Soviet \nUnion and the Warsaw Pact. The new strategic environment includes the \nreorienting of former East Bloc states toward the West.\n  Some have said that the end of the Cold War spelled the ``end of \nhistory.'' I believe we are seeing the opposite. The end of the \nconfrontation between the Soviet Empire and the Free World has \nunleashed historical forces suppressed for forty-five years. Nations \nand peoples are reverting to their patterns of the past.\n  One of those patterns of the past is Russian imperialism. Czarist \nRussia was an expansionist, aggressive regional power long before the \nBolshevik Revolution. Although there is no longer a Soviet Union, \nRussia is still a great power--if no longer a super power--and is \nexerting its will in the so-called ``Near Abroad''. The brutal \nsuppression of the revolt in Chechnya and Russia's intervention in \nGeorgia, Azerbaijian and Moldova are worrisome examples.\n  America's primary national security goal in Europe should be to \nensure that Russia makes the transition to a stable, free-market and \ndemocratic nation, but especially one that remains within its borders. \nDemocracies do not make war on their neighbors. We should do everything \nwithin reason to help Russia's transition to democracy, to maintain \nwarm and friendly relations, and to avoid unnecessary provocations. \nLikewise, Russia should take the hard steps required to transition to a \nstable, free-market and democratic nation. However, we cannot afford to \nlet Russia's opposition decide the course of NATO enlargement.\n  In taking steps to assist Russia to transition to a stable and \ndemocratic nation, both the United States and NATO have established \nprograms to reach out to, and cooperate with, Russia. With regard to \nNATO, just prior to the Madrid Summit, President Yeltsin, President \nClinton, and NATO leaders signed the NATO-Russia Founding Act. This Act \nestablished a forum in which Russia can consult with NATO on issues of \nmutual interest, called the Permanent Joint Council. The United States \nhas established programs in the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy to assist Russia in controlling its strategic \narsenal, and to meet its arms control commitments.\n\n  The committee did, however, point out in its letter to the Foreign \nRelations Committee its view that activities in the Permanent Joint \nCouncil should not distract NATO from its core function. Again, while I \nbelieve we should take steps to aid Russia in transitioning away from \nits communist and imperialist past, I do not believe the Permanent \nJoint Council should be allowed to be used by Russia to participate in \nNATO matters, not used as a platform to divide the Alliance, or \ndenounce U.S. policy.\n  The Clinton administration's policy toward Russia places all its \nstakes on the fate of Boris Yeltsin, and it does not appear to be \nhaving the desired effect. Moreover, the Administration's Russia-\ncentered policy has caused us to neglect building solid relations with \nUkraine and other former Soviet states. This also does not serve our \ngoal. In fact, the policy of giving such sustained preferential \ntreatment to Russia, and depending too much on President Yeltsin is the \nmost destabilizing factor in Eastern Europe.\n  We have to face the very real possibility that our policies may not \nsucceed. Russia may not make the transition to a stable, democratic \nnation, nor one content to remain within its borders. In fact, an \nunstable Russia, torn by factions and internal strife, may not even be \nable to agree where its natural borders lie.\n  The greatest potential threat to peace, stability, and security in \nEurope\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\nis the return to power of Russian hard-liners. President Yeltsin's \npopularity has sunk so low--that since his illness and heart \noperation--there is almost no yardstick against which to measure.\n  The United States and its allies need to look seriously at bringing \ninto NATO the states of the East and Central Europe which share our \ndemocratic values, and which are able to assume mutual security \nobligations inherent in the Alliance. Only a strong NATO that includes \nthose states can keep a future, resurgent Russia contained and \ndeterred.\n  There are other reasons to expand membership of NATO, for example, \nthe lessening of international tensions between members, and \nfacilitating the resolution of conflicts. But we must not lose sight of \nthe fact that NATO has been successful because it was a defensive \nalliance. Turning it into something else could fatally weaken it. \nUnless we understand that NATO's underlying and abiding purpose remains \nto defend Europe, the burdens of the Alliance over time will cause NATO \nto crumble.\n  As a great maritime power and trading nation, America has intervened \nall over the globe to protect freedom of the seas and our vital \ninterests, from the earliest days of our existence as a nation. Over \ntime we formed strong alliance to protect mutual interests, \ndemonstrating that free democratic nations acting collectively, can \nsurvive the threat of tyranny. These kinds of alliances, the kind \nrepresented by NATO, with allies who share our democratic values, \nshould be the cornerstone of our foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, I believe Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic share \nour values, and have worked hard to transition toward democratic \nnations and stabilize their economies. They have shown their \nwillingness to act collectively with the United States by contributing \nforces to the coalition during the Persian Gulf War, and more recently, \nby sending military forces to work with NATO in Bosnia. Equally \nimportant to me, they have demonstrated their support for the United \nStates during the most recent crisis with Iraq. They represent the type \nof nations which are deserving of membership in NATO, and I believe \nwill be allies which the United States can look to in the future for \nsupport in areas of mutual defense and foreign policy interest.\n  The Senate will have to vote on behalf of the American people by a \ntwo-thirds majority to ratify the admittance of any new country to \nNATO. I do not want to see the Senate become an obstacle to progress \ntoward the Nation's national security interests. For the reasons that I \nhave outlined, I will vote to support NATO enlargement.\n\n\n   the alleged ``new threat to russia's borders'' by nato enlargement\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from New York has asserted \nseveral times that NATO's enlargement to include Poland would for the \nfirst time bring NATO up to Russia's borders. This is because Poland \nshares a small border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.\n  As I mentioned in our floor debate last month, the Senator's \nassertion is factually incorrect. Ever since the founding of NATO in \n1949, Russia--first as the Russian Republic in the Soviet Union, then \nsince 1991 as the Russian Federation--has shared a border with Norway, \na charter member of NATO.\n  Norway's relations with Russia have remained excellent throughout. In \nfact, Norway gives Russia foreign aid, as do many other NATO members, \nthe United States included.\n  The Senator from New York responded by minimizing both the size and \nimportance of the Russian-Norwegian border. Here again, he was \nincorrect.\n  First, in regard to length, the Russian-Norwegian border is nearly as \nlong as Poland's border with the Kaliningrad exclave--104 miles versus \n128 miles, to be exact.\n  Second, militarily speaking the Russian-Norwegian border is much more \nimportant than the Polish-Kaliningrad border. Norway abuts Russia's \nKola Peninsula, one of the most heavily militarized regions on earth. \nAmong the Kola Peninsula's armaments are nuclear weapons.\n  In spite of the strategically sensitive nature of the NATO-Russian \nborder, for nearly half-a-century relations have remained very good.\n  One might ask why. Aside from the tact and diplomacy of the \nNorwegians, another reason may be that NATO has not permanently \nstationed in Norway troops from other Alliance countries.\n  Mr. President, this is precisely what NATO declared on March 14, 1997 \nas the Alliance's policy for the prospective new members. So let's \ndispose of this bogey-man: Russia will not have to worry about large \nnumbers of permanently stationed non-Polish NATO troops facing \nKaliningrad.\n  I would like to return to geography for a few minutes, since the \nSenator from New York and the Senator from Virginia have brought this \ntopic up several times.\n  I think that they would agree that in the bad, old Soviet Union the \nnon-Russian Republics were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Moscow. Ethnic \nRussians who took their orders directly from the Kremlin filled the key \npositions in the Republics' political, economic, and military \nstructures.\n  In that context, it is important to note that since Turkey entered \nNATO in 1952, the Alliance had a common border with Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, and Georgia--at that time Russian-ruled parts of the old \nSoviet Union.\n  For the record, that border was considerably longer than either the \nRussian-Norwegian or the Polish-Kaliningrad borders--328 miles long, to \nbe exact.\n  So for nearly forty years, NATO had a lengthy border with the \nstrategically vital southwestern flank of the Russian-ruled Soviet \nUnion.\n  In fact, Mr. President, even today there are Russian troops stationed \nin the independent states of Armenia and Georgia.\n  So, once again, let's finally put to rest the nonsensical argument \nthat Poland's joining NATO would constitute a new geographic move by \nNATO up to Russia's borders. It just isn't true.\n\n\n            alleged aggressive posture of nato toward russia\n\n  Moreover, the opponents of enlargement, the Senator from New York \nincluded, have asserted that by enlarging to include Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic, NATO will be assuming a militarily aggressive \nposture toward Russia.\n  Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. NATO simply \ndoes not threaten Russia. Never did--never will.\n  Critics often characterize NATO's enlargement as if it were a massive \ndeployment toward Russia. In reality, NATO's entire evolution since the \nend of the Cold War has been in the other direction, a fact which is \npatently clear to Moscow.\n  Since 1991, NATO countries have greatly substantially reduced their \nmilitary forces, as measured by total spending, spending as a \nproportion of GDP, and by overall force levels.\n  American troop levels in Europe have declined by over two-thirds, \ndown from a peak of over 300,000 to about 100,000 today.\n  NATO's forces during this period have moved away from Moscow, not \ntoward it, as the Alliance abandoned its Cold War doctrine of forward, \nstationary defenses and relied instead on rapid reaction.\n  These changes have made NATO's posture unambiguously less threatening \nto Russia. The Alliance's enlargement does not appreciably change this \nfact.\n  Those who characterize NATO's enlargement as a movement of NATO power \ninto Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are simply wrong, and they \ndo the public a grave disservice by suggesting this is the case.\n  The record has been clear for well over a year that this is not what \nenlargement means. In December 1996, the Alliance declared that it had \n``no intention, no plan, and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the \nterritory of new members,'' and has clarified that this statement \nsubsumes nuclear weapon storage sites.\n  I have already cited the March 1997 statement regarding no need to \nmove combat troops into the territory of the new members.\n  Moreover, the willingness of all Allies to negotiate adaptations to \nthe Treaty on Conventional Force in Europe (CFE) is a clear signal to \nMoscow that NATO seeks a post-Cold War arms build-down, not a build up.\n\n\n                     nato's reaching out to moscow\n\n  NATO enlargement to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic,\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nin the real world--not the rhetorical world--will not trigger an \nadverse Russian reaction. Why? Because the U.S. and our allies have \ntaken so many steps to reach out to Russia since the end of the Cold \nWar.\n  As I mentioned in my opening statement on Monday, the critics of \nenlargement are guilty of what might be called the ``Weimar Fallacy.'' \nThey suggest that Russians will see NATO enlargement as post-Cold War \npunishment, which will trigger a nationalist backlash in the same way \nthat the Treaty of Versailles helped to trigger the rise of National \nSocialism in Germany.\n  But the supposed parallel is utterly specious. The Treaty of \nVersailles forced Germany to pay billions in reparation to the victors \nof World War I. by contrast, we and our allies imposed no reparations \non Moscow after the Cold War.\n  On the contrary, reparations went in the other direction. We and our \nallies have provided Moscow with over $100 billion since 1991 to aid \nits political and economic reform.\n  One of the most important forms of aid has been through the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program--known popularly as the Nunn-Lugar \nProgram--which has provided $2.3 billion to Russia and other former \nSoviet states since 1992, with $442 million requested for FY99.\n  Today, this program is supporting the annual elimination of over 20 \nRussian SS-18s and 10 SSBNs. The Russians have proposed using the \nprogram to support processing of missile materials from dismantled \nRussian warheads for storage at the Mayak facility.\n  Through this program, we are helping to finance efforts that make \nboth our countries safer--not punishing the Russians at their own \nexpense.\n  The spurious comparison to Weimar Germany is also a fallacy because \nwe and our allies have sought to integrate Russia into the \ntransatlantic community, not isolate it.\n  In 1991, we made Russia and the other former Soviet states part of \nNATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and part of the Euro-\nAtlantic Partnership Council, the successor to the NACC, in 1997. In \n1994, we made Russia and the other newly independent states part of the \nPartnership for Peace program.\n  After the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, NATO invited Russia to \nparticipate in the coalition in Bosnia, and today Russia has an \nairborne brigade of approximately 1,400 troops servicing in northern \nBosnia under NATO command alongside American and other NATO forces.\n  In May 1997, President Yeltsin joined President Clinton and the other \nNATO leaders in signing the NATO-Russia Founding Act. The Permanent \nJoint Council has met several times at the ministerial level since \nthen, and proved a useful forum for discussions with Russia on security \nissues of mutual concern.\n  Our efforts to reach out to Russia go well beyond NATO. In March \n1997, at their summit in Helsinki, President Clinton told President \nYeltsin that the U.S. would support Russia efforts to join the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO).\n  In May 1997, President Yeltsin joined G-7 leaders in Denver to \ninaugurate the ``summit of the Eight.'' The ``Gore-Chernomyrdin \nCommission'' continued to meet during the very period that NATO was \npursuing its enlargement, and American cooperation with Russia \ncontinues on a wide range of cultural, scientific, technological, and \nenvironmental efforts, such as our continuing efforts in space.\n\n\n                       Russia's Nuclear Doctrine\n\n  The Senator from new York in a recent speech in Texas warned darkly \nthat NATO enlargement might lead to nuclear war. With all due respect \nto my good friend, I think his assertion is incorrect and alarmist.\n  He and other opponents of NATO enlargement have underscored Russia's \ndisproportionate reliance on its nuclear forces, sometimes even \nresorting to scare tactics.\n  It is well known that the dissolution of the Soviet empire and \nRussia's transition to a market economy required jolting changes within \nRussia. Since 1990 Russia's economy has contracted by perhaps 40 \npercent and has only recently established and shown the first signs of \nrecovery.\n  Partly as a result, Russian military spending contracted \nsubstantially. Russia's number of combat-ready divisions has also \ndeclined.\n  Beyond these measures, non-payment of wages and other factors have \ndampened morale among officers and enlisted personnel. The war in \nChechnya showed the cumulative toll on Russia's forces.\n  Given this decline in Russia's conventional forces, it is \nunderstandable that Russia has apparently placed a heavier reliance on \nnuclear weapons. But this change became evident as early as 1992, when \nRussia declared that it would no longer abide by its previous policy of \n``no first use'' of nuclear weapons.\n  There are many signs that ``no first use'' had been more of a \npropaganda tool than an actual reflection of Soviet policy, but the \ndeclared abandonment of this policy was significant. The move away from \n``no first use'' gained a higher profile when it began to be discussed \nin public in 1997.\n  The Senator from New York and other proponents of NATO enlargement \nhave recently charged that this increased reliance on nuclear forces \nwas a consequence of Russia's fear of NATO's enlargement. This analysis \nis simply not credible.\n  First, as noted earlier, NATO's enlargement results in no significant \nincrease in NATO's military capability relative to Russia.\n  Second, it is hardly likely that NATO's enlargement, begun in 1994, \ncould have triggered a change in Russian policy that began in 1992. The \nfact is that opponents of NATO enlargement have constructed this \nargument retroactively.\n  The same is true for those who have attributed delays in Duma \nratification of START II to NATO enlargement. Well before NATO \nenlargement was proposed, Duma critics of START II based their \nopposition on other arguments, from the cost of compliance with START \nII to the loss of national pride.\n  NATO enlargement became another useful argument for confirmed \nopponents, but hardly the cause of their opposition.\n  In any case, the Russian government is now moving to push \nratification of START II through the Duma, perhaps by the end of June--\nanother sign that NATO enlargement is no impediment to constructive \nrelations with Russia or progress on arms control.\n  So, I would sum up by reminding my friend, the Senator from New York, \nof four key facts:\n  First, Poland's accession to NATO will not be creating a \ngeographically new move of the Alliance to Russia's borders. It has had \na strategically important border with Russia in the north for nearly \nfifty years, plus one in the south with Russian-ruled territory.\n  Second, there is absolutely no comparison with the allies' \ntrimuphalist behavior toward defeated Germany after World War One and \nthe reaching out of the United States and its NATO partners to Russia \nafter it lost the Cold War.\n  Third, NATO has conclusively demonstrated through its movements of \ntroops and equipment away from Russia's borders, and by concluding and \ncarrying out significant arms control agreements, that it in no way \nthreatens Russia.\n  Finally, it is completely false--even irresponsible--to assert that \nNATO enlargement is driving the world toward nuclear war. Cooperation, \nnot confrontation is occurring on many fronts.\n  Russia need have no fear from NATO enlargement.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe NATO expansion is in the best \ninterest of the United States. Also, expanding NATO will be in the \ninterest of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary and for that \nmatter--world peace.\n  The United States' security is intrinsically tied to the security of \nall of Europe. An enlarged NATO will only extend the influence of peace \nand prosperity to these three deserving countries. Also, as Poland, the \nCzech Republic, and Hungary continue to grow and flourish, their \nacceptance into the NATO Alliance will only further integrate Western \nvalues and will lock in the practices of democracy. Locking democracy \ninto this region is in the\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nUnited States interest and we should never shirk from our \nresponsibility and duty to see that democracy is spread throughout the \nworld.\n  While many foreign policy issues don't make the headlines and gather \npress, I do want to add to the record three opinion editorials from a \nfew Colorado newspapers. I ask unanimous consent that an April 21st, \n1998 editorial from the Daily Sentinel, a paper from Grand Junction \nColorado, an April 28th, 1998 editorial from the Denver Post, and an \nApril 5th, 1998 editorial from the Rocky Mountain News be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Let me highlight a few comments from these editorials.\n  The Daily Sentinel writes,\n\n       Adding Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to NATO \n     rewards three countries for their efforts against communism \n     during the Cold War. More importantly, expanding the western \n     alliance to include the three former Soviet bloc captive \n     nations not only is in the best interests of NATO and the \n     United States, but it unequivocally proclaims to the rest of \n     the world that the fate of Central Europe will no longer be \n     in the hands of whatever despots come along, be they Nazis, \n     Communists or something else.\n\n  The Denver Post states,\n\n       The Post believes adding these three nations will \n     contribute to stability in Eastern Europe and thus to world \n     peace. . . . Any student of the 20th century has to admire \n     the freedom-loving spirit displayed by the Hungarians, Poles, \n     and Czechs, often against great odds. . . . their current \n     governments are stable and they are worthy partners of NATO.\n\n  Lastly, from the Rocky Mountain News,\n\n       NATO enlargement is the Western world's way to show that \n     the Cold War is over and that we welcome these countries to \n     freedom. The new threats we face can only be met by forming \n     new alliance to ensure that these democracies do not fall \n     prey to nationalistic or terrorist regimes. The Czech \n     Republic, Poland, and Hungary know life without freedom and \n     now deserve freedom and security that only NATO can provide.\n\n  For me this sums up many of the reasons why I believe adding these \nthree countries to NATO will strengthen, stabilize, and promote peace \nfor the United States and Europe. I urge my colleagues to support this \nNATO expansion.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Daily Sentinel, Apr. 21, 1998]\n\n                  Congress Should OK Expansion of NATO\n\n       Sometime very soon, perhaps by the end of the week, the \n     Senate will vote on whether to ratify a treaty that would \n     allow Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join NATO. It \n     should vote decisively to allow the expansion.\n       Much has been said about the fact that the expansion will \n     offend Russia because it will appear that NATO is expanding \n     to the Russian doorstep. Clinton administration officials \n     attempting to defuse that argument have declared that NATO is \n     a peaceful alliance ``not arrayed against Russia'' or anyone \n     else.\n       Such statements are, of course, necessary to deal with \n     global politics. And they are misleading. NATO's purpose is \n     to protect its western European members and the United States \n     against outside aggression, including the possibility of a \n     reawakened Russian bear decades down the road.\n       It's true that the Cold War is over but it's equally true \n     that NATO was founded primarily to stem the expansionist \n     proclivities of Soviet Russia.\n       Moreover, the three nations in question all challenged \n     Soviet domination during that period, and each paid a heavy \n     price in some form of Soviet retaliation--Hungary during the \n     1950s, Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and Poland in the 1980s. \n     In discussing the NATO expansion, few people note that \n     rejecting the membership of these three countries would be an \n     even greater offense to them than their inclusion in NATO \n     would be to Russia.\n       Additionally, while Russia is no longer communist, there is \n     still reason to be suspicious of its expansionist tendencies \n     which have gone on almost continuously since the days of \n     Peter the Great. Two of the leading candidates to succeed \n     Boris Yeltsin as president are nationalists who have hinted \n     at trying to reassert Russian control over some of the old \n     Soviet states which are now independent nations.\n       Adding Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to NATO \n     rewards three countries for their efforts against communism \n     during the Cold War. More importantly, expanding the western \n     alliance to include the three former Soviet bloc captive \n     nations not only is in the best interests of NATO and the \n     United States, but it unequivocally proclaims to the rest of \n     the world that the fate of Central Europe will no longer be \n     in the hands of whatever despots come along, be they Nazis, \n     Communists or something else.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Apr. 28, 1998.]\n\n                          Admit 3 More to NATO\n\n       The North Atlantic Treaty Organization may well be \n     history's most successful military alliance. Since its \n     formation in the early days of the Cold War, not one square \n     inch of any member country has been lost to external \n     aggression. That record has not been lost on nations that \n     were once members of the rival Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.\n       This week, the U.S. Senate will vote on whether to admit \n     three of those former rivals--Hungary, Poland and the Czech \n     Republic--to NATO. The Post believes adding these three \n     nations will contribute to stability in Eastern Europe and \n     thus to world peace. But we would urge the administration and \n     Senate to be extremely cautious about any more applicants, \n     some of whom seem likely to embroil NATO in their domestic \n     difficulties.\n       Any student of the 20th century has to admire the freedom-\n     loving spirit displayed by the Hungarians, Poles and Czechs, \n     often against great odds. The 1956 Hungarian revolution, the \n     1968 Prague Spring and the rise of Solidarity in Poland bore \n     eloquent witness to the ideals of their peoples. Their \n     current governments are stable and they are worthy partners \n     of NATO.\n       The Clinton administration has wisely stated it has ``no \n     reason, no intention and no plan'' to station nuclear weapons \n     in the new member states. Added to NATO but left in a \n     nuclear-free condition, the Czech Republic, Poland and \n     Hungary should be able to resume their historic role as a \n     buffer zone between Germany and Russia and should thus be a \n     stabilizing influence in Eastern Europe.\n       Beyond those three candidates, however, NATO should be very \n     wary about further expansion. Already Romania, Slovenia, \n     Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are eyeing admission and \n     Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Slovakia are waiting in ther \n     wings.\n       Some of these nations (Slovenia, Macedonia) are relatively \n     new with little experience at democracy. Others, like Romania \n     and Albania, had long histories of dictatorship alternating \n     with instability. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are \n     democratic and stable, but their location between Russia and \n     the Baltic Sea makes them all but indefensible by nonnuclear \n     means. Admitting Ukraine, Belarus or other former Soviet \n     republics would be provocative to Russia.\n       In short, we support admission of Hungary, Poland and the \n     Czech Republic to NATO. But there needs to be a great deal of \n     thought, discussion and diplomacy before any more invitations \n     are issued to join this exclusive club.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, Apr. 5, 1998]\n\nShould NATO Grow?--Enlargement of Alliance Will Truly Signal the End of \n                              the Cold War\n\n                       (By Senator Wayne Allard)\n\n       The Cold war is over and many have argued that we can now \n     begin to dismantle our defenses and look inward. I believe \n     Secretary of State Albright said it best when testifying \n     before the Armed Services Committee on April 23, 1997, ``[I]f \n     you don't see smoke, that is no reason to stop paying for \n     fire insurance.''\n       The United States nor the world face the imminent threat of \n     the Soviet Union, but this is no time to relax. United \n     States' interests are still threatened by local conflicts; \n     internal political and economic instability; the reemergence \n     of ethnic, religious, and other historic grievances; \n     terrorism; and the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and \n     chemical weapons.\n       Soon, the U.S. Senate will debate and vote on the \n     invitation of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Just because we \n     are in a time of relative peace, we can not stop from being \n     engaged in a fight for peace and freedom. I believe expanding \n     NATO is the best way to ensure peace and stability.\n       First, NATO is and has always been a force for peace and \n     prosperity. Enlarging NATO will only enhance the U.S. and \n     European security and stability. Throughout our history, the \n     U.S. has been closely linked to the stability of Europe, and \n     that has not changed. The U.S. has been through two World \n     Wars and a Cold War in Europe. However, since NATO was \n     formed, not one major war or aggression has occurred against \n     or between member states (except for Argentina's invasion of \n     the British Falkland Island).\n       An enlarged NATO can do for all of Europe what it has done \n     in Western Europe by strengthening the emerging democracies, \n     creating conditions for continued prosperity, preventing \n     local rivalries, diminishing the race for arms buildups and \n     destabilizing nationalistic policies, and fostering common \n     security interests. Enlargement will truly signal the end of \n     the Cold War by no longer validating the old Stalinistic \n     lines but will secure the historic gains of democracy in \n     Central Europe.\n       Second, enlargement of NATO will further the integration of \n     Western values into Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. \n     Their invitation and movement into NATO will lock in Central \n     Europe's practices of democracy. Enlargement will promote \n     American-led multinational defense structures and prevent the \n     renationalization of these democracies. As enlarged NATO will \n     fill the security vacuum created with the fall of the Soviet \n     Union, subduing fear that the area will begin to divide \n     nationalistically and begin to look like the former \n     Yugoslavia.\n       However, just the possibility of membership into NATO has \n     given these countries the incentive to peacefully resolve \n     their border disputes. Since 1991, we have seen 10\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\n     major accords settling these differences and much of this is \n     credited to the opportunity to join NATO. Even if old \n     disputes resurface, NATO membership will help keep the peace, \n     just as NATO has done in relation to the problems between \n     NATO members Greece and Turkey.\n       Third, there has been concern about the Russian response to \n     NATO enlargement. Russian leaders have expressed their \n     dislike of NATO enlargement, in part due to the misperception \n     that the Alliance poses a threat to Russia's security. NATO \n     is not, and never has been an offensive Alliance, but one of \n     defensive purposes only. We must respect the Russian \n     concerns, but as my predecessor Senator Hank Brown has \n     written, ``[W]orking closely with Russia in an attempt to \n     allay their concerns makes sense. slowing or altering NATO \n     expansion * * * hands the Russian government a veto pen.'' \n     This would be a tragic mistake.\n       An enlarged and strengthened NATO promotes security and \n     stability in an area of Europe that is vital to Russian \n     security. The invited states must clearly know that they are \n     no longer considered Russian ``eastern bloc nations'' but an \n     integral part of the circle of democratic nations. Plus, \n     unlike the Warsaw Pack, the decision by the Czech Republic, \n     Hungary, and Poland to join NATO was made by each individual \n     country, without any coercion or force from any current NATO \n     member.\n       Fourth, with any expansion there are costs. A bulk of the \n     cost is to modernize and reform militaries and make them \n     operable with NATO. However, being that the U.S. already has \n     the world's premier armed forces, the bulk of the cost will \n     be incurred by our European allies and the three invited \n     nations. They are voluntarily joining and understand the \n     commitments asked of being a NATO member.\n       The United States' percentage of burden sharing for the \n     NATO budget will go down with the addition of the three \n     countries. Also, the U.S. is not obliged to subsidize the \n     national expenses of any of the the three invitees to meet \n     its NATO commitments. Adequate defense systems always costs \n     money but alliances make it less expensive because costs are \n     shared and countries join together to meet the challenges.\n        NATO enlargement is the Western world's way to show that \n     the Cold War is over and that we welcome these countries to \n     freedom. The new threats we face can only be met by forming \n     new alliances to ensure that these democracies do not fall \n     prey to nationalistic or terrorist regimes. The Czech \n     Republic, Poland, and Hungary know life without freedom and \n     now deserve freedom and security that only NATO can provide.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenate ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of \n1949 on Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This is \nthe fourth time that the Atlantic alliance, which rose from the ashes \nof World War II, has decided to expand. And each time, expansion has \nserved the same purpose--to expand the area in Europe within which \npeace, stability, freedom and democracy could flourish. The NATO \nAlliance was remarkably successful throughout its initial decades. \nToday we are considering a step designed to ensure that the success \ncontinues into the next century. This is not a decision that NATO, the \nU.S. or the Senate takes lightly. It is a more serious issue which goes \nto the heart of the question of how the U.S. can best promote our \ninterest in peace and stability in the post-Cold War era. After all, \nthese new members will enjoy all the benefits and bear all the \nresponsibilities which apply to the current members of this mutual \ndefense alliance. The U.S. will be obliged to consider an attack on \nWarsaw, Budapest or Prague in the same manner we are not obliged to \nconsider an attack on London, Paris or Bonn. Having fought in two wars, \nI am most cognizant of the solemnity of the obligation we will be \nundertaking through the ratification of this agreement.\n  The 1990s, which witnessed the end of the Cold War and the demise of \nthe Warsaw Pact, brought about a fundamental transformation in Europe. \nWhere once we saw Europe divided into hostile, ideologically-opposed \ncamps, we now see a continent increasingly united by a commitment to \nthe principles of democracy and free market economics.\n  Initially I had two principal concerns about the proposed enlargement \nof NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--the cost to \nthe U.S. and the impact on relations with Russia. In the nearly ten \nmonths since NATO made the official decision to offer membership to \nthese three nations, I have continued to examine these two areas and \nwill summarize, very briefly, my conclusions.\n  In December of last year NATO completed a review of the estimated \nincreases in the costs to NATO's commonly-funded budget resulting from \nenlargement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's report describes \nhow NATO conducted its review and calculated its cost estimate.\n\n       NATO first identified the military requirements of \n     incorporating these three new members into the Alliance. \n     Teams of experts were then dispatched to each country to \n     evaluate facilities, infrastructure, and current capabilities \n     to meet NATO's projected military requirements. With this \n     information, NATO then developed a cost estimate for bringing \n     the current capabilities into line with NATO requirements. \n     The NATO studies concluded that the cost of enlargement will \n     total $1.5 billion over the next ten years. Thus, according \n     to NATO, the additional U.S. payment to the common-funded \n     budgets will average approximately $40 million per year over \n     ten years.\n\n  This amount does not seem to me to be excessive, given the U.S. stake \nin continued security and stability in Europe. Obviously, in addition \nto these commonly-funded costs, there will be considerable additional \ncosts to the new members themselves, which each of them has pledged to \nmeet. Yes, the United States may decide to help these new NATO members \nmodernize their military forces; just as we have provided such \nassistance to many of our current NATO allies through, for example, the \nprovisions of loans or loan guarantees, for the purchase of U.S.-made \nmilitary equipment. However, Mr. President, that is a separate decision \nfor the U.S. government, one that is neither required by nor prohibited \nby our decision to support enlargement. The responsibility for ensuring \nthat their militaries are capable of meeting their obligations to the \ncommon defense rest with the new members themselves.\n  It hardly needs repeating that cooperative relations between Russia \nand the U.S., and Russia and NATO, serve the interests of the U.S. and \nthe Alliance. I am convinced that NATO enlargement and the development \nof a NATO-Russia relationship are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, since \nNATO made clear its intention to expand, NATO and Russia have concluded \nthe ``NATO-Russia Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and \nSecurity'', signed last May. This agreement is designed as a means of \nregularizing and formalizing consultative procedures between NATO and \nRussia.\n  Further, NATO is a purely defensive alliance, and a threat to no \nnation. The peace and stability within Europe promoted by the Alliance \nbenefits the entire continent, including Russia. It may be unreasonable \nto expect Russia to approve of NATO expansion. But neither is Russia's \nunhappiness over the expansion likely to become the determining factor \nin Russian behavior toward the U.S. and the Alliance.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I believe that these two major issues \narising from NATO expansion have been satisfactorily addressed. I will \nsupport NATO expansion and hope that the Senate will ratify the \nexpansion agreement by an overwhelming margin.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Managers' \namendment to the Resolution of Ratification, and of the Resolution of \nRatification itself.\n  Even though the Berlin Wall has crumbled and the Soviet Union has \ndissolved, NATO remains vital. It is the cornerstone of stability for a \ncontinent that is under massive transition. The nations of central and \neastern Europe have established democratic forms of government and have \nderegulated their economies. The accession of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic is the best way to bolster their fledgling democracies \nand market economies thereby making their newly-won freedom \nirreversible.\n  Let there be no mistake: our engagement with Europe since NATO was \nformed in 1949 has not been without its costs and not without its \nrisks. Our engagement with the new democracies of Central Europe will \nnot be without costs and risks either. The expansion of NATO will most \nlikely antagonize Russia.\n  More importantly, as a military alliance, we risk obligating the \nUnited States military to defend the citizens of distant and unfamiliar \nlands. In the end, though, we have found it difficult to stay out of \nthese conflicts. Just about anywhere in the world where there is \nconflict, our military is there.\n  I believe that disengagement from Europe, as history has repeatedly\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nshown, would have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, I believe that \nwe have no choice but to go forward with our current commitment to an \nexpanded NATO. The Senate should vote to approve the Resolution of \nRatification.\n  But, like many senators, I remain concerned at the potential \nfinancial costs of expansion. As a member of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I am concerned that the Administration has not yet come \nto terms with the price of supporting NATO expansion or more generally \nwith the costs of America's position as the sole superpower.\n  As was the case with Bosnia, there is reason to believe that the \nAdministration is underestimating the costs of expansion in order to \nmake ratification more palatable in the Senate.\n  Without pouring additional funds into the defense budget, NATO \nexpansion costs that are unaccounted for may hinder the Defense \nDepartment's ability to carry out missions in other vital areas of the \nworld and at the same time to modernize the force.\n  We have heard a number of cost estimates in the course of this \ndebate. We must keep in mind that the new member nations, as the \nprimary beneficiaries of expansion, must devote the resources necessary \nto shoulder their fair share of the common burden.\n  And I know that nothing would undermine the support of this body for \nNATO, or that of the American people, faster than a perception that the \nnew members, or existing members, for that matter, were not living up \nto their responsibilities in this regard.\n  I am also concerned about another aspect of NATO expansion--one that \nhas received less attention than the broader strategic issues, but one \nthat is critical to the long-term success of an expanded alliance--\nnamely intelligence and counterintelligence matters.\n  Here too, after a careful review, I have concluded that the long-term \nnational interests of the United States are best served by a vote in \nfavor of the Resolution. But I would like to encourage Senators to take \nthe time to review the report that I will describe shortly, which is \navailable in classified form in S-407.\n  An unclassified summary can be found in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee report, Executive Report 105-14, on the Resolution of \nRatification.\n  This report was prepared by the Intelligence Committee staff at the \ndirection of Senator Kerrey, the Committee Vice Chairman, and myself, \nand submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations and to the Senate \nat large.\n  It contains the staff's assessment of the intelligence implications \nof NATO expansion.\n  The report is the culmination of the committee's work over the past \nyear monitoring the progress of the accession process set in motion by \nthe Alliance's decision last July to formally invite Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary to join NATO.\n  The staff has routinely reviewed the state of the accession \nnegotiations, a process that concluded in December 1997 with the \nsigning of the accession protocols. Committee members and staff have \nmet numerous times with NATO negotiators as well as representatives \nfrom the acceding states, both in European capitals and in Washington, \nD.C.\n  In preparation for the Senate vote on advice and consent, committee \nstaff held numerous briefings with U.S. and NATO intelligence \nofficials; reviewed documents prepared by the Intelligence Community; \nand posed numerous questions for the record.\n  The committee directed the Executive branch--the Central Intelligence \nAgency, Department of Defense, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, and Department of State--to submit a formal report on \nthe intelligence implications of enlargement.\n  Committee staff also met with members of the Alliance's Interagency \nWorking Group on NATO Enlargement (IWGNE) to discuss integration \nefforts in the intelligence field.\n  Finally, committee members and staff traveled to national capitals of \nthe three aspiring members to gain a more detailed, first-hand \nknowledge of how the civilian and military services of these countries \noperate, and whether adequate procedures are in place for the sharing \nof sensitive information with current NATO members.\n  Once again, I would remind my colleagues that the classified \ncommittee staff report is available in S-407 for Senators who may wish \nto read it.\n  The Committee has also prepared an unclassified summary of the \nreport's major findings, and I would like to share with my colleagues \nthe highlights.\n\n\n                                overview\n\n  The United States, along with its NATO allies, believes that \nmembership in NATO cannot be granted piecemeal.\n  NATO has thus determined that there will not be a two-tiered security \nstructure within the Alliance. If and when the three accede to full \nNATO membership, they will share in all rights and obligations, and \nwill be entitled to share in Alliance secrets.\n  The work undertaken bilaterally and through NATO is geared to \nensuring that the three invitees take the necessary steps over the \ntransition or pre-accession period to demonstrate that they can and \nwill guard NATO secrets appropriately once they join in April 1999.\n  In assessing the reliability of Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic in guarding NATO secrets, the following factors are critical:\n  1. the strength of democratic reforms, with a focus on ministerial \nand legislative oversight of intelligence services and activities;\n  2. the degree to which the three countries have succeeded in \nreforming their civilian and military intelligence services, including \nthe ability of the services to hire and retain qualified Western-\noriented officers, and the evolution of political and public support \nfor these services;\n  3. Russian intelligence objectives directed against these countries, \nincluding any disinformation campaigns designed to derail, retard, or \ntaint their integration with the West;\n  4. counterintelligence and other security activities being pursued by \nthe three countries, and the adequacy of resources devoted to these \nefforts; and\n  5. the work underway between the three invitees and NATO to ensure \nthat security standards will be met by the time the three join the \nAlliance.\n\n\n                           committee findings\n\n  As a result of their investigations, the committee staff arrived at a \nseries of key findings.\n  Their report includes general findings, findings derived from the \nexperience of our respective intelligence agencies working together in \nboth bilateral and multilateral fora; and findings relating to the \ncounterintelligence threat, the pace of reform and the NATO work \nprogram for intelligence issues.\n\n\n                            general findings\n\n  Perhaps most important, the report makes a point that is obvious but \nnonetheless bears repeating: any intelligence sharing relationship \ninevitably involves some risks.\n  Nevertheless, I believe that the intelligence relationships with \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be, on balance, a net plus \nfor U.S. and NATO interests. As many of my colleagues are aware, \ncooperation with the three countries on intelligence issues began \nbefore the idea of NATO enlargement itself took root.\n  In that respect, sharing intelligence in the NATO context will build \non a pattern of bilateral cooperation which has existed for nearly a \ndecade.\n  Based on the information provided to the Committee, Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic have proven to be reliable in handling \noperational information and capable of guarding classified \ninformation--some of it extremely sensitive.\n\n\n                        the multilateral context\n\n  In the multilateral context, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nhave participated in the Implementation Force and the Stabilization \nForce operations in Bosnia, and have cooperated actively with U.S. \nintelligence to provide critical force protection information.\n  The three countries have demonstrated a solid record in the area of \ninformation and operational security within the NATO Partnership for \nPeace Program.\n  In addition, all three countries value their bilateral links to the \nU.S. and wish to expand them. They view multilateral intelligence \ncooperation in NATO as a complement to, not a substitute for, these \nbilateral intelligence relations.\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\n                     the counterintelligence threat\n\n  The single most critical intelligence issue we face in inviting \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO is the \ncounterintelligence question.\n  It is an unavoidable fact that past associations with Soviet \nintelligence services, together with proximity to Russia, make these \ncountries vulnerable to hostile intelligence activity.\n  Over time, personnel and generational changes, training, and more \nrobust counterintelligence programs by the three countries should \nreduce further this vulnerability. But for the time being, the threat \nis there.\n  The problem is not one of attitudes. The legacy these countries \ninherit from 44 years of Soviet domination makes them suspicious of \nRussian policies and motives.\n  Indeed, for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, the problem is \nnot complacency about the foreign intelligence threat, but ensuring a \ncapability to counter it.\n  Lastly, and to put this issue into perspective, we should recall that \nRussian and other intelligence efforts to penetrate NATO will continue, \nirrespective of new Alliance members.\n\n\n                          the record of reform\n\n  With respect to the critical issue of reform, all three countries \nhave made significant strides in restructuring, reforming, and \nredirecting their intelligence services.\n  More needs to be done to attain greater experience in parliamentary \noversight of the services, to secure acceptance by politicians of the \nneed for these services to maintain political neutrality, to retain and \npromote experienced officers with Western orientation, and to enhance \ncomputer security.\n  As professionalism increases, morale will improve, and the \nintelligence services will be looked upon as contributing to common \nsecurity interests. Adequate funding and visible support from the \npolitical leadership will be essential to this process.\n\n\n                         the nato work program\n\n  The three invitees are continuing to work with NATO in preparation \nfor their final accession.\n  In cooperation with NATO to date, in a variety of interactions with \nthe U.S. and other current NATO allies, including the sharing of \nsensitive information through the Partnership for Peace program, IFOR/\nSFOR, and in bilateral intelligence cooperation, the three invitees \nhave demonstrated solid records in the area of information and \noperational security.\n  Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have undertaken significant \nsteps to conform to NATO security standards and have enhanced personnel \nand information security practices.\n  Looking toward accession in April 1999, from a NATO perspective, the \nintelligence aspects of NATO enlargement appear to be on track. Indeed, \nthe intelligence planning in NATO is currently ahead of the other NATO \nprograms which must be readied for the April 1999 accession date.\n  NATO and U.S. officials have been reviewing the capabilities and \nintentions of the three governments to handle sensitive information, \nand the extent to which the military and intelligence services of these \nformer Warsaw Pact members have distanced themselves from their former \nmentors.\n  The NATO Intelligence Board has worked closely with NATO's Office of \nSecurity to ensure adequate security measures are developed with new \nmembers.\n  The specific criteria that the Alliance is using to ensure that NATO \npractices and regulations become standard operating procedures for the \nthree new invitees are based on established security guidelines \ndeveloped for the Alliance and approved by the member states. Each of \nthe three NATO invitees has thus far achieved or exceeded each \ncriterion set before it, according to the Executive Branch.\n\n\n                    intelligence committee condition\n\n  Based on these findings, I together with Senator Kerrey have proposed \na condition to the resolution of ratification of the Protocols to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty, which is included in the Managers' amendment now \nbefore the Senate.\n  The purpose of the condition is to monitor the progress that the \nthree aspiring members are making in adopting NATO practices and \nregulations as standard operating procedures in their own intelligence \nservices, and in enhancing their overall procedures for protecting \nintelligence sources and methods.\n  To monitor the progress in meeting NATO standards during the \ntransition period up to April 1999, as well as to provide a benchmark \nfollowing formal accession, the condition requires the President and \nthe Director of Central Intelligence to provide the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress with three ``snapshots''--two before and one \nafter formal accession of these countries to the alliance.\n  The President is required to report by 1 January 1999, on behalf of \nall the interested agencies, the progress made by the three countries \nin meeting NATO membership security requirements.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence is also required to report on or \nbefore 1 January 1999, and again not later than 90 days after the date \nof formal accession of these countries to NATO, on the latest \nprocedures and requirements established in these countries for the \nprotection of intelligence sources and methods, including a comparison \nof the overall procedures and requirements for such protection in these \nthree countries with those in other NATO member states.\n  I believe that this condition sets forth a balanced approach to \nmonitoring the progress of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \ntoward meeting the intelligence and security-related requirements for \nfull NATO membership.\n  In what I believe is the unlikely event that a serious problem arises \nwith respect to one or more of the prospective members, the reports due \non January 1, 1999 will provide both the Senate and the Executive \nBranch with an opportunity to address and resolve any such problem \nbefore final accession.\n\n\n                            final assessment\n\n  I would like to close with the following.\n  In developing an overall assessment of the security risks associated \nwith the inclusion of the three new invitees in NATO, the issue is not \nonly how to ensure that these three countries protect NATO secrets, but \nalso to ensure that the new members, and NATO at large, devote \nsufficient attention and resources to address the overall non-NATO \nintelligence threat to the Alliance.\n  To reiterate, based on the information provided to the Committee, the \ngovernments of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have \ndemonstrated both an intent and an ability to protect the classified \nmilitary and intelligence information that would be routinely provided \nthem as members of the Alliance.\n  While past associations make these countries vulnerable to Russian \nintelligence activity, over time, personnel and generational changes, \ntraining, and more robust counterintelligence programs by the three \ncountries should reduce further this vulnerability.\n  As I noted earlier, cooperation on intelligence issues began before \nthe idea of NATO enlargement took root. In that respect, sharing \nintelligence in the NATO context builds upon a pattern of cooperation \nof nearly a decade.\n  As with other aspects of NATO integration, it will take some time and \ntechnical advice and assistance from other NATO members for the \ngovernments of these three countries to totally overcome the legacy of \ntheir communist past.\n  As a critical element of such a program, the three governments must \ndevote adequate resources to support professionalized intelligence and \ncounterintelligence services, and must demonstrate their political \nsupport for these services' role in safeguarding the democratic \npolitical order.\n  Lastly, by the time the three invitees join NATO, a decade will have \npassed since the collapse of their communist regimes.\n  Contacts with the U.S., other allies, and NATO, coupled with \ncontinuing modernization programs and priority assistance efforts from \ncurrent NATO members, should help to ensure that all three countries \nsatisfy membership security requirements by the time of their accession \nto NATO in April 1999.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms, and the\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nRanking Member, Senator Biden, for including the Shelby-Kerrey \ncondition as part of the Managers' amendment, and for their leadership \nin ensuring the thorough and expeditious consideration of this historic \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nResolution of Ratification currently pending before the Senate. I do so \nwith less enthusiasm than I wished, and more doubts than I prefer.\n  I will vote yes because Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will \nstrengthen NATO's resolve and improve the chances that a post-Cold War \nNATO will be the same stabilizing force for peace it has been for the \npast half-century. I will vote yes because the requirements for NATO \nmembership, such as civilian control of the military and democratic \nrule, especially domestic laws that protect minority rights, make it \nmore likely that external conflicts are resolved peacefully. I will \nvote yes because the benefits of doing so appear, on balance, to \noutweigh the potential liabilities.\n  My vote of support is also based on my belief that denying the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, and Poland entry after their expectations have been \nraised so high would do more harm than good. Further, I believe these \nthree countries - on account of their passionate understanding of what \nlife is like under the iron fist of a dictator--will stiffen the \nresolve of NATO to be a force for peace. NATO has no will to fight \nunless consensus can be achieved amongst all members, and it is the \nwill to fight which will do the most good in deterring future military \nconflicts.\n  Too often during this debate I have heard the argument of some \nadvocates who presume enlargement as a necessary insurance policy \nagainst the risk of Russia becoming an expansionist military threat \nagain. These proponents often speak as if the circumstances of 1998 \nclosely resembled those in Europe when NATO was created.\n  This vision is flawed. It is flawed because it misrepresents the \ncomparative conditions of 1949 and 1998. It results in the \nsubordination of other more important foreign policy goals such as \nassisting the Russian transition to democracy, reducing nuclear \nweapons, and confronting the threat posed by proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction to the less important task of adding three new \nmembers to a Cold War military alliance.\n  Consider what President Truman and Congress faced in the wake of the \nSecond World War. In 1949, when they led America into the North \nAtlantic Alliance, only thirty years separated them from the end of the \nGreat War, the war which was supposed to end all wars. Only twenty \nyears had separated the end of this terrible war and the beginning of \nthe next. Twenty years. Imagine what our attitudes would be if a war as \nsavage and futile as World War I had been concluded on November 11, \n1968, and then in 1988, the enemy we had vanquished rose to the attack \nagain.\n  Both those wars were within memory's reach of President Truman and \nthe Congress on April 4, 1949 when the Washington Treaty was signed. \nEurope lay in ruins. Their economies had been destroyed. Food and \nmedical supplies were in short supply. Political uncertainty and \ninstability were the order of the day. The Red Army was threatening in \nthe east and their belligerence well established by the Communist coup \nd'etat in Prague in February 1948 and the Berlin Blockade which began \nin June 1948.\n  All of this combined to justify the creation of a powerful military \nalliance. It is worth noting that even with these factors, NATO at \nfirst had no military structure. Only after the Korean War began in \nJune 1950, did the idea of a worldwide communist offensive gain \ncredibility. This led to the establishment of a NATO military force, \nthe major element of which is the Allied Command Europe. In December \n1950, General Dwight Eisenhower was appointed the first Supreme Allied \nCommander Europe (SACEUR). The command's headquarters--the Supreme \nAllied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) - was located in Brussels.\n  President Truman was 65 years old in April 1949 when the Washington \nTreaty was signed. But certainly he must have remembered the day in \nmid-January 1919 when he was bivouacked near Verdun, France awaiting \nthe demobilization orders needed before he could go home. In Paris, \nU.S. President Wilson, English Prime Minister Lloyd George, and French \nPresident Clemenceau had begun their discussions of terms and \nconditions for peace.\n  In a letter to his fiance, Bess Wallace, Truman had written:\n\n       It's my opinion we'll stay until uncle Woodie gets his pet \n     peace plans refused or okayed. For my part, and I'm sure \n     every A.E.F. (American Expeditionary Force) man feels the \n     same way, I don't give a whoop (to put it mildly) whether \n     there's a League of Nations or whether Russia has a Red \n     government or a Purple one, and if the President of the \n     Czecho-Slovaks wants to pry the throne out from under the \n     King of Bohemia, let him pry, but send us home . . . For my \n     part I've had enough vin rouge and frog-eater victuals to \n     last me a lifetime.\n\n  Mr. President, in our modern age of see and invade-all journalism, \nthis letter would probably have surfaced to embarrass Truman when he \nentered national politics a decade later. However, it is also likely \nthat cameras manned by brave men and women would have broadcast 1919 \nstreet scenes of Berlin, Moscow, Paris, Warsaw, Budapest, Vienna, and \nPrague. I believe these scenes would have made Americans less anxious \nto withdraw from the devastating instability of starvation, demobilized \nand poorly led Armies, and the sudden collapse of the old order of the \nKaiser, the Romanovs, Hapsburgs, and Ottomans.\n\n  Yet only thirty years after he wrote this letter, Lieutenant Truman \nhad become President Truman, and he faced a world that looked not all \nthat different from 1919. As he considered what policy would guarantee \nthe peace after 50 million lives had been lost in the Second World War, \nhe saw a Europe as devastated as it had been in the First. He saw a \nthreatening Soviet Union in the east. Withdrawal, pacifism, and \ndemilitarization were the failed policies of the 1920's and 1930's. \nPolitical engagement and military strength were logical and correct \nalternatives. Forty years later, as communism collapsed and our former \nenemies embraced democracy, Truman's vision and path was vindicated.\n  Mr. President, too many proponents of expansion have tried to cast \nthis vote as a vote about our future engagement in the world. I am not \npersuaded by the preposterous either/or arguments used by these \nproponents. You are either for NATO expansion or you are for repeating \nthe mistake we have made twice in this century to withdraw from Europe. \nYou are either for NATO expansion or you are for appeasing the \nRussians. You are either for NATO expansion or you are for allowing \ninstability to reign supreme on the European continent.\n  What nonsense. If NATO were to disappear tomorrow--as it almost did \nby refusing to become engaged in Bosnia--America would not withdraw \nfrom Europe. We are becoming more and more connected through travel, \ntrade, and telecommunications. Any comparison of the political, \neconomic, and social conditions of 1998 and 1919, or 1998 and the \n1930's should be greeted with raised eyebrows and laughter.\n  Mr. President, many times during this debate I have heard my \ncolleagues say that NATO has been the most successful military alliance \nin history. I do not disagree with their assessment. But the statement \nleads me to ask a question: why has NATO been so successful and what \ndoes that mean for the future of the Alliance?\n  Ultimately, NATO was successful during the Cold War not for any \nmilitary operation, but for its military power and the willingness to \nuse it. For nearly 50 years, NATO has served as the vanguard of peace \nand security in Europe. For forty of those years, NATO forces stood \nready to engage in the defense of Europe from the very real threat \nposed by Warsaw Pact forces on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The \nreason NATO was able to maintain the peace and never had to fight a hot \nwar in Europe came from the recognition by our adversaries that NATO, \ndespite the horrors of a potential superpower conflict, was prepared \nfor real military action.\n  Equally as important as the will to act, NATO commanders understood \nthe importance of maintaining a formidable capability to fight. \nThroughout the Cold War, NATO's military forces were highly motivated, \nsuperbly trained,\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nand equipped with the latest weapons and technology that made the \nAlliance a force to be reckoned with.\n  Beyond the success of the Cold War, I believe that NATO has survived \nin the post-Cold War era, despite many predictions to the contrary, \nbecause it was prepared to change to reflect new realities. First, NATO \nhas begun the difficult task of restructuring and downsizing its force \nand command structure. As we in the Congress are well aware, following \nthree rounds of U.S. base closures, making the necessary decisions to \ndownsize the military is politically difficult. NATO deserves credit \nfor what it has accomplished in this area, but more work will be needed \nin the future.\n  NATO has also been successful because of its willingness to address \nthe challenges of the post-Cold War world. NATO has made significant \nprogress in tackling difficult new issues such as arms control, \nregional ethnic instability, and creating partners out of former \nenemies. In this final area, the Partnership for Peace program has made \ntremendous progress in encouraging civilian control of the military and \npromoting military transparency, each of these essential in creating \ngreater confidence between nations.\n  Each of these steps have contributed to transforming NATO into the \nAlliance that we have today, an Alliance that serves the interests of \neach of its members and promotes cooperation and stability. However, as \nNATO officials admit, the Atlantic Alliance must continue to evolve. We \nmust ask ourselves: what must NATO do now if it is to be relevant in \nthe future?\n  First, NATO must continue with the difficult work of reforming its \nforce and command structure to reflect changes in its mission and \nstrategic concept. Second, as during the Cold War, NATO must maintain a \ncredible force and the will to use that force when diplomacy fails. \nThese are the core elements of the Alliance that must be carried into \nthe future.\n  But I believe NATO must also be prepared to take on new missions. It \nwill have to be ready to address future threats to regional stability \nlike Bosnia in an efficient and timely manner. Mr. President, the true \nlesson of the Dayton Accords is that sometimes force, or the credible \nthreat of force, precedes diplomacy. I do not believe the Dayton \nAccords would have been possible had NATO not reached consensus to \nrespond militarily, albeit late, to Serbian aggression in Bosnia. I \nhope we have learned the lesson of Bosnia, and I hope these three new \nmembers will help strengthen our will to react to Bosnia-style \naggression in the future. The recent memory of the Solidarity movement, \nthe moral leadership of President Vaclav Havel, and the impact of the \n1956 uprising in Hungary will be extremely beneficial contributions to \nthe diplomatic decision-making that occurs in Brussels. We may find the \nnewest members of the Alliance will soon play a critical role in \nleading NATO into the future.\n  Mr. President, having addressed the history and future of the \nAlliance, let me restate that I will vote in favor of this Resolution \nof Ratification because I believe that NATO enlargement is a positive \nstep forward for the three invitees and for the future of the NATO \nalliance.\n  The enlargement of NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic is a statement of the success of their transition to free-\nmarket democracies. Each of these countries have experienced the \npeaceful transitions of democratic government, established the rule of \nlaw in the interaction of people and institutions, and implemented \nstrong civilian control of their militaries. We should not forget the \ndifficulty with which each of these countries has made these changes, \nnor should we underestimate the political leadership that was necessary \nto make the decisions involved in transforming from a command-style \neconomy to free-market democracy.\n  Mr. President, NATO membership, along with eventual membership in the \nEuropean Union, will re-establish their contacts to the West and help \nsolidify the political reforms in place today. Furthermore, the \nbenefits of collective defense will limit the need to reconstitute \nnational defenses and allow for continued focus on strengthening their \neconomies and rebuilding the infrastructure necessary to compete in the \nglobal economy.\n  I also believe that these countries will benefit from NATO \nenlargement through the promotion of regional stability. The prospect \nof NATO membership has already caused Central European nations to re-\nexamine their relationships with one another and to address age-old \npolitical and ethnic disputes. The resulting treaties and bi-lateral \nagreements will lessen the chance of border and ethnic conflicts in the \nregion after these three nations become full members of the Alliance.\n  Mr. President, I also believe NATO will benefit from the inclusion of \nnew members. Each of these countries will bring a unique set of \ncapabilities to the Alliance. To be sure, each still needs to make \nsignificant progress in bringing their militaries up to NATO standards, \nbut they are not starting from zero. Initial estimates show that \nfollowing their own military restructuring, these countries will bring \nan additional 280,000 troops to the Alliance; this will undoubtedly \nboost NATO's ability to perform future missions.\n  An example of this enhanced capability for NATO can be seen in the \ncontribution each of these three countries have made to the IFOR/SFOR \nmission in Bosnia. Poland is currently providing SFOR an airborne \ninfantry battalion, the Czech Republic has provided an engineering \ncompany and is maintaining a mechanized infantry battalion, and Hungary \nhas contributed an engineering battalion. Hungary has also leased the \nTaszar airbase to the United States which provides a critical point of \nentry for U.S. forces into Bosnia. I am confident that when these \ncountries become full members of NATO, we can expect that they will \ncontinue to provide a strong commitment to NATO operations.\n  In my duties as Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I joined \nwith my colleagues in reviewing the security consequences of bringing \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the Alliance.\n  In directing this review, Senator Shelby and I did not for a moment \nsuspect the sincerity or the commitment of these countries to be loyal \nmembers of the Alliance. But because some of their intelligence \nprofessionals and other military and civilian personnel had served in \nsimilar positions when their countries were dominated by the Soviet \nUnion, we felt duty-bound to examine how well these countries would \nmeet NATO security requirements, especially with regard to handling \nNATO classified information and protecting intelligence sources and \nmethods. We determined that, even in these narrow security terms, the \nnew members will be a major net gain for the Alliance. They have the \nexpertise and the dedication to protect the information which NATO will \nshare with them, and they bring intelligence capabilities to the \nAlliance which will make NATO stronger.\n  To help measure and assist the transition of the new members to NATO \nsecurity standards, Senator Shelby and I proposed a condition to the \nresolution of ratification which would require two reports: one to be \nrendered by the President next January on the progress of the new \nmembers in meeting NATO security requirements, and another to be \nrendered in phases by the Director of Central Intelligence identifying \nthe latest security procedures and requirements of the new allies and \nassessing how they compare with those of other NATO members. In my \nview, these reporting requirements are prudent and should help the \nexpanded Alliance more quickly reach a common security standard.\n\n  Mr. President, I am encouraged by the prospect of membership for \nthese three countries. However, this is a major change in U.S. policy, \nand a very real commitment that should not be entered into without a \nfull understanding of its meaning. The American people must understand \nthat membership in NATO for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \ncarries with it all of the commitments of the 1949 Washington Treaty. \nIn particular, by ratifying this change to the Washington Treaty, the \nUnited States extends full Article V protection to each of these \ncountries.\n  Article V states:\n\n       The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more \n     of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an \n     attack against them all; and consequently they agree that, if \n     such an armed attack occurs,\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\n     each of them . . . will assist the Party or Parties so \n     attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert \n     with the other Parties, such actions it deems necessary, \n     including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the \n     security of the North Atlantic area.\n\n  The quantitative result of this treaty is that the United States has \npledged to defend an additional 15% of European territory in the event \nof an attack. The qualitative result is that we as Americans pledge to \nsend our young soldiers to defend Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest. \nHowever, let me state, Mr. President, my firm belief that enlargement \nof the Alliance will in fact reduce our chances of having to fight a \nwar in this region of the world. By solidifying democratic reforms, \nencouraging regional cohesion through the Partnership for Peace \nprogram, and limiting the need for national defenses, we will promote \ncooperation and limit the threat of war.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I also have concerns about the costs \nassociated with NATO enlargement. Wide discrepancies in the assumptions \non which the various cost estimates have been based have left us with, \nat best, an incomplete view of what enlargement will cost current and \nfuture members. I am hopeful that after the vote, the Administration \nwill continue to work closely with Congress to address our remaining \nconcerns regarding costs. At a time in which our military is being \ncalled on to protect against threats to U.S. security interests \nthroughout the world, we must carefully scrutinize additional spending \ncommitments.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned with the slowness with which the \nEuropean Union has moved to address the needs of the new democracies in \nCentral and Eastern Europe. I strongly encourage the EU to catch-up to \nNATO by quickly completing negotiations over their own expansion. In \nthe long-run, the success of the former-Soviet bloc countries will \nhinge more on their ability to access the economic benefits of the EU \nthan membership in NATO.\n  While I support NATO enlargement for these three countries at this \ntime, we must also ask how do we define our future foreign policy \npriorities. For the past year, members of the Administration have \nworked tirelessly to ensure ratification of NATO enlargement. I believe \nit is time for the United States to shift our foreign policy focus: our \nnumber one priority must become the successful transition of Russia to \na stable, free-market democracy. I for one am very optimistic about the \nprospects for Russia.\n  I think at times we suffer from the inertial effects of Cold War \nthinking that limit our ability to see the world for what it is today. \nJust as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are not the Warsaw \nPact, Russia is not the Soviet Union. Russia no longer poses the \nimmediate threat to our survival as expressed in Cold War rhetoric of \nJosef Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. It is a new era, and we should use \nthis opportunity to our utmost ability to work with Russia to ensure \nthe establishment of the rule of law, to assist with the ethical \nprivatization of state owned enterprises, to promote the continued \ndevelopment of the democratic process, and to realize meaningful \nprogress on arms control.\n  We already have positive examples of what cooperation with Russia can \naccomplish. Mr. President, few may realize the Bosnia mission is the \nfirst time in which NATO troops have participated in an actual military \nengagement. Few would have guessed during the dangerous days of the \nCold War that NATO's first military mission would have occurred with \nRussian soldiers working alongside American soldiers not as the enemy, \nbut as partners. The Bosnia mission demonstrates the potential we have \nwhen we work with a democratic Russia to solve disputes. Another \npositive sign is that in recent months the Russian government has \nstepped up its participation in the Partnership for Peace program and I \nam hopeful about the possibility for continued dialog through the \nPermanent Joint Council as established under the Russia-NATO Founding \nAct. Mr. President, I encourage both the Congress and the \nAdministration to address the future of U.S.-Russian relations with the \nsame vigor with which we have worked to achieve NATO enlargement.\n  At no point in the future do I want to look back to this unique point \nin history and have to ask if we could have done more to ensure a \npeaceful, democratic Russia. Mr. President, I encourage all of us to \ntake a long-term view of history. We should consider how the world has \nchanged from the chaos and danger that led President Truman to create \nNATO in 1949 to the sweep of democracy that liberated Central and \nEastern Europe from communist control. We should consider how these \nsame nations have transformed themselves into stable democracies ready \nto become full members of the Atlantic Alliance. And finally, we should \nconsider how we want the world to look in fifty years, and then set our \npriorities to ensure our children will have the benefit of living in \nthat world.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe protocols of accession to NATO, specifically for Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic. NATO expansion is clearly in the security \ninterests of the United States and the NATO alliance as a whole.\n  We have an opportunity in the Senate today to make a truly a historic \nvote that will shatter, once and for all, the artificial division of \nEurope that occurred at the end of the Second World War. By expanding \nthis alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, we \nwill further erase the Cold War lines of division and broaden the scope \nof protection of this defensive military alliance which has played the \ncentral role in maintaining peace and stability in Europe since the end \nof World War II. Now, if history is any guide, it ensures and enhances \nthe prospects for peace, prosperity, and harmony throughout Europe.\n  It is important to remember that NATO is a defensive, not offensive, \nstrategic military alliance. Although the new member countries were \nonce considered so-called ``allies'' of the former Soviet Union, their \nso-called alliance had more to do with the presence of Soviet troops \nwithin their countries than any commitment to Soviet values or ideals. \nBringing them into the NATO alliance is not a charge against Russia and \nshould not be so construed. To the contrary, we are recognizing that \nthe people of these countries are now our allies. We pledge to come to \ntheir defense if they are attacked by a non-member country, and they in \nturn make the same pledge to support all other NATO countries who may \nbe attacked by a non-member party.\n  Mr. President, in the nearly 50 years of its existence, NATO has \nprovided the military security umbrella that has permitted old enemies \nto heal the wounds of war and to build strong democracies and \nintegrated free economies. Expanding NATO to include the emerging \ndemocracies of Eastern Europe will, I hope, produce the same results. \nThat is, stronger and freer economies whose people can live in the same \nharmony as do the people of France and Germany.\n  Communism has collapsed. The Soviet Union is no more. This is not to \nsay, however, that Europe no longer faces any security threats. I think \nthat would be shortsighted. Threats continue to exist in Europe, and \nmany of these threats are more difficult to identify and combat. Ethnic \nstrife in many parts of Eastern Europe; the instability which we face \ndaily with Iraq; terrorism; the list is long. These are all verifiable \nthreats to which the United States and other NATO member countries must \nbe prepared to respond and defend. By adding Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic to the NATO alliance, we are broadening and \nstrengthening our ability to combat and defend against these threats.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that the prospect of NATO \nenlargement has already begun as seen by the process of harmonization \nin Central and Eastern Europe. Hungary has settled its border and \nminority questions with Slovakia and Romania. Poland has reached across \nan old divide to create joint peacekeeping battalions with Ukraine and \nLithuania.\n  Without question, an expanded NATO will make the world safer simply \nbecause we are expanding the area where wars will not happen. As \nSecretary of State Albright testified last year before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and I quote, ``This is the paradox at NATO's \nheart: By imposing a price on aggression, it deters aggression.'' At\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nthe same time, we gain new allies, new friends who are committed to our \ncommon agenda for security in fighting terrorism and weapons \nproliferation, and to ensuring stability in places such as the former \nYugoslavia.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that had Soviet troops not in 1945 \noccupied Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and installed puppet \ngovernments, the debate over whether these three countries should be \nmembers of NATO would have long ago been resolved in their favor.\n  The people of these countries have yearned for freedom, democracy, \nand peace for more than 40 years, as evidenced by Poland particularly. \nThe blood in the streets of Budapest in 1956, the demonstrations of the \npeople in Prague in 1968 who confronted Soviet tanks, and the public \nconfrontations of Solidarity throughout Poland beginning in the 1970s \nall laid the foundation for the collapse of communism, which we have \nseen in our lifetime.\n  Now as they begin to build institutions of democracy and free \nenterprise, as they move to further integrate their economies with the \nrest of Europe, they should participate in the collective security of \nthe continent. I think this will bind these countries closer together \nfar into the future and ensure stability and peace throughout the \ncontinent.\n  Mr. President, there have been expressions of concern by some people \nthat expanding NATO is a mistake because it would somehow be perceived \nas a threat, a threat to Russia. I find that argument hard to accept. \nIn my opinion, NATO has never been a threat to Russia. Even during the \nheight of the Cold War, no one seriously considered that NATO \nthreatened the Soviet Union. Quite the contrary. NATO stood to defend--\ndefend--against any potential military threat to its members. There is \na difference between defense and offense. And NATO is designed for \ndefense. It was never designed as an alliance of aggression--rather, it \nis an alliance against aggression.\n  I think the same holds true today, Mr. President. The people of \nRussia, who are slowly trying to emerge from the darkness and terror of \n70 years of communism, have nothing--I repeat, nothing--to fear from \nNATO. Our goal is not to isolate Russia; but to engage and support her \nin her efforts to develop a lasting democracy and a free market.\n  The people in the evolving democracies of Poland, the Czech Republic, \nand Hungary have earned the right to become full partners in Europe and \nfull partners in NATO. I hope my colleagues will support the dreams, \nhopes, and aspirations of these people who have struggled for freedom \nfor so long, after so many decades in which they have lived without \nhope. They have that opportunity today.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to commend these countries for \nthe rapid progress which they have made nurturing democracy and \nbuilding stable economic development based on free market principles. \nWhile some would argue that they have not evolved far enough, I would \nsimply say that they are light years from where they were when the \nBerlin Wall fell and that democracy and the free market is an evolving \nprocess. They are well on their way; bringing them into the NATO \nalliance will only serve to help them along.\n  The people of these nations have dedicated themselves to these \ndemocratic ideals, and it is incumbent upon us to support them in their \nquest. Mr. President, I strongly support expanding the NATO alliance to \ninclude Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and hope that the Senate \nspeaks loudly and strongly on this issue today.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, a strong North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) is an important vehicle for maintaining security in \nEurope. For half a century NATO has been critical to maintaining \nsecurity in Europe. Largely because of NATO, Europe has enjoyed more \nthan 50 years without war among its major powers, the longest period in \nmodern history. Because of this success, European countries that at one \ntime were in a competing alliance, are now clamoring to join NATO. \nToday we have a historic opportunity to extend the NATO umbrella to \nadditional European countries, and to expand the benefits that the \nalliance has created.\n  Dr. Brzezinski of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \nin his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made a \ncompelling case for NATO expansion and its importance to the United \nStates. He said:\n\n       For me, the central stake in NATO expansion is the long-\n     term historic and strategic relationship between America and \n     Europe. NATO expansion is central to the vitality of the \n     American-European connection, to the scope of democratic and \n     secure Europe, and to the ability of America and Europe to \n     work together in promoting international security.\n       The expansion of the Euroatlantic alliance will bring into \n     NATO counsels new, solidly democratic and very pro-American \n     nations. That will further deepen the American-European \n     kinship while expanding Europe's zone of peace and democracy. \n     Such a more secure Europe will be a better and more vital \n     partner for America in the continuing effort to make \n     democracy more widespread and international cooperation more \n     pervasive. That is why NATO's enlargement--in itself a vivid \n     testimonial to the dynamism of the democratic ideal--is very \n     much in America's long-term national interest.\n\n  Since its inception, NATO has provided a forum to resolve \ndisagreements among members and for institutionalizing norms and \nrelations fundamental to modern democracies. It is natural therefore, \nthat newly emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, which \nqualify, should be considered for membership in the alliance.\n  The accession to the alliance of Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary is the culmination of years of work on these countries part to \nmeet the requirements of NATO membership. As Dr. John Micgiel, Director \nof the East Central European Center at Columbia University has said, \n``the mere prospect of membership . . . has acted as a catalyst for \npolitical reform. . ..'' Furthermore the ``three prospective member \ncountries have each taken a proactive role in cooperating with their \nneighbors and sometime former adversaries.''\n  These three countries have demonstrated functioning democratic \npolitical systems, as well as economic reforms that will allow them to \nshare the costs of NATO membership. Although there are no set \nrequirements for membership, at a minimum, candidates for membership \nmust meet the following five requirements: new members must uphold \ndemocracy, including tolerating diversity; new members must be making \nprogress toward a market economy; their military forces must be under \nfirm civilian control; they must be good neighbors and respect \nsovereignty outside their borders; and they must be working toward \ncompatibility with NATO forces.\n  Poland's membership is the logical culmination of its long struggle \nfor freedom and economic independence. In 1989, the world watched as \nPoland became one of the first former Soviet-controlled countries to \nhold free and democratic elections. ``Solidarity'' became a symbol of \nfreedom recognized around the globe.\n  In 1993, Poland was the first country in the region to record \neconomic growth, and it now has one of the strongest economies in \nEurope. In 1997, its GDP grew at a rate of about seven percent, while \nits inflation and unemployment rates declined.\n  Moreover, Poland has demonstrated its readiness to contribute to \nsecurity beyond its borders, one of the requirements of NATO \nmembership. Poland contributed forces to the Gulf War coalition and \ncurrently provides troops to the NATO-led Stabilization Force mission \nstriving to keep peace in Bosnia.\n  Hungary has met the requirements for NATO membership by holding fully \nfree and fair elections since 1989. Over the past nine years, the \ncountry has had two complete democratic changes of government. \nEconomically, Hungary has engaged in successful, yet painful, \nstabilization programs to cut its current budget deficits. Since 1990, \nHungary has attracted almost $16 billion in foreign direct investment; \nalmost a third of all foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern \nEurope.\n  Since 1989, the Czech Republic has held three fully free and fair \nelections. Their constitution contains protections similar to ours, \nsuch as the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the freedom of \nthe press. Economically, the country has privatized state-owned \nenterprises, engaged in tight monetary policies, and liberalized trade \npolicies. As a result inflation is\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\ncontrolled, the GDP has been rising since 1994, and unemployment is \nlow.\n  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were chosen to join the \nalliance because they meet all the requirements of admission. Each will \nbe a good ally and each country is prepared to accept the \nresponsibilities of NATO membership, including contributing their share \nto NATO's costs. I would like to congratulate Poland, the Czech \nRepublic and Hungary, for their courage, for their perseverance and now \nfor their imminent membership in the greatest military security \nalliance the world has ever known.\n  Other countries will soon also be prepared to join the alliance, that \nis why I believe the expansion of NATO should be regarded as a process \nrather than the enactment of a single policy. Nations such as Romania \nand Slovenia, who were not invited to join NATO at the Madrid summit \nshould be extended NATO membership once they meet the alliance's \nadmission requirements.\n  During the 104th Congress, I supported the NATO Enlargement and \nFacilitation Act of 1996. This legislation would have extended economic \naid to those countries in Central and Eastern Europe showing genuine \ninterest in furthering economic privatization and political \npluralization as a prerequisite to NATO membership. This legislation \nsent an important signal of American support for these countries \nundergoing the painful transition from communism to democratic market \nreform.\n  Mr. President, constituents from my state have indicated strong \nsupport for NATO expansion. While my constituents include Americans of \nHungarian and Czech descent, you may know that Chicago has been called \nthe Warsaw of the Midwest because of the large number of city residents \nof Polish descent. Statewide, there are nearly 1 million Illinoisans of \nPolish-ancestry, many of whom who have contacted my office in support \nof Poland's imminent entry into NATO.\n  Mr. President, it is not, however, merely the many Polish-Americans, \nor Hungarian-Americans or Czech-Americans in Illinois and around the \nUnited States who wish these countries well as they assume the \nresponsibilities of full NATO membership. Freedom-loving people in \nevery part of the world can take heart from these countries' examples. \nHistory records the innumerable times that they have been invaded by \nhostile armies. But these people have strived to maintain their culture \nand their unique way of life, and that struggle has finally been \nrewarded. For as long as there is a North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, \ntheir security will be guaranteed by some of the most powerful nations \non earth.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today as we reach the end of our \ndebate on NATO enlargement to restate my firm support for the Protocols \nto the North Atlantic Treaty providing for the accession of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic. NATO enlargement is the right thing to \ndo. We must seize this opportunity now to help make Europe whole and \nfree. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of enlargement.\n  While NATO was born out of the Cold War to protect ourselves and our \nallies from the Soviet threat, it is also part of the broader U.S. \npolicy to foster European integration after the end of World War II. \nThe first step in this policy was the Marshall Plan, not NATO. But \nafter Stalin's Iron Curtain divided Europe, and Soviet-installed puppet \ngovernments rejected Marshall Plan aid, it was clear that economic \nrecovery and political cooperation could not proceed without a security \nshield. NATO provided that shield.\n  The Soviet Union is gone. So are the Moscow-controlled puppet \ngovernments in central and eastern European states. Once again, we have \na window of opportunity to complete the work we started at the end of \nWorld War II. We must not miss this historic chance to advance our \npolicy of supporting European integration based on democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law.\n  We have a chance to bring into the circle of Western democracies \nthose states, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, that were denied \nthis chance by Soviet occupation at the end of World War II. By voting \nfor enlargement, we are again extending the hand that Stalin slapped \naway, affirming the promise of freedom and security for the Polish, \nHungarian, and Czech peoples.\n  As Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, better known as the Helsinki Commission, I have seen NATO \ncandidate states take steps to resolve internal problems and external \ndisputes that have been major features of national life within those \nstates for generations. Human rights violations in those states have \nsubstantially decreased, and their membership in NATO and, in the \nfuture, the EU, will give us leverage to resolve remaining problems. \nBut for the promise of the security guarantee that comes with NATO \nmembership, I believe these problems and disputes would not only have \nremained unresolved, but would likely have given rise, over time, to \nconfrontations between states that could have led to war.\n  Thus, by that measure, NATO enlargement is already having positive \nresults.\n  Once NATO enlargement is realized, the political risk associated with \neconomic reform in central and eastern European states will diminsh. \nThis will make international investors more willing to provide capital \nto businesses in these states, creating jobs and improving economic \nhealth. Improved performance during and after transition to free market \neconomies will help cement in place stable democratic governments.\n  The combination of healthy economies and stable democratic \ngovernments will help the European Union expand to include these \nstates. Thus, expansion of NATO's security shield is the first step, \nnot the last step, toward further broad European integration.\n  There have been many statements of caution about the impact of NATO \nenlargement on Russia. I firmly believe that Russian democracy will be \nbetter served by having healthy, stable, and prosperous democracies on \nits western border, than by leaving a gray zone between a steadily more \nintegrated Europe and Russia.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1981, I have been a member of the \nHelsinki Commission. This work has brought me into contact with the \nSoviet dissident community, which over time has become the core of the \nRussian pro-reform and pro-democracy movement. From this long \nexperience, I can tell you that a failure to expand NATO and the \nEuropean Union to embrace every European state that can meet the \nestablished entrance requirements would be a victory for the anti-\ndemocratic forces in Russia.\n  Especially if NATO enlargement were to fail because the United States \nwould not agree to it, extremist politicians of all stripes from Russia \nthrough eastern and central Europe would take heart and encouragement. \nDemocrats and free market reformers would be seriously damaged, and \npolitical and economic stability would be called into question. The \ninfluence of the United States would be greatly decreased, and our \ncommitments would be open to doubt. When we cast our votes today, we \nneed to keep in mind the probable highly negative consequences of what \nwould, in effect, be a veto by the United States Senate of NATO \nexpansion.\n  NATO enlargement, European integration, and the advancement of \npolitical reform, democracy, individual freedom, and free market \neconomics are all part of the same effort. What we do here today can \nmake a major contribution to the security and prosperity of future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  The opportunity to expand the circle of free and democratic countries \ncan not be missed. This amendment to the North Atlantic Treaty should \nbe approved. I will vote for it, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, for quite some time I have been studying the \nissue of whether we should expand NATO. There are some who have argued \nthat there has not been sufficient debate about NATO expansion. Yet, we \nhave been considering NATO expansion for several years now, long before \nthis resolution of ratification made it to the Senate floor. By wide \nmargins, the Senate indicated its support for the concept of NATO \nexpansion in 1994 and 1995, and since then, there has been much \ndiscussion in the Senate and in the media on the pros and cons of \nexpanding NATO. As the Administration has worked with our allies on the \ndetails of NATO expansion, building on\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nthe Partnership for Peace which lay the ground work for this move back \nin 1994, and culminating with the signing of the Protocols to the North \nAtlantic Treaty on the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic in December 1997, we have reached the point where there is \nlittle doubt that the Senate will ratify the resolution before us \ntoday. It is interesting to note, that as a bipartisan consensus for \nNATO expansion has emerged, opponents of NATO expansion have sharpened \ntheir arguments. I want to credit these opponents for giving us all \nmuch food for thought and for ultimately helping me focus my thinking \non this important issue.\n  After careful consideration, I have concluded that expanding NATO is \nin our national interest and I intend to support the resolution of \nratification before us today for a number of reasons.\n  NATO will help to fill a security vacuum in newly democratic Central \nEurope. It has only been a few short years since Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic have embraced democratic institutions and embarked \non the path to political and economic reform. We need to send the \nstrongest possible signal to the fledgling democracies of Central and \nEastern Europe that they must not falter in this endeavor. It is in our \nnational interest for these nations to succeed, and support from the \nWest allows them to proceed with difficult political and economic \nreforms. Just as it made sense in the breathless months after the \ndissolution of the Warsaw Pact to invite these countries to join NATO, \nwe cannot back away from them now. Following through on our invitation \noffers them a sense of security after years of domination by the Soviet \nUnion. And, it is fitting that a military alliance originally conceived \nto counter the Soviet threat would offer them a safe haven from the \nthreats of the future. Although it may seem that they have little to \nworry about now, we cannot predict what threats may emerge. After all, \nfew among us could have predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \nend of the Cold War.\n  We should support NATO expansion because it will help ensure that \nRussia does not pose a threat to those countries in the future. Russia \nmay not pose a threat now, but the fears of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic that Russia will change its stripes or that some other \nhegemonic power will threaten them are all too real. We must respond to \nthese fears. It's easy for critics of NATO expansion on this side of \nthe Atlantic to say that these fears are not justified but we must not \nforget that the reason the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are \nclamoring for NATO membership in the first place is because of their \nlong history of invasion and subjugation. Who among us could look the \nPoles, and the Czechs, and the Hungarians in the eyes and say that even \nwithout NATO they need not fear an invasion in the future. True, no one \ncan make the case that the Russian military in its current state is in \nany position to reconstitute the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact. \nRecent articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times lay out \nin stark terms the weakened state of the military, and the difficulties \nRussia is facing in developing strong economic and political alliances \nwith its neighbors. Although some have argued that these are reasons to \noppose NATO expansion, for me this underscores the challenges Russia \nfaces today in realizing full political and economic reform, challenges \nthat have little to do with NATO expansion. If Russia does not \nsucceed--and we must do all we can to ensure that it does--I shudder to \nthink of the consequences. NATO expansion will shield Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic from these consequences.\n  I do not intend to respond to all of the arguments made by opponents \nof NATO expansion, but I want to say a few more words about Russia. I \ndo not believe that NATO expansion will undermine Russian efforts to \nachieve democratic reform: If Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nwant greater integration with Western Europe this should not pose a \nthreat to Russia. However, just as we are responding to the fears of \nthe Central Europeans by inviting them to join NATO, we must recognize \nRussian fears. We must continue to remind the Russians that NATO is not \nantagonistic to their interests. And, we must redouble our efforts to \nhelp the Russians so that they too can succeed in their economic and \npolitical reforms. As the resolution of ratification states:\n\n       The Senate finds that is in the interest of the United \n     States for NATO to develop a new and constructive \n     relationship with the Russian Federation as the Russian \n     Federation pursues democratization, market reforms, and \n     peaceful relations with its neighbors.\n\n  I hope that at some future date the Senate will consider specific \nmeasures to further this goal.\n  As tensions between the United States and Russia have subsided, the \nend of the Cold War has brought many long dormant ethnic rivalries to \nthe surface. NATO expansion is a reasonable response to these \ndevelopments: A broad based military alliance can help keep ethnic \ntensions from escalating into violence. As we have seen all too vividly \nwith the dissolution of Yugoslavia, ethnic tensions in Europe are still \ndeep rooted. The world was taken by surprise at the atrocities that \nwere unleashed in Bosnia and it took several years for the West to \nbring enough pressure on the parties to end the violence. We want to do \nwhat we can to prevent the dissolution of state militaries into \nmurderous ethnic militias as took place in Bosnia. There are no \nguarantees, but by bringing the emerging democracies of Central and \nEastern Europe into a broad based military alliance we are encouraging \nmilitary cooperation and understanding and fostering relationships that \nwill make it easier to resolve major conflicts. Although NATO's primary \npurpose is not as a dispute resolution body, it is my hope that NATO \ncan help prevent many of these disputes from emerging in the first \nplace.\n\n  NATO's strength is that it is not only a military alliance, but an \nalliance of nations sharing democratic values. Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic have made great strides over the last seven years \ndemonstrating that their commitment to democratic institutions and \npolitical reform runs deep. Some have argued that political stability \nrests on economic stability and that we should press the European Union \nto admit the countries of Central and Eastern Europe before we engage \nthem in a military alliance. However, free market economies are not the \nonly key to stable democracies. The role of the military can make a \ndifference in the long-term success of democracies. A military alliance \nthat defers to civilian leaders can serve as an example of stable \ncivil-military relations. I am confident that inclusion in NATO will \nstrengthen democratic values in the new democracies of Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic.\n  The NATO alliance has been a successful alliance. It is in our \nnational interest to build on that success. For fifty years, NATO has \nunited Europe and America in a common purpose, and with its strong \nemphasis on cooperation and a collective defense, NATO will serve as a \nbuilding block for the security arrangements of the future. We have \nestablished some very important relationships in NATO. These \nrelationships are a source of strength and they should not be \nabandoned. And, the strong ties we have with Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic can be formalized by admitting them to NATO.\n  Earlier in the debate we reaffirmed the strategic purpose of NATO. I \nbelieve that as the threats of the future come into sharper focus, the \nstrategic rationale for NATO will evolve. This will not happen \novernight. And that is why I supported the Warner amendment. Before we \nremake an alliance that has served American interests and proceed with \nfurther expansion we need to spend more time thinking about the role \nNATO will play in our changing security arrangements. The Warner \namendment also would have allowed us to step back from the process \nwithout specifically rejecting any of the nations of Central or Eastern \nEurope. Regardless of how long we wait before the next group of nations \nis admitted to NATO, we must closely monitor the integration of Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic into NATO.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words about the cost of NATO \nexpansion, an issue of particular concern to me. Although there have \nbeen numerous estimates, the most recent Administration estimate is \nthat we will spend $400 million over the coming decade to\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\ncover the US share of NATO expansion costs. This is not a small sum. \nConsider, however, that we have already spent more than $6 billion on \nUS operations in Bosnia in the last two and a half years. If NATO can \nhelp prevent the Bosnias of the future, even if NATO expansion costs \nare double the Administration's current estimate, this will be money \nwell spent.\n  I am disappointed that there is no consensus in the Senate to limit \nour spending in this area beyond the existing limit on the US \ncontribution to the NATO common budget. I supported the Harkin \namendment that would have placed a 25 percent cap on expenses that \nmight be incurred to help NATO's newest members integrate their forces \nwith NATO, and I will continue to watch spending in this area. As the \nResolution of Ratification states: ``the United States is under no \ncommitment to subsidize the national expenses necessary for Poland, \nHungary or the Czech Republic to meet its NATO commitments.''\n  Our future is and always has been inextricably tied to Europe, a \nregion that has been beset by war. After two devastating World Wars \ndominated the first half of this century, we have relied on the NATO \nalliance to help keep the peace during the second half. I believe that \nNATO expansion can also help us maintain peace and stability in Europe \ninto the next century and for that reason the resolution of \nratification to admit Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic merits \nour support.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, almost 10 years ago, the wall that had \ndivided Europe for more than a generation suddenly crumbled. Brave, \nfreedom-loving people in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia took \nmatters into their own hands, eventually toppling their communist \ngovernments. East Germans attacked their wall with gusto, and in a \nmatter of months, Germany was reunited. Ever since that time, there has \nbeen talk in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary of joining the West \nin a more formal way, to solidify their break from the East, to \nrecognize their conversion to democracy and free markets, and to insure \nagainst future aggression from the East. NATO membership was seen as \none way to do this. Eastern Europe also recognized that economic \ndevelopment was critical to their success and sought economic \nintegration with the West and access to its markets. Membership in the \nEuropean Economic Union was a high priority for most states.\n  While the West spoke glowingly of the transformations taking place in \nthe East, it soon became clear that there would be only meager amounts \nof foreign assistance and economic investment for the East, and access \nto new markets would remain limited. Western Europe and North America \nwere wrestling with their own economic difficulties and fighting \npopular expectations that the end of the Cold War would bring reduced \nfinancial commitments abroad. Increasingly, it became clear to many \nEastern European governments that joining NATO was their best chance of \ngetting membership in a western ``club''. NATO membership would address \nthe historical and emotional anxieties of many East Europeans left by \ndecades of domination and oppression by the East, and would provide \nwestern aid to modernize their militaries. While it wasn't what they \nneeded most, at least it was something.\n  As the prospects of membership in the Economic Union faded, many East \nEuropean governments jumped at the 1995 NATO announcement that it would \nconsider taking in new members. NATO, led by the United States, was \nfaced with the difficult task of deciding which countries would qualify \nfor membership immediately and which ones would be refused, pending \nfurther political, economic and military maturation. The stakes were \nhigh, and in some cases, the disappointment was great. The United \nStates made it clear to all who were not accepted that there would be \nother chances to join in the near future, that the door to membership \nwould remain open. No clear vision of the shape or boundaries of NATO \nemerged from this exercise.\n  The decision to enlarge NATO also altered the context for the newly \nformed Partnership for Peace (PFP). Rather than concentrating on the \nquality of PFP discussions and ways that it could enhance regional \nsecurity, the focus shifted instead to the benefits of full NATO \nmembership. Rather than easing the tensions caused by the Cold War \ndividing line through the heart of Europe, enlarging NATO revived those \ntensions, once again creating a sense of ``us'' versus ``them'', and \nreducing the ability of the PFP to address the void left by the \ndissolution of the Warsaw Pact.\n  Americans feel the strong emotional pull of the countries who want to \njoin NATO. We want to do what we can to reward them for their struggles \nand solidify their political, social and economic gains. We have little \nability to pry open European markets, and few financial resources to \ncommit to economic development programs. So NATO membership at first \nglance seems the obvious thing to do.\n  I have some very deep reservations about this course of action. For \none, NATO membership will not provide what the new democracies of \nEastern Europe need most--economic and political development. Secondly, \nNATO expansion may well jeopardize critical U.S. national security \nconcerns that require close cooperation with Russia. Additionally, \nmoving to expand NATO at this time cuts short the potential development \nof the PFP into a more innovative structure for handling the very \ndiverse military concerns of its members who now span the globe from \nthe Arctic Ocean to Central Asia to the Pacific Ocean. We also must \nrecognize that estimates of the cost of NATO expansion vary widely, and \nit is likely that the American taxpayer will get stuck picking up a \nvery sizable percentage of the costs. Finally, I do not believe that \nthe American public has given sufficient attention to the question that \nis being asked of the Senate: Should we extend our very best security \nguarantee to more nations? Are we ready to commit US troops to the \nunconditional defense of even more territory? The Senate should not act \nuntil it is sure that the American people support this commitment.\n  Now is not the time to make this move. Let's think for a moment about \nthe most immediate threat facing both Europe and the United States. It \nis not really a Russian attack upon Eastern Europe. The war in Chechnya \nshowed that the Russian military is not even capable of putting down \ninternal rebellion. Yet this is what NATO is designed to protect \nagainst.\n  A very real and pressing threat to U.S. and European security is the \nleakage of Russian weapons of mass destruction. An expanded NATO gives \nus no advantage in countering this threat, while at the same time \ncutting back on the degree of cooperation we will get out of Russia in \naddressing these threats. If we want to work with the Russian military, \nwe must convince them that we are not escalating the threat against \nthem. Much as we might say that NATO is not an aggressive alliance \naimed at Russia, Cold War perceptions do not dissipate that quickly, \nand if Russia feels increasingly threatened, it will be even more \nreluctant to scale back its military capabilities, to ratify START II \nand to cooperate in other arms control initiatives. And these are \nthings that matter very much to U.S. national security.\n  We have increasingly found that the resolution of most thorny \ninternational crises require some assistance from Russia. The standoff \nwith Saddam Hussein over UN weapons inspections was the most recent \nexample. Bosnia will continue to demand active US-Russian cooperation, \nand other efforts such as reducing the spread of nuclear weapons in \nSouth Asia will be enhanced if we have Russian assistance.\n  The decision to move NATO closer to the borders of Russia may well \nhave one other unintended and dangerous consequence--driving Russia \ninto a closer relationship with China. China will continue to emerge as \na greater presence on the international scene. And I believe we will \nhave even more serious disagreements with its leadership. Russia is a \npart of this strategic equation. Our job now is to convince Russia that \nit shares our concerns vis a vis China, and that it is not in Russia's \nbest interest to turn a blind eye to dangerous Chinese behaviors. But \nit Russia feels that a closer relationship with the West will not bring \nit greater security, then this will be a very difficult argument to \nmake.\n\n  Mr. President, Senate ratification of this enlargement of NATO is \njust the\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\nfirst step. Other countries are now very anxious to get ``in'' and \neventually more of them are going to meet the stated qualifications for \nmembership. Yet every new addition beyond the three before us today \nbrings more trouble, both in terms of Russian reaction and challenges \nto the cohesion of the NATO structure. If NATO is unable to act \ndecisively on matters that we feel are central to our security, it will \nbe of diminishing use to us in the future.\n  I am quite concerned that by accepting these three countries today, \nwe are increasing the pressure on others to join. Putting top priority \non developing a close military relationship with NATO is not what these \nnew democracies need right now. They should be focusing primarily on \ntheir economic, social and political development. I fear that we do \nthem a disservice by holding up NATO membership as the best way to be \n``tied'' to the West. After all, having a stable democracy and strong \neconomic ties with one's neighbors has proven to be the most successful \nway to ward off both military and political strife.\n  If we proceed to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to \njoin NATO, I believe we must be very cautious about any additional \nrounds. I have proposed an addition to the document before us that \nwould require the Administration to report regularly to Congress on the \nstatus of discussions with other countries about joining NATO. \nHopefully this will allow us to be more involved in the process before \nany new invitations are extended. I appreciate the Managers acceptance \nof my amendment. And I trust that the vigorous debate we have had on \nthis issue will encourage much greater caution by the Administration \nand NATO in extending future invitations.\n  I know some Senators objected earlier to efforts to postpone \nconsideration of this treaty. Yet, no matter where my Colleagues come \ndown on this issue, I trust they all now will agree with me that U.S. \nforeign policy and the American public have benefited from the fuller \ndebate we have had as a result.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic deserve to be recognized for the great strides they have \nmade in recent years. But I am not convinced that immediate full \nmembership in NATO is the right answer for them or for us. And I am \nvery concerned that the process this treaty sets in motion is one that \nwe may well ultimately come to regret.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of expanding NATO to \ninclude Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  As the Congress has considered this issue, I have evaluated the \narguments for and against NATO expansion. There are compelling \narguments on both sides. However, on balance, I have concluded that \nthis round of NATO expansion should be supported.\n  The first question I asked myself in making this vitally important \ndecision is whether expanding NATO serves America's national security \ninterests. I concluded that it does.\n  America has fought two brutal world wars in Europe, and we have \nthousands of troops stationed in Bosnia. Our vital interests in \npromoting European stability and democracy are clear.\n  I believe that NATO expansion will promote stability in Europe. The \nmere possibility that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic might be \ninvited to join NATO created a strong incentive for them to resolve \npeacefully longstanding ethnic and border disputes and to improve ties \nwith their neighbors. Hungary, for example, concluded Basic Treaties on \nUnderstanding, Cooperation, and Good-Neighborliness with Slovakia and \nRomania in 1996, and its relations with Romania are greatly improved. \nClearly, Europe is more stable as a result, and that is good for \nAmerica.\n  While I hope tensions will not arise in the future among any of these \nnew members, they may. If these countries are not NATO members, our \nability to prevent tensions from boiling over into full-blown conflicts \nwill be more limited. Experience has shown that NATO can play a \nconstructive role in resolving conflicts between members, helping \nreconcile former adversaries like France and Germany and moderating \ntensions between Turkey and Greece. It could play the same role in \nmediating conflicts between new member countries.\n  NATO strength has come from the fact that it is not only a security \nalliance but also a political organization. Just as it has been a force \nfor stability in Europe, so it has been a force for democratic \ndevelopment. Now that the Cold War is over, that political role will be \nincreasingly important. By including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic in NATO, the U.S. and NATO will have a greater ability to \ninfluence the continued democratic development of these countries.\n  Furthermore, expanding NATO will advance America's long sought goal \nof defense burden sharing. We've spent a considerable amount of time in \nthe Senate debating the costs of NATO. But few have talked about the \nbenefits of including three countries that are willing and prepared to \nshare the defense burden in the Alliance. Already prospective members \nare working with NATO through the Partnership for Peace program and \nserving with American troops in Bosnia. All three would have supported \nAmerican air strikes in Iraq. They're willing to pay their fair share \nand contribute to the collective defense. The West ought to welcome \nthem.\n  The second question I asked in making this decision, Mr. President, \nwas whether each of the prospective NATO countries meets the five \ncriteria articulated in 1996 by then Secretary of Defense Perry: \ncommitment to democratic reform; commitment to a free market economy; \ngood neighborly relations; civilian control of the military; and \nmilitary capability to operate effectively with our other NATO allies. \nI am satisfied that each of the countries the Senate is being asked to \napprove for NATO membership meets these criteria.\n  In Poland, where communism once reigned, democracy is flourishing. \nSeven free and fair elections have been held since 1989, and two \ndemocratic changes in the government have taken place. A new Polish \nconstitution has been approved in a popular referendum. The judiciary \nis independent, and the press is free.\n  As a result of Poland's economic reform program, the country \ncurrently has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. The \nprivate sector is thriving and currently accounts for about two-thirds \nof GDP and about 60% of the country's work force.\n  Poland has good relations with all seven of the states it borders. \nIts new constitution codifies civilian control as well as parliamentary \noversight of the military. And American officials have determined that \nPoland has the most capable armed forces in Eastern Europe.\n  Hungary receives high marks on each of these criteria as well.\n  A stable, parliamentary democracy, Hungary has had two democratic \nchanges of government since 1989 in free and fair elections. Its \ngovernmental institutions are stable, and its judiciary is independent.\n  Since 1989, the country has implemented price and trade \nliberalization, extensive privatization and instituted important legal \nchanges. That almost one-third of all foreign direct investment in \nCentral and Eastern Europe has been attracted to Hungary speaks to the \nstrength and attractiveness of its economy.\n  After many years of tension, Hungary has made tremendous strides in \nimproving its relations with neighboring countries, such as Romania, \nwhere large concentrations of ethnic Hungarians reside. New Treaties \nwith Slovakia and Romania include important provisions on ethnic \nminority rights and reconfirms Hungary's commitment to respect existing \nborders.\n  Importantly, Hungary's military is under civilian control, and its \narmed forces are reorganizing to meet NATO standards.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is the Czech Republic, a parliamentary \ndemocracy which has held three free and fair elections since 1989. \nVaclav Havel, a former political prisoner and human rights advocate, \nserves as President and conscience of the country.\n  The economy of the Czech Republic has been so transformed that nearly \n80% is currently in private hands, an astonishing amount for a formerly \ncentrally planned economy, and 65 percent of the GDP is generated by \nthe private sector. Since 1991, the Czech Republic\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\nhas operated on a balanced budget. Relations between the Czech Republic \nand its neighbors, including Germany and Slovakia, are sound. And the \nCzech military is under civilian control.\n  As a Member of the Helsinki Commission, I am aware of the issues that \ncontinue to form a part of the U.S.-Czech bilateral dialogue, including \nproperty restitution problems and discrimination against the Romani \nminority. At the same time, I believe that Czech leaders are committed \nto resolving these problems and I am committed to working with the \nCzech Government until they are.\n  I am keenly aware, Mr. President, that there are some risks involved \nin expanding NATO and that many are deeply concerned about the impact \nthat expanding NATO will have on our relations with Russia. I have \nthought long and hard about this risk. I have discussed it at length \nwith Undersecretary Pickering, and I have concluded that while NATO \nexpansion may create some complications in our relations with Russia, \nthose difficulties can be managed.\n  Despite the fact that most of the Russian political elite say they \noppose enlargement, Russia continues to pursue a cooperative \nrelationship with the U.S. Public opinion polls in Russia reveal that \nthe vast majority of the Russian public would rather cooperate with \nthan confront the enlarging Western alliance.\n  Even on arms control issues, progress is being made with the Russians \ndespite the debate over NATO expansion. For example, Russia has \ncontinued to implement START I reductions in strategic forces. In fact, \nI am told that Russia is dismantling its strategic nuclear forces more \nrapidly than the Treaty requires.\n  Despite the fact that NATO was well on its way to expansion, at the \nMarch 1997 summit in Helsinki, President Yeltsin agreed to the outlines \nof a START III accord, and he agreed to urge the Duma to ratify START \nII. Importantly, there are signs that the Duma will move forward and \nratify the START II agreement this summer because, according to Duma \nspeaker Seleznev, it ``meets Russia's interests.''\n  There are other positive signs regarding arms control. While NATO \nexpansion was being debated, Russia ratified the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. It also continued to work with the U.S. on adaptation to \nthe Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.\n  While I do not have a crystal ball, and I cannot predict the future \nof arms control, I am encouraged by these signs. They indicate to me \nthat this round of NATO expansion will not derail arms control.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO. Expanding NATO will \nerase Stalin's artificial dividing line. Poland, Hungary, and the \nformer Czechoslovakia ended up, against their will, on the wrong side \nof the Iron Curtain after the Second World War. Now that democracy is \nflourishing in each of these countries, it is to America's advantage to \nerase that dividing line and bring them into the NATO alliance. We \nexpanded NATO in 1952 when we allowed Greece and Turkey to join. We \nexpanded it in 1955 when we allowed Germany to join. And we expanded it \nin 1982 when we invited Spain to join.\n  We should expand it now by allowing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic to join as well.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, after much consideration of the pending \nresolution of ratification to expand NATO, I intend to vote in favor of \nthis resolution. It is in the national security interest of the United \nStates and our allies. But, as the Senate continues this historic \ndebate on the expansion of the NATO alliance to include Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic, I would like to make some observations \nabout the cost implications of expanding NATO and steps we have taken \nin the Senate to address them.\n  When the Senate committees began to consider NATO expansion last \nyear, I was skeptical. The Senate, I feared, was approaching this issue \nwith insufficient information or appreciation for the costs of such \nexpansion for the American taxpayer.\n  That is why I joined with our colleague from Texas, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, on a letter of June 25, 1997, to the President \nrequesting specific facts and analysis regarding the cost and military \nimplications of NATO expansion.\n  I continued to pursue the cost issue last October, when the Senate \nAppropriations Committee held a series of hearings on this important \nissue. On the first day, the committee heard about the policy \nimplications of NATO expansion from Defense Secretary Cohen and \nSecretary of State Albright. The next day, the committee heard about \nthe military implications from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Shelton, and the Commander in Chief of the U.S. European \nCommand, General Clark.\n  What came out of both days of hearings was the fact that no \ndefinitive estimates existed for the true costs of NATO expansion.\n  The committee heard how the original Defense Department estimates may \nhave been inflated because they took into account a fourth country, \nrather than only those three currently invited to join NATO. Those \nestimates also considered a greater Russian threat than actually \nexisted because of that country's recent reductions in force. The \ngenerals testified that, first, specific military requirements will be \ndeveloped; then, NATO will determine the costs for meeting those \nrequirements.\n  The third day of those hearings was critical. On October 23, 1997, I \nasked a witness from the General Accounting Office to provide for the \nCommittee a definitive analysis of the cost of this expansion. During \nthat hearing, I expressed my concern that no official estimates yet \nexisted about what the U.S. contribution will be to an expanded NATO. \nIN fact, the title of the GAO report summed it up--``Cost Implications \nfor the United States Remain Unclear.''\n  The hearing also revealed that the GAO cost estimates lacked critical \ninformation, such as the $60 million in bilateral aid which the U.S. \nhad already provided the three invited countries. In response to my \nquestion, the GAO conceded the $60 million was American taxpayers' \nmoney and should be counted.\n  Ultimately, I was informed that an accurate projection could not be \nprovided for some months.\n  Then in February of this year, the administration provided much lower \nfigures for the U.S. share of NATO expansion--approximately $40 million \neach year over the next 10 years. This estimate stood in stark contrast \nto the much larger figures that had been quoted just months before.\n  Because of my concerns about the unpredictability of future expansion \ncosts, I joined the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, on his amendments as an original cosponsor. The Senate \nadopted these amendments earlier this evening. They establish limits on \nthe U.S. share of the common NATO budget and ensure Congress has the \nnecessary authority to keep close watch over these costs in the future \nyears of expansion.\n\n  Another important aspect of the cost issue is the expected \ncontributions from the new members of NATO. Although Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic have made tremendous economic strides since the \ncollapse of the Warsaw Pact, there have been concerns about their \nability to live up to their individual cost commitments to NATO. It is \nimportant for the Senate to fully consider the commitments from these \ncountries so the American taxpayers will not be forced to shoulder an \nunfair burden in the future. Therefore, I obtained letters of \ncommitment from each of these Governments and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the letters be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Before I close, I want to recognize the work of our \nformer distinguished colleague in this body from the State of Colorado, \nSenator Hank Brown, who is one of this country's most ardent supporters \nof NATO expansion. Few have played a more crucial or steadfast role in \nthe effort to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in the \nNATO alliance. His outstanding work will have a lasting impact.\n  After much consideration of the cost and military implications of the \npending resolution of ratification to expand\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nNATO, I intend to vote in favor of this resolution. It is in the \nnational security interest of the United States and our allies.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         Warsaw, February 28, 1998\n     Hon. Mr. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Republican Majority Leaders,\n     Hon. Mr. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Democratic Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Distinguished Senators: The Senate of the United States of \n     America will soon vote on NATO enlargement with respect to \n     Czech, Hungarian and Polish membership. It will be an \n     important political decision with particular implications for \n     the security of many nations, especially of those from \n     Central and Eastern Europe.\n       Decisions of the member state of the North Atlantic \n     Alliance and the United States' decision particularly, will \n     provide our region, which suffered so much in the XXth \n     century, with stability, security and lasting democratic \n     order.\n       As leaders of all parliamentary caucuses in the Polish \n     Parliament--those ruling as well as in the opposition--we \n     assure you, Honorable Senators, that this question of Polish \n     membership in NATO is vital for security of the Euroatlantic \n     region and enjoys overwhelming support in our society.\n       Poland as a future member of NATO would like to be not only \n     a security consumer but also a security provider. At the same \n     time, we are determined to fulfill all necessary Alliance \n     obligations--including financial ones.\n       It is our hope that the United States Senate will meet the \n     expectations of millions of Poles and will give consent and \n     advice to the President of the United States to ratify the \n     Protocolls of Accession.\n       We address ourselves to you, as American Statesmen, to use \n     your authority to assure the successful outcome of the Senate \n     vote on NATO enlargement.\n       We remain, respectfully yours,\n     Leszek Miller,\n       Chairman, Parliamentary Caucus, Democratic Left Alliance.\n     Janusz Dobrosz,\n       Chairman, Parliamentary Caucus, Polish Peasant Party.\n     Marian Krzaklewski,\n       Chairman, Parliamentary Caucus, Solidarity Election Action.\n     Tadeosz Syryjczyk,\n       Chairman, Parliamentary Caucus, Union for Freedom.\n     Jan Olszewski,\n       Chairman, Parliamentary Group, Movement for the \n     Reconstruction of Poland.\n\n\n                                    The Ambassador of Hungary,\n\n                                                   April 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     380 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As the U.S. Senate continues its \n     debate on the enlargement of NATO and the accession of \n     Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the Alliance, I am \n     writing to you as the representative of the Hungarian \n     Government in the United States. I highly appreciate your \n     interest in this matter important for both the security of \n     the United States and that of the European continent. I \n     understand that you need assurances of our countries \n     commitment to share the financial burdens of the enlargement.\n       Earlier last year, the Hungarian Government decided to \n     raise the ratio of defense expenditures within the GDP by 0.1 \n     percent annually until Hungary reaches the average level of \n     defense spending by current NATO members of the same size as \n     Hungary. Given the 4%+ growth of our GDP, this commitment \n     will result in a 8-10% yearly increase of defense spending in \n     real terms. Since both domestic and international financial \n     institutions project the same or more growth in the years to \n     come, it will be an ``increasing slice of a growing pie'' and \n     my country's commitment to meet all the financial obligations \n     stemming from our accession is supported by a solid economic \n     background.\n       Mr. Senator, I remember that during the Appropriations \n     Committee hearing last fall, you raised a concern that the \n     U.S. cost implications would be unclear until NATO adopts its \n     Target Force Goals report. It is true that this study will be \n     adopted in June by the NATO Ministerial, however I should \n     clarify that the Target Force Goals include military \n     requirements to be fulfilled by the 3 nations. These \n     requirements are national expenses and to be exclusively \n     financed by the applicants, thus, they would not have an \n     impact on the U.S. costs. It is clearly stated in one of the \n     conditions of the Resolution of Ratification that ``the \n     United States is under no commitment to subsidize the \n     national expenses necessary for Poland, Hungary, or the Czech \n     Republic to meet its NATO commitments''. As a matter of fact, \n     during our recent accession talks Hungary underwent a \n     thorough ``screening'' by NATO which resulted in a conclusion \n     that all the military requirements of NATO accession can be \n     paid from the existing defense budgets.\n       With the above, I would reiterate the commitment of the \n     Hungarian Government to pay all the necessary expenses of our \n     membership. It is our fundamental interest to successfully \n     adapt into an alliance that continues to be successful. This \n     approach is supported by all the parliamentary parties of \n     Hungary. This was also communicated to the U.S. Senate: our \n     Foreign Minister visited Washington twice during the last \n     half a year and meeting your distinguished colleagues as well \n     as the leaderships of both aisles, he assured them about our \n     firm commitment.\n       Enclose please find the Hungarian Government's memorandum \n     on the enlargement that includes the financial commitment, as \n     well. The memorandum was disseminated in the Senate in \n     February.\n       I hope you will find the above useful in your \n     consideration. I look forward to a continuing cooperation \n     with you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Dr. Gyorgy Banlaki.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Memorandum of the Government of the Republic of Hungary on the \n         Enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\n       Hungary considers the enlargement of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization as a unique historic step that will \n     expand the zone of stability and security to the benefit of \n     all countries of the Euro-Atlantic region. Hungary's \n     accession to NATO is a decisive step in the process of firmly \n     anchoring itself in the community of democratic nations, with \n     whom it shares values, interests and goals. Hungary is \n     determined to play its part in ensuring international peace \n     and justice, democracy and fundamental human rights, the \n     principles and practice of the rule of law and a free market \n     economy. The Hungarian Government is convinced that the \n     strengthening of the transatlantic link assured by NATO is an \n     indispensable prerequisite of the security of both present \n     and future members of the Alliance.\n       Hungary's accession to NATO is based not only on the \n     consensus of all parties represented in the Hungarian \n     Parliament but also possesses an overwhelming support of \n     Hungarian citizens. This was manifested in the impressive \n     result of the referendum held on 16 November 1997 on the \n     country's accession to the Alliance.\n       It is the firm intention of Hungary to provide for its own \n     security and contribute to the security of all its Allies \n     within the framework of a cohesive, strong NATO, based on \n     solidarity among its members on both sides of the Atlantic. \n     Hungary fully accepts all responsibilities and obligations \n     and wishes to enjoy all rights stemming from membership.\n       Hungary accepts the broad approach to security as outlined \n     in NATO's Strategic Concept. Hungary is determined to \n     participate fully in NATO's Integrated Military Structure and \n     in Collective Defense Planning. Hungary will commit the bulk \n     of its armed forces to collective defense and is ready to \n     commit forces, as necessary, to other NATO missions as well.\n       Hungary will allocate adequate budgetary resources for the \n     implementations of its commitments. The country's sustainable \n     economic growth and the envisaged increase of defense \n     expenditure will provide solid foundation for fulfilling \n     them.\n       The Republic of Hungary fully supports the continued \n     openness of the Alliance, as stated in the Madrid \n     Declaration. Hungary has a vested interest in seeing all \n     countries of Central and Eastern Europe become members of the \n     Alliance that wish to do so, once they have fulfilled the \n     criteria of membership. Hungary remains committed to \n     supporting their efforts and to sharing its experiences \n     gained during the accession process.\n       In the period to come Hungary will further intensify her \n     efforts to successfully complete her preparation for \n     membership.\n       The Hungarian Government expresses its gratitude to all \n     those in the United States of America, civilians and military \n     alike, who have helped the entire process of Hungary's \n     accession to NATO with dedication and a high level of \n     professionalism.\n       The Hungarian Government hopes that the upcoming \n     discussions and debates on NATO enlargement in the Senate \n     will reflect the constructive approach that has consistently \n     characterized the United States' position in all earlier \n     phases of the enlargement process. Legislators in both \n     current and future member states are facing the historic \n     challenge of making a decision that will shape the future of \n     the Euro-Atlantic region for a long time to come.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Embassy of the Czech Republic\n\n\n                               3900 Spring of Freedom St. N.W.\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: The Embassy of the Czech Republic \n     appreciate your interest in the contribution the new NATO \n     members will make to the common defense of the North Atlantic \n     Alliance.\n       I can assure you that the Czech Republic is ready to bear \n     its share of the costs of NATO enlargement. In September \n     1996, the Czech Government decided to increase the military \n     spending by 0.1% of the GDP annually until the year 2000. The \n     1998 budget adopted by the Parliament last December provides \n     for a 22 percent increase in defense spending as compared \n     with the previous year.\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\n       Attached please find statements of Czech officials on the \n     costs of NATO enlargement and basic data on Czech military \n     expenses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Anotnin Hradilek,\n                                          Deputy Chief of Mission.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \napproval of extending North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership to \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. For me this issue is very \nclear, admitting these countries into NATO will strengthen the \nOrganization, reinforce new democracies, renew the American commitment \nto European security, and reaffirm American leadership in international \nrelations and diplomacy.\n  The United States plays a pivotal role in international relations \nbecause of our position as the world's only military and economic \nsuperpower, and as the world's strongest democracy. The existence of \nNATO is one of our best hopes for relieving much of the burden of that \nrole. NATO initiatives can prevent international incidents from \nbecoming serious military conflicts by encouraging member nations to \nwork together to resolve conflicts. The success of NATO initiatives \ndepends entirely on the support and participation of member nations. \nRatification of this NATO expansion resolution is a test of whether the \nUnited States will stay engaged in a changing and evolving Europe.\n  If NATO was not regularly reinforced and reinvigorated, the world's \nonly superpower, the United States, would necessarily be involved in \nevery international conflict and crisis. There is overwhelming \nbipartisan support for the notion that the United States taxpayer \nshould not be responsible for policing the world, and that this should \nincreasingly be an international responsibility. While I share this \nbelief, I also have a personal interest in NATO expansion. My oldest \nson Brooks is in Bosnia as part of a NATO support effort. As NATO \nbecomes more inclusive, the chances of going to war for all countries \ndecreases. Likewise, as more countries join NATO, spreading the burden \nof conflict resolution and peacekeeping, fewer American soldiers will \nbe needed abroad. This is a positive blessing for all Americans.\n  Nevertheless, there are some who oppose the expansion of NATO and \nothers who would like to place limitations on expansion, eroding the \nbody's effectiveness. Because Russia and the rest of the world know \nthat NATO is a defensive peacekeeping body, not an offensive regime, \nthe current fears that an expanded NATO will directly threaten \nrelations with non-NATO member neighbors are inflated. Instead, \nincluding eastern European countries in NATO will lead to increased \nstability in the region, something good for all countries throughout \nthe world. Additionally, efforts to preclude other countries from \njoining NATO over a specified time period and attempts to limit the \npowers of the Organization are not well thought out. Limiting the \nmission of NATO would not be wise, particularly because we would be \nlimiting our own abilities in the future. And a mandated pause would \nundermine the open door commitment that NATO has had since 1949. All \ncountries have always been welcome to join the fold of NATO and all \ncountries should forever remain welcome to join an Organization \ncommitted to peace and security. The United States cannot walk away \nfrom the role of leadership in Europe. By what we have witnessed in \nBosnia, Europe is at a very fragile stage. We must embrace the European \ncountries that wish to be a part of a world alliance for peace and \nsecurity, and we have a moral obligation to strengthen Europe and \nreduce the possibility of war in the region. The door to NATO must \nremain fully open, not half closed, to those nations equipped to \nshoulder the responsibility and reforms necessary to meet NATO \nmembership standards.\n  With regard to the cost of NATO expansion, I believe that equitable \nfinancial involvement of member nations should be enforced. The U.S. \nshould do what it can to support NATO to an extent equal to efforts of \nother countries involved. It is imperative that NATO expansion costs be \nkept as low as possible, and I do not believe that substantial \nexpenditures to upgrade the new entry militaries is necessary or wise. \nInstead, I applaud the efforts of NATO to prioritize communications \ninfrastructure, language skills, and strategic training for new members \nover big ticket items as the immediate criteria for NATO membership. It \nshould also be noted that the governments of Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic estimate that they would spend more on defense, not \nless, if they remain outside NATO. Although the United States will have \na proportional increase in overall NATO expenditures, I believe the \ncost of forgoing NATO expansion is much greater.\n  For these reasons, I fully support Senate approval of extending North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization membership to Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic. Admitting these countries into NATO will strengthen the \nOrganization and reaffirm American leadership in international \nrelations and diplomacy. President Clinton announced his support for \nNATO enlargement in 1994 and in 1997 the Senate held over ten hearings \non this issue. Debate on this issue has been extensive and thorough. \nNATO expansion is good for America and for the world.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about \nexpansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO.\n  I believe in a United States that is an activist leader and \nrespectful participant in world affairs. This leadership comes with \nresponsibilities that are often difficult for the United States: troops \nstationed and foreign aid dollars expended abroad; cooperation with \ninternational organizations like the United Nations; and the decision \non NATO expansion that is before the Senate today. U.S. leadership \nabroad remains a vital national interest to the American people. My \nrecord as a United States Senator is strongly in support of a United \nStates fully engaged with the world, a country and a people that \nparticipate and lead the international efforts to address the many \nproblems that transcend borders and cultures.\n  NATO, since its founding in 1949, has been a successful foundation of \nU.S. security and cooperation with our European allies. This was \nparticularly true throughout the period of the Cold War. The collapse \nof the Soviet Union and communism can be partially credited to NATO; \nboth to the alliance's collective defense arrangements and to its \ncomplimentary role in bringing Europe together which has fostered \ndemocratic and economic ties among countries with historical and \ncultural grievances. NATO has played a significant role in creating a \nEurope free from serious conflict for nearly 50 years.\n  The Senate is now considering whether to enlarge the sixteen member \nalliance by admitting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Few will \ndeny that these three countries are prepared and committed to assuming \nthe responsibilities of NATO membership. Few will contest the statement \nthat these three countries have long ties to the West; that these three \ncountries are the most Western states of the former Soviet bloc. And \nfew will assert that these three countries face any military threat \nfrom Russia or other foe, either today or in the foreseeable future. I \nam confident that the enormous changes that have taken place in Poland, \nthe Czech Republic and Hungary will not be jeopardized by the upcoming \nvote. These changes including the creation of democratic institutions, \nnew respect for human rights, and a growing market economy all enjoy \nenormous public support and will be continued regardless of Senate's \ndecision on NATO expansion.\n  I do have a number of very serious concerns about NATO expansion \nincluding several which have been addressed through the amendment \nprocess. My concerns have very little to do with the three candidates \nfor NATO expansion. In fact, I believe the United States and our allies \nshould take aggressive steps to support these burgeoning democracies \nwhich have demonstrated so much promise since the fall of the Soviet \nUnion. Each of these countries has a remarkable story to tell and each \nis deserving of closer ties to the United States and the West.\n  I voted for the amendment offered by Senator Harkin to call for an \naccurate accounting of all expenses to the United States related to \nNATO expansion. The Senate and the American people ought to better \nunderstand the obligations we are assuming if we agree to NATO \nexpansion. I have no confidence in the various cost estimates\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nthat have been presented during this entire process. In fact, I am \nfairly certain the costs to U.S. taxpayers will exceed even the \nAdministration's highest estimates. The various cost estimates for NATO \nexpansion have ranged from $1.5 billion to $125 billion.\n  Opponents of the Harkin amendment argue that the U.S. is not issuing \na blank check on behalf of our taxpayers. Certainly, Congress will \nobject to escalating costs for NATO in the future and particularly if a \nsignificantly larger NATO burden falls upon the United States. However, \nmy concern is that without a full accounting of costs, the United \nStates is assuming a new moral and financial obligation to NATO without \nadequate consideration by the Senate. U.S. prestige and our position in \nthe world should not be risked at some future point because we did not \nknow or were not prepared to consider today the full costs on NATO \nexpansion.\n  The Moynihan amendment to link NATO expansion with admission to the \nEuropean Union also addresses my concerns regarding the most \nappropriate forum for integration between the West and the many former \nSoviet satellite states seeking closer ties with Western Europe and the \nUnited States. Senator Moynihan has been an articulate voice throughout \nthis debate and I do agree with many of the eloquent points he has \nbrought before the Senate. I voted for the Moynihan amendment as I \nbelieve European Union membership is the most appropriate of the \navailable forums for integrating with the West the three nations \ninvited to join NATO.\n  These three countries are in various stages of economic development \nand each is committed to improving the lives of its citizens through \ncloser ties to the West. In my mind, the European Union is a far better \nvehicle for economic growth and integration with the West. \nParticipation and inclusion in the EU and its marketplace will pay \ndividends for the people of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary that \nfar outweigh the security assurances inherent with NATO membership.\n  The European Union has begun negotiations for EU admission with \nPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary and several other countries. \nFrankly, I am very skeptical that the EU will in a timely manner admit \nnew members. The EU has a history of protected industries--particularly \nagriculture--and I doubt Europe's protected industries will be anxious \nto take on lower wage countries or significant agricultural producers. \nExport states here at home, like my state of Washington, have long \nsought to open Europe's protected market and system of state subsidies. \nWe should be careful not to aid or validate Europe's trade practices \nwhich have hurt the United States.\n  Admission to the EU is a question for EU countries to consider, \nhowever, I do not think we should give the EU the opportunity to settle \nfor NATO expansion. Europe has the strongest interest in the success of \nmany former Soviet states. The EU, including the European states who do \nnot belong to NATO, should also be expected to make sacrifices to \nensure a peace for all time in Europe.\n  My vote for the Moynihan amendment should be viewed as a call for new \nthinking on the shared objective of bringing the newly independent \nnations of Europe into the existing political and economic system. We \nhave to ask ourselves if the tools of the Cold War will work for the \nU.S. and Europe as we enter a new century.\n  The impact of NATO expansion on our relationship with Russia is my \nmost significant concern on this issue. I am delighted so many of my \ncolleagues have raised the issue, both those who favor expansion and \nthose who oppose it.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that the impact of the vote we are to cast \ntoday will have very little effect on the U.S.-Russia relationship. For \nI believe, from the very beginning of the expansion process, we have \npursued a process and a policy that has seriously damaged our \nrelationship with Russia. I believe the Administration has erred \ngreatly here and our foreign policy will be effected by it for years to \ncome regardless of the outcome of the NATO expansion vote.\n  Already, numerous Senators have cited the historic work of George \nKennan. I also take his counsel very seriously and I encourage my \ncolleagues to ponder his words from a 1997 New York Times opinion \npiece. Mr. Kennan wrote, ``Expanding NATO would be the most fateful \nerror of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era. Such a \ndecision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and \nmilitaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect \non the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of \nthe cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign \npolicy in directions decidedly not to our liking.''\n  Kennan's final words are particularly troubling as he states, ``. . . \nto impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our \nliking.'' One needs only look at recent weapons inspection crisis with \nIraq to see the worsening ties between the U.S. and Russia as a result \nof NATO expansion. There are other examples of the growing divide \nbetween the U.S. and Russia: cooperation with Iran on ballistic \nmissiles, agreements with China to counter a world with one superpower, \nand an assortment of other nuclear weapons related issues from \ndeclarations on the first use of nuclear weapons to ratification of \nSTART III and the eventual negotiation of START. All of these issues \nare vital to the United States and all have been negatively impacted by \nNATO expansion.\n  It goes without saying that Russia does not dictate to the United \nStates our foreign policy interests and policies. However, U.S. policy \nmakers should not underestimate the degree to which Russia matters to \nour own future. Russia is the largest nation in a new Europe. Any \nattempt to guarantee the future peace and security of Europe by \nexcluding Russia creates more problems than promise for the future.\n  NATO Expansion fails to consider the political landscape of Russia. \nApproximately two-thirds of the Russian Duma is controlled by communist \nand nationalist parties. These political parties are very anti-American \nand the West. The Russian Constitution grants enormous powers to the \nPresidency that have allowed the West to underestimate Russia's \nopposition to NATO Expansion.\n  My fear is we have undermined those in Russia who are advocating and \nfollowing the course of democracy, international cooperation and \neconomic reform. I hope the Senate does not revisit the words of George \nKennan with immense regret in future years. The Administration and the \nSenate now must take it upon themselves to rebuild those ties with \nRussia to go forward and address our many shared interests for the \nfuture. Vice President Gore has been instrumental in building ties \nbetween our two countries, and I certainly encourage him to continue \nhis leadership role with Russia's new prime minister.\n  I have discussed in detail my concerns with NATO expansion. This has \nbeen a very difficult decision for me. In the end, I was swayed by one \nadditional, very powerful concern.\n  This powerful concern is for U.S. credibility. I do believe U.S. \ncredibility is on the line with this vote. Regardless of the wisdom of \nNATO expansion, I fear that rejection of NATO expansion at this point \nwill send dangerous messages to the world about U.S. intentions for the \nfuture. The international community will view a rejection of this \ninitiative which was started and driven by the United States as a sign \nof U.S. isolationism. Allowing that message to be sent around the world \nwill, in my mind, be far more damaging to U.S. interests worldwide than \nadmitting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  Quite frankly, I think the Administration has marginalized the United \nStates Senate on the question before us today. While I doubt that the \nAdministration intended to do this and I know the Senate has been \nactive and engaged throughout this process, the result is the same. The \nSenate, as I see it, has little choice in the matter before the body \ntoday. To reject NATO expansion at this point will also cause serious \nlong-term problems for U.S. interests throughout the world.\n  Therefore, I will vote for NATO expansion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, the Minority manager of the \nresolution of ratification regarding NATO enlargement.\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\n  I had planned to submit an amendment to the resolution of \nratification as I discussed in my floor speed of October 27, 1997. This \namendment, simply put, would express the Sense of the Senate that the \nUnited States should consult with all NATO member nations, subsequent \nto the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic but prior to \nthe consideration of any other nation for accession, concerning the \ndesirability of establishing a mechanism to suspend the membership of a \nNATO member if it no longer conforms to the Alliance's fundamental \nprinciples of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.\n  Mr. President, I raised this issue with former Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger when he testified before the Armed Services Committee \non January 29th. In response to my question as to whether NATO should \nhave a mechanism to suspend a member, Secretary Kissinger stated:\n\n       I think in situations in which a government emerges \n     incompatible with the common purpose of the Alliance, there \n     ought to be some method, maybe along the lines you put \n     forward. I have not thought this through, but I fully agree \n     this is a very important issue which does not apply to any of \n     the new countries that are now before us.\n\n  I also raised the issue of establishing a mechanism for suspending a \nNATO member with former Secretary of Defense William Perry when he \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee on March 19th. I posed \nthe question in the context of a NATO nation that no longer conforms to \nNATO's fundamental principles but still has a veto over NATO \noperations. Secretary Perry stated:\n\n       That is a very good question, Senator Levin. What you are \n     describing is a problem--in fact, I would call it a flaw--in \n     the original NATO structure, the NATO agreements. And, in my \n     judgment, this is a problem which should be addressed. It has \n     been a problem for many, many years. And, therefore it is \n     important, in addressing that problem to separate it from the \n     issue of NATO accession. I would not in any way want to tie \n     that issue to the NATO accession issue.\n       We could have predicted several decades ago that that would \n     cause a problem, there would be some major issue come up on \n     which we could not reach consensus, and that would bring NATO \n     to a halt, or that some member would depart from the NATO \n     values. Happily that has not happened. But it is a potential \n     problem, and I think we ought to address it.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to offer this amendment at this time \nbecause it has nothing to do with Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic \nand I do not want to suggest or imply any such connection. \nNevertheless, I do believe it is an issue that needs to be raised \nwithin NATO councils. I believe it should be resolved before any \nadditional accessions to NATO are considered. And so, I would ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware if he believes this is a matter \nthat merits consideration?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree with the Senator from Michigan that this is an \nimportant matter that raises fundamental issues for the United States \nand our Allies. I believe that this is a matter that merits careful \nconsideration within NATO councils. It would certainly be preferable \nfor NATO to discuss this in a careful and measured way now, rather than \nto be faced with the issue at some future time when an emergency \nsituation exists. I want to commend the Senator from Michigan for \nraising this matter. I also commend him for not seeking to amend the \nresolution of ratification, for, as he has correctly noted, this issue \nis not related to Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have voiced a number of concerns with regard to the \nAdministration's open-door policy on NATO enlargement, and in \nparticular the implementation of that policy with regard to the Baltic \nstates.\n  Over the last few days, the Administration and Sen. Biden and his \nstaff have worked closely with myself and my staff to address my \nconcerns.\n  I wish to confirm with Sen. Biden and Sen. Helms that my \nunderstanding of certain provisions in the NATO resolution, as modified \nby the Manager's Amendment, is correct.\n  First, there is the issue of consultations with the Senate. I \nunderstand that the Resolution, as clarified by the Manager's \nAmendment, states that the Senate will be consulted prior to the U.S. \nconsenting to invite any European state to begin accession talks with \nNATO, as was done for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic at Madrid \nlast year. This would apply for the Baltic states, and for any other \nEuropean state seeking admission to NATO. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Second is the issue of U.S. security commitments. The \nNATO resolution contains a provision stating that only ``a consensus \ndecision by the full membership of NATO, approved by the national \nprocedures of each NATO member * * * will constitute a security \ncommitment pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty.'' This means that a \npolitical document, like the Baltic Charter, which has not been \napproved by the Senate pursuant to constitutional treaty-making \nprocess, does not constitute a U.S. security commitment to the Baltic \nstates. Is my understanding of that provision correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The third concern that I wish to address is whether the \nUnited States, in signing the Baltic charter, has ``pre-committed'' to \nsupport Baltic membership in NATO in the future. The Resolution, as \nmodified, contains a provision to the effect that, other than Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic, the United States has not consented or \ncommitted to invite any other country to join NATO in the future. My \nunderstanding of this provision is that it reflects the fact that the \nBaltic Charter of Partnership does not constitute a U.S. pre-commitment \nto NATO membership for the Baltics, and that presently the United \nStates has not consented or committed to support NATO membership for \nany European state (other than Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic) \nthat may seek to accede to NATO. Is that understanding correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I want to begin my discussion of this \nvery important issue by commending the people of Poland, Hungary and \nthe Czech Republic for their brave and determined transition to \ndemocracy and free market economies. The citizens of these three \nnations have suffered grave injustices and brutal atrocities during \nWorld War II and the Cold War and now, to see these nations emerge from \nthese dark days and turn toward democracy, deserves the praise of every \nman and woman who cherishes freedom.\n  I also want to express my strong support for the security and \nindependence of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. I also believe \nthe United States and its military forces will support the independence \nof these nations whether or not they join NATO.\n  While I want to encourage the move toward democracy, free markets and \nWestern values in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, I also want \nto see these values take root in Russia. It is because of my concern \nthat a vote now on NATO expansion will hinder our relations with Russia \nand risk the Duma's ratification of the START II Treaty that I will \nvote against NATO expansion at this time.\n  I have spent a good deal of time and effort discussing the issue of \nNATO expansion with a number of U.S. foreign policy makers and military \nleaders. I have given this question a considerable amount of thought \nbecause I believe before the United States commits itself to defending \nadditional nations, with U.S. nuclear weapons if necessary, we must \ncarefully consider all of the ramifications of this action.\n  As I look at the current security situation in Central Europe, I do \nnot see a security threat that necessitates a vote to expand NATO \ntoday. What I do see however, is a weakened superpower in Russia with \nthousands of nuclear weapons that can reach the United States.\n  I think if anyone looks at the lessons of the end of the First World \nWar and the Treaty of Versailles, it shows that the harsh terms of the \npeace imposed on Germany fed the antagonisms that allowed Adolf Hitler \nto come to power. That, I believe, is the real threat we face today.\n  At present, we have an historic opportunity to bring Russia into the \nWest and cement Russia's commitment to freedom, democracy and free \nenterprise. On the other hand, we can expand NATO, right up to Russia's \nborder, and we can thereby inadvertently recreate a Russia that is a \nthreat to U.S. security and peace in Central Europe.\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\n  It is ironic that by adding Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to \nNATO we may create the security danger these nation's fear. More \nimportantly, by voting to expand NATO today I believe we run the risk \nof undercutting the supporters of democracy in Russia and fuel the \nfears of those who want to restore an aggressive, imperialist Russia \nthat will then require billions of dollars in additional American \ntaxpayer money to deter.\n  This is not idle speculation, this scenario is real and it is here \nnow. At present, the Russian Duma has refused to ratify the START II \nTreaty and this action has led the United States to maintain nuclear \narmed ICBMs, SLBMs and ballistic missile submarines that we would \notherwise deactivate under the START II treaty. In fact, the U.S. \nstrategic nuclear arsenal would drop from about 6,000 warheads under \nSTART I to 3,000 under START II. Department of Defense figures indicate \nby fiscal year 2000 it will cost hundreds of million of dollars to keep \nthe U.S. nuclear arsenal at a START I level.\n  While we wait for the Russian Duma to ratify START II, the Secretary \nof Defense, our friend Bill Cohen, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General Shelton, believe that we must keep our forces at a \nSTART I level to keep the pressure on the Russia Duma to ratify the \ntreaty.\n  Therefore, when the supporters of NATO expansion discuss the costs \nassociated with adding Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the \nalliance, I would ask that they add the cost of keeping U.S. nuclear \nforces at a START I level to their calculations. Let the record show, \nno Administration official has stepped forward to argue that a Senate \nvote to expand NATO will encourage the Russian Duma to ratify START II.\n  In fact, in a conversation I and several members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee had with Alexie Arbatov, a member of the Russian \nDuma and a democratic reformist, Mr. Arbatov told us that NATO \nexpansion undercuts democratic reformists ability to promote \ncooperation between NATO allies and Russia. He continued to tell us \nthat expansion of NATO to include these three countries will delay \nRussian ratification of START II.\n  The Washington Post recently included two articles describing the \ndegraded state of Russia's nuclear arsenal. These articles also confirm \nthe extensive testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwhich documents Russia's growing reliance on nuclear weapons.\n  As my colleagues, know, Russia's economic problems have resulted in a \nhuge reduction in that nation's conventional capability. This reality \nhas led Russian policy makers to enunciate a policy stressing a \nreliance on nuclear weapons to defend Russia's security interest.\n  We therefore find ourselves in a situation, under the proposed NATO \nexpansion, where we are extending the U.S. nuclear umbrella closer to \nRussia's border, and literally to Russia's border in the Kaliningrad \nprovince which borders Russia, at a time when Russia is increasing its \nreliance on weapons of mass destruction to defend its interests.\n  Given Russia's growing reliance on nuclear weapons, I believe it is \ndangerous for the United States to push the border of NATO eastward to \nRussia's border at this time.\n  Administration officials tell us NATO expansion is not directed \ntoward Russia, indeed some offer the hope that Russia will eventually \njoin NATO, but I ask these officials do the Poles, the Hungarians and \nthe Czechs believe NATO is their defense against Russia? Of course they \ndo!\n  I also question the logic of those who say Russia is free to join \nNATO. If Russia is allowed to join NATO, what is the real mission of \nNATO? If Russia and everyone else who wants to is allowed to join NATO, \nis NATO still a self-defense alliance or is it then a new version of \nthe United Nations?\n  I believe NATO expansion at this time will decrease U.S. national \nsecurity because I believe it will hinder joint U.S.-Russian efforts to \nstop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. According to a February \neditorial in the New York Times by Howard Baker, Sam Nunn, Brent \nScrowcroft and Alton Frye, ``frictions over NATO distract Moscow and \nWashington from profound common dangers.'' At the top of the list of \nthe ``profound common dangers'' is the threat of the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction. This enormous challenge begins with our effort to \ncontrol the nuclear weapons, nuclear materials and nuclear scientists \nin Russia. All of these crucial non-proliferation programs require the \nactive cooperation of Russia and a vote today to expand NATO does not \ncontribute to this cooperation.\n  As it stands today, even my good friends on the other side of this \nissue will agree Russia's conventional forces are weak and getting \nweaker. Russia's plans for new conventional weapons systems are slowed \nand reduced. Russia cannot afford to regularly pay the members of her \narmed forces. Instead, Russia has turned efforts inward to refocus and \nrebuild their country; and, with our help, Russia may reemerge with a \nstrong market economy rooted in freedom and democracy. Without a doubt, \nRussia's continued evolution toward the West will have the greatest \nimpact on long term U.S. security.\n  Mr. President, I support efforts by the United States and the \nEuropean Union to help Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to become \nstrong democracies with robust market economies. But I also want Russia \nto continue on the road to freedom and democracy so I therefore will \noppose the resolution to expand NATO at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the expansion of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization to include the Czech Republic, Poland and \nHungary. The inclusion of these three countries will alter the \nAlliance, but the benefits clearly make this expansion both timely and \nworthwhile.\n  In 1949, if the founders of NATO had been asked to predict where the \nalliance would be five decades later, few if any could have foreseen a \nmore extraordinary success. The NATO nations stood firmly together as \nthe great bulwark against communism during the Cold War. NATO is, \nwithout doubt, the most successful security alliance in history.\n  The original purpose of NATO was to protect the West against the \nformer Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations. Now, even though the \nCold War is over, NATO continues to be essential. It makes sense to \nadopt this modest expansion of the Alliance beyond its Cold War borders \nto include three nations which were once part of the Warsaw Pact.\n  The greatest threats to European security are now the long-standing \nethnic conflicts that have simmered inside many of these nations for \ncenturies. Two world wars in this century began in Central Europe. \nExtension of NATO's security umbrella to these three additional nations \nwill place them in a part of Europe where wars no longer happen.\n  Obviously, there are concerns about the expansion of NATO that \nCongress and the country must be sensitive to--especially the potential \nimpact of this expansion on our relationship with Russia.\n  We have rightly spent much of the past decade and billions of U.S. \ntaxpayers' dollars in working with Russia to achieve nuclear arms \nreductions and to help Russia safeguard its nuclear arsenal and its \nnuclear materials. Russian cooperation with the U.S. under the \nComprehensive Threat Reduction Program and our bilateral nuclear arms \nreduction treaties with Russia have substantially reduced the chance of \nnuclear war. In my view, anything that would disrupt or harm this vital \nprogress would be a fateful error.\n  Many of Russia's leaders do not support NATO's invitation to Poland, \nHungary or the Czech Republic. But the addition of these countries to \nNATO poses no threat to Russia. I commend President Clinton for his \neffective leadership in making this point clear. We must continue to \nwork to assure President Yeltsin and other Russian leaders that the \nexpansion of NATO is not a danger to their country or their security. \nWe must do all we can to address Russia's concerns and increase our \ncooperation in all key areas with Russia to ensure that our goal of a \nmore secure future is achieved.\n  We must also deal with the concerns over costs, especially the costs \nthat Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will have to bear to \nupgrade their military forces to NATO standards.\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nThese costs will inevitably have to compete with pressing domestic \nneeds in those countries.\n  Together, these three nations will have to spend as much as $14 \nbillion over the next 10 years to meet NATO standards. These costs are \nthe responsibility of these prospective new members. They committed to \npay these costs when they asked to become members of NATO. The U.S. \nalready pays 25% of NATO's commonly-funded expenses. NATO expansion \nshould not impose costly new burdens on U.S. taxpayers.\n  Nevertheless, these countries are on the right track, and so is NATO. \nThis expansion of NATO is amply justified. Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic will strengthen NATO. They are solid democracies, and \nthey will make our alliance for peace even stronger. Their rightful \nplace is in NATO, and I urge the Senate to support this Resolution of \nRatification.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, later this evening the Senate will conclude \ndebate on a resolution of ratification authorizing the United States to \nsupport the entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n  The decision that the Senate takes with respect to this resolution \nwill have an historic impact on the future of Europe and the nature of \nthe Transatlantic partnership that will take us into the next \nmillennium.\n  Without question, NATO has been the singularly most successful \nalliance for mutual defense in modern history since its establishment \nin 1949. For nearly fifty years it has served as a bulwark against \ncommunism, and as a deterrent against threats posed by the Soviet Union \nand its Warsaw Pact satellites.\n  Today the world has changed. The Soviet Union no longer exists, and \nthe Warsaw Pact is fast becoming a mere footnote in our history books. \nIn that context, it seems to me to be a particularly appropriate moment \nto review whether and how NATO's role should evolve, to keep pace with \nthe changing political landscape.\n  Some changes have already been undertaken by NATO. For example, not \ntoo long ago NATO members agreed that it was an appropriate mission for \nNATO forces to assist with efforts to implement the Dayton Peace \naccords in war torn Bosnia.\n  Certainly the debate this week is as much about such matters as it is \nwhether Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic will be good NATO \npartners.\n  The debate is also about the merits of admitting additional members \nbeyond these three--and the order and timing for doing so. And, it is \nabout the budgetary implications of an enlarged organization with an \nexpanded land area requiring collective defense. Finally, it is about \nthe impact on U.S. and NATO's relations with Russia and other NIS \ncountries and the implications for internal Russian political \nstability.\n  These are all important and legitimate areas for discussion. The \nSenate's debate on these questions has been thoughtful and \nconstructive. Senators Warner, Moynihan, Harkin and others have asked \nsome very important questions that deserve answers before moving \nforward to take NATO from 16 to nineteen members and beyond. It would \nbe foolhardy not to carefully assess these matters before making \nchanges to NATO.\n  I agree with those who have held up a yellow flag urging caution. \nCertainly it behooves us to act judiciously in reshaping NATO to ensure \nthat whatever we do does not undermine the effectiveness or efficiency \nof the current organization. Nor should we foster expectations in \nEastern and Central Europe that cannot be fulfilled--or create \nadditional and unnecessary financial burdens on existing or new \nmembers.\n  I also believe that it is important that we take into account the \nimplications for our current and future relations with Russia and other \nformer Soviet states. And particularly with respect to Russia's \ncontinued willingness to move forward to ratify Start II and other \nfuture arms control agreements.\n\n  While I agree with those who suggest it would be wrong to give Moscow \nveto power over NATO decisions--on the other hand, I see nothing to be \ngained from causing unnecessary uncertainty or anxiety with respect to \nour intentions toward Russia.\n  After the many hours of debate we have had on the pending measure, I \nbelieve a strong case has been made in favor of admitting these three \nnew members. Foreign policy experts and scholars who have spent a great \ndeal of time studying NATO over the years make a persuasive case in \nsupport of expansion.\n  I also believe that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary \nof Defense Bill Cohen, together with other Clinton Administration \nofficials, have during hours and hours of Congressional testimony made \na very compelling case in favor of ratification of the pending \nprotocols. Former Presidents Bush and Carter have endorsed the \nPresident's decision. As have a number of our distinguished former \nSecretaries of State and former members of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. They have also adequately addressed concerns that have been \nraised with respect to NATO expansion.\n  During the July 8, 1997 Madrid Summit, NATO heads of state, including \nPresident Clinton reached common agreement at that time to invite \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join the organization, while \nleaving open the door to other interested governments. However, no \ncommitment was made with respect to the sequence or timing of such \nadditions.\n  That was appropriate in my view. It goes without saying that we must \nassess any impact of enlarging NATO by three on that organization's \nability to continue to fulfill its primary mission--namely collective \nself-defense--before moving forward to consider additional new members.\n  Realistically, such an assessment is likely to take three or more \nyears by my estimation--in line with the time frame fame Senators \nWarner and Moynihan have included in their so called pause reservation. \nHaving said that, I really do not think it necessary to codify this \ntime frame into a binding proposition. In fact, the time period could \neven turn out to be longer than three years. Were we to codify the time \nperiod, we might in fact be creating false expectations in the minds of \ncountries waiting to join that invitations will automatically be \nforthcoming once three years have elapsed. It was for those reasons \nthat I voted against this amendment earlier today.\n  It is important as we review the current structure, purpose, and \nmembership of this important organization that we remain mindful of the \ncentral proposition--the organization's relevance to today's and \ntomorrow's realities. We should ask as well whether and what changes \nbest further U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Only \nafter such questions have been fully explored should we move forward to \nalter NATO.\n  I believe that during the course of the current debate we have \nexhaustively reviewed the implications and U.S. interests at stake with \nrespect to the pending protocols. I am satisfied that the addition of \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO will enhance U.S. \nnational security and foreign policy interests by strengthening and \nfostering European unity and security.\n  There is little doubt in my mind, Mr. President, about the likely \noutcome of the final vote on this matter. In my judgement the United \nStates Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification, and \nthereby authorize the United States to consent to the admission of \nthese three members.\n  Mr. President, I will join my colleagues in voting aye on this \nmatter. To do otherwise would severely undermine the cohesive support \nthat has existed for NATO since its establishment in 1949 and leave us \nill prepared to promote a strong, secure, and united Europe in the 21st \ncentury.\n\n\n                      the cost of nato enlargement\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no more complex issue than the \nfinancial cost of NATO enlargement.\n  Over the past two years there have been several studies by private \nand by governmental organizations, which have yielded widely differing \nestimates.\n  The highest figure reached one hundred twenty-five billion dollars \nover ten years, with over thirty billion of that accruing to the United \nStates. The most recent--and I believe the best--estimate is NATO's own \ncost study, which estimates only one-and-a-\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nhalf billion dollars in direct costs over ten years. According to the \nlatest estimate, the expected U.S. contribution to the direct costs of \nenlargement are estimated to average forty million dollars per year for \nten years.\n  There are good reasons for the vast disparities in the estimates--\nbasically there was a lot of ``apples and oranges'' mixing going on.\n  Explaining all this requires a fair amount of effort, which, I \nregret, some of the critics of enlargement either were unwilling to \ngive, or which they eschewed for the easier route of utilizing \nunexplained, raw data for partisan purposes.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to examine the cost issue.\n  The 16 NATO nations collectively spent about $455 billion on defense \nin 1997. Of that total approximately $1.6 billion goes to the NATO \ncommon budget.\n  What does the NATO common budget pay for? Let's take the airbase at \nAviano, Italy, as an example.\n  The host country, Italy, maintains an airbase that has been \ndesignated for NATO use. Italy pays for all costs related to the base \nexcept new construction and improvements that benefit the United States \nAir Force units stationed there. These improvements, above and beyond \nthe national needs of Italy, comprising some $260 million, are paid for \nby NATO's common budget.\n  One of NATO's founding principles was (and remains) equitable cost \nsharing--that is, nations make financial contributions to offset costs \nbased on their ability to pay.\n  In the 1950's, the U.S. paid almost 50% of NATO's operating costs. In \nthe 1960's, however, our European allies assumed about half of the \noriginal U.S. contribution in recognition of our worldwide security \ncommitments.\n  Since then, our overall national contribution to NATO's three common \nbudgets has been reduced to about one-quarter. Our allies account for \nthe other three quarters of NATO operating costs.\n  We participate in NATO at a reduced rate, but we receive security \nbenefits that far outweigh our financial contributions.\n  Let's take a closer look at where our annual contributions to NATO's \nbudget go.\n  NATO has three budgets, each supporting a distinct aspect of NATO \noperations.\n  NATO's Civil Budget pays for the operating costs of NATO's modest, \n1960's-vintage headquarters building plus associated staff in Brussels.\n  Additionally, there are numerous public information, political, and \nscientific activity programs supported by this budget, including \ncivilian elements of NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace activities.\n  The annual U.S. contribution is provided by the State Department.\n  NATO's Military Budget provides support for NATO's military \nheadquarter (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium, and other elements of the \nintegrated command structure.\n  This budget also supports operations of several key NATO military \nagencies, like the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency, the NATO C3 \nAgency, for example, and the costs of running the NATO AWACS fleet.\n  Annual contributions are paid from Department of Defense Operations \nand Maintenance funds.\n  NATO's Security Investment Program pays for construction of the \nfacilities and installations NATO uses to support alliance military \nactivities, such as command structure C3 support, force mobility \nprojects, and training facilities--in other words, infrastructure.\n  It is also used to support common-user procurements to meet priority \nmilitary requirements set by SACEUR and SACLANT, like integrated air \ndefense and interoperable communications systems.\n  U.S. contributions to this budget are obtained from Department of \nDefense Military Construction funds.\n  As I said, the U.S. pays approximately one-quarter of the overall \nNATO common budget.\n  If there were no enlargement in 1999, we would still expect to pay \nabout $458 million.\n  Now let's turn to the costs of enlargement. NATO has estimated that \nover 10 years, the cost to the NATO common-funded budgets will be about \n$1.5 billion.\n  While the amount may not be distributed evenly over 10 years, let's \naccept for the sake of discussion that it will.\n  This means that the U.S. quarter-share will be about $400 million \nover 10 years, or about $40 million a year.\n  This represents only a 9% increase in our total contribution to the \nNATO common-funded budgets.\n  Bearing in mind that the U.S. share of NATO's common-funded budgets \nrepresents only one-tenth of one percent of the current defense budget, \nI believe that enlargement expenditures are a pretty good deal.\n  The key questions for us should be: Is the $1.5 billion figure \naccurate? What is the U.S. share? and Is the U.S. share a fair share?\n  Anyone who has looked at this issue would, I believe, agree that it \nis extremely confusing.\n  There are lots of numbers out there on enlargement costs in addition \nto the $1.5 billion.\n  You will recall that the Administration told us in February 1997 that \nthe total cost of enlargement would be about $27 to 35 billion.\n  Let's look at those numbers.\n  First, as the General Accounting Office (GAO) has pointed out, the \nAdministration's estimate included two categories of costs that are not \ndirect enlargement costs.\n  The first was costs to current NATO members--$8 to 10 billion. These \nare the national costs the current allies needed to spend to meet their \ncommitments under the revised 1991 Strategic Concept to improve their \nmobility, reinforcement, and power projection capabilities.\n  They would incur these costs even if NATO did not enlarge.\n  That's why GAO said the Administration made a mistake in including \nthem in the February 1997 estimate.\n  The U.S. has already met its power projection requirements, so we \nwould not have additional costs in this area.\n  The second figure in the February 1997 estimate, which is not counted \nin the final NATO study, represented the costs to new members to \nrestructure and modernize their militaries--$10 to 13 billion.\n  They would incur these costs even if they did not join NATO.\n  Once again, this is why GAO said the Administration goofed in \nincluding these costs in their February 1997 estimate.\n  This leaves us with $9 to 12 billion in direct enlargement costs.\n  Of this $9 to 12 billion, the Administration said in February 1997 \nthat about 60% would be eligible for NATO common funding.\n  The rest of these direct enlargement costs would be picked up by the \nnew members.\n  For example, there is the procurement of something called \nIdentification of Friend or Foe (IFF) gear--you need to have it if \nyou're in the Alliance--but NATO common funding won't pay for it.\n  60% of $9 to 12 billion is about $5.5 to 7 billion.\n  This is the number we should start with when comparing the NATO \nestimate of common-funded costs of $1.5 billion.\n  What accounts for the difference? $5.5 to 7 billion versus $1.5 \nbillion?\n  I just talked about the top half of this chart * * * above the dash \nline.\n  Let's focus on why the Administration's $5.5 to 7 billion estimate \nand NATO's $1.5 billion estimate are different.\n  First, there is the matter of four versus three new members. The \nAdministration did its estimate several months before the decision in \nMadrid. The extra member counts for about $1.1 billion. That brings us \ndown to $4.9 to 6.2 billion.\n  The February 1997 estimate did not have the benefit of detailed \nresponses by the three to NATO's Defense Planning Questionnaire (DPQ) \nor the benefit of site visits to the three countries' facilities \nconducted by SHAPE military experts.\n  The infrastructure turned out to be much better than expected. This \nis a key point. In February 1997, we thought we had a lot of work to do \nto bring airfields up to NATO standards.\n  The reality is that a number of the Polish, Czech and Hungarian \nairfields are in very good shape. The earlier Administration \nassumptions about the capacity of the airfields to host NATO aircraft \nwere incorrect.\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\n  For example, during Partnership for Peace exercises, a Hungarian \nairbase successfully hosted a Dutch F-16 squadron, that is, the Dutch \nF-16s landed, were serviced and refueled, and took off again.\n  With regard to funding eligibility: The Administration assumed NATO \nwould pay for some works that NATO later determined were national \nresponsibilities.\n  There were also some pricing differences. The U.S. used generalized \ncost factors and pricing, while NATO used by-item, historical cost data \nfrom their files.\n  While there were some military requirements differences between the \nU.S. and NATO studies, these were modest and not operationally \nsignificant. What are we getting for $1.5 billion? Is it the right set \nof requirements? The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says it is. \nWhat are those categories?\n\n  C31 Requirements include: Cross border connections, transmission \nmedia, terminal and security equipment; Upgrades to military \nheadquarters interface equipment; C2 info systems, including the NATO-\nspecialized functional area sub-system; and a NATO satellite \ncommunications (SATCOM) terminal for Hungary.\n  Air Defense Requirements include: Air Sovereignty Operations Center \ncommunication links to airfields; NATO air defense ground environment \nC2 sites; Interface to the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System \n(AWACS); Installation of Combined Air Operations Centers in Hungary and \nPoland; Upgraded air defense radars; and Air Command and Control System \nacquisition.\n  Necessary reinforcement improvements (land, air & maritime facility \nupgrades) include: Tactical fighter airfields; An AWACS and air-\nrefueling forward operating base; Rail and storage facilities for land \nreinforcement; Petroleum, oil and lubricant facilities; and Maritime \nfacilities.\n  Training and exercise improvements include: Upgrades to air and \nground communications, Tank and vehicle wash facilities, Movement costs \nfor new allies' exercise participation, and Costs for minor \nconstruction and administrative travel.\n  Now I would pose the question: are these the right requirements.\n  I have confidence in the positive assessment of these requirements \ngiven by General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The Department of Defense has assured us that the scenarios which \nthese requirements have been planned against include robust \nassumptions.\n  These assumptions have changed from the Cold War assumptions of about \n40 to 60 divisions coming across the border with less than 24 hours' \nwarning, to scenarios of 10 to 20 divisions with 60 to 90 days' \nwarning.\n  We can discuss the specifics in a classified setting.\n  But I am satisfied that the requirements are based on reasonable \nassumptions, and that they include sound, worst-case analyses, given \nthe current security environment.\n  To sum up, the most recent NATO estimate of the direct costs of \nenlargement appears to be sound.\n  The annual costs of NATO enlargement to the United States are real, \nbut they are affordable, constituting only a tiny fraction of our \nannual defense expenditures. For them, we gain three loyal allies with \na quarter-million troops. The costs are, in short, a bargain.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is considering whether Poland, \nthe Czech Republic, and Hungary should be admitted to the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This is one of the most important \nforeign policy issues to be considered by the Senate in recent years, \nand the outcome will shape the future direction of NATO and our \nmilitary relationship with our European allies.\n  In addressing this question, we should begin with the fundamentals, \nby examining the past and future purpose of NATO. NATO is a collective \nsecurity military alliance, with the original purpose of defending \nWestern Europe from a possible attack by the Soviet Union and its \nallies in the Warsaw Pact. When considered from that perspective, NATO \nstands as one of the most stunningly successful alliances ever \nconceived. Not just because it maintained the peace for over forty \nyears--other alliances in human history have kept the peace for longer \nperiods of time. The success of NATO cannot be judged merely by time, \nbut also by the scope of its mission. For, unlike previous military \nalliances, NATO was not intended merely to prevent another conventional \nwar, but also to deter nuclear war. At stake was--and still is--nothing \nless than the preservation of global civilization, and the world owes a \ndebt of gratitude to the alliance and its leaders for maintaining the \npeace.\n  Some have argued that NATO also serves to maintain democratic \ntraditions, since its original purpose was to protect Western democracy \nfrom an attack by an authoritarian Warsaw Pact. Today, NATO continues \nto defend those democratic values, which are part of the criteria in \nthe decision to expand the membership of the alliance.\n  Nonetheless, NATO continues to be, first and foremost, a defensive \nalliance. Critics of NATO expansion question whether Russia perceives \nNATO to be defensive or offensive, and argue that the admission of the \nthese three new members will ``alarm'' Russia. These critics believe \nthat Russian nationalists will perceive the expansion of NATO to be the \nenlargement of an offensive alliance aimed squarely at the heart of \nRussia, rather than the enlargement of a defensive agreement among \nnations inclined to keep, not break, the peace.\n  The question of Russian nationalists, and their future role in their \nown country, speaks to the core of the issues surrounding the future of \nNATO. The question is not only how Russian nationalists react today, \nbut also whether the most militaristic and virulent nationalists might \ngain power in the future, and whether that could pose a renewed threat \nto peace in Europe.\n  Russia is unstable in virtually every societal area--her economy is \nweak, her military in shambles, and civil order is increasingly \ndominated by violence and corruption. Although we all sincerely hope \nthat this wounded bear will regain her health and settle into a \npeaceful way of life that protects the interests of all her citizens \nand which deals fairly and openly in the community of nations, it is \nnot at all clear that democratic traditions will survive within that \nnation for the next ten years. Some have argued that the expansion of \nNATO could be a factor in bringing the nationalists to power. The \navailable evidence suggests that this is not the case. The Yeltsin \ngovernment has publicly accepted the expansion of NATO, and public \nopinion polls indicate that the Russian populace is barely aware of \nthis question, and everyday Russians do not have strong opinions on the \nquestion of NATO expansion. They are far more concerned about bread and \njobs than they are about NATO.\n  If authoritarian nationalists are to gain power in Russia in the \nfuture, that sad scenario will be caused by the fundamental instability \nof Russian democratic institutions, and the general collapse of the \neconomy, not by NATO expansion. If nationalists seize power, and impose \na new militaristic dictatorship upon Russia, it will pose a new threat \nto the peace of Europe, and the continuation of NATO will be essential \nto again preserve that peace. We might again face the question of a \nnewly hostile Russia that possesses a still formidable arsenal of \nnuclear-tipped missiles.\n  I would also note that critics of NATO expansion argue this question \nboth ways. They argue that we dare not enlarge NATO because it might \nirritate or anger the most virulent of the Russian nationalists, yet \nthose same critics do not address the question of the threat posed by a \nfuture rise to power of those very same nationalists.\n  In the event of the rise to power of authoritarian nationalists in \nRussia, NATO would be strengthened by the admission of these three \nnations. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic occupy key \ngeopolitical positions in the heart of central Europe. For that reason \nalone, their addition to NATO is of strategic importance. These three \nnations have also met the criteria for membership, and their inclusion \nin NATO would more firmly cement their ties to the U.S. and Western \nEurope.\n  Another related question is whether we should enlarge NATO now, or \nwait until some undefined future date.\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n There is little to be gained through delay, since the Russian \ngovernment has largely accepted the addition of these three countries \nto NATO. The diplomatic and political conditions are not likely to be \nany better in the future, and there is a serious risk that \ncircumstances may only worsen. For example, if militaristic \nnationalists gained power in Russia in the future, they would likely \nvehemently object to any expansion of NATO. NATO would likely not act \nto expand the alliance in the face of such Russian opposition, fearing \nthat it might lead to renewed cold war tensions. The bottom line is \nthat we would not be able to expand NATO at the very time that such \nenlargement would be in our national interest. Under such \ncircumstances, NATO might deeply regret not including Poland, with the \ngeopolitically important Polish plain, as part of NATO.\n  It is probably true that some xenophobic Russian nationalists will \ntell their people that NATO enlargement poses a threat to their \ncountry. But we know, as do they, that this argument is entirely false. \nNATO is inherently a defensive alliance. Its military structure \nrevolves around the defense of its own territory, and not around the \nlaunching of offensive operations aimed at subjugating Russia. We \ncannot base our foreign policy upon the paranoid concerns of the \nopponents of democracy in Russia. They will advance arguments to \nundermine democracy and U.S.-Russian relations regardless of what we \ndo.\n  Another important question is whether there should be another round \nof NATO enlargement, and if so, which nations should be included. \nCritics of NATO expansion have argued that a decision to admit Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic implies yet another round of expansion, \nand that if we start down this path, we will inevitably include even \nmore nations into NATO.\n  In my opinion, there is nothing inevitable about this at all. I am \nvoting on the admission of three nations, and only three nations. My \nvote to admit those three does not imply either approval or disapproval \nfor any other nations. If this or any future administration decides to \nrecommend another round of countries for admission to NATO, that \nrecommendation must receive the consent of the Senate to become a \nreality.\n  I want to clearly separate our vote on enlargement today from any \nvote in the future on other nations. I recognize that there are deep-\nseated concerns about the possible future admission of the Baltic \nnations of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. These are important \nquestions, which would be carefully evaluated by the Senate, and any \ndecision involving the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic stands by itself.\n  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has performed a vital role in \nmaintaining the peace and deterring catastrophic nuclear war. I believe \nthat the enlargement of NATO, by including Poland, the Czech Republic, \nand Hungary, will further strengthen that role in the future. \nTherefore, I will cast my vote in favor of expansion.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of expanding the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic. It is the right thing to do, right now.\n  Fifty years ago, President Harry Truman perceived the very real \nthreat to our national interest posed by the rise of Soviet Communism \nin liberated Western Europe. He understood that although turning a \nblind, isolationist's eye to trans-Atlantic affairs may have seemed \nattractive in the short term, it could prove far more dangerous and \ncostly to American interests in the long term. Therefore, it was \nabsolutely in our national interest to promote and defend abroad our \nvalues of democracy and opportunity against an aggressive and \noppressive Soviet regime. To that end, we fashioned the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization--a collective security agreement with fifteen of \nour allies. With NATO, insuring that Western Europe's democracies \nflourish--and that its economies grow--became a top U.S. priority, and \nrightly so.\n  Fifty years later, the results are impressive and worth examining. By \ninstituting collective security among its member nations, NATO achieved \ncollective stability. This stability allowed Western Europe to enjoy \none of its longest periods of sustained peace and economic development \never. It has recovered remarkably from the scourge of two World Wars, \nand free markets have thrived inside of democratic institutions. NATO \nnot only deterred the Soviets from aggression, but so strong is our \nalliance that since its inception no NATO country has ever been \nattacked. Of course, this success has not been achieved without \nsacrifice or without cost. However, the price of peace is a mere \nfraction of the cost of war.\n  Clearly, the mission of NATO needs to be adapted to the post-Cold War \nworld. The threat is no longer the clearly defined ominous shadow of \nCommunism; but the threat of instability is just as real. The Cold War \nhas ended, and the Warsaw Treaty Organization has been dismantled, but \nnow is not the time for passive complacency. Just as the war-torn \ncountries of Western Europe did fifty years ago, the emerging \ndemocracies and economies of today's Eastern Europe need NATO security \nto rebuild and to thrive. And now, like then, it is in the national \ninterest of the United States that this occur.\n  Expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \nwill sustain current and future economic reforms. It will promote \ncooperation and peace among neighbors. NATO's presence also will fill a \ndangerous military and political vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe, \nand further cement European security by uniting East with West.\n  As well as increasing global security, NATO expansion will have \ntangible economic benefits. Free but untapped markets in this part of \nthe world hold tremendous economic potential for U.S. exporters. \nAnd undoubtedly, the prestige, the security, and the validation that \ncomes with NATO membership will have a profoundly positive \npsychological impact on the minds of foreign investors.\n\n  Throughout this process it was important that the invited nations \ndemonstrate that they are willing to make the sincere commitment \nrequired of NATO members, and it seems to me that they have. \nPolitically, economically, and diplomatically, the Czech Republic, \nHungary, and Poland show great promise that they will become strong \npartners in our alliance.\n  Poland, for example, has just witnessed its second democratic change \nof government since 1989 as a result of fully free and fair elections. \nIts new democratic constitution was approved last year by national \nreferendum. Economically speaking, Poland is sound. Its economy has \nbeen one of the fastest-growing in Europe since 1993, and the private \nsector now accounts for two-thirds of its gross domestic product. \nPoland has also codified civilian control and parliamentary oversight \nof its military. On the diplomatic front, Poland has resolved \noutstanding differences with its neighbors, including Ukraine, with \nwhom it recently signed a declaration of reconciliation. These \ndiplomatic efforts would not have been possible but for the promise of \nNATO expansion.\n  After forty years of dictatorship, democracy now reigns in Hungary. \nAll six of its parliamentary parties support entry into NATO. The \nHungarian government upholds human rights, freedom of expression, rule \nof law, and an independent judiciary, and it too has twice held free \nelections since the fall of Communism. While attracting almost $16 \nbillion of direct foreign investment, Hungary has engaged in a strict \nstabilization program and cut its budget deficits substantially. And on \nthe diplomatic front, Hungary has recently signed treaties with Romania \nand Slovakia, thus ending territorial disputes that had existed for \ngenerations. And the government has agreements with its neighbors, \nincluding Ukraine, to cooperate against organized crime, terrorism, and \ndrug trafficking.\n  The story is much the same in the Czech Republic, which has a \nconstitution guaranteeing freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and \nfreedom of the press. Two national elections were held in 1996 for the \nlegislature, and they were free and fair. Since 1989, the Czech \nRepublic has engaged in tight fiscal policy, liberal trade practices, \nand privatization of state enterprises. As a result, unemployment is \nlow and inflation is controlled. It maintains\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nstrong relations with its neighbors, especially Germany--its leading \nforeign investor--and with Poland, as the two countries have harmonized \ntheir approaches to European Union and NATO membership.\n  I would now like to make some comments about some of the amendments \nwe have voted on.\n  First, I want to say that I opposed the amendment which would have \nlinked admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to admission \nto the European Union. While NATO and the EU have overlapping \nmembership, they have different missions. NATO is a collective defense \norganization designed to protect and defend the territory of its member \nstates. The EU is not a military but an economic alliance of European \nstates which does not include the United States. It also does not \ninclude Canada, Iceland, Norway--which by the way rejected EU \nmembership--nor does it include Turkey.\n\n  The question I have is why would we want to allow an organization of \nwhich the US is not a member, to dictate our security interests? \nAnother concern I have about this amendment is that it would \nultimately--and unnecessarily--delay NATO enlargement, since Poland, \nthe Czech Republic and Hungary are not members and have only recently \nbeen invited to begin the process of joining.\n  Second, I opposed the amendment which would have mandated a three \nyear pause on new members. Article 10 of the NATO charter provides a \nmechanism to enlarge the alliance. This article has successfully worked \nfor 50 years in bringing new member states into NATO. I strongly feel \nthat this amendment would not have helped NATO, but rather have added \nan additional and unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to the process.\n  The amendment also would have dampened the spirits of other countries \nwho eagerly want to join NATO. Many of these countries have made \nsignificant sacrifices--both political and economic--to prepare \nthemselves for future NATO membership. Enacting this amendment would \nhave reduced the incentives of these countries to continue these \nimportant reforms. I would like to point out, however, that there is no \ncommitment at this time to invite other nations to join NATO.\n  Let me conclude. Through democratic and economic reforms, these three \nnations have invested in long-term stability. NATO membership promotes \nconfidence in this regional stability, thus making it even stronger.\n  If this century has taught us anything, it is that European \ninstability ultimately becomes our problem. By admitting these \ncommitted and deserving nations to NATO, we will strengthen our \nalliance and expand the dividends of peace and prosperity to a level \nunprecedented in modern history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today regarding the topic before us: \nSenate ratification to amend the North Atlantic Treaty to allow for the \naccession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  I wish to commend Senator Helms and Senator Biden for their sustained \nefforts to investigate thoroughly the issues inherent in this historic \nmove.\n  As befits the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee has held numerous public hearings and \nprovided many briefings and reports giving consideration to all \naspects--and all views--regarding this historic move.\n  The Budget, Appropriations, Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees in both bodies of Congress have further contributed to this \nvaluable debate. Indeed, in the post-Cold War era in which we now find \nourselves, I don't believe any issue has been more thoroughly vetted, \nand I thank my colleagues and the leaders of the relevant committees \nfor their efforts.\n  I have lent a great deal of thought to this issue. Amid the euphoria \nof 1989, when many focused on the stunning collapse of Soviet \noccupation throughout central and eastern Europe, we had to recognize \nthat a yawning geopolitical vacuum had just opened. For the first few \nyears we correctly focused on assisting the Germans in their successful \nreunification efforts, but as nascent democratic and free markets \ninstitutions arose in central Europe, the United States stepped in to \nassist and solidify these developments.\n  The costs to us of solidifying these institutions were significantly \nless than the costs of waging the Cold War, but the benefits we saw--in \nterms of the freedom spread where darkness reigned for nearly half a \ncentury--were so much greater.\n  Mr. President, I have regularly visited the countries that will soon \nbe accepted as NATO's new members, sometimes on my own, sometimes with \nother members, and regularly with our delegations to the North Atlantic \nAssembly, recently under the leadership of my colleague Senator Roth. I \nhave met with their political leaders, their military representatives, \nand local analysts on many occasions, as I have sought to measure their \nlevel of democratic advancement.\n  In 1995, I was honored to address the first multinational graduating \nclass from the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest, \nHungary, where the FBI now works with law enforcement officials from \nthroughout central Europe to assist in combating criminal challenges to \nus all.\n  Democracy is strong in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The \nrule of law is established, civilian control of militaries is well-\nestablished, and these nations rightly take their place alongside the \nnations of the West.\n  There are a few voices, Mr. President, who argue that what the \nnations of central Europe need more than NATO membership is economic \ndevelopment. This is the essence of the amendment proposed by my \nrespected colleague, Senator Moynihan, which requires European Union \nmembership prior to the deposit of our instrument of ratification.\n  With great respect for the senior Senator of New York, I must \ndisagree: Yes, the countries of central Europe require economic \ndevelopment, but it is mistaken, in my view, to believe that economic \ndevelopment and geopolitical advantage are exclusive of each other.\n  The European Union has only planned for joint defense capabilities; \nNATO has preserved the territorial integrity for its members for nearly \nhalf a century. The European Union excludes the United States; but the \nUnited States leads NATO. Therefore, subjecting determinations for \nfuture NATO expansions to the European Union is not only unwise, it is, \nin my view, illogical.\n  Mr. President, you have heard this many times already in this debate, \nand I daresay you will hear it many more times. The North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization is the most successful treaty defense organization \nin human history.\n  Twice, before the founding of NATO, the United States was drawn into \nwars on the European continent, where we suffered huge losses of blood \nand treasure. An unbridled Germany and an unstable central Europe were \npredominant reasons for the calamities that became these world wars. \nThe accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to NATO in 1955 firmly \nestablished free Germany into the community of western democracies. \nWith the unification of Germany in 1990 following the collapse of the \nSoviet empire, the integration of Germany was complete. Throughout that \nperiod, NATO succeeded by the virtue of its defensive cohesiveness and \nits deterrent effect on the European continent.\n  Today, we are set to integrate three important nations of central \nEurope, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland. With their \nintegration, geopolitical space in central Europe will be firmly \nincorporated into the territory protected by the defensive military \nalliance of NATO.\n  As the report accompanying the resolution of ratification asserts \ncorrectly: ``With the enlargement of NATO, the United States and its \nallies have an opportunity to build a more stable Europe, to lock in \nthat stability, and to replace the dynamics of confrontation and \nconflict with trust and cooperation.''\n  Some have asserted that no threat exists to legitimize such an \nenlargement to the alliance now.\n  Mr. President, the extension of geopolitical stability in Europe is \nan insurance policy against the future development of regional threats. \nThe United States, and the United States Senate, should not need to \nwait for the development of an imminent threat in order to implement \nsound geopolitical strategy.\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n  NATO's mission has always been subject to certain applications beyond \nthe core mission to defend territory. These applications have reflected \nconsensus among members regarding military challenges, and I am \nhesitant to amend this resolution in any way that would impose \ndefinitions or mechanisms that might politicize the carefully honed \nlanguage of the original North Atlantic Treaty.\n  I believe the language of the resolution sufficiently asserts the \ncentral mission and strategic rationale for this enlargement.\n  It is entirely reasonable for the Senate to carefully review the \ncosts that this enlargement will incur.\n  Through the years of considering this move, many numbers have been \nmanufactured: the range has been startling and the spin has been \nconfounding.\n  I suppose it is somewhat predictable that attempts were made to \npoliticize these numbers, but the scrutiny of many committee hearings \nhave provided great focus. I am confident that the most recent GAO and \nCBO estimates are accurate: a total of $1.5 billion in increased U.S. \ncontributions over the next 10 years. For increasing the geopolitical \nstability well into central Europe, this is a sound and defensible \nexpenditure.\n  A great deal of debate has focused on the consequences of NATO \nenlargement on Russian geopolitical behavior and U.S.-Russian \nrelations.\n  I am not convinced of any direct causality between NATO's decision to \nenlarge and the content and direction of Russian foreign policy. I \nthink historians and analysts of Russia concur with my view.\n  Despite an unprecedented U.S.-Russia relationship that has developed \nover the past decade, a relationship that has seen billions of \nU.S. assistance go to the development of Russian democratic \ninstitutions, a relationship that has seen Russian and American troops \nserving side-by-side in Bosnia, some believe that this expansion of \nNATO will poison our efforts, or will, in the words of some, ``scare \nthe Russians.''\n\n  I have visited Russia many times in my career in the Senate, most \nrecently three weeks ago. Senator Gordon Smith, who is chairman of the \nEuropean Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and I had many meetings with the Russian foreign policy \nestablishment, including Deputy Foreign Minister Mamedov, responsible \nfor U.S.-Russia relations, and Andrey Kokoshin, Secretary of President \nYeltsin's Security Council. We met with a number of Duma and Federation \nCouncil members. We discussed many aspects of our bilateral relations, \nand NATO was reviewed in every meeting.\n  Every Russian official I met in Moscow objected to NATO enlargement. \nYet every official I met denied that they believed NATO posed a \nmilitary threat to Russia's territorial integrity, and every official I \nmet admitted that, despite being unhappy with this enlargement, they \nwere all reconciled to this development. Mr. President, no Russian--not \none--told me that NATO enlargement would be a legitimate cause for \nreversal of Russia's domestic evolution toward democracy.\n  Not one Russian official told me he was afraid of NATO enlargement. \nNot one Russian, Mr. President, objected to the new contiguous border \nbetween Poland and Kaliningrad.\n  I must admit that I find this objection raised by opponents to \nenlargement to be somewhat bizarre. Since Turkey's accession to NATO in \n1952, NATO had a long border with what was then the Soviet Union--we \nused to have nuclear-armed Jupiter missiles in that border country. We \nalso had a contiguous border between NATO and the Soviet Union along \nNorway's eastern border with the Kola peninsula, behind which the \nSoviet Union's strategic naval forces resided.\n  And now we have opponents objecting to a border with Kaliningrad, \nwhich is not contiguous with Russia itself? Or, even stranger, there \nare those who analogize the Kaliningrad situation with a Russian \nalliance with Mexico along our southern border.\n  Such an argument would have been denounced 15 years ago as ``moral \nequivalence.'' Today, the Kaliningrad argument is ahistorical and \nsimply dilatory.\n\n  Every Russian I met three weeks ago told me they still objected to \nNATO enlargement, but told me also they wanted to work with the \nFounding Act instrumentalities and were eager to continue and expand \nour many levels of bilateral cooperation.\n  The enlargement of NATO that this body will pass in the next few days \nis not short-sighted, Mr. President, but the most significant foreign \npolicy act before the end of this century.\n  It has been long-considered, and, frankly, desired even longer. I \nrecall the days when we looked across the Iron Curtain to countries we \nknew had once had Western, democratic societies.\n  I hope this is not the last enlargement, although I am confident that \nfuture enlargements, if they occur, will occur with the same detailed, \npainstaking consideration as we have conducted over the past four \nyears.\n  Over the course of this debate we will hear quoted many testimonials \nby Americans from all walks of life, both parties, and all regions in \nfavor of the move we will ultimately take.\n  It is particularly significant to me that the American Legion, as \nwell as the American Veterans of Foreign Wars, have endorsed NATO \nenlargement. These men and women know the territory; they know the \nhistory; and they know the price. I'm proud to be associated with them \non this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of this historic move. The \ncountries formerly imprisoned by the Soviets have come out of the cold, \nhave elected democratic governments that have established the rule of \nlaw, civilian control over their militaries and individual liberty and \nfree markets. They have all indicated strong support from their publics \nfor NATO membership and its responsibilities.\n  A geostrategic vacuum, long a source of instability on the European \ncontinent, is being filled--by an organization that is strictly \ndefensive, with absolutely no offensive intentions. The action this \nbody takes in the next few days--by ratifying this protocol to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty--will not only extend stability into central \nEurope, but will extend the promise of peace and stability into the \nnext century.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the order of \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution is open for general debate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to make some comments about NATO expansion, particularly as \nit relates to the resolution of ratification for protocols to the North \nAtlantic Treaty.\n  As was evident earlier, I had an amendment which was designed to \nchallenge a transformation of NATO that would take place as a result of \nthe resolution of ratification which would essentially expand the scope \nof NATO.\n  I would refer Members of the Senate to the New York Times of last \nFriday, April 24.\n  The editorial is identified as ``The Senate's Duty on NATO.'' It \nreads as follows:\n\n       The ratification resolution promiscuously opens the door to \n     NATO military actions almost anywhere in the world. That \n     startling expansion of NATO's license to conduct military \n     operations demands extensive debate.\n\n  Here you have the New York Times drawing attention to this expansion \nof NATO's scope and mission. It says that the mission of NATO is \nbeing--in the words of the New York Times--changed when the resolution \n``promiscuously opens the door to NATO military actions almost anywhere \nin the world.'' To change the nature of a treaty promiscuously, as the \nNew York Times suggests, without asking the Senate to ratify the \nchange, is a dangerous and troubling precedent. It is inappropriate.\n  I have raised this issue of NATO's broadened mission throughout the \ndebate on NATO expansion. I raised it before this New York Times \neditorial was published, but I am very pleased that they would draw \nattention to this ``startling expansion of NATO's license to conduct \nmilitary operations.'' I don't think you can expand a treaty's license \nto conduct military operations without consulting the Senate and \nobtaining this body's advice and consent.\n  The New York Times stated this issue demands extensive debate. I \nproposed that we debate it, and I proposed\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nthat we curtail this expansive extension of the ability of the NATO \nalliance to be involved in military operations around the world, \nregardless of whether they are related to NATO's collective defense \nmission. Frankly, I am very disappointed that the Members of the Senate \nhave not engaged in extensive debate in this area--an area in which the \nSenate has been largely ignored by an administration which seeks to \ntransform NATO into an entirely new organization. Treaty creep is what \nis occurring and NATO is being altered from a defense of territory \norganization to a defense of interest organization. The interests of \nNATO nations can be pursued around the globe, with international \ndeployments of NATO forces not necessarily for the defense of NATO \nterritorial integrity or political independence.\n  The New York Times properly says this expansion of NATO's scope \ndemands extensive debate. I am sorry to say that the Senate decided to \nwalk away from its obligation to oversee the ratification of this \nfundamental change in the treaty. By tabling the amendment, the Senate \nhas failed to address an issue of fundamental importance for the future \nstrength of NATO and the security of the United States.\n  It is not every day that I agree with the New York Times, but I think \nthe article is insightful and clear on this point. I would like to take \njust a few minutes--and I will use some of these charts--to indicate \nthe missed opportunity of the Senate to look carefully at what is \nhappening to the mission of NATO. I intend to vote against the \nratification of this treaty, if for no other reason than the \npromiscuous expansion of NATO's mission endorsed in this resolution of \nratification. This shift from a defense of territory to a defense of \ninterests is a tremendous question that must be addressed with regard \nto the future of NATO.\n  Let me just refer the Senate to the statement of William Perry, the \nimmediate past U.S. Secretary of Defense. He was one of the architects \nof the treaty expansion that is before us. Here is what he says:\n\n       The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the \n     Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant.\n\n  Then he goes on.\n\n       The original geographical area of NATO responsibility is no \n     longer sufficient. The original military structure of NATO is \n     no longer appropriate. . . . The new missions of NATO--\n\n  You know, this debate hasn't been about new missions. This debate has \nbeen about three new countries. But here the architect of the expansion \nsaid:\n\n       The new missions of NATO should be preventive defense--\n     creating the conditions for peace in Europe . . . the \n     geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere in the \n     world . . . .\n  That means the ambit of deployment, the arena for the deployment of \nNATO troops, including young men and women from the United States, is \nanywhere in the world. I think before we make that kind of change, we \nought to think very carefully. No wonder the New York Times says, \n``That startling expansion of NATO's license to conduct military \noperations demands extensive debate.'' I shudder to think that we \nconsider tabling ``the most extensive debate.''\n  But here is what the Secretary of State had to say. Secretary \nAlbright, according to the Washington Post:\n\n       . . . also has urged that an expanding North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization . . . must extend its geographic reach \n     beyond the European Continent and evolve into a `force for \n     peace from the Middle East to central Africa.'\n\n  All of us want to see peace around the world. We all want peace in \nthe Middle East. We all want peace in central Africa. But if we allow a \ntreaty to evolve through treaty creep, letting it expand on its own \nrather than having a real discussion on the role and responsibility of \nthe United States and NATO and its proposed new missions of serving as \na force for peace from the Middle East to central Africa, then we are \nnot fulfilling our responsibility as members of this body.\n  It is sad that the Senate of the United States decided to turn its \nback from that kind of discussion and decided that it would table that \ndebate. This is a serious matter, whether we are going to be sending \nyoung men and women of the United States of America to perhaps stain \nthe soil of Africa under some NATO mission, perhaps an international \npolicing operation not envisaged in the NATO treaty. Such operations \nwere never before thought to be within NATO's scope, because the \nalliance was explicitly for the defense of territory.\n  Now, by expansion of NATO's mission through press release and speech, \nthe Secretary of State says we are going to be involved in central \nAfrica and the Middle East in ways we had not ever anticipated. This \ntreaty is changing in fundamental ways. If we allow NATO's expanded \nmission to be achieved through the unilateral press release, statement, \nand policy of this administration, what is the value of the U.S. Senate \nin giving its advice and consent to treaties? If the Senate does not \nfulfill its role, perhaps it would just take a single treaty that any \nadministration then could evolve into whatever it chose. I think we \nought to think seriously about allowing an organization, the most \nsuccessful military collective defense organization in the history of \nthe world, to be simply evolved into something for which it was never \nintended.\n  Just to make it clear that it was never intended, let me refer you to \nthe statement of Senator Tom Connally. Tom Connally is not one of our \ncontemporaries but was a Senator, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in the year 1949, when the NATO alliance first came into \nexistence. Here is what Tom Connally said: ``Let us not forget''--\nawesome words, because I think we are in the process of forgetting--\n``that this treaty is limited in scope.''\n  It was to be limited to North Atlantic Treaty Organization member \nstates. Now we are talking about anywhere in the world. We are talking \nabout beyond Europe to central Africa.\n  This treaty is limited in scope. [I quote again Senator Connally.] \nIts main purpose is to maintain the peace and security of the North \nAtlantic area. We do not propose to stretch its terms to cover the \nentire globe.\n  The elasticity of stretched treaties has reached new limits, or \nperhaps has found no limits in what we are willing to do here today. \nThe suggestion of the New York Times that this kind of expansion, this \npromiscuous opening of the door to military deployments around the \nworld, doesn't merit discussion at all, it merited tabling--this is a \nsad day. A global NATO? That is not what Tom Connally thought we had.\n  As a matter of fact, NATO's first strategic concepts really focused \non two things, ``Defense planning limited to the defense of the treaty \narea,'' and, ``NATO military authorities have no responsibilities or \nauthority except with respect to incidents which are covered by \narticles V and VI of the North Atlantic Treaty.'' It was a defense of \narea treaty. It wasn't to be an alliance the troops of which could be \ndeployed like a mini-United Nations, with a standing army, to the hot \nspots around the globe for so-called international policing or so-\ncalled peacekeeping. It was to be something that defended the NATO \nnations. And to change this essential mission for NATO, I contend, \nshould come before the Senate for its advice and consent.\n  However, these strategic concepts of the past have been superseded by \nthe Strategic Concept of 1991. Here, instead of having the defense of \nterritory as being primary, we find ``to provide one of the \nindispensable foundations for a stable security environment in \nEurope''--all of Europe this time, not just the NATO nations--``in \nwhich no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any European \nNation.'' This is treaty creep. We have gone from the member nations of \nNATO to the European Continent as a whole to ``stop intimidation'' and \n``coercion''.\n  The first priority in the 1991 Strategic Concept is to expand beyond \nthe member nations of NATO. Talk about the latitude to deploy troops \nthroughout Europe, and we have seen out-of-area deployments become the \nprimary focus of the NATO alliance.\n  No. 2, ``to serve as provided for in article IV of the North Atlantic \nTreaty, as a transatlantic forum for allied consultations on any issues \nthat affect their vital interests.''\n  Oh, no, we have moved from defense of territory and the defense of \nthe political integrity of member nations to the defense of vital \ninterests. I suppose ``vital interests'' could include trade\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\ninterests or interests in humanitarian concerns or interests in \ncultural exchanges. We find ourselves with a real potential for the \nexpansion of the scope of this treaty.\n  All of a sudden, the collective defense of the territory of the NATO \nnations is no longer the prime task, according to the Strategic \nConcepts of 1991. Where do we find the collective defense? We find them \ndown in 3 and 4. They have been placed at the bottom of the list.\n  There is a new agenda for NATO nations. Not the defense of territory, \nit is the defense of ``vital interests.'' No wonder they are talking \nabout deploying troops in Africa in international policing operations. \nNo wonder Secretary Perry talked about deploying troops around the \nglobe. The NATO nations could have commercial interests and trade \ninterests around the world.\n  Some would say this expansion of mission is an appropriate thing. I \nthink when the New York Times said this demands extensive debate, they \nweren't ruling out such an expansion of mission out of hand. I don't \nthink setting NATO on a course to become a mini-U.N. with a standing \narmy is a good thing, and, as the New York Times points out, we should \nat least have an extensive debate before NATO takes this step. When the \ntime came this evening to look carefully at this, we found the Senate \nsaying, ``We'll table it; we won't consider it.'' As we all know here, \na motion to table cuts off debate. It doesn't provide for debate.\n  Let me just say, when the treaty was entered into, it was pretty \nclear what territory was covered. Article VI defined the territory that \nwas to be defended:\n\n       Any of the parties in Europe or North America, on the \n     Algerian Departments of France, on the territory of Turkey, \n     or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the \n     parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of \n     Cancer.\n\n  Sounds like the legal description of a deed to the house. It is \nspecific; it is particular. It doesn't say you deploy resources all \naround the globe to protect interests. It says that resources are to be \nused to defend territory. We have seen this change, and it is reflected \nover and over again.\n  The point that I am making is that when you change the nature of a \ntreaty, you have a responsibility, at least as members of the United \nStates Senate, to do so carefully. We didn't even have debate on this \namendment today. We simply had a motion to table the amendment in haste \nto move on to other things.\n  Here is what happens when you cut defense and you start thinking \nabout global deployments. One of the things I fear is that the same \nproblem that has attended the deployment of our own Armed Forces around \nthe world in peacekeeping and policing operations could happen to NATO. \nAnd you know, our Armed Forces are threatened because we have a \ntremendous willingness in the administration to deploy, but not much \nwillingness to fund. We cut the funding and cut the funding and cut the \nfunding, and we keep sending more troops to different places. As this \nadministration has slashed defense spending, one wonders whether the \nresource that is devoted to the military and defense of this country is \nbeing impaired. I am confident that there are instances where it is.\n\n  Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic comprise 301,000 new square \nmiles of territory to be defended; 2,612 miles of new borders to be \ndefended. And yet, our total national defense spending fell by 27 \npercent over the last 8 years. And we are going to take on a \nsubstantial new commitment. Our share of whatever happens in NATO has \nalways been about 25 percent. We are going to have that kind of an \nincrease in commitment while we are having this kind of plummeting \ndevotion of resources to our own military spending.\n  Additionally, we have spent money in a lot of different ways in these \nout-of-area deployments for our own Armed Forces. Outside normal \ntraining and alliance commitments, the Army conducted 10 operational \nevents between 1960 and 1991. Ten times we deployed troops in that 31-\nyear period, and that is when we had a significant devotion of \nresources to support the troops.\n  Since 1991, we have been cutting our resources to the troops \nsubstantially. And what have we done while we have been cutting their \nsupplies? We have been sending them out at an alarmingly higher rate. \nWe had 10 deployments in 31 years, and then in the next 7 years, we \nhave had 26 deployments. That is a formula for difficulty, and if that \nis the way we are going to treat NATO, by having increasing deployments \nbased on the interest of the parties, not to defend the strategic \nterritories of the parties, but to just sort of defend their vital \ninterests, be they in Africa, Asia or the Middle East or somewhere \nelse, then the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is North Atlantic in \nname only.\n  If we begin to deploy NATO forces without reference to the alliance's \nmission, we could hollow out this most successful defense organization \never in the history of mankind. We could hollow it out so it loses its \neffectiveness.\n  Our Marine Corps conducted 15 contingency operations between 1982 and \n1989 and 62 since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  This business of deploying people all around the world is serious, \nand if we are going to do that with NATO, we are going to see some of \nthe same challenges that we have seen in our own operations, because we \nare having trouble with maintaining our armed forces. Our fleets are \ngetting old, and we are having trouble with reenlistments because we \ndon't have the resources.\n  The same kind of problems besetting our own military also could beset \nthe NATO alliance. The point I am making is simply this: If you are \ngoing to change the mission of NATO, if you are going to change it from \ndefending territory, which is identified and understandable, located \nand clearly marked, and you are going to start making NATO into an \norganization the troops of which can be sent anywhere, anywhere in the \nworld in the defense of ``the interests,'' we may well threaten the \nviability of NATO itself.\n  Let me just conclude by making this statement: We talk about NATO \ntroops as if they are individuals who are strangers. Well, NATO troops \ninclude folks from the United States of America. They include our sons \nand our daughters, our brothers and sisters, our nephews and nieces. I \ndon't think we should embark upon a program of substantial change in \nthe responsibility and duty of those troops without considering it \nvery, very carefully. To switch from defending the territory of the \nNATO nations to defending interests potentially around the globe is to \nmake a major change that merits the close scrutiny and extensive debate \nthat this Senate should and could provide but which it declined to \nprovide when this amendment was tabled.\n  However, these strategic concepts of the past have been superseded by \nthe Strategic Concept of 1991. Here, instead of having the defense of \nterritory as being primary, we find ``to provide one of the \nindispensable foundations for a stable security environment in \nEurope''--all of Europe this time, not just the NATO nations--``in \nwhich no country would be able to intimidate or coerce any European \nNation.'' This is treaty creep. We have gone from the member nations of \nNATO to the European Continent as a whole to stop intimidation and \ncoercion.\n  The first priority in the 1991 Strategic Concept is to expand beyond \nthe member nations of NATO. Talk about the latitude to deploy troops \nthroughout Europe, and we have seen out-of-area deployments become the \nprimary focus of the NATO alliance.\n  No. 2, ``to serve as provided for in article IV of the North Atlantic \nTreaty, as a transatlantic forum for allied consultations on any issues \nthat affect their vital interests.''\n  Oh, no, we have moved from defense of territory and the defense of \nthe political integrity of member nations to the defense of vital \ninterests. I suppose ``vital interests'' could include trade interests \nor interests in humanitarian concerns or interests in cultural \nexchanges. We find ourselves with a real potential for the expansion of \nthe scope of this treaty.\n  All of a sudden, the collective defense of the territory of the NATO \nnations is no longer the prime task, according to the Strategic \nConcepts of 1991. Where do we find the collective defense? We find them \ndown in 3 and 4. They have been placed at the bottom of the list.\n  There is a new agenda for NATO nations. Not the defense of territory, \nit is the defense of ``vital interests.'' No wonder they are talking \nabout deploying troops in Africa in international\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\npolicing operations. No wonder Secretary Perry talked about deploying \ntroops around the globe. The NATO nations could have commercial \ninterests and trade interests around the world.\n  Some would say this expansion of mission is an appropriate thing. I \nthink when the New York Times said this demands extensive debate, they \nweren't ruling out such an expansion of mission out of hand. I don't \nthink setting NATO on a course to become a mini-UN with a standing army \nis a good thing, and, as the New York Times points out, we should at \nleast have an extensive debate before NATO takes this step. When the \ntime came this evening to look carefully at this, we found the Senate \nsaying, ``We'll table it; we won't consider it.'' As we all know here, \na motion to table cuts off debate. It doesn't provide for debate.\n  Let me just say, when the treaty was entered into, it was pretty \nclear what territory was covered. Article VI defined the territory that \nwas to be defended:\n\n       Any of the parties in Europe or North America, on the \n     Algerian Departments of France, on the territory of Turkey, \n     or on the islands under the jurisdiction of any of the \n     parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of \n     Cancer.\n\n  Sounds like the legal description of a deed to the house.

Absent that kind of \nconsideration, I find it very, very difficult to say that we should \nexpand an alliance whose purpose is not clear.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator from Texas wishes to be recognized \nnext, but just so the Senators will be on notice to what I think will \nhappen now, the Senator from Texas wishes to speak a few minutes on the \nfinal disposition of this issue. Senator Smith will be recognized to \noffer an amendment. His amendment will be set aside, and Senator Inhofe \nwill have an amendment he will offer. At the conclusion of their \ndebate, then we would anticipate that there would be two or three votes \nthat would occur, hopefully in sequence, so this could begin in a \nrelatively short period of time.\n  We do not have a time agreement, but we hope to reach conclusion \nbefore too late into the night.\n  Mr. FORD. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Is there a chance we might get a time agreement on those \nother two amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, I say to the Senator, they would prefer that we \nnot have a time agreement, but they do not anticipate taking a long \ntime.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe I share with a substantial \nnumber of my colleagues a real sense of unease about the process that \nwe are about to finish. When I made my opening comments about the \nresolution before us, I noticed that a legislative body is ill-suited \nto the task of establishing order, coherence, and discipline to a \nforeign policy initiative. The last few days have proven me right, as \nwe have missed the opportunity to greatly improve the resolution before \nus.\n  The decision to expand NATO and extend invitations was made in the \nheat of a political campaign, with little attention given to the truly \nimportant questions that should have been addressed.\n  There has been no assessment of the threat against which the military \nalliance was supposed to defend. There were no clear criteria \nestablished for membership in NATO. We did not use\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nthis opportunity to debate what the mission of NATO should be in the \npost-cold-war era. We have not used this opportunity to lay out clear \nexpectations for the next group of would-be members of NATO. We have \nleft no roadmap for the future.\n  Unfortunately, the administration did little to address these issues \nwhen it proposed to expand the alliance in the first place. The Senate \nwas placed in the position of having to do so because of a failure of \nexecutive leadership. And I do not think the Senate has done very well, \neither.\n  Why was it left to us to wonder about the possibility for border and \nethnic disputes to impact the expanded alliance in a way that might \nhurt U.S. interests?\n  While my amendment on that matter was defeated, 37 Members, more than \none-third needed to stop future expansions, believe that a process to \naddress such disputes is important and should be discussed. Other \nMembers raised equally valid concerns, and they were nearly all \ndefeated.\n  The Senator from Virginia had a prudent proposal to step back after \nthe first round of expansion to let the experience be fully absorbed by \nthe United States and her allies. Defeated.\n  Our colleague from Idaho wondered if we should not at least vote to \nauthorize the ongoing and possibly open-ended NATO mission in Bosnia \nbefore we think about expanding the alliance to new members. Defeated.\n  The Senator from New Mexico said strategy should be adopted before we \ntake in new members. Defeated.\n  Because the concerns of so many Members were so summarily dispensed \nwith, many will find it difficult to support this resolution. How much \nstronger a signal might this body have sent on this important matter if \nthere had been more willingness to find an acceptable compromise with \nconcerned Members, many of whom are not on the relevant committees and \nhad no opportunity to really fashion the underlying resolution.\n  Instead, we have a resolution that has very little to say about the \nfuture beyond the fact that we will likely add three new members to the \nalliance. But that has never really been the debate here as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Most of us have not opposed the three countries being considered for \nimmediate membership. We were concerned about the process by which we \ngot to this point. In many ways, after more than a week of debate, we \nare still not much further than when we started.\n  For example, there is no strategic rationale for the new NATO \nalliance. It is not due from the President until 180 days after this \nresolution is passed. There is still no credible estimate about the \ncost. We have seen estimates miraculously shrink from $125 billion to a \ncouple of million as we have gotten closer to this vote. Obviously, no \none knows what the real cost will be. At least we have the protections \navailable because of the cost caps imposed by the amendment of the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  In the meantime, this body over the last couple of days has voted for \na provision that allows NATO possibly to engage in military efforts on \nborder and ethnic disputes but, rather strangely, voted against letting \nNATO attempt to resolve such disputes peaceably at the lower levels \nthrough dispute resolution.\n  In short, I think, Mr. President, that both the administration and \nthe Senate have approached the issue of NATO enlargement in a rather \nhaphazard and disjointed manner. Because this Senate defeated the pause \nproposed by the Senator from Virginia, we will probably be debating the \nadmission of yet another tranche of countries before we have any idea \nabout cost, border disputes, or strategic rationale.\n  So where are we now? Instead of debating the more challenging issues \ninvolving the future of the alliance, we are left with a narrow \nquestion: Should Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary be admitted to \nNATO?\n  These countries have made a sustained commitment to democratic \ncapitalism since the end of the cold war. In numerous discussions with \nthe Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers from each of these three \ncountries as a member of the U.S. Senate's NATO Observer Group, I am \nconvinced that they intend to aggressively shoulder the burdens of \nmembership in NATO. They seek no special treatment, and they wish only \nto be treated as full members of the alliance with the rights and the \nresponsibilities entailed.\n  Further, these countries have demonstrated a commitment to the goals \nof the alliance. They have contributed, in some cases heavily, to the \nongoing NATO mission in Bosnia. In the case of Hungary, the United \nStates has staged its Bosnia operations there for some years. The U.S. \npresence there has approached that of our closest NATO allies and our \nnon-NATO allies. And the Hungarians have been excellent hosts to U.S. \nforces.\n  While I remain steadfast in my belief that NATO needs and should at \nleast discuss the adoption of a formal dispute resolution process, the \nfact is that these countries have worked hard to resolve disputes with \nneighbors. The Czech Republic peaceably separated itself from Slovakia. \nHungary and Romania have signed a treaty to resolve issues surrounding \nthe treatment of ethnic Hungarians in Romania.\n  Despite these strong indications that these countries are ready for \nthe burdens and benefits of alliance membership, I would nevertheless \nhave retained additional reservations had the managers not accepted the \nU.S. cost limitations proposed by the Senator from Alaska.\n  A major issue that must be addressed is how much should the United \nStates continue to shoulder for peace in Europe? We pay 25 percent of \nthe cost of NATO. The Stevens amendment will keep U.S. costs at no \ngreater than what we now spend for NATO. Additional costs incidental to \nthe adoption of three new members will have to be specifically \nauthorized by Congress.\n  With great reservations about this process, I will not vote against \nthree countries that I believe will strengthen the alliance. I do hope \nthis administration will not come to us again with new countries \ninvited before the strategic rationale, cost limitations, border \ndispute processes and other conditions many of us tried and failed to \nimpose. I hope we will not put the cart before the horse.\n  To that end, I take some comfort in the vote totals for at least two \nof the amendments that failed. My amendment on conflict resolution \nreceived 37 votes. Senator Warner's amendment, requiring a pause of 3 \nyears, received 41 votes. It takes 34 votes to stop a future treaty.\n  I hope the administration and its successors would see these votes as \ncautionary should they consider going forward and raising expectations \nof good people in other countries before looking at the long-term \nsecurity interests of America and considering what our responsibility \nis throughout the world. America has never walked away from its \nresponsibilities. We want to pay our fair share. But we would not \nrepresent the taxpayers of this country if we allowed our country to \ntake more than its fair share and thereby debilitate the strength of \nour own security.\n  I hope that we can move forward now and continue to have the Senate \nmaintain its constitutional responsibility in treaties of advise and \nconsent, not just consent. What we have done instead of truly rewriting \nthe course of our future and creating an alliance for the next century \nis to add three new members to an alliance whose purpose and therefore \nwhose future is no more certain than when we began this process.\n  While I cast a vote in favor, I take no great comfort in doing so and \nI hope the next debate is on the role of NATO in the post-cold-war era. \nOnly then will we assure that the greatest defense alliance in the \nhistory of the world will remain exactly that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2328\n\n (Purpose: To condition United States ratification of the protocols on \n  specific legislative action for the continued deployment of United \n   States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO \n                                mission)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], proposes an \n     executive amendment numbered 2328.\n\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in section 3 of the resolution, \n     insert the following:\n       ( ) Legislative action regarding deployments in bosnia and \n     herzegovina.--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives shall each have taken a vote on legislation \n     that, if enacted, would contain specific authorization for \n     the continued deployment of the United States Armed Forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO mission in that \n     country.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to my colleagues I will be very \nbrief and try to keep it within 10 minutes.\n  This amendment is really quite simple. It is very much like the Craig \namendment that we voted on earlier with the exception that it doesn't \ncall for the passage. It simply says that one way or the other we would \nrequire Congress to debate and then vote--whichever way the vote comes \nout--but just vote on our deployment in Bosnia prior to depositing the \ninstruments of ratification.\n  I want to briefly touch on why I am offering this amendment. When the \nCongress first considered the President's plan to send troops to Bosnia \nin 1995, the administration placed very clear limits on the duration of \nthis commitment. On every single occasion I am aware of, the \nadministration official stated that U.S. troops would remain in Bosnia \nfor 1 year. In fact, Secretary Perry, on December 1, 1995, said, ``We \nbelieve the mission can be accomplished in one year, so we based our \nplan on that time line. This schedule is realistic because the specific \nmilitary tasks in the agreement can be completed in the first six \nmonths and thereafter IFOR's role will be to maintain the climate of \nstability that will permit civil work to go forward. We expect these \ncivil functions will be successfully initiated in one year. But, even \nif some of them are not, we must not be drawn into a posture of \nindefinite garrison.''\n  I think these remarks were well intended, and I think it is clear \nthat the Secretary of Defense meant what he said, but it is also clear \nthat they didn't bear out.\n  We also heard from Secretary of State Holbrooke on December 6, 1995: \n``The military tasks are doable within 12 months. There isn't any \nquestion * * * The deeper question * * * [is] whether the nonmilitary \nfunctions can be done in 12 months. That's a real question. But it's \nnot the NATO or U.S. force responsibility to do that. It's on the \ncivilian side, working with the Europeans. It's going to be very tough. \nShould the military stick around until every refugee has gone home, \n'til everything else in the civilian annexes has been done? No, that is \nnot their mission.''\n  There were many of us who watched these comments--especially in the \nArmed Services Committee--very closely, studying the conflict in \nBosnia. We felt that this was an unrealistic commitment. We didn't feel \nthat those kinds of commitments should have been made, because we \ndidn't feel they could have been kept. But the American people had no \nchoice but to kind of accept these comments from our leaders.\n  I was disappointed but I wasn't surprised when right after the 1996 \nelections, the President announced the continuation of the military \ncommitment for an additional 18 months, to June of 1998. That is where \nwe are now. It is almost June of 1998. Last December, the President \nacknowledged that our commitment now in Bosnia is open ended but we are \nstill talking about clear and achievable goals.\n  For 2 years the President has had this opportunity, and I believe \nthat he has been wrong in making these statements. I believe it is \nwrong for the Government to conduct the foreign policy of the United \nStates without any input from Congress and the public. The American \npeople need to understand what is at stake and either agree to the \ncommitment or not. We have a commitment. The President made it, and now \nhe has extended it open ended.\n  The question before the Congress today is, do you want to continue \nwith an open-ended commitment, a blank check in Bosnia or don't you? \nThe President has stated he wants to, and he stated why. Now the \nAmerican people ought to hear from us, the Congress, as to whether or \nnot this is a good idea or a bad idea.\n  This is no longer simply a Presidential use of force based on his \njudgment of an immediate threat. We now have nation-building in Bosnia \nas deliberate foreign policy, and it ought to be approved and funded by \nthe Congress of the United States. Failure to place this before \nCongress, in my opinion, will destroy congressional support for his \nforeign policy and, frankly, it insults the intelligence of the \nAmerican people.\n  There already has been a casualty in Bosnia, and that casualty is the \ntrust of the American people that their Government will do what it says \nit will do when it puts American armed forces in harm's way.\n  I don't see how Congress can allow this extended commitment to \ncontinue simply because the President sees no way out. Now, I have been \naround the cloakroom and in meetings for a couple of years now while \nthis policy has been going on and I have been hearing a lot of \ncomplaining from my colleagues, a lot of complaining about how this \nwill continue, it is open ended, what are we going to do about it.\n  Here is a chance to vote--and I'm not asking you to vote to say that \nwe ought to take the troops out or leave them in; I'm asking you to \nvote. All I'm asking for is a vote. It could go 5-90 against deployment \nor the other way around for deployment. I'm not asking for a vote to \ncome out either direction. I'm just simply saying the Congress should \nvote, the Senate and the House of Representatives, before we deposit \nthe instruments of ratification. That is all this amendment does. It \ndoes nothing less and it does nothing more.\n  I don't, frankly, think that is asking very much. With the new \nnations we may have more Bosnias. We may have more Bosnias before we \nare finished, especially as we continue the expansion that Senator \nHutchison of Texas was talking about a few moments ago, where we \ndefeated the Warner amendment. So who is next down the line? We \ncontinue to draw lines. Where do we draw these lines? This is a very \nimportant debate, and I really cannot understand why anybody would \noppose this amendment that simply says vote one way or the other. Keep \nthem in 90-10, or take them out 90-10. Just vote. That is all this \namendment asks for, before we submit the articles of ratification. In \neither case, I think the objective is clear that the American people \nneed to be heard. They haven't been heard. We should let them be heard \nright here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Again, let me just say that if my colleagues on both sides of the \nissue don't support this amendment, which simply requires them to cast \na vote--just cast a vote--on this matter before the June 30 deadline, \nthey ought to forever keep their peace on Bosnia. No more complaining \nin the cloakroom, no more speeches on the floor about how the policy is \nso bad and so open-ended, no more second-guessing the President, no \nmore criticizing the President, no more saying Congress doesn't have \nany responsibility. If we can't force ourselves to stand up here \ntonight and be counted on this subject, then we don't have a right to \ncriticize the President on this issue. Every time I am on the floor and \nI hear somebody criticizing the President on this, I am going to check \nthe vote list and see how the votes were, and I am going to rise up and \nchallenge that Senator. This is not going to delay the passage, the \ninstruments of ratification. We can vote on this any time. We can vote \nnext week or the following week, or tonight, for that matter. It \ndoesn't matter to me when we vote on it. Whenever the leader wants to \nschedule it.\n  Mr. President, my final remarks. The purpose of this amendment is to \nsimply require Congress to vote, period, one way or another on \ndeployment to Bosnia prior to depositing the instruments of \nratification for NATO. That's it.\n\n\n          what will expansion cost, and who will pay the bill?\n\n  It is obvious to me that nobody really knows what the true costs of \nNATO\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\nexpansion will be. Just look at the cost estimates that are available.\n  In March of 1996, CBO issued a report that provided five options or \nscenarios for NATO expansion. The cost of those five options ranged \nfrom $60 billion to $124 billion.\n  In the fall of 1996, Rand Corporation completed a study on the costs \nof NATO expansion and concluded that the costs could range from $10 \nbillion to $110 billion.\n  In February of 1997, the administration provided its own cost \nestimates. In this report the cost of NATO expansion was pegged at $27 \nto $35 billion.\n  In December of 1997, NATO itself estimated the cost of NATO expansion \nas $1.5 to $2 billion.\n  The February 16 edition of Defense News reports that the Pentagon \nwill issue yet another study that will peg the cost of NATO expansion \nat $1.5 billion over 10 years.\n  According to the CRS, the administration assumes that the new nations \nwill pick up 50 percent of the bill, the current NATO members will pay \n44 percent and the U.S. will pick up 6 percent of these costs.\n\n\n   can poland, hungary and the czech republic afford nato expansion?\n\n  Supporters of NATO expansion say we must expand in order to help the \nyoung fledgling democracies and market economies of these countries \ngrow. This is not what NATO does.\n  NATO is first a military or security alliance, not an economic \nalliance. If the goal is economic and not security, then let the EU \ndeal with these countries, not NATO.\n  With NATO expansion, we are placing a requirement that the new \nmembers ``buy'' their way in. If they could buy their way in, their \nyoung market economies wouldn't need the protection of NATO expansion. \nThis circular logic is no logic at all.\n  In an article on NATO expansion that appeared in the January/February \n1998 edition of Foreign Affairs, Amos Perlmutter writes:\n\n       The belief that the new members should be able to absorb \n     costs of close to $42 billion between 1996 and 2001 overlooks \n     the International Monetary Fund's rules and the Maastricht \n     Treaty's expectations. The IMF requires former Warsaw Pact \n     states to invest in economic infrastructure, and the \n     Maastricht Treaty will accept members only on the basis of \n     their conformity to its rigorous fiscal standards. Hungary \n     and the Czech Republic are already experiencing serious \n     budget crunches and are seeking ways to cut spending to meet \n     IMF demands. Where, then, will the money come from to expand \n     their military budgets?\n\n\n                             political will\n\n  In addition, there is also the question of whether or not there is \nthe political will in these countries to help pay for expansion. The \nUnited States Information Agency (USIA) conducted a poll in October of \n1997 in the countries listed below and asked if the respondents \nsupported increasing their government's defense spending:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Don't\n                                          Support     Oppose      know\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCzech Republic.........................         29         63          8\nHungary................................         36         60          4\nPoland.................................         56         31         13\nSlovakia...............................         21         71          8\nSlovenia...............................         22         72          6\nBulgaria...............................         28         55         17\nRomania................................         55         39          7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResult: Only Poles, not Czech or Hungarians willing to increase spending\n  to pay for expansion.\n\n                            fiscal realities\n\n  Even our current European allies have had sharply declining defense \nbudgets as they prepare to meet the fiscal requirements of the European \ncommon currency.\n  Sir John Kerr, the British Ambassador to the U.S. stated the \nfollowing on July 23, 1997:\n\n       I think, realistically, it is very unlikely that the \n     Europeans will stump up another $15 billion on their defense \n     budgets. It would mean increasing defense budgets on average \n     by about 1.5 percent a year, a very much larger number than \n     the cost for the United States. And I don't think it will \n     happen.\n\n  In July of 1997 French President Jacques Chirac made the following \nstatement:\n\n       We have adopted a very simple position: Enlargement must \n     not cost anything in net terms. We are convinced that it is \n     possible.\n\n  A Washington Post article from July 10, 1997 quotes German President \nHelmut Kohl as saying:\n\n       It is completely absurd to link NATO enlargement with cost \n     factors as if the aim was to rearm large areas of Europe to \n     the teeth.\n\n  Another German, Walther Stuetzle, a former senior defense planner for \nthe German Government said in the March 12, 1997 edition of the \nWashington Post:\n\n       So who will pick up the tab? I think it will have to be the \n     United States.\n\n  So we've heard from our NATO allies and they are saying that they are \nnot willing to pay for NATO expansion. Some supporters of NATO \nexpansion will downplay these comments as political comments made for \nconsumption at home. They say our allies will come through.\n  I am a firm believer that past performance is an indicator of future \nperformance. What hasn't been heard too much in public is the fact that \nour NATO allies have been falling well short on their current NATO \ncommitments. That certainly doesn't bode well for any additional \ncommitment from our current NATO allies to pick up their share of the \ncosts to expand.\n  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Admiral \nJack Shanahan (USN retired) made the following comments:\n\n       In 1970 I was assigned to the U.S. mission to NATO in \n     Brussels. The prevailing attitude of most of the alliance was \n     that they were safely under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, and \n     that the Warsaw Pact was not a major concern. As a result our \n     allies did not consistently meet their NATO commitments in \n     terms of defense spending. Their prepositioned war reserve of \n     food, ammunition, fuel etc. were well below NATO standards. \n     Interoperability was a joke. They were not ready then, they \n     are not ready now, and as we integrate East European \n     militaries into the alliance this condition will worsen, \n     placing greater demands on the U.S. military to shoulder the \n     burden. Even as we speak, our allies are making significant \n     reductions in military spending and in their force \n     structures.\n\n  This testimony is very revealing and speaks for itself--especially in \nlight of the additional commitments that our present NATO allies will \nbe asked to bear through expansion.\n\n  We not only have statements from the major Western European countries \nindicating that they are not willing to pay for NATO expansion, but \nalso disturbing testimony before the Senate that our current NATO \nallies already have fallen well short of fulfilling their current NATO \ncommitments.\n  Thus, it will probably fall to the United States to pay for NATO \nexpansion. Indeed, the March 12, 1997 Washington Post quoted a senior \nU.S. official as saying: ``There was a strong political imperative to \nlow-ball figures. Everybody realized the main priority was to keep \ncosts down to reassure Congress, as well as the Russians.''\n  What are the implications of all this for the article V commitment \nthat an attack on one is an attack on all? Do we really believe we can \neffectively carry out this commitment if the cost of NATO expansion has \nbeen fudged in order to reassure the Congress and Russia? Don't the \nsupporters of expansion take the alliance more seriously than this?\n\n\n                           are they prepared?\n\n  The three nations who would become part of NATO have military \ninfrastructures that are profoundly unprepared to join NATO. Defense \nnews recently reported on NATO's most recent assessment of the \ninvitees. The report concluded that Poland, the Czech Republic and \nHungary are years away from having militaries that are minimally \nfunctional, much less strategically interoperable with NATO's military \nsystems. Examples include:\n  All of the Czech Army's equipment is ``old and approaching \nobsolescence.''\n  None of Poland's naval ships are ``capable for command and control of \njoint or combined operations.''\n  In Hungary, 70 percent of the pilots carry out only 50 hours of \ntraining per year, far below NATO standards.\n  The United States cannot even pay for its own modernization. Why \nwould we want to pay for the modernization of three new NATO members?\n\n\n                      can the u.s. foot the bill?\n\n  Don't be naive--NATO expansion is not going to be free--no matter how \nmuch the figure is lowered to make it more ``palatable.''\n  The balanced budget agreement has locked us into a flat if not \ndeclining defense budget during the next few years. We've all heard \nreports that readiness in the military is starting to deteriorate.\n  The House National Security Committee issued a report recently that \nchronicled some of the readiness problems that are starting to appear \nin our military. What we are facing, in my\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\nopinion, is the very real scenario where we will be increasing our \nnational security commitments without a corresponding increase in our \ndefense spending because of the balanced budget agreement.\n  The current defense budget we have now is inadequate to meet our \ncurrent plans and requirements. Just like every other contingency \noperation the Clinton administration has signed U.S. forces up to, an \nunderfunded Defense Department will have to foot the bill once again.\n  We keep hearing from this administration that another round of BRAC \nis necessary to reduce infrastructure and pay for modernization. Could \nit be that the real objective of another BRAC is to pay for NATO \nexpansion? Does the Senate really want to approve adding one more IOU \nto an already empty Pentagon checkbook, when we do not even know how \nlarge the IOU will be? I don't think so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay my amendment aside so \nthat Senator Inhofe may discuss his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can I ask a question of Senator Smith?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I was thinking. Do you mean if I vote no on \nthis, 3 weeks from now if we want to vote again in the Senate on the \nBosnia policy, I can't vote?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Did I say that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So the vote means we are going to vote for it or not, \nand we can have a vote on Bosnia if we want it, whenever we want, \nwhatever we do with your amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. You certainly can. But I am saying this \nshould be a requirement. If we don't have that vote, we ought not to \ncomplain about the resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2325\n\n(Purpose: To require the President to submit the Kyoto Protocol to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to the Senate for \n     its consideration under the Treaty Power of the Constitution)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     executive amendment numbered 2325.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in section 3 of the resolution, \n     insert the following:\n       (  ) Requirement of transmittal to the senate of kyoto \n     protocol on global warming.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     submit the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework \n     Convention on Climate Change, done at Kyoto on December 10, \n     1997, to the Senate for its consideration under Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States \n     (relating to the making of treaties).\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me briefly explain what my amendment \ndoes. It simply requires the President to submit the Kyoto Protocol to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to the Senate \nfor its consideration under the Treaty Powers of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the White House has made a full-scale effort for \nratification of expansion of NATO. We are considering that now and we \nhave had a lot of debate. Some of us are against it and some of us are \nfor it. We have had a chance to get our positions out and we know where \nwe stand. But according to article II, section 2, clause 2 of the \nConstitution, we are the only body--and it has to be by a two-thirds \nvote--that can ratify treaties of the United States. The President \ncan't do it, the Secretary of State can't do it, the Vice President \ncan't do it, the Secretary of Defense can't do it, the Director of the \nEPA can't do it--just the U.S. Senate.\n  Some might argue that the NATO expansion debate is not an appropriate \nplace to raise the question about the Kyoto Protocol. But the issue \nhere is whether the President is going to have serious regard for the \nSenate's advise-and-consent authority under the Constitution, which the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia has reminded us many times is our \nprerogative. The President cannot be expected to send treaties up for \nadvice and consent when he thinks the Senate agrees with him and refuse \nto send them up unilaterally when he feels that we do not. Truly, that \nis the case.\n  We made our case very specific when we voted 95-0, prior to going to \nJapan, that if they came back with something that did not treat the \ndeveloping countries the same as the developed nations, we would oppose \nit, and the President came back with exactly that, putting us under \nobligations that the developing nations were not under. So that China \ndoesn't have to worry about it, or Pakistan, and other countries, like \nMexico. But we do. This is the issue we are dealing with here.\n  I am going to deviate from that for a moment in this very short time \nto repeat something that I said earlier in this debate because I \nunderstand I am the last speaker now and this is the last amendment. I \nwould like to just say there are four reasons why we should not, in the \nfinal analysis, expand NATO.\n  The first one is the cost. I don't know why nobody seems to be upset \nthat the range goes all the way from $400 million to $120 billion, and \nthose at the low end are the administration--the same administration \nthat said that Bosnia was going to cost us $1.2 billion, and now our \ndirect costs have skyrocketed way way above $9 billion, and there is no \nend to it. It is a permanent commitment. Yet, we were told that it was \ngoing to be $1.2 billion.\n  So here we have an amount of money--at a time when we have cut our \ndefense down to the bone, at a time when we have to be able to do \nsomething to put ourselves in a position to defend America. Yet, we are \ntalking about an open-ended commitment by extending NATO to these \ncountries.\n  The second reason is it is the open door. I hope nobody thinks we are \ntalking about three countries--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. \nWe are talking about an open door now that is extended to everyone. I \nwant to read what our Secretary of State said in a statement she made:\n\n       We must pledge that the first new members will not be the \n     last and that no European democracy will be excluded because \n     of where it sits on the map.\n\n  She talks about Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, \nAlbania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Slovakia, and the list goes on and on. So \nit is the clear intent that this is not the last. If you think this is \ngoing to be expensive, just think what it is going to be when we start \nextending it to other countries. Where would we draw the line?\n  The third concern I have is a genuine concern that we talked about on \nthe floor, and that is, what does this do to our relationship with \nRussia? Everybody says, ``That's all right, I have been to Russia and \nthey don't mind.'' I have gotten commitments from people saying that is \nall right, go ahead, this is not going to be a problem. But that's not \nwhat the Duma said, which is their parliamentary body. The Duma passed \na resolution calling NATO expansion the ``biggest threat to Russia \nsince the end of World War II.''\n  There is one person I had a great deal of respect for in this body, \nand I regretted when he left this body; it was Sam Nunn, who I served \nwith on the Armed Services Committee. There is not a person who would \nstand up on the floor and question his integrity or his knowledge of \nforeign affairs or question his concern for defending America. Sam Nunn \nsaid that Russian cooperation in avoiding proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction is our most important national security objective, and \n``This NATO expansion makes them more suspicious and less \ncooperative.'' He further said, ``The administration's answer to this \nand other serious questions are what I consider to be platitudes.''\n  So everyone is on record. Last, I will address the concern that the \nSenator from New Hampshire had. He has a very good resolution, and I \nthink everybody understands it. If anybody wants to get on record as to \nwhere they stand insofar as Bosnia is concerned, his amendment is your \nopportunity to do so. Because right now we don't have\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nanything to show who is on record. We do have a resolution of \ndisapproval that was barely defeated by only three votes in November of \n1995. I suspect that some people now have changed their minds now that \nthey realize this open-ended commitment is there.\n  So I would like to wind this up by saying that if this cost to \nsupport the Bosnian operation is any indication, I remind you that in \nNovember of 1995, we were on the brink of being able to defeat this and \nnot send our troops to Bosnia, except they said that this is going to \nbe a short commitment, it is not going to be something that would last \na long period of time.\n  It was going to be over within less than a year, and it was going to \ncost $1.2 billion. The only reason that they were able to get those \nvotes to pass this was, they said, ``We must protect our integrity with \nour partners in NATO.'' Now that same argument can be used--I wonder \nwho is going to be the next Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, while I have this amendment, I know the votes are not \nthere for this amendment, and there is one very good reason, because of \na dear person in this body, that we want to not extend any longer than \nit should be extended. So nothing would be gained by considering my \namendment.\n  For that reason, I withdraw my amendment and urge my fellow \ncolleagues to vote against the extension of NATO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2325) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I was opposed to the amendment offered \nby Senator Inhofe. Quite frankly, I believe the consequences if this \namendment passed would have been extremely deleterious to our foreign \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, everyone should recognize that his amendment is \nnothing more than a thinly-veiled threat to delay NATO enlargement and \nto ensure that we won't have NATO enlargement for a significant period \nof time. It is very clear that President Clinton can't and won't submit \nthe Kyoto Protocol for Senate ratification until the conditions he has \nset are met--meaningful participation by developing countries. The \nAdministration is not in a position of saying now when that milestone \nwill be achieve, but it probably won't be soon. So a vote for this \namendment is a vote to stop NATO expansion.\n  But even if you oppose NATO expansion, you should oppose this \namendment because the approach it takes is without precedent and would \nhave a significant impact on how the country conducts foreign policy.\n  Let me say also that I was a member of the Senate observer group to \nthe Kyoto conference last December. There has never been a more \ncomplicated, difficult international negotiation attempted. I believe \nthat the conference was a historic success: more than 160 countries \nrecognized that the common threat of climate change was more important \nthan each nation's separate anxiety about the immediate impact of an \nagreement.\n  The Conference was also a historic success because American proposals \nwon the day. We called for much more real and realistic targets and \ntimetables. We proposed flexibility through a trading program to use \nthe power of the market to achieve lower compliance costs for business. \nWe offered a joint implementation system that would allow American \nfirms to build clean power plants or preserve forests in developing \ncountries in exchange for emission reduction credits that could be used \nor sold later. Our negotiators won on each of these battles--and they \nwere very hard fought battles.\n  But the President has clearly said that the Kyoto protocol is not \nready to be submitted to the Senate. The President has made clear that \nthe protocol will not be ready for submission until we have succeeded \nin achieving the meaningful participation of developing counties. At \nKyoto, a down payment was made in the form of a ``clean development \nmechanism'' which embraces the U.S. backed concept of joint \nimplementation with credit. This will allow companies in the developed \nworld to invest in projects in countries in the developing world for \nthe benefit of both parties.\n  But developing countries will clearly need to do more in order to \nmeaningfully participate in combating global warming, and in order of \nthe President to submit the protocol for the consideration of the \nSenate. Secretary Albright recently announced a full court diplomatic \neffort to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. President, as far as I can determine, there is no precedent in \nour history for doing essentially what this amendment seeks to do, \nforce the President to transmit a treaty to the Senate before the \nPresident deems it appropriate to do so. This amendment is a high-\nhanded attempt by Congress to undermine the President's constitutional \npower.\n  Mr. President, I asked the American Law Division of the CRS to look \nat a related issue: whether there are any time limitations within which \nthe President must submit a treaty after it has been negotiated and \nsigned. Let me quote from that report: ``As a general proposition, \nthere do not appear to be any time constraints on the transmittal of \ntreaties to the Senate for its advice and consent. The spare language \nof the Constitution provides simply that `(the President) shall have \nPower, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make \nTreaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur. . . .' \nUnder this structure, it is the President who negotiates and ultimately \nratifies treaties, provided the Senate gives its advice and consent. \nBut the constitutional language does not set time limits on any aspect \nof the process of treaty-making.''\n  The report goes on to note that ``nor does statutory law appear to \nimpose any time constraints on the submission of treaties.''\n  Mr. President, the memo goes on to discuss numerous cases in which \ntreaties have not been submitted to the Senate for ratification for a \nlong time after they were negotiated and signed. For example, the \nUnited States signed the ``International Convention on the Elimination \nof All Forms of Racial Discrimination'' on September 28, 1966. Nearly \n12 years passed after the United States signature before it was \nsubmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent on February 23, \n1978.\n  Let me read here from the memorandum's review of the Legislative \nCalendar for the 104th Congress: Final Edition of the Senate Committee \non Foreign Relations which discloses a number of examples of \nsignificant delay is transmittal of treaties.\n       A review of the Legislative Calendar for the 104th \n     Congress: Final Edition of the Senate Committee on Foreign \n     Relations discloses a number of additional instances of \n     significant delays in transmittal. A bilateral treaty between \n     the U.S. and Haiti ``Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement \n     and Protection of Investment'' was signed on December 13, \n     1983, but not submitted to the Senate until March 25, 1986. A \n     treaty on ``Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters'' \n     between the U.S. and Nigeria, signed on September 13, 1989, \n     was not transmitted until April 1, 1992. A ``Revised Protocol \n     Amending the Convention Between the United States and Canada \n     With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital,'' originally \n     signed on September 28, 1980, and then amended in 1983 and \n     1984, was finally submitted to the Senate on April 24, 1995. \n     An extradition treaty with Belgium was signed on April 27, \n     1987, but not submitted until June 12, 1995; and one with \n     Switzerland was signed on November 14, 1990, but not \n     transmitted until June 12, 1995. The ``International \n     Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants'' \n     was originally negotiated in 1961, amended in 1972, 1978, and \n     1991, and finally signed by the U.S. in 1991, but was not \n     submitted to the Senate until September 5, 1995. Finally, the \n     ``Convention on the International Maritime Organization,'' \n     originally signed on March 6, 1948, was transmitted to the \n     Senate on October 1, 1996.\n       All of these examples illustrate the absence of any legally \n     binding time constraints on the President's transmittal of \n     treaties to the Senate.\n       I hope the foregoing is responsive to your request. If we \n     may be of additional assistance, please call on us.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the treaty \nbefore us to expand NATO. I also strongly support the agreement that \nemerged from Kyoto, as well as the President's position that the \nagreement is not ripe for submittal to the Senate at this time. There \nis no precedent for forcing the President to submit a treaty on a \ntimeframe established by the United States Senate before the President \nbelieves it is appropriate. But that is what this amendment seeks to \ndo. Adopting this amendment would have been a terrible precedent for \nconducting our foreign policy and I believe would have stopped the \ntreaty now pending before us.\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\n                      Executive Amendment No. 2328\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question remains on the Smith amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will take only 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The hour is late. It has not improved the substance of the \nSmith amendment--the time. It is essentially, as the Senator from New \nHampshire indicated, similar to the Craig amendment; very little \ndifference. I urge my colleagues to recall how they voted on the Craig \namendment, and the same rationale applies with regard to the Smith \namendment.\n  I hope when we get to the vote--which I hope is very shortly--that we \nwill vote no on the Smith amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nthere is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \nvotes, and there are two remaining votes in this series, then, be \nlimited to 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the question of whether to expand the \nNATO alliance is one of the most important foreign policy decisions \nthis Senate has been called upon to make since the fall of the Berlin \nWall.\n  We will make history with this vote. So it would seem appropriate to \nconsult history before we cast it. That's what I did the other day. I \nre-read some of the debate that took place in this chamber 49 years \nago, when our predecessors, in the tumultuous years following the \nSecond World War, had the courage and foresight to commit our own \nnation to this alliance.\n  One of the chief supporters was Arthur Vandenberg, the chairman of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Vandenberg, a \nRepublican from Michigan, predicted that NATO would become ``the \ngreatest war deterrent in history.''\n  History has proven him right. Because of NATO, a region that produced \ntwo cataclysmic wars in this century has now known a half-century of \npeace and stability. Those of us who were born after the Second World \nWar tend to take that for granted. But in fact, it is a remarkable \naccomplishment.\n  Just as the map of Europe was redrawn at the end of World War II, it \nhas been redrawn again with the end of the Cold War. Nations that once \nmarched in lockstep with totalitarian dictatorships have been \ntransformed into struggling young democracies.\n  It is time for us to redefine NATO to match the new map, the new \nreality, of this post-Cold War world.\n  Enlarging NATO's circle of security to include the new democracies of \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is not only in the best \ninterests of those nations. It is in the best interests of the entire \nEuropean continent. And, it is in the national security interest of the \nUnited States.\n  For these reasons, I intend to vote for ratification of the treaty \nexpanding NATO. And I urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I do not underestimate the seriousness of this action, nor do I take \nlightly the thoughtful arguments some of my fellow Senators have made \nagainst ratification of this treaty.\n  As I see it, there are essentially four such arguments. In making my \nown decision, I have wrestled with each of them. And I would like to \nshare with you some of my thoughts on them.\n  First, though, I want to read something from a man who has thought \nvery deeply about these arguments, and about the future of Europe: the \nPresident of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel. President Havel is among \nthe most articulate supporters of the treaty we are now considering.\n  ``As I follow the debate over whether NATO should be enlarged,'' he \nhas written, ``I have the strong sense that the arguments are often \npurely mechanical, somehow missing the real meaning of the alliance. \n``The process of expansion must be accompanied by something much \ndeeper: a refined definition of the purpose, mission and identity of \nNATO.\n  ``The alliance,'' he continues, ``should urgently remind itself that \nit is first and foremost an instrument of democracy intended to defend \nmutually held and created political and spiritual values. ``It must see \nitself not as a pact of nations against a more of less obvious enemy, \nbut as a guarantor of Euro-American civilization, and thus a pillar of \nglobal security.''\n  Does NATO exist to defend a fixed list of nations, chosen 49 years \nago, against an enemy that no longer exists? Or does it need to respond \nto the new threats we face by including, under NATO's collective \nsecurity umbrella, the three countries that have demonstrated not only \na deep commitment to democracy, but a willingness to defend it? That is \nthe fundamental question in this debate.\n  The answer, in my view, is yes. We should expand NATO to include the \nnew democracies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.\n  There are, as I said, four other questions as well. They also deserve \nserious reflection.\n  The first is: What effect would expanding NATO to include Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic have on Russia's relations with the \nWest--particularly its relations with the United States?\n  Russia clearly would prefer that we not expand NATO. Given their \nhistory, that is understandable. Russia lost 20 million people in the \nSecond World War.\n  Despite assurances from NATO that no troops or nuclear weapons will \nbe stationed in the three new member nations, there are those in Russia \nwho remain fearful of an expanded NATO, and others who are trying to \nexploit those fears to weaken the hands of Russian democratic \nreformers. This is troubling, because it is clearly in our national \ninterest to see Russia fully engaged with the West.\n  There is evidence, however, that Russian leaders wish to continue \nthat engagement. Russia's willingness last year to sign the NATO-Russia \nFounding Act is one example of Russia's commitment to improved \nrelations with the West. Perhaps an even better example is Russia's \ncontinued active participation in the international peacekeeping effort \nin Bosnia.\n  Some of my colleagues cite fear of antagonizing Russia as a reason to \nreject this treaty. While I respect their opinion, I do not believe \nthis concern warrants such action, and I cite as evidence Russia's own \nactions.\n  We must remember what Secretary of State Albright calls the \n``productive\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\nparadox'' at the core of NATO. That is, by demonstrating that we are \nwilling to defend our allies, we dramatically reduce the chances that \nwe will ever actually have to commit troops to do so.\n  This has been true in the past, and I believe it will remain true in \nthe future.\n  A second question we must address is the price of enlargement.\n  It is important that we be clear from the very start: There are costs \nassociated with expanding NATO. And, while most of these costs will be \nborne by the new member nations, some of the costs will fall to \nexisting members of the alliance, including the United States.\n  The initial estimates of the costs to the US were quite high. Two \nthings have happened in the last year, however, to reduce projections \nof those costs.\n  First, NATO invited three members to join the alliance instead of \nfour, the number on which earlier estimates were based.\n  Second, and more significant, the military committee of NATO \nconducted a thorough analysis of the three potential new members and \nfound that their military infrastructures were in better shape than had \nbeen assumed. As a result, the cost of bringing them in line with NATO \nstandards is projected to be considerably less.\n  The new, more accurate estimates put the cost to US at an average of \n$40 million a year for 10 years.\n  I am not suggesting for a minute that this is a small amount. It's \nnot. But compare it to the price of some pieces of military hardware. \nOne Blackhawk helicopter costs $10 million. One Harrier jump jet costs \n$27 million. One F-15 Eagle fighter costs $43 million. One Trident II \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missile costs $53 million. And one B-2 \nbomber costs $2 billion--five times more than the entire 10-year cost \nof expanding NATO.\n  No, $400 million over 10 years is not a small amount. But if it can \nhelp extend stability and security in central and eastern Europe, it is \nnot a bad bargain.\n  It is also important to note, Mr. President, that Poland, Hungary and \nthe Czech Republic will be compelled to modernize their defenses--\nwhether or not they join NATO.\n  If that modernization takes place within NATO's framework, however, \nwe avoid the risk of re-nationalizing militaries that have caused so \nmuch instability in Europe in the past.\n  The third question we must consider is if, in expanding NATO, we are \nsimply drawing new lines in the sand, and thus creating the potential \nfor new conflicts.\n  Again, I want to quote President Havel, who has also considered the \nconsequences of refusing to erase the old lines. ``If this way of \nthinking prevails,'' he warns, ``it will turn the alliance into a \nhopelessly antiquated club of Cold War veterans.''\n  We can't allow that to happen.\n  It is not this Senate, or the NATO alliance, that erased the old \ndividing lines of Yalta. History erased those lines. The power of \nfreedom and democracy erased those lines. We must not maintain an \nobsolete line in Europe because we are afraid of drawing a new line. We \nmust not let fear of an old enemy keep us from embracing a new ally.\n  Hitler and Stalin helped draw the line that placed Poland and Hungary \nand the Czech Republic on the wrong side of freedom in 1944. By \nadmitting these nations to NATO, we are erasing that line.\n  Finally, there is a fourth question that some have raised in this \ndebate. That is, when will we next consider expanding NATO? And which \nnations should we consider?\n  I believe that question is premature. We should remain open-minded. \nBut we haven't yet approved the first expansion. We need to see this \nprocess through and carefully and thoroughly evaluate it before we can \nmake any sort of informed decision about admitting additional new \nmembers to the alliance. I see no reason why we should commit ourselves \nto a fixed timetable or list of additional entrants now.\n  The danger in Europe today does not come from a totalitarian \nsuperpower. The danger in Europe today comes from aggressive \nnationalism and terrorism and the spread and misuse of nuclear weapons \nand other weapons of mass destruction.\n  By bringing Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO's circle \nof security and democracy, we will strengthen the bulkhead against \nthese destructive forces. We will bolster NATO's fighting capacity by \nadding 200,000 troops. We will add geographically significant territory \nto the alliance. We will increase NATO's understanding of these new \nthreats, and thus its ability to head them off.\n  And all of this, Mr. President, is in the United States' national \nsecurity interest.\n  When the Berlin Wall fell, it answered the prayers of millions of \npeople all over the world. It also created a new landscape in Europe. \nExtending NATO membership to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nwill help ensure that democracy and freedom fill that landscape, rather \nthan old hatreds and outdated ideologies.\n  In his first speech as President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel \ndescribed his dream for his country.\n  ``I dream,'' he said, ``of a republic independent, free, and \ndemocratic, of a republic economically prosperous and yet socially \njust, in short, of a humane republic which serves the individual and \nwhich therefore holds the hope that the individual will serve it in \nturn.''\n  In the years since the Berlin Wall collapsed, Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic all have made great strides toward achieving that dream. \nThey have demonstrated that they meet NATO's standards for membership, \nand that they can contribute to the alliance in a meaningful way.\n  For all these reasons, I will vote to expand the NATO Treaty to \ninclude these three new democracies, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief as we complete debate on the \nresolution of ratification providing our advice and consent to the \naddition of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Ths has been an excellent debate in the finest traditions of the \nSenate. We have spent more than 40 hours on the resolution over the \ncourse of 9 days. Almost 50 Senators have made statement, many of them \non several occasions. The Senate has considered 20 amendments. We have \nadopted 12 and rejected 8. This is in addition to the 4 conditions and \n7 declarations in the committee's Resolution.\n  Many people deserve credit in this debate. The Chairman of Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms, has shown great leadership. Senator \nRoth led the NATO Observer Group with energy and diligence. Senator \nBiden served as the lead Democrat to both and made valuable--and \nfrequent--contributions to our debate. Senator Gordon Smith, Chair of \nthe Europe Subcommittee played a central role.\n  Many staff played key roles as well. Steve Biegun, Brian McKeon, Beth \nWilson and Mike Haltzel of the Foreign Relations Committee can all now \nget on with their lives. Ian Brzezinski (BRA-zin-ski) with Senator Roth \nwas always there for the Observer Group. The Congressional Research \nService, especially Stan Sloan, on the floor now, provided invaluable \nservices for members on both sides of the issue. Legislative Counsel \nArt Rynerson drafted virtually all of the language we have been \ndebating.\n  A number of issues have been raised in our consideration. We have \naddressed future enlargement, NATO's mission, costs, Bosnia and arms \ncontrol. I believe all sides have had an opportunity to have their \nvoices heard. Now it is time to cast our votes.\n  Much has been said about Russia over the past week--how Russia will \nreact to NATO enlargement and the impact on a wide range of bilateral \nissues. Both sides agree that Russian hard-liners should not have a \nveto over our course of action. But supporters and opponents of \nenlargement differ greatly over the impact on our relations with \nRussia.\n  We have heard many estimates of how our vote will influence the \ntangled web of Russian politics and the disturbing course of Russian \nforeign policy. I do not think anyone can predict the impact with \ncomplete precision. But we can look at some basic facts.\n  First, NATO poses no threat to Russia. No serious person inside or \noutside Russia believes NATO--with 16 or 19 members--jeopardizes \nRussia. The\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nthought of Czech tanks rolling across the Russian steppes is ludicrous.\n  Second, the average Russian is not concerned about NATO enlargement. \nA recent poll even shows the majority of Russians in Moscow support \nadding these three countries to NATO.\n  Third, the Russians have delayed action on START II for years. NATO \nenlargement is only the latest in a long line of reasons given for \ntheir inaction.\n  Fourth, Russian diplomacy in Brussels has not been affected by our \ndebate here. Just yesterday, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council \ndiscussed a wide range of issues. Alleged Russian concerns about \nenlargement were not an issue.\n  Finally, long before NATO enlargement became a real possibility, \nRussia has engaged in a large number of foreign policy actions that \nharm our interests--from proliferation to Iran and violations of START \nI to subversion of its neighbors. NATO enlargement may provide an \nexcuse for Russian adventurism, but will not provide a cause.\n  Our principle concern with Russia must be Russian behavior--not the \nvolatile mood swings of Russian domestic politics.\n  Mr. President, this will be a historic vote. It is fitting that we \nare voting on including the Czech Republic in NATO sixty years after \nthe sellout at Munich, fifty years after the communist coup in Prague, \nand thirty years after Soviet tanks crushed the winds of freedom in \nCzechoslovakia.\n  That is the past and, as many Senators have pointed out, this vote is \nabout the future. It is about what kind of a Europe we want to see. It \nis about what kind of allies we want in a continent where we have \nfought three great wars in this century.\n  Expanding NATO is about ensuring this generation and future \ngenerations are not called to fight a fourth time. It is about a 21st \ncentury trans-Atlantic partnership that provides more freedom, more \nsecurity and more opportunity for all of us.\n  A few days ago, I received a letter from Polish Foreign Minister \nGeremek (GAR-a-mech). His words are an appropriate way to close debate:\n\n       The consistent and visionary foreign policy of the United \n     States has opened a historic window of opportunity. Just as \n     in 1989, it was American leadership which was the decisive \n     factor in ending the Cold War. . . . so today it is the U.S. \n     Senate which will decide whether a new page is turned in \n     history of the Transatlantic area and Eurasia. It will be a \n     chapter testifying to the triumph of freedom and democracy \n     and to the success of the biggest and most successful \n     alliance in world history. It will strengthen the Alliance to \n     the clear advantage of Europe and America.\n\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation in reaching this moment. I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the votes are final passage of the NATO \nenlargement treaty, and according to the rules of the Senate, Senators \nshould be in their assigned desks and vote from their desks. That is in \nthe rules. I have discussed it with Senator Byrd. We are all here. I \nthink it would be an appropriate thing for us to do. The rules do \nrequire it.\n  I also think it would help us expedite the vote. So, if the Senators \nwould take their assigned desks, we will have a vote on the historic \ntreaty.\n  The second vote is final passage of the supplemental appropriations \nbill. Tomorrow, the Senate will debate the Workforce Development Act \nunder a time agreement of no more than 4 hours. Several amendments will \nbe offered. Consequently, those votes will be postponed to occur \nTuesday, May 5, at 5:30.\n  Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the IRS reform bill. I \nknow we will have a number of Senators who will wish to make opening \nstatements. We will check with the managers and with the leadership to \nsee about the possibility of amendments being offered. But if they are \noffered, they, too, would occur at 5:30 on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for a productive week. I \ncongratulate the managers of this legislation. I thank the Senators who \nmade it possible for us to complete this action tonight. I know some of \nthose who are opposed to it would have liked to have delayed it over \nuntil next week, but I believe the time is right for us to vote. I \nthank all Senators for their help, and I thank Senator Daschle for his \ncooperation and I yield to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor yielding. I also thank the distinguished majority leader for \ncalling to the attention of Senators the following standing order, \nwhich I hope that Senators will contemplate. And I congratulate the \nmajority leader for enforcing this regulation. Any Senator may ask the \nChair to enforce this regulation at any time. I have often thought \nabout it. I think we ought to follow this regulation, Mr. Leader, and I \nhope that we will establish this as a practice and continue to do it.\n  The Senate would make a much better impression, not only upon the \nvisitors but also on Senators themselves, if they learn to sit in their \nseats to answer the rollcall. And they will take greater pride in this \ninstitution. I guarantee that, watching from the galleries, it would be \na much more impressive sight during rollcall votes than what we have \nbeen accustomed to seeing down here in the well, which looks like the \nfloor of a stock market. I have been to the stock market on a few \noccasions. It doesn't look any worse.\n  Let me read this standing order of the Senate. It is on page 157 of \nthe Senate manual. All Senators who wish to read it, here it is. It is \nonly three lines. The heading, ``VOTES SHALL BE CAST FROM ASSIGNED \nDESK.''\n\n       Resolved, that it is a standing order of the Senate that \n     during yea and nay votes in the Senate, each Senator shall \n     vote from the assigned desk of the Senator.\n\n  This was by Senate Resolution 480 in the 98th Congress, the Second \nSession, October 11, 1984.\n  This is a great day for me. I am glad to see the leader asking that \nSenators abide by this regulation, which we voted on, those of us who \nwere here in 1984.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Senator Byrd. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back the time? The \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \nendured nearly half a century of communist domination as a result of \nexpedient and short-sighted policies of the West. Today, we have the \nopportunity to remedy that injustice while securing democracy in \nCentral Europe for future generations.\n  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have established democratic \ngovernments, each has built a market economy, and all three work with \nus in defense of liberty from Cuba to China.\n  In my judgment, Mr. President, these three countries belong to NATO. \nI have met with the Foreign Ministers of all three countries. They \nunderstand the commitment and responsibilities that they undertake by \njoining NATO. I am confident they will meet all of their obligations.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee held 8 hearings in the past six \nmonths, heard from 37 supporters and opponents of NATO expansion. \nBefore the Committee hearings, I myself had concerns about NATO \nexpansion, including what it would cost, how we could deal with Russia, \nand the future mission of NATO. The Committee's resolution addresses \nall of these points and passed by a vote of 16-2.\n  Mr. President, NATO enlargement has been endorsed by countless \ndistinguished individuals including Margaret Thatcher, Jeane \nKirkpatrick, Caspar Weinberger, and Richard Perle. In addition, the \nForeign Relations Committee has received endorsements of this policy \nfrom every living former U.S. Secretary of State, numerous former \nSecretaries of Defense and national security advisors, and more than \nsixty flag officers and general officers, including five distinguished \nformer Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote overwhelmingly in support \nof NATO enlargement. This is the right decision for the United States \nof America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. A century ago, our \npredecessors in the U.S. Senate took a very bold step in ratifying the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty.\n  It is easy for us today to forget what a break with the past that \nvote represented. For the first time, this country committed itself, in \npeacetime, to\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\nthe defense of democratic Europe. The Senate recognized by its far-\nsighted action that our future--indeed our own freedom--is inextricably \nbound to Europe.\n  The success of the fledgling NATO was by no means certain. Western \nEurope was made up of a jumble of nations, several of which had only \nrecently been at each others' throats. Germany and France alone had \nfought each other three times in 74 years. The three western zones of \nGermany, which were not the Federal Republic and, in fact, were not \ninvited to join NATO.\n  The countries of Western Europe were economically weak, not yet \nhaving recovered nearly fully from the devastation of World War II.\n  Several European NATO members had strong Communist parties whose \nloyalty and commitment to democracy were suspect.\n  Mr. President, our predecessors took a gamble. Fortunately for us and \nour children--and I hope for our grandchildren--NATO succeeded beyond \nthe Senate s fondest expectations.\n  As we all know, for 40 years, it kept Soviet imperialism at bay, \nthereby providing the security umbrella under which democratic Western \nEurope could recover socially and economically, and thrive.\n  In the process, NATO expanded its membership three times to welcome \nGreece and Turkey, West Germany, and Spain. With each expansion the \nAlliance was strengthened.\n  Largely thanks to NATO's persistence, communism in most of Europe \ncrumbled, including in the Soviet Union.\n  Now, nearly 50 years after our predecessors met the challenge of \ntheir time, we are called upon, once again, to take up the torch.\n  Three highly qualified democracies that chafed under the Communist \nyoke for four decades are now candidates for membership in NATO. \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have already rejoined the West \npolitically and socially. Tonight we can vote to readmit them to the \nWest's security framework.\n  In a larger sense we will be righting a historical injustice forced \nupon the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians by Joseph Stalin.\n  Mr. President, NATO enlargement is squarely in America's national \ninterest. It is in Europe's interest. And yes--by stabilizing a \nhistoric crucible of violence in East-Central Europe--it is in Russia s \ninterest.\n  I am proud to be able to play a small part in this historic occasion. \nI will cast my vote with conviction to ratify the Resolution of \nRatification, and I urge my colleagues to join me. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I shall cast my vote in opposition for the \nreasons that I have stated over the past several days in what I regard \nis an excellent debate. But if it is the will of two-thirds of the U.S. \nSenate that this ratification go forward, then I commit, and I hope \nothers will commit, who have been in opposition, to do our very best to \nmake it work.\n  I think it is going to pose a mighty challenge to make it work, but \nif that is the decision of this body, for which I have infinite \nrespect, then I commit as a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nwhere I will have some special responsibilities, to make it work.\n  But I also say that I shall be among others who will maintain a vigil \nas to the future with an open and objective mind but still predicated \nin my own thoughts on what I have expressed on this floor about future \nadditions of other nations in a manner that would be untimely to make \nthis treaty last another 50 years. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on both sides? If so, \nthe question is on agreeing to the committee amendment, as amended.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the Senate will now go into \nlegislative session.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill, H.R. 3579, making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for \nother purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill H.R. \n     3579, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of April 30, 1998.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the House passed earlier today the \nemergency supplemental appropriations conference report by substantial \nmargin.\n  I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to my friend and \ncolleague from West Virginia, Sen. Byrd, for his assistance and \ncooperation in presenting this bill to the Senate.\n  Our Committee worked in a bipartisan manner through every step of the \nprocess of moving this emergency supplemental bill through the Senate, \nand back from conference.\n  I strongly urge all my colleagues to vote in support of this bill, \nwhich addresses urgent funding requirements for the Department of \nDefense, and many agencies responsible for dealing with natural \ndisasters.\n  The conference report provides $2.8 billion for emergency defense \naccounts.\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\nThese amounts are not offset by any reductions to defense or non-\ndefense appropriations--they are treated genuinely as emergencies.\n  We recommend these appropriations based on the expenditures already \nmade by the military, and recognizing the devastating effect of failing \nto provide these funds now.\n  The Congress will have the opportunity to consider the proposed \nfunding for missions in Bosnia and southwest Asia in the fiscal year \n1999 defense authorization and appropriations bills. This supplemental \nfunding does not prejudge the decisions we face later this year.\n  The conference report provides $2.6 billion in nondefense emergency \nappropriations, for FEMA, the Departments of Agriculture, \nTransportation and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  These appropriations are offset by budget authority reductions to \ncontract authority available for HUD sec. 8 housing and the airport \nimprovement program.\n  Based on extensive discussions with the administration, these amounts \nare not required to execute these programs during the remainder of \nfiscal year 1998.\n  We do face the need to monitor these accounts closely for fiscal year \n1999, and some additional funds may be needed for the HUD section 8 \nhousing.\n  Mr. President, I very much regret that the conference report does not \ninclude the funding passed by the Senate for the International Monetary \nFund.\n  The House wishes to take up IMF funding in a separate vehicle, which \nhas been reported by the House Appropriations Committee.\n  Speaker Gingrich has committed to holding a vote on the IMF bill in \nthe House. I hope that vote comes later this month, so that we can \nassure the markets in Asia, and the global financial community, of our \nNation's commitment to maintaining economic stability and growth.\n  Mr. President, before closing, I want to note the exceptional work \nundertaken by the staff of the House and Senate appropriations \ncommittees.\n  Our conference met for the first time at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, and \ncompleted most of its work Wednesday night at 6:00 p.m.\n  By 9:30 a.m. today, the official papers were prepared and ready to \nfile--a remarkable achievement.\n  I want to especially note the contributions of Jay Kimmitt, Jack \nConway and Richard Larson of the Senate committee staff, and John \nMikal, Dennis Kedzior and Chuck Parkinson of the House committee staff.\n  Mr. President, we need to pass this bill tonight, and I believe we \nhave returned to the Senate a good bill, that merits the Senate's \nsupport.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate all the conferees on this \nvery important disaster assistance supplemental appropriation bill, and \nin particular, the chairman and ranking member of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Chairman Livingston and Mr. Obey, as well as \nSenator Stevens, who chaired the conference, for the successful \ncompletion of what has been a very difficult conference.\n  Many of the issues that came before the conference and required \nextensive debate were extraneous matters that had nothing to do with \nthe primary purposes of the bill, to provide emergency appropriations \nfor our men and women in uniform in Bosnia and Southwest Asia and to \nprovide emergency disaster assistance to those of our citizens who have \nsuffered from the devastating series of natural disasters that have \nbeset the country in recent months--from the ice storms this past \nwinter in the northeast to the flooding in the western and southern \nportions of the nation, as well as the recent killer tornadoes \nthroughout the southern states. There was very little disagreement on \nthese matters among the conferees. We all understood the urgency of \nproviding the necessary resources for these emergency purposes.\n  Nevertheless, as I say, we were faced with a number of potential \ncontroversial, extraneous legislative riders which had to be debated \nand disposed of. Those issues ranged from whether to include language \nin this conference agreement that was in neither version of the bill \nrelating to such things as: interest rates on guaranteed student loans; \nwhether to insert portions of the recently-completed Agricultural \nResearch Conference Report; and whether to override the President's \nExecutive Order prohibiting the importation of assault weapons. Such \nextraneous issues consumed a considerable amount of time but, I am \npleased to say, most were not adopted by the conference.\n  In all, the bill contains some $2.86 billion to cover the cost of the \nmilitary operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, together with $2.6 \nbillion in emergency disaster assistance payments, principal among \nwhich are $1.6 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n$259 million in emergency Federal-aid highway relief, and $130 million \nfor community development block grants. The appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense, as well as the disaster assistance payments were \nrequested by the President as emergency appropriations and, as such, \nunder the Budget Enforcement Act, require no offsets. The Senate \nversion of the bill, therefore, contained no offsets for any of the \naforementioned emergency items. Nevertheless the House conferees \ninsisted that the appropriations totaling $2.6 billion for emergency \nassistance for natural disasters be offset, in budget authority only, \nby rescissions of $2.3 billion in Section 8 Housing authority reserves \nand $241 million in excess contract authority in the FAA Airport \nImprovement Program.\n  I am pleased that the conferees accepted the Senate amendment which \nprovided the full $550 million request of the President for veterans \ncompensation and pensions. These funds were not included in the House \nversion of the bill before the conferees. The funds are needed to \naccommodate the additional costs associated with the 1998 cost-of-\nliving adjustment of 2.1 percent for compensation beneficiaries; an \nincrease in the estimated number of compensation beneficiaries; and an \nincrease in the average payments to compensation and \npension beneficiaries. It is important that we keep faith with our \nveterans, who have sacrificed so much in their service to our country, \nand I am delighted that the conferees agreed to provide these funds on \na timely basis so that there will be no interruption in these payments \nto our veterans. In addition, the bill also includes some $142 million \nin appropriations for various agencies to enable them to continue their \noperations throughout the balance of the fiscal year. These latter \namounts are appropriately offset by rescissions.\n\n  I am pleased that the conference accepted my amendment to the Senate-\nversion of the bill, which was cosponsored by the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, and which requires the \nPresident to seek support aggressively from our allies and friends to \nshare the burden of containing the Iraqi menace in the Middle East. In \nmy view, Mr. President, this provision is essential as I do not believe \nthat we should shoulder this burden alone. To this end, I note that the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, as well as selected other \nmembers of the committee, will shortly depart for the Middle East in \norder to impress upon the leaders of our allies in that area of the \nworld the importance that we place upon increased burdensharing by our \nallies in this very critical aspect of international peacekeeping that \nis so important to stability in today's world.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am disappointed that the House conferees \nwere unable to accept a Senate amendment offered by myself, Senator \nDorgan, and other Senators to establish a congressional commission to \nstudy causes and consequences of our trade deficits. I have noted that \nthe trade deficit numbers for February are now at a decade-high monthly \nlevel, primarily as a result of the Japanese economic problem. We have \nnot had a comprehensive review of our national trade policies since \n1970--nearly 30 years ago. This legislation has been 3 years in the \nmaking, and my Senate amendment would have established a congressional \ncommission composed of twelve members--six members nominated by the \nSenate and six members nominated by the House, four of whom shall be \nMembers of congress. Nevertheless, the conferees did agree in the \nStatement of Managers to include the following:\n  ``The managers considered, but did not adopt, language that would \ncreate a Trade Deficit Review Commission, as\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\nproposed by the Senate. The conferees agree that serious concerns exist \nregarding continuing trade deficits and intend to work with the \nlegislative committees of jurisdiction to establish such a Commission, \nincluding in the context of the fiscal year 1999 appropriations \nprocess.''\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of high priority. Senator Dorgan and \nI will be monitoring this important matter closely. We hope that the \nvarious legislative committees of jurisdiction will take up this issue \nat a very early date. In any case, the members can count on Senator \nDorgan and me to revisit this matter on a timely basis later this year \nif no action has been taken in the interim.\n  I know that the administration is disappointed that the conference \nhas not chosen to include payments to the International Monetary Fund. \nThis matter was debated at great length during the conference and it \nwas determined that the House, at this time, was not prepared to yield \non this issue.\n  I, again, thank all conferees for their diligent efforts throughout \nthe past week in resolving all of the difficult issues faced in the \nconference and particularly the chairman of our committee, Senator \nStevens, who chaired this, his first supplemental appropriations \nconference, with great patience, skill, and good humor.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I express my sincere gratitude to the \nmanager of the bill, Senator Stevens, and to the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Interior, Senator Gorton. Yesterday, I raised with them \nan issue of concern regarding amendments to the Coastal Barrier \nResources System, a program under the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, that the conferees were considering. \nThese amendment would have adjusted the boundaries of several units \ncurrently in the System in Florida, and they are quite controversial.\n  Senator Stevens and Senator Gorton were both very gracious and \naccommodating to my concerns. They chose not to include the amendments, \nand instead included language in the report stating that the managers \nwill work with the committees of jurisdiction to explore the \npossibility of a legislative remedy in the context of future \nappropriations bill or other legislative vehicle. I very must \nappreciate this collaborative approach.\n  Again, I express my sincere thanks to my esteemed colleagues, \nSenators Stevens and Gorton.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Supplemental \nConference report, and I oppose it for the same reasons I opposed the \noriginal Senate Supplemental Appropriations bill in the Appropriaitons \nCommittee.\n  While I want to go on record supporting the funding for our \noperations in Bosnia and Iraq, I am voting against this bill because I \nbelieve we should have found a way to offset this defense spending. I \nunderstand that some of the funding was unanticipated, but certainly \nnot all of it. If we are truly committed to a balanced budget, as I \nbelieve we should be, we need to make the tough choices to reduce \nspending in other areas of defense spending to pay for this bill.\n  I also want to state that I opposed the House bill which offset \ndefense spending with cuts in domestic programs. Separate defense and \ndomestic spending levels were set in last year's historic balanced \nbudget accord, and I see no reason to revisit those fundamental \ndecisions now. Except for truly unanticipated emergencies, the \nDepartment of Defense ought to make the tough decision that allows it \nto live within its budget. If the non-emergency defense spending in \nthis bill was not important enough to make the Department of Defense's \nFY 1998 budget, it is not important enough to justify raiding cash-\nstrapped domestic programs.\n  And finally, I am disappointed that this legislation does not include \nfunding for the International Monetary Fund's quota increase and New \nArrangements to Borrow. The situation in Asia has clearly demonstrated \nthat while the mission of the IMF is now more important than ever, the \ncurrent resources of the fund are not adequate to meet the demands of \nthat mission. We have a responsibility to every American, whether they \nbe consumer, business person, job seeker or job holder, to promote \npolicies that help grow the global economy to which the American \neconomy is increasingly and inextricably linked. Simply put, our future \ndepends on the future of our neighbors and trading partners. Many of my \ncolleagues have raised legitimate concerns regarding IMF reform, \nconcerns which should be addressed. But our primary task for today was \nto provide the IMF with the resources necessary to continue its \nimportant mission, and I regret that Congress failed to live up to that \nresponsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3907-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3909-S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA POLICE CHIEF\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nSection 10007, a general provision included in the conference report \nfor the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1998. My amendment is a technical amendment clarifying that the terms \nof the contract recently signed by the new Police Chief for the \nDistrict of Columbia are valid and not in conflict with existing law. \nThe new Police Chief, Charles Ramsey, was unanimously approved for the \njob by the D.C. Council, the Mayor, the D.C. Financial Responsibility \nand Management Assistance Authority (the Control Board) and the Mayor's \nCitizens Advisory Panel. The employment contract, which called for \nChief Ramsey to report to the Control Board, was signed by the Mayor \nwithout objection on April 21, 1998. An April 23, 1998 legal opinion \nwritten by the District of Columbia Corporation Counsel challenges the \nlegality of the contract. This opinion has created a potential crisis \nof uncertainty over who Chief Ramsey will report to and threatens to \nsidetrack the Chief as he begins to clean house at a very troubled \ndepartment. My amendment simply states that the Chief's April 21, 1998 \ncontract is valid. It also makes clear that, so long as the Control \nBoard--which Congress created--exists, all future Chiefs of Police will \nwork under the same reporting conditions as Chief Ramsey. This \namendment is imperative if we are to support the Control Board, Chief \nRamsey, and the citizens of the District of Columbia, who deserve a \npolice department that can protect them on the streets and in their \nneighborhoods.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Chairman Stevens, Senator Bond, Senator Domenici and their staffs \nfor their efforts on behalf of the citizens of Alabama. Over the last \nseveral months, Alabama has suffered greatly as a result of multiple \nnatural disasters. As the state was addressing the flooding in its \nSouthern regions, a series of violent tornados devastated portions of \nNorthern Alabama. These terrible events resulted in loss of life and \nextensive property and infrastructure damage. In many cases, whole \ncommunities were destroyed. While communities have banded together to \nbegin the process of rebuilding their lives, the need for assistance is \nobvious to anyone who has viewed the destruction firsthand.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Missouri as the Chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA/HUD and Independent Agencies \nto increase the funding provided by the Community Development Block \nGrant (CDBG) program. Although there has been extensive promotion of \nbuyouts and relocation, it is my understanding that only 3 million \ndollars is available to the State of Alabama through hazard mitigation \nfunding for this purpose. These funds are dramatically insufficient to \nmeet the current needs and demands of the communities hit by these \ndisasters. It is my understanding that the State of Alabama will be \neligible for the CDBG funds included in this bill to respond to the \nflood and tornado disasters. Is it the Chairman's understanding that \nthis funding could be used by the State for buyouts?\n  Mr. BOND. As you know, in large part to your help, the conference \nreport to the FY 1998 Supplemental appropriations bill includes $130 \nmillion for emergency CDBG funding that is intended to meet unmet \nemergency disaster needs by supplementing the existing, more \ntraditional disaster programs administered through FEMA, the SBA and \nthe Corps of Engineers. While there remains significant concerns over \nHUD's administration of\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\nemergency CDBG funding, buyout funding is an eligible activity under \nboth FEMA disaster relief and HUD emergency CDBG funding, and I expect \nany request for buyout funding for Alabama to receive the full \nconsideration by both FEMA and HUD. Nevertheless, the term ``buyout'' \nhas become overused and has come to mean different things to different \npeople. The federal government should be providing communities with a \nmenu of flexible approaches to address emergency disaster needs. This \nflexibility is critical to the people of Alabama. In addition, I urge \nboth FEMA and HUD to develop comprehensive yet flexible requirements \nfor buyouts, including eligibility and cost requirements.\n  Mr. SHELBY. If the State is able to use CDBG money for buyouts, this \nwill certainly help them meet the demand for buyouts that currently \nexceed the funding made available through the hazard mitigation \nprogram. Is it correct that States eligible for this funding would be \nable to obtain waivers from the low to moderate income requirement in \norder to make use of this funding for the purposes of responding to \ntheir disaster needs?\n  Mr. BOND. Correct, waivers are included to help programs address \nlocal needs. Emergency CDBG funding needs to remain flexible to assist \nfamilies and individuals in these times of real crisis.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I want to thank the Senator from Missouri again for his \nhelp and effort to ensure that adequate funding is provided for \ndisaster assistance. It is my hope that this funding will be made \navailable expeditiously and equitably to those States currently \nrecovering from disasters. While the funding provided through this \nbill, due in great part to your assistance, will help, I believe that \nAlabama will still face huge hurdles in its recovery process. I look \nforward to continuing to work with you to address the needs of those \ntrying to rebuild.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks this \nafternoon by recognizing and applauding the efforts of my colleague, \nthe distinguished Senior Senator from Alabama, for all of his efforts \nin working to ensure that the Supplemental Appropriations bill produced \nby the conference committee includes badly needed relief for our home \nstate of Alabama in the wake of the terrible natural disasters that \nhave occurred over the past month. Senator Shelby has worked tirelessly \nto see to it that this document includes assistance for those \ncommunities that have suffered so much in the wake of the recent spate \nof floods and tornadoes that have so severely struck our state. In his \nposition as a member of the Appropriations committee and as a \nconference to this bill, Senator Shelby has been a true champion for \nthe interests of his constituents. It is fitting and appropriate that \nhis work be generously acknowledged.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the efforts \nof the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and to thank him for \nall of the assistance he offered during the conference negotiations \nover the disaster provisions in the bill. It is very likely that \nwithout the support and the leadership provided by Senator Stevens, we \nwould have been unable to secure funding for the town of Elba, Alabama. \nElba has recently been devastated by flooding caused after rain swollen \nrivers forced the town's levees to give way. Thanks to Senator Stevens' \ngenerous support, this bill contain $5 million in funding to help \nrepair Elba's levee. I can not begin to express how much Senator \nStevens' willingness to go to bat for this small Alabama town means to \nthis Senator.\n  Finally, I want to thank my good friend Senator Bond of Missouri for \nyour willingness to work with Senator Shelby and myself to ensure that \nthe increased money that this bill provides for Community Development \nBlock Grants will get to those who are direly in need of them. The \nsupplemental bill contains $130 million in Community Development Block \nGrant funding. This funding, which is important to communities seeking \nto recover from devastating events, like those events my state has \nrecently suffered through, needs safeguards to ensure that it \nultimately reaches those areas where it is most desperately needed. It \nis imperative that the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nmakes these grants really available to areas within Alabama that have \nsuffered from these natural disasters. Over the last few weeks my \noffice has been receiving requests from communities throughout the \nstate, communities such as Birmingham and Elba, Geneva, Brewton and \nEast Brewton, all asking that these funds be made available to them so \nthat they might begin the difficult task of rebuilding. Senator Bond, \nyour willingness to help work to ensure that this funding gets back to \nthe devastated areas within my state is very generous, and I appreciate \nyour commitment greatly.\n  Mr. President, this supplemental bill goes a long way toward \nbeginning the healing process for the citizens in my state that have \nrecently had to shoulder such a heavy burden. I have personally visited \nthe sites in my state that were the hardest hit, and I can assure you \nthat the scope of the devastation and the scope of the personal, human \ntoll these disasters have taken is beyond my ability to adequately \nconvey. This supplemental disaster bill is a good bill, a solid bill \nand I look forward to securing its passage so that the relief provided \nwithin can be begin to get back to the people of Alabama.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today we are voting on the FY 1998 \nSupplementary Appropriations bill which contains very important \ndisaster relief and funding for our military operations overseas.\n  In this bill before us, Congress funds emergency disaster relief for \nEl Nino related storms on both coasts and in the southeast. We also \nprovide important funding for our military personnel in Bosnia. \nAlthough I have been on record consistently opposing our continued \npresence in Bosnia, I support our military men and women while they are \nthere. This bill provides that important support.\n  This appropriations bill also funds our military mission in Iraq. \nWhile I am skeptical of the dubious and undefined U.S. plan in this \nregion, I again vote to make sure our military personnel serving our \ncountry there are well equipped and defended. This bill provides this \nassurance.\n  This bill also provides some important local relief for Colorado. \nThis legislation contains language to assist the City of Boulder. \nBoulder needs to replace a water pipeline that crosses Forest Service \nlands. The language in the bill provides assurance that Boulder does \nnot abandon its original easement when it agrees with the Forest \nService to relocate the pipeline.\n  This bill also contains important relief for the National Forests in \nnorthern Colorado. Recently, a unique meteorological situation occurred \nin Routt County, near Steamboat Springs, called a blowdown. A blowdown \nis exactly that--winds of such terrific and concentrated force blew \ndown almost every tree in the region. It looked as though a large \nnuclear bomb was detonated above. This devastating disaster affected \n20,000 acres of land, almost all which was on national forest land and \nwas the largest such blowdown ever recorded in the Rocky Mountains.\n  Part of the $10 million appropriated by this bill to the National \nForest System would support the cleanup efforts in the Routt National \nForest in Colorado. This would assist the local communities which rely \non the natural resources of the Routt National Forest for tourism, \nrecreation, agriculture, and timber can get back to normal. Not only \nwill this help economies of the local communities, but it is vital for \nthe health of the Routt National Forest and the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness \nArea.\n  This funding will allow the Forest Service to establish a timber \nsalvage plan for the responsible harvest of the downed timber and \nmaintain the roads that will be necessary for this to take place. While \nthe prospect of a timber sale may seem objectionable to some people, I \nbelieve the responsible harvest of this timber in the national forest \nis preferential to the chance a natural or accidental forest fire might \noccur there.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to vote for this Supplemental \nAppropriations Conference Report because it contains important disaster \nrelief funds for Vermont, which was hard hit by ice storms this winter. \nVermont's maple syrup makers suffered devastating losses and these \nfunds will help them recover.\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\n  But were it not for that I would vote against this Conference Report, \nand I want to take a moment to explain why and to express my regret and \nfrustration about what has occurred here.\n  As senators will recall, the Senate passed by a vote of 84-16 funding \nfor the International Monetary Fund as part of this Supplemental. That \nfunding was strongly supported by Senator Stevens, the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. It had overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  It reflected obvious alarm about the economic crisis in Asia, and the \nfact that a third of all American jobs are tied to exports and a third \nof those exports go to Asian markets.\n  Secretary Rubin made a strong case that the IMF funding is urgently \nneeded to stem further weakening of the Asian economies.\n  So the IMF funding was an issue in the Conference Committee, but the \nHouse Republican conferees refused to recede to the Senate position. \nApparently the House leadership had ordered them not to agree to the \nIMF funding because of its continuing dispute with the President over \nthe completely unrelated issue of family planning.\n  Mr. President, it is outrageous that yet again we have a vitally \nimportant foreign policy matter being held hostage by the House in its \nseemingly endless and futile attempt to make political points over \nfamily planning.\n  The IMF funding has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with family \nplanning. They are separate issues and should be decided on their \nmerits, not used as political blackmail.\n  I mention this, Mr. President, because the American people, many of \nwhose jobs depend on the stability of foreign markets, should \nunderstand exactly what is happening here.\n  This is not about the IMF, it is about politics. The House Republican \nleadership is playing games with the lives of American workers. What do \nthey care? They know that whether or not the Asian economies recover or \ncollapse, the House Republican leadership will have a job regardless. \nThey are not the corn farmer in Iowa, or the manufacturer in Delaware.\n  Before they will agree to the IMF funding, the House Republican \nleadership wants the President to sign a law that prohibits US \nGovernment support for private organizations that use their own money \nto petition foreign governments on abortion. It would prohibit those \norganizations from even speaking on behalf of policies to make abortion \nsafer in countries where it is legal.\n  And if the President does not agree, they would cut funding for \nfamily planning which prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortions by \n$44 million. It is the most illogical approach to an issue I have ever \nseen.\n  Mr. President, we are back to tactics of sabotage, of blackmail, of \nbringing the government to its knees to win political points. \nApparently, as far as the House Republican leadership is concerned \nnothing matters anymore--not democracy, not the legislative process, \nand certainly not what is in the best interests of the country.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that it is up to the Senate to \nprevent the Congress from becoming totally irresponsible.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \ndisaster supplemental conference report. I would like to thank the \nconferees and Chairman Stevens for their efforts to meet the additional \nneeds Maine and the other Northeast states identified after the January \nice storm.\n  Since early January I have worked with the State, FEMA, SBA and other \nfederal agencies to ensure that the devastation from Ice Storm `98 \nwould become a memory and not a long-term problem in Maine. The impact \nof the storm was such that every Mainer who lived through it, will \nalways remember it--whether it be for the length of time they were \nwithout power, the loss of trees throughout the state, the amazing \nutility crews from up and down the East Coast who worked to restore \npower or simply the viciousness of mother nature.\n  The conference report provides assistance in several areas where \ncurrent federal programs simply couldn't handle the entire problem or \nwhere no program existed. Our forests are in shambles due to the damage \ninflicted on the trees by the ice. The conference report provides $48 \nmillion to the US Forest Service in order to help the states and \nprivate land owners assess the damage and develop plans for clean up \nand for ensuring a healthy future for the forests. There is an \nadditional $14 million in the Tree Assistance Program for cleanup. This \nfunding is much needed and very welcome.\n  There is $4.48 million included in the Emergency Conservation Program \nto help the maple syrup industry. This money, which will be matched, \nwill help restore tubing which was torn from the trees by the ice and \nreplace taps that were lost.\n  I am pleased that the conference report also contains funding for the \nNortheast dairy farmers. The lack of electricity prevented many farmers \nfrom milking their cows or from being able to store their milk at the \nnecessary temperature. The $10.8 million in the report will help cover \nsome of these losses as well as pay for stock that was lost as a result \nof the storm.\n  The $130 million included for the Community Development Block Grant \nprogram (CDBG) is not as much as I would have liked, but I understand \nthat the conferees had a large gap to negotiate as the House bill \nprovided only $20 million while the Senate bill had $260 million. This \nmoney is very important to Maine as it will assist the state in \ncovering disaster-related costs unmet by FEMA, including the biggest \nunmet need in Maine--the costs associated with the damages to our \nutility infrastructure.\n  I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the support that the \nCommittee Chairman has shown for the needs of Maine and the Northeast \nstates. His leadership has been vital in ensuring that the recovery \nfrom the Ice Storm of `98 for Maine, Vermont and New York will be \ncompleted as quickly as possible. Again, I appreciate his assistance \nand attention to the special needs of our states because of this one \nhundred year storm, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, like the vast majority of my colleagues, I \nam anxious to speed the funds provided by this bill to the communities \nall across our country that have been adversely affected by natural \ndisasters. I am equally anxious to provide the funds necessary to \nmaintain our crucial peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.\n  This spending is so important because it responds to emergencies--\nunforeseen events that cause terrible damage to property and to life. \nEveryone in this chamber understands that the unpredictable nature of \nthese unfortunate events makes budgeting or planning for disasters, by \ndefinition, very difficult. That is why the Senate's rules allow us to \nspend money on an emergency basis without finding offsetting budget \ncuts. And that is exactly what we in the Senate did when we passed this \nbill originally.\n  Unfortunately, through no fault of the distinguished Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, or Ranking Member Byrd, this \nbill now includes over $2.3 billion of cuts in rental assistance for \nvery low income families.\n  I regret to say that Republican conferees from the other body \ndemanded these cuts to move forward on this emergency bill. They chose, \nonce again, to try to use Americans who have seen their lives torn \napart by tornadoes or floods, who have lost homes and businesses, as a \ntool to attack the poor, to pursue their cruel ideological agenda.\n  I am incapable of understanding, Mr. President, what sense it makes \nto take away one man's home to pay for another's. It makes no sense to \nme whatsoever. Every year--year-after-year--this Congress raids the \nhousing budget to pay for other programs.\n  Of course the House Republican Leadership has offered ``assurances'' \nthat these funds will be restored. Who will pay for those? Will that \nmoney come from health care for veterans? From crucial environmental \nprograms? From our children's education? That, Mr. President, is only a \nshell game, and the victims, regardless of which ones are chosen, would \nbe the disadvantaged and powerless. That is nothing short of shameful.\n  There are 400,000 families who will lose their housing assistance if \nthese funds aren't restored next year. The\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development just released a report \nrevealing that 5.3 million families already live on the brink of \nhomelessness. Without rental assistance, that number will grow \ndramatically.\n  Mr. President, I also am terribly disappointed that the Republican \nMajority has chosen to play politics with two other vital matters: \nfunding to pay our arrearages to the United Nations, and funding for \nthe International Monetary Fund. The President, the Secretary of State, \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, numbers of other senior government \nofficials, and hundreds of international business leaders, economists, \nand foreign policy experts have pleaded with the Congress to take the \nresponsible step of meeting our obligations in these two key respects.\n  Our continued failure to pay our bills to the United Nations--an \norganization which helps reduce conflict in the world, and which we as \na nation press into service for such vital national security objectives \nas isolating Saddam Hussein in order to halt his diabolical adventurism \nand to prevent him from developing and using weapons of mass \ndestruction--not only threatens the ability of that institution to \nsurvive and function as designed and as we depend on it to function. \nOur failure sullies our leadership and announces to the world community \nof nations that we are too good, too mighty, too righteous to be \nbothered by the responsibilities of world citizenship. The thought that \nwe can do this perpetually and retain our influence for good; the \nthought that we can do this and retain the ability effectively to \ninsist that other nations meet their obligations to the world \ncommunity, is nothing less than preposterous.\n  Similarly, Mr. President, it appears that there are many in the \nCongress who are somehow both willing and able to play ostrich--to \npretend either that the effects of the economic collapse that has \nrippled through the nations and economies of the Pacific Rim are and \nwill remain wholly confined to that region of the world, or that the \nworld's most powerful economic engine--that of the United States--need \nplay no significant role in the international effort to help the \nbuffeted Asian nations regain economic stability before the disarray \nmakes itself felt very uncomfortably among Americans.\n  We should not be surprised, if we repeatedly insist on placing \nourselves above the responsibilities and obligations recognized by the \nrest of the developed world, if the rest of the world begins to isolate \nand ignore us and our wishes. We then may find ourselves paying a \nterrible price for our obstinacy and arrogance in a world where, \nincreasingly, our objectives must be met by diplomacy and persuasion \nrather than by force.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains essential funding. This funding is \nneeded to help the victims of disasters in a number of areas of our \nnation. It is needed to pay the costs incurred by our armed services to \noperate the humanitarian mission in Bosnia without cannibalizing funds \nneeded to maintain the readiness of our forces across the board. I am \ndistressed that my colleagues and I are presented with an all-or-\nnothing vote where, if we reject this bill for what it should do but \nfails to do, such as paying our U.N. arrearages and infusing funds into \nthe IMF, and what it irresponsibly does, which is to steal desperately \nneeded funds from efforts to meet the housing needs of our nation, we \nnecessarily will reject what it does for disaster victims and to \nreplenish the defense funding accounts that have been used to meet the \ncosts of our Bosnia activities.\n  I will vote for this bill, but I will do so with the strong \nreservations I have set forth. I hope the American people will take \nnote of what has been done here, and will respond appropriately.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Before we move to adoption of the conference report, two \ncolleagues have asked for a very short time frame to express themselves \non a particular provision. And I ask they be accorded that time before \nwe go to a final vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we have a time on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin and Senator \nBoxer both be accorded 2 minutes prior to the time we have a final vote \non the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do support the passage of this emergency \nsupplemental, but I want to point out to my colleagues something very \nimportant that happened in that committee. There is the presence of a \nrider in this particular bill. I think you ought to know about it, \nbecause you are going to get asked about it.\n  It will hurt American taxpayers. It will take literally $5.5 million \na month out of their pocket and put it into the pocket of big oil \ncompanies.\n  Now, what is this about? I will tell you in my remaining time.\n  The Mineral Management Services spent 2\\1/2\\ years working on a rule \nto figure out the best way to collect royalty payments from oil \ncompanies. What are royalty payments? They are payments that go to the \ntaxpayers when the companies drill on public lands.\n  In this particular emergency supplemental bill is a rider that never \nwas part of the House bill, was never part of the Senate bill. We had \n10 minutes to discuss it. And it stops this rule from going into \neffect. So every month that this new rule is stopped from going into \neffect, $5.5 million--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So every month this rule is stopped from going into \neffect, American taxpayers are shorted $5.5 million. Now maybe that \ndoesn't sound like a lot to the folks who put in this rider, but I can \ntell you the folks in your States are going to wonder why we did this, \nas it were, in the dead of night, because we really couldn't debate it \nas much as we should have.\n\n  Although my chairman was very generous and allowed me to make my \ncomments, I still believed that that rider should not have been placed \nthere when it was not part of either the House or Senate bill.\n  I yield the remainder to my colleague from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me rise and first thank the \nAppropriations Committee for the work on this bill.\n  I will not be able to vote for it for two reasons. First, I find it \ninteresting that after a week of debate in this Chamber and a lengthy \ndiscussion about America's role in world leadership, we follow this \nhistoric vote on the enlargement of NATO with an appropriations bill \nwhich fails to appropriate funds for our Nation's obligation to the \nUnited Nations. It is a source of embarrassment to our Nation that \nCongress continues to fail to meet its responsibility to the United \nNations. A great nation should pay its bills.\n  Let me also add to what the Senator from California said. If you look \nat this bill on page 69, section 3009, you will find a provision that \nhas never been in a House bill and never been in a Senate bill that \ncomes in here at the last minute on an emergency spending bill. It is a \nrider which will give to oil companies some $65 million in breaks for \noil and gas that they are taking off of public lands--lands owned by \ntaxpayers.\n  Last year, we passed a budget agreement with a provision in it for a \n$50 billion tax break for tobacco companies. We went back home and were \nembarrassed by it, came back and rescinded it. I'm afraid we are \nreturning home to face more embarrassment for this provision which, \nunfortunately, provides a break to oil companies at the expense of \ntaxpayers.\n  For the fiscal conservative listening, this money is not set off by \nany cuts in spending. This gives to the oil companies, pure and simple, \n$65 million out of the Treasury, at taxpayers' expense.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I want to bring a rider to the attention of Members.\n  In conference, a rider was added, not debated on this floor or in the \nHouse, that extended for 2 months the period\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\nof time in which Secretary Shalala and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services--for regulations on organ donation policy to be \nimplemented.\n  The organ donation policy advocated by patient transplant \norganizations, to have a much more equitable system of organ donation, \nwas put forward on a bipartisan basis support.\n  The Senator from Louisiana put in an amendment to delay the \nimplementation for 2 additional months over the objections of the \nadministration. People will be dying as a result of this. Sick people \nwho need organs are not going to get those organs as a result of this \ndelay.\n  We should not allow this to continue. I'm going to vote against this, \nand I hope that we will not continue this kind of delay.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Which Senator from Louisiana is he referring to?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I was referring to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee in the House.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are provisions in this bill that \nextend regulations. None of the provisions overrule regulations. There \nis an additional period of time in three instances for regulations to \nbe reviewed by Congress. We did not meet at night; only during the day. \nBut this is a very serious matter to get this bill passed to assure \nthat men and women of the armed services get the support they need to \ncontinue their training and also to meet the disasters that have \noccurred to this country during this year since we passed a 1998 \nappropriations bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl), is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 88, nays 11, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 118 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--88\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--11\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bumpers\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Gramm\n     Inhofe\n     Kohl\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Smith (NH)\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kyl\n       \n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Thanks to Staff\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to \nthank some of the incredibly qualified staff we have here. I don't know \nwhether the public realizes, but some of the young, and in the case of \nsome of my staff not so young, women and men are incredible assets to \nthis country. There are more Rhodes scholars, Marshall scholars, \nPh.D.s, professors, former professors, and incredibly talented people \nwho sit here in these seats, not only on treaties, but on every major \nthing we do and advise us.\n  On Chairman Helms' staff, as always, Admiral Bud Nance, a retired \nAdmiral in the U.S. Navy, and close friend of the chairman's and a \nclose advisor, did a terrific job in directing the entire staff and \nworking closely with our staff, as did a man who was kind enough to \nstay with me, a man who is a significant and capable lawyer, as well as \na staff director for the minority, Ed Hall. These two guys run that \noperation in a way, I say to the leader sitting here, that was almost \nlike the bipartisan days, the old days, in large part because they get \nalong so well and they trust each other so much.\n  Bud Nance is a gentleman who has already given decades of service to \nhis country in the U.S. Navy, and continues to serve the chairman in \nhis role as staff director.\n  Additionally, I thank Steve Biegun, Beth Wilson, and Alex Rodriguez, \nas well as Marshall Billingslea, of the majority staff, who did a \nfirst-rate job in pulling together our hearings last fall and in \nhelping draft the resolution of ratification.\n  On my staff, I will start with this man. I worry about these guys who \nhave one doctorate, but this guy has two. He came to me from a \ndistinguished career as a professor, as well as working in the Library \nof Congress, Dr. Mike Haltzel. He is the minority staff member for \nEuropean affairs. He traveled with me throughout the European capitals \nand to Russia in preparation for the hearings, and he wrote the major \nportions of the remarks given and rebuttals during this debate. It was \na pleasure to have him at my side.\n  During this process, he has been ably assisted by Mark Tauber, a \nPearson Fellow from the State Department; Ed Levine, the committee's \narms control expert; and Erin Logan, a Javits Fellow who has honored \nthe memory of our former colleague by her service to the committee.\n  In addition, Marnie Davidson, Ursula McManus, Dawn Ratliff, Mike \nSchmidt, and Marc Mellinger provided considerable assistance behind the \nscenes.\n  Finally, I thank my counsel on the committee, a young man who came to \nme out of Auburn, NY, 20 years ago to stay for a ``few days'' and \nstayed on, and while with me, he graduated from law school, clerked, \nand then came back and is the legal director for the committee, Brian \nMcKeon.\n\n\n                         Thanking Art Rynearson\n\n  Lastly, I thank Art Rynearson, who is a senior legislative counsel \nand has served the Senate and the Foreign Relations Committee for over \ntwo decades. I know him as Art. I have known him all these years as \nArt. He is one of those guys behind the scenes, the legislative counsel \nhere, who we take so much for granted, and who did an incredible job. \nIn the 105th Congress, the committee has placed a lot of demands on \nArt, starting with the Chemical Weapons Convention, the CFE Flank \nDocument, and then on the State Department authorization bill.\n  On NATO enlargement, he was enormously helpful, as he always is, in \nhelping us draft the resolution of ratification.\n  Over the past few months--indeed over the past 15 months --Art has \nworked tirelessly in assisting the Foreign Relations Committee with its \nbusy agenda. I would like to thank him for his competent \nprofessionalism and for always being there to help the committee staff.\n  Lastly, let me thank my colleagues. I believe it is not a presumption \nto say that the level of debate and the competence that they \ndemonstrated was impressive. I have great respect for those who voted \nnegatively on this because they thought about it long and hard.\n  I also find, I say to the President, in my 25 years here that when \nthe very big, important issues are before us, almost everyone steps up \nto the ball, no matter what side they come out on, on those big issues. \nIt is always a consequence of very thoughtful consideration and very \nengaging debate. It was an honor to be associated with the staff of the \nmajority and the minority.\n  I thank, lastly, the minority leader for doing what he has been kind \nenough to do with me since he has been leader--entrusting to me the \ntactics, if not the strategy, of how to proceed on a major piece of \nlegislation. I thank him for that. I thank him for his confidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just a moment. \nBut let me, while he is on the floor, congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware for his magnificent\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\nleadership over the course of the last several days. I said to him \nprivately, and I will say it at this point for the Record, that this \nwas one of his finest hours. This was a time when we needed his \nleadership, when we needed his expertise, when we could count on him to \nguide us through this very difficult period. He has done so, as he does \non so many occasions, with eloquence, with passion, with expertise, and \nwith a degree of credibility that I think suits this Senate and suits \nhim extraordinarily well. I congratulate him on his achievement.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nand others who have had so much to say with regard to our achievement \ntonight. This, indeed, is a very historic moment. I am honored to be a \npart of it. I am honored to serve with colleagues who led us so well \nduring this debate.\n  I again congratulate each and every one of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction with respect to the NATO enlargement treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3909-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the sister-city relationship between the City of Solleftea, \nSweden and the City of Madison, Mississippi. This international \npartnership has provided opportunities for cultural and business \nexchanges, as well as providing Swedish and American citizens unique \nexperiences to broaden cultural perspectives.\n  The Sister-City Program was inaugurated by United States President \nDwight David Eisenhower in 1956. This business and cultural exchange \nwas chartered to foster greater friendship and understanding between \nthe people of the United States and other countries through the medium \nof direct personal contact. Since its inception, over 1,200 American \nstate and local governments have joined with 2,100 foreign partners to \ncreate a network of international friendship.\n  The citizens of Solleftea and Madison have expressed their \nwillingness and desire, through their respective councils, to become \nsister-cities and to adhere to the ideals set forth by President \nEisenhower. These two cities also wish to encourage cultural exchanges \nthat will lead to a lasting friendship between the communities.\n  The sister-cities agreement was signed by Solleftea and Madison on \nJune 27, 1997 in Sweden. Since this time, three Swedish companies have \nopened or plan to open businesses in the City of Madison. Hagloff, \nInc., Minitube and Logosol are three Swedish companies that should be \ncommended for their efforts to further the spirit of the June 1997 \ncompact.\n  The Solleftea and Madison friendship has served as a model for future \nsister-city partnerships. I commend the efforts of these two great \ncities and wish them continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3915-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3915-S3916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am concerned about Amtrak's future. Though \nCongress has worked to ensure its continued existence, the \nAdministration has yet to fulfill its statutory responsibilities which \nare necessary if Amtrak is to have any hope of turning into a viable \noperation.\n  As my colleagues well know, the Senate has invested countless hours \nduring the past several Congresses to enact legislation that would \nenable Amtrak to reinvent itself, both operationally and financially. \nAfter three long years, Congress achieved a bipartisan reform package \nthat was signed into law by the President on December 2, 1997.\n  This package, the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, was touted as \nAmtrak's ``last chance.'' It provided significant changes, allowing \nAmtrak to operate more like a business. Congress expected Amtrak to \nimmediately begin implementing the many reform provisions. Certain \nresponsibilities concerning Amtrak's future were assumed by Amtrak's \nunion and management employees, the American taxpayers, Congress and \nthe Administration.\n  For their part, Amtrak's employees agreed to negotiate employee \nbenefits just like other segments of industry in exchange for financial \nsecurity. The taxpayers contributed considerably--$2 billion for \ncapital improvements in addition to the $22 billion already given to \nAmtrak to date.\n  Congress fulfilled its part of the deal, too. The Congress appointed \nits members to the newly created Amtrak Reform Board. Further, the \nSenate recently adopted a provision in the budget resolution urging \nfull funding for Amtrak to enable it to reach its goal of zero \noperating assistance by 2003.\n  Who is missing from this effort? Mr. President, I content it is the \nAdministration.\n  In the past months, the Administration has missed numerous deadlines \nand issued contrary proposals.\n  First, the law requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) \nInspector General to begin an independent audit of Amtrak's financial \nsituation. The audit was supposed to begin within a month of enactment, \nwhich would have been this past January. The DOT Inspector General has \nworked to abide by the statute, but the Secretary of DOT has refused to \nallow the audit to go forward. DOT's refusal prompted both the House \nand Senate Appropriations Committee to provide specific funding to \ncover the audit's expense. DOT knows that funding is on its way, yet \nthe Secretary has refused to permit the IG to begin the process.\n  Second, the law required the President to nominate a new 7-member \nReform Board to replace Amtrak's current Board of Directors. Since the \nreform package required Amtrak to operate like a business. Congress and \nthe Administration agreed that new leadership was imperative. After \nall, instilling a `new culture' among Amtrak employees and management \nnecessitated that changes start from the top.\n  The law requires the Reform Board to be in place by March 31, 1998--\nalmost 1 month ago--yet we still have not received a single nomination \nfrom the President. Most troublesome is the fact that if the new Reform \nBoard has not assumed the responsibilities of the Amtrak Board of \nDirectors before July 1st, Amtraks' authorization lapses. I do not \nthink the Administration would want this to happen.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the Administration's recent \nshortcomings, it has also failed to announce the names of individuals \nwho will fill the Administration's three slots on the Amtrak Reform \nCouncil. Because the Council is expected to play a critical role in \nformulating passenger rail in the years ahead, I have encouraged the 8 \nmembers appointed by the Congress to begin their work. I understand the \nfirst meeting of the Council should occur in early May.\n  The only action taken by the Administration thus far has been to \npropose a budget that underfunds Amtrak in fiscal year 1999. The \nAdministration's budget submission seeks to take money away from \ncapital expenditures and to use it to pay for Amtrak salaries and \noperating expenses. This diversion proposal is in direct violation of \nthe statutory language in the law which established the capital funding \nsubsidy.\n  Ms. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I share the Majority Leader's concerns \nabout Amtrak. As the primary author of the Amtrak reform law, I am very \nconcerned that Amtrak has yet to have the opportunity to avail itself \nof the statutory reforms we all worked so hard to provide. The Amtrak \nReform Council positions are an essential element in the overall reform \nscheme.\n  Amtrak needs to make long-term plans and commitments. That action has \nnot yet begun. I hope the Administration will take prompt action to \nfulfill its responsibilities and give Amtrak the opportunity to achieve \nwhat we all hope is possible--a fiscally sound and efficient national \nrail passenger system.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My colleagues know all too well my frustrations with \nAmtrak. However, I worked in good faith with my colleagues and the \nAdministration to move the Amtrak reform legislation through the \nlegislative process. Therefore, I expected similar ``good faith'' to be \napplied in fulfilling the statutory provisions under the Act.\n  I find it unconscionable the Administration continues to obstruct the \nindependent assessment. This is one of the most critical elements in \nthe entire reform package. How can anyone determine if Amtrak is \nmeeting its financial obligations if we don't have a baseline to start? \nWhat is it about Amtrak's finances the Administration is trying to keep \ncovered up?\n  Equally troubling to me is the Administration's lack of regard for \nupholding the statute. A new Reform Board was to be in place nearly a \nmonth ago. These positions require Senate confirmation which \nnecessitates hearings and review by the Commerce Committee. I have \nevery intention to uphold our Committee's responsibilities. Yet, we \nhave not received even ONE nomination from the President.\n  Worse still, the rumors we hear is that the Administration is \nconsidering reappointing current Board members. I have been very clear, \nthat the Commerce Committee will not report favorably any Board hold-\novers and I stand firm on that position. I would think even the \nAdministration would acknowledge we didn't create a new Board only to \nreappoint the same members.\n  Why isn't the Administration interested in fixing Amtrak's problems \nwhile it is under their watch? I never cease to be amazed.\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Congress worked long and hard in a bipartisan \nfashion to give Amtrak one more opportunity to do what they keep \ntelling us they can do given the chance. The President let Amtrak, \nCongress, and the taxpayers think Amtrak was being given that chance. \nSadly, the Administrations subsequent lack of interest is quickly \ntaking that chance away.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3915-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATOR BYRD RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL AWARD'S LEADERSHIP AWARD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last night, Senator Robert C. Byrd was \nawarded the Congressional Award Program's highest honor, the Leadership \nAward. This award is given to someone who has exhibited extraordinary \nleadership in support of programs which benefit our Nation's youth and \nthe Congressional Award Program. We all know Senator Byrd as a skilled \nlegislator, master of the Senate's rules and procedures, award-winning \nhistorian of the United States Senate, a man of great honor and \npersonal integrity, a fine example of true leadership, a colleague, and \na friend. We may not be fully aware of his tireless efforts on behalf \nof the children of this country. The Leadership Award is presented each \nyear to individuals who have displayed outstanding commitment to \nimproving the lives of young Americans and who have provided critical \nsupport to the Congressional Award program in its efforts to make the \nAward a national opportunity for all of our young people.\n  Senator Byrd knows only too well the hardships many of our children \nface: plagued by poverty, challenged by a culture which all too often \nfails to glorify the values essential to a civil society, facing \nviolence not present when we grew up, a world without the kinds of \nheroes that inspired Senator Byrd to personal achievement and a life of \nservice to others. As he so clearly articulated last night at the \nCongressional Award's annual dinner and program, heroes fuel in us a \ndesire for personal development. And Senator Byrd found out that he is \na hero to many.\n  Grant Hill, NBA basketball star, talked of the great honor of \ncompeting against Michael Jordan, and the equally great honor of \nmeeting Senator Byrd, ``the Michael Jordan of the Senate.'' Mr. Hill \nwas awarded the Horizon Award, which gives special recognition to \nindividuals from the private sector who have contributed to expanding \nopportunities for young Americans through personal contributions to \nyouth programs, and who have set exceptional examples for young people \nthrough their success in life.\n  Congress grants only two medals: The Congressional Medal of Honor and \nthe Congressional Award. The Congressional Award was established by \nCongress through P.L. 96-114. Senator Byrd was a member of the first \nCongressional Award Joint Leadership Commission and helped set the \nstandards for this bipartisan program which is available to young \npeople aged 14-23. To earn an award, participants must set and achieve \nindividually challenging goals in volunteer community service, personal \ndevelopment, physical fitness and expeditions.\n  Please join me in extending our congratulations to Senator Byrd for \nbeing the 1998 recipient of the Congressional Award's Leadership Award, \nand for receiving yet again another first: being named the ``Michael \nJordan of the Senate.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3916-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO SPEARFISH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN \n              THE 1998 ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .'' COMPETITION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to commend an outstanding group of \nstudents from South Dakota who have participated in the We the People . \n. . The Citizen and The Constitution program across our state this \nyear. The We the People . . . program is an annual nationwide \ncompetition sponsored by the Center for Civic Education.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The We the People . . . program has provided curricular \nmaterials at upper elementary, middle and high school levels for more \nthan 75,000 teachers and 24 million students nationwide. This program \nis designed to help students achieve a reasoned commitment to the \nfundamental values and principles that bind Americans together as a \npeople. The program also fosters civic dispositions on traits of public \nand private character conducive to effective and responsible \nparticipation in politics and government.\n  Students from Marion High School, Harding County High School, Hot \nSprings High School, Rutland High School, and Spearfish High School \nshowed a tremendous amount of talent and exhibited a great deal of \ndiligent study in a state competition last month in Pierre, South \nDakota. Students participated in simulated congressional hearings as \nthe culminating state activity for the We the People . . . program. \nEach class, working in cooperative teams, prepared and presented \nstatements before a panel of subject experts who acted as congressional \ncommittee members and posed challenging questions about the \nConstitution, the Bill of Rights, and our democratic system. The format \nprovided students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of \nconstitutional principles and their understanding of civic \nresponsibility.\n  These teams had the support and guidance of their teacher and local \nadvisors, which is essential in such a challenging competition. Curt \nSage and Principal Mark Rockafellow from Marion High School, Paul \nRystrom and Principal Allen Dvorak from Rutland High School, Marty Wood \nand Principal Gary Peters from Hot Springs High School, and John \nPfitzer and Principal Charles Maxon from Harding County High School are \nto be commended for their involvement and for providing an educational \nenvironment in their schools that encourages teachers and students \nalike to participate in this type of program.\n  The Spearfish High School team won the state competition and will be \nvisiting Washington next week to compete in the national competition. \nThe Spearfish team is well prepared for what will be an exciting and \ncompetitive final round here in Washington on May 2-4. The members of \nthe Spearfish team representing South Dakota in the national finals \nare: Melissa Bauman, Tricia Beringer, Toni Bickford, Andy Binder, Pam \nBlair, Chelsea Collins, Christian Colaiacoro, Nicole Dana, Jason \nDelahoyde, Jacob Dell, Justin Huck, Lucas Humbracht, Sara Jensen, \nBrandy Lensegrav, Wade McDonald, Justin Nicholas, Eric Nies, Kirby \nSand, Jason Schoental, Becky Stokes, Amy Sylvester, Mikayla Tetrault, \nJonathon Watson, and James Williams. I am very proud of their \naccomplishments and wish them well in the national competition.\n  I would also like to recognize their teachers, Patrick Gainey and Tom \nFreece, for their tireless efforts over many months in working with \nthese talented students. The district coordinator, Lennis Larson, also \ncontributed a significant amount of time and effort in working with all \nSouth Dakota schools who participate in the program.\n  I commend all the South Dakotans Constitutional scholars who have \nparticipated and worked so hard.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating \nthe people of Israel on the 50th anniversary of their independence.\n  Fifty years ago, Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, \ndeclared the establishment of the State of Israel, ending a centuries-\nold struggle by the Jewish people to return to their rightful ancestral \nhomeland. The modern dream of a Jewish state had been reborn over 50 \nyears earlier, when Theodore Herzl shared his vision of such a nation \nduring the First World Zionist Conference in Switzerland. Our \npredecessors in the U.S. Congress supported this vision when they \npassed a resolution in 1922, calling for the founding of a Jewish \nnation.\n  Tragically, the Jewish people were unable to achieve that great goal \nduring the early years of the modern Zionist movement. They were forced \nto endure the most brutal and systematic repression of a people that \nhumanity has ever witnessed. The six million Jewish men, women, and \nchildren who lost their lives during the Holocaust had committed no \ncrime. They were killed, not because of anything they had done, but \nbecause of who they were, as part of an inhuman, racist policy that \nrobbed its victims of both life and dignity. The extraordinary courage \nwith which the Jewish people bore this tragedy is a timeless tribute to \ntheir enduring faith, and we owe the victims and the survivors a \ncommitment that such persecution and prejudice will never occur again.\n  From its beginning 50 years ago, the nation of Israel has had a very \nclose and special relationship with the United States. In a perennially \nturbulent and unpredictable region of the world, Israel has always been \na bulwark of stability. It is our closest ally not only in the Middle \nEast, but also in the United Nations. And during times of crisis and \nconflict in the region, this bond has only been strengthened.\n  It was no coincidence that America was chosen as the site for the \nhistoric Declaration of Principles agreement between the Israeli and \nthe Palestinian people in 1993, since we have always worked with great \ndedication and commitment to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle \nEast. The Israeli people know that we will continue to work with them \nand support them during this long and difficult peace process.\n  No other ethnic or religious group in human history had endured so \nmuch pain and prejudice and overcome so many enormous difficulties in \nestablishing a nation of their own. No other new nation faced so great \na threat to its immediate survival as did Israel during its first year \nof existence. They have created a thriving democracy in a region known \nfor its dictatorships. They have generously opened their land to Jews \nfrom all over the world. As we celebrate this inspiring Golden \nAnniversary of the birth of Israel, we also honor and commend the \nIsraeli people for their courage and commitment in achieving their \ndream of a homeland and in building the strong and vital democracy and \nfriend that Israel is today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3917-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT CONCERNING THE AUSTRALIA GROUP AND THE CONVENTION ON THE \n  PROHIBITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, STOCKPILING AND USE OF \nCHEMICAL WEAPONS AND ON THEIR DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 118\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the resolution of advice and consent to \nratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their \nDestruction, adopted by the Senate of the United States on April 24, \n1997, I hereby certify in connection with Condition (7)(C)(i), \nEffectiveness of Australia Group, that:\n  --Australia Group members continue to maintain an equally effective \n    or more comprehensive control over the export of toxic chemicals \n    and their precursors, dual-use processing equipment, human, animal \n    and plant pathogens and toxins with potential biological weapons \n    application, and dual-use biological equipment, as that afforded by \n    the Australia Group as of April 25, 1997; and\n  --The Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for limiting the \n    spread of chemical and biological weapons-related materials and \n    technology, and that the effectiveness of the Australia Group has \n    not been undermined by changes in membership, lack of compliance \n    with common export controls and nonproliferation measures, or the \n    weakening of common controls and nonproliferation measures, in \n    force as of April 25, 1997.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to carry out joint reviews relating to \ninterdepartmental cooperation in the delivery of medical care by the \ndepartments; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                    military health care legislation\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am particularly honored to serve as the\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nranking Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel \nSubcommittee, a charge I have embraced to its fullest. In the first \nsession of the 105th Congress, I pledged my commitment to improving \nmilitary health care. Today, I am here to discuss proposals to offer \nboth immediate assistance and a time phased legislative strategy to \nfulfill this commitment.\n\n  The Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) included \na Sense of the Congress Resolution which provided a finding that ``many \nretired military personnel believe that they were promised lifetime \nhealth care in exchange for 20 or more years of service,'' and \nexpresses the sense of Congress that ``the United States has incurred a \nmoral obligation'' to provide health care to members and retired \nmembers of the Armed Services and that Congress and the President \nshould take steps to address ``the problems associated with the \navailability of health care for such retirees within two years.'' I \nauthored that resolution, and today in year one of my two-year \nchallenge, I stand ready to take the first of many necessary steps to \nfulfill this obligation.\n  I call this obligation ``K-P Duty''--K-P as in KEEPING PROMISES. As a \ndisabled veteran and retiree, as former head of the Veterans \nAdministration, and as the Ranking Member on the Personnel \nSubcommittee, I am seeking to draft Congress and the entire nation and \nput us all on K-P Duty.\n  Back when I was in the Army, some saw K-P or ``kitchen police'' as \npunishment. If a soldier was derelict in his duties, or if he broke the \nrules, he went on KP, where he served his fellow soldiers by working in \nthe messhall.\n  The K-P Duty I'm talking about is not about punishment, however. Yes, \nwe as a nation have been derelict in our duties to our military \npersonnel, active duty and retired. Yes, we have broken our promises. \nBut the K-P Duty I'm talking about is a sacred honor. It is about a \ngrateful nation paying respect to those soldiers who made tremendous \nsacrifices for our Country. The soldiers who won World War II, who won \nthe Cold War--the soldiers that have made it possible for the United \nStates to be the world's only super power. It is our time, indeed it is \npast time, to serve these soldiers and fulfill our obligation.\n  As with any draft in an army, the first order of business is \nbootcamp. As long as I have taken the liberty of drafting the entire \nCongress, I might as well serve as drill instructor. Let me take this \ntime to ``drill'' the Senate on the basics of this challenge.\n  Not only do we have to fulfill our promise, we also have to \nreconsider the way in which the military and veterans health care \nsystems work. It is the change in the demographics of military health \ncare beneficiaries that necessitates a change in the way that we \nadminister health care.\n  When I went on active duty, the military was made up of mostly single \nmale soldiers. Looking at the all-volunteer, totally-recruited force \ntoday, the picture is much different. Now, 57 percent of all enlisted \nmembers and 73 percent of all officers are married. Not surprisingly, \nthe number of young dependents has also risen. In terms of recruitment, \nquality health care is cited as a major incentive for young men and \nwomen who join the military. It is that same health care for soldiers \nand their families that helps retain these soldiers in the military. \nRecently, I heard the adage, ``the military recruits a soldier, but \nretains a family.''\n  Since the time I was a U.S. Army Captain 30 years ago, the number of \nactive duty personnel has undergone a 58 percent reduction. \nConcurrently, the number of retirees has more than doubled. The \nGovernment Accounting Office reports that approximately 48 percent of \nthe beneficiaries of the Department of Defense Military Health System \nare active duty members and dependents. The remaining 52 % are retirees \nand dependents. 71% of military retirees are under the age of 65, while \n29% of military retirees are over the age of 65.\n  As we consider options for improving the DoD and VA health care \nsystems, we need to be mindful of some basic facts. About 60% of \nretirees under the age 65 live near a military treatment facility but \nonly about 52% the retirees aged 65 and older live near such a \nfacility. About two thirds of retirees under age 65 used the military \nhealth system. In comparison, only about a quarter of the retirees aged \n65 and older used military medical facilities on a space available \nbasis primarily for pharmacy services.\n  According to a 1994-95 survey of DoD beneficiaries, over 40 percent \nof military retirees, regardless of age, had private health insurance \ncoverage. About a third of retirees aged 65 and older also reported \nhaving additional insurance to supplement their Medicare benefits. \nApproximately 14% of retirees under age 65 had insurance to supplement \ntheir CHAMPUS coverage.\n  In this same dynamic environment of the past 30 years, the medical \nportion of the DoD budget has increased dramatically from approximately \ntwo percent to six percent. In part, this can be attributed to cost \ngrowth from technology and intensity of treatment in the private and \npublic sectors. It is interesting to note the converse relationship \nbetween the increase in health care dollars as the number of active \nduty personnel decreases and the number of retirees increases.\n  The Military Health System (MHS) and the Veterans Health \nAdministration are well established institutions that collectively \nmanage over 1500 hospitals, clinics, and health care facilities world-\nwide, providing services to over 11 million beneficiaries. Overseeing \nthese systems requires a well-planned and executed effort.\n  The Veterans Health Administration is a system in transition. In the \npast two years, the VA has replaced its structure of four regions, 33 \nnetworks, and hundreds of clinics with a new system geared to \ndecentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. \nThe purpose of the reorganization was to improve the access, quality \nand efficiency of care provided to the Nation's veterans. The hallmark \nof the network structure is that the field has been given control over \nfunctions which were previously located in Washington. The majority of \nquality-related activities were transferred closer to the site of \npatient care.\n  The Military Health System has also changed. During the Cold War, \nthat system was designed to support full-scale, extremely violent war \nwith the Soviet Union and its allies in Europe. The collapse of the \nSoviet Union and the end of the Warsaw Pact led to a major reassessment \nof the U.S. defense policy. The overall size of the active duty force \nhas been reduced by one-third since the mid-1980s.\n  The DoD health care system changes have included the establishment of \na managed care program, numerous facility closures, and significant \ndownsizing of military medical staff. In the last decade, the number of \nmilitary medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the number of \nmilitary hospitals has been reduced by one-third. The National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 directed DoD to prescribe and \nimplement a nationwide managed health care benefit program modeled on \nhealth maintenance organization plans and in 1995, beneficiaries began \nenrolling in this new program called TRICARE. With over 8 million \nbeneficiaries, it is the largest health maintenance organization plan \nin the Nation.\n\n  One of the problems with TRICARE is what happens to retirees when \nthey reach the age of 65. They are ineligible to participate in \nTRICARE. The law currently provides for transition from military health \ncare to Medicare for these beneficiaries. This is not the right \nsolution, especially given the fact that Medicare does not currently \nreimburse the DoD for health care services, although Congress recently \nauthorized a test of this concept. In addition, as the military begins \nto close and downsize military treatment facilities, retirees over 65 \nare unable to seek and obtain treatment on a space available basis. The \nretirees over 65 are, in effect, being shut out of the medical \nfacilities promised to them.\n  The changing health care environment has created its own set of \nunique challenges. To assess these varied and special requirements, I \nformed a Military Health Care Reform Working Group of senior officials \nin government and the private sector to explore innovative solutions to \nimprove the military and veterans health care systems. During the past \nfew months this group analyzed the array of military and veterans \nhealth care issues and recently provided a comprehensive report of\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\ntheir findings and recommendations to me.\n  In March, I hosted a military health care roundtable at Fort Gordon, \nGeorgia. The positive and supportive working relationship between the \nEisenhower Army Medical Center and the Veterans Administration Medical \nCenter in Augusta, Georgia was highlighted by the panel speakers and \naudience members. These facilities have established a sharing agreement \nwhich allows each to provide certain health care services to the \nbeneficiaries of the other. This type of joint approach has the \npotential to alleviate a significant portion of the accessibility \nproblem faced by military retirees, especially given the reduction in \nDoD medical treatment facilities. In spite of these benchmarked efforts \nin cooperative care, beneficiaries who were in the audience still \nattested to insufficient accessibility to resources to meet their \nneeds.\n  Public Law 97-174, ``The Veterans Administration and Department of \nDefense Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act,'' was \nenacted in 1982 specifically to promote cost-effective use of federal \nhealth care resources by minimizing duplication and underuse of health \ncare resources while benefitting both VA and DoD beneficiaries. Under \nthis law, VA and DoD pursue programs of cooperation ranging from shared \nservices to joint venture operations of medical facilities. Sharing \nagreements are developed on a local basis, whereas, joint ventures are \ndeveloped at the highest levels within an organization or command.\n  In 1984, there were a combined total of 102 VA and DoD facilities \nwith sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. In five \nyears, between FY 1992 and FY 1997, shared services increased from \nslightly over 3,000 to more than 6,000 services ranging from major \nmedical and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory services \nto unusual speciality care services. VA and DoD currently have four \njoint ventures in operation in New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, and \nfour more in planning for Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, California.\n  In my opening remarks, I suggested that there are things that we can \ndo immediately and others that can be accomplished through a near term \ntime phased legislative strategy to fulfill our moral obligation to \nactive duty and retired service personnel. Let me first discuss some of \nthe options.\n  There has been an overwhelming outpouring of support for offering \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to military retirees. \nAlthough this program has achieved a successful reputation among \nfederal employees, it is a costly alternative which necessitates close \nscrutiny, along with other health care options. I appreciate the fact \nthat there are many advantages to FEHBP. Furthermore, I share the view \nthat health care for military retirees should be at least as good as \nthe health care we in the Congress afford ourselves. I am committed to \nworking closely on the FEHBP option.\n  The Medicare Subvention demonstration project that is scheduled to \nbegin enrollment in the near future involves TRICARE Prime. \nUnfortunately, it will only benefit retirees who live near military \ntreatment facilities--which is only about half of all retirees. Those \nretirees living outside catchment areas won't benefit from subvention. \nAdditionally, there are ongoing efforts to initiate a Veterans Affairs \nSubvention test. The limiting criteria of these tests is that they \nrequire beneficiaries to live near the respective treatment facilities. \nTo accommodate those beneficiaries that do not live near treatment \nfacilities or within the catchment area, we must explore other \nalternatives, including, as I mentioned, the FEHBP option.\n  Today, I am announcing two initiatives. The first is a bill to \nrequire the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to significantly enhance their cooperative efforts in the \ndelivery of health care to their respective beneficiaries. Several \nmeasures to enhance military health care efficiencies are already being \nexplored, and the initiative I am proposing would complement these \nefforts without any direct impact on current spending. Let me just \nhighlight some of the elements of my plan.\n  The first element directs DoD and the VA to conduct a comprehensive \nsurvey to determine the demographics of their beneficiaries, their \ngeographic distribution, and their preferences for health care. A \nsecond survey would review the range of existing DoD and VA facilities \nand resources and the capacity available for cooperative efforts. The \npurpose of these reviews is simple. We need to accurately determine who \nwe are serving, what they want, and what resources we currently have to \nprovide to them.\n  The second element directs DoD and the VA to provide to the Congress \na report on any and all impediments which preclude optimal cooperation \nand/or integration between DoD and VA in the area of health care \ndelivery. We need to know what statutory restrictions, regulatory \nconstraints, and cultural issues stand in the way of full and complete \ncooperation between the two departments. They would be directed to \nrecommend to the Congress what changes should be made in the law. \nFurthermore, they would be directed to eliminate any regulatory and \ncultural impediments.\n  The third element addresses several projects that have been \nundertaken by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs that can \nbe accelerated for near term implementation. The Electronic Transfer of \nPatient Information, a collaborative effort by DoD and VA which would \nprovide for immediate transfer of and access to patient records at the \ntime of treatment is a project which merits Congressional support. The \nDoD and VA have also established the DoD/VA Federal Pharmaceutical \nSteering Committee. I believe this committee should perform a \ncomprehensive examination of existing pharmaceutical benefits and \nprograms, including current management and utilization of mail order \npharmaceuticals. Finally, the initiative directs DoD to review the \nextent of VA participation in TRICARE networks and to take steps to \nensure optimal participation by the VA.\n  The second initiative I am announcing today is legislation which is \nbeing crafted to respond to the tremendous outcry to provide health \ncare for military retirees over 65. Mr. President, as you know, S. \n1334, a bill to provide for a test of the FEHBP plan has 60 cosponsors. \nIt is my plan to work with my friend and colleague Senator Kempthorne \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee to include in the National \nDefense Authorization bill a proposal that addresses this matter this \nyear.\n  I recognize that there is a perception that our military benefits are \neroding but I am here today to say that we can change this perception \nif we all do our share on K-P Duty. Greater cooperation among the DoD \nand VA will yield greater choices for the beneficiaries of these \nsystems. Developing a viable health care alternative for our retirees \nover 65, a group that has been largely disenfranchised, will ensure \nthat now all beneficiaries have access to the health care to which they \nare entitled because of their service to this Nation.\n  We made a promise, now let's keep it. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2009\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The military health care system of the Department of \n     Defense and the Veterans Health Administration of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs are national institutions that \n     collectively manage more than 1,500 hospitals, clinics, and \n     health care facilities worldwide to provide services to more \n     than 11,000,000 beneficiaries.\n       (2) In the post-Cold War era, these institutions are in a \n     profound transition that involves challenging opportunities.\n       (3) During the period from 1988 to 1998, the number of \n     military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the \n     number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third.\n       (4) During the two years since 1996, the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs has revitalized its structure by \n     decentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service \n     Networks.\n       (5) In the face of increasing costs of medical care, \n     increased demands for health care services, and increasing \n     budgetary constraints, the Department of Defense and the\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\n     Department of Veterans Affairs have embarked on a variety of \n     dynamic and innovative cooperative programs ranging from \n     shared services to joint venture operations of medical \n     facilities.\n       (6) In 1984, there was a combined total of 102 Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense facilities with \n     sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. \n     During the six years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal \n     year 1997, shared services increased from slightly over 3,000 \n     services to more than 6,000 services ranging from major \n     medical and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory \n     services to unusual speciality care services.\n       (7) The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs are conducting four health care joint \n     ventures in New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, and are \n     planning to conduct four more such ventures in Alaska, \n     Florida, Hawaii, and California.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs are to be commended for the cooperation \n     between the two departments in the delivery of medical care, \n     of which the cooperation involved in the establishment and \n     operation of the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Executive Council is a praiseworthy example;\n       (2) the two departments are encouraged to continue to \n     explore new opportunities to enhance the availability and \n     delivery of medical care to beneficiaries by further \n     enhancing the cooperative efforts of the departments; and\n       (3) enhanced cooperation is encouraged for--\n       (A) the general areas of access to quality medical care, \n     identification and elimination of impediments to enhanced \n     cooperation, and joint research and program development; and\n       (B) the specific areas in which there is significant \n     potential to achieve progress in cooperation in a short term, \n     including computerization of patient records systems, \n     participation of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the \n     TRICARE program, pharmaceutical programs, and joint physical \n     examinations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for business development and trade \npromotion for Native Americans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\nthe native american business development, trade promotion, and tourism \n                              act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \nmeasure to help Indians and tribal businesses foster entrepreneurship \nand vigorous reservation economies. Indian tribes face many challenges, \nbut the greatest priority is in building stronger economies and \nproviding jobs to tribal members. With this bill, I intend to unshackle \nIndian entrepreneurship to provide jobs and revenues for reservation \neconomies.\n  When the Europeans landed in the New World to explore and build \nsettlements, they were greeted by Native\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\npeople with a long tradition of inter-tribal and regional trade. The \ntribes traded pelts and furs, hand-woven baskets, blankets, virtually \nlimitless arts and crafts, weapons, and a variety of Native grown and \ngathered foods.\n  Unrestrained by bureaucrats and free to roam their own lands, the \ntribes enjoyed a standard of material well-being that, while not ideal, \nwas a far cry from the Third World conditions most Indian people live \nin today.\n  Over the course of 200 years this tradition has been replaced by \nrules and regulations that continue to stifle Indian entrepreneurship \nand instead promise cradle-to-grave ``security'' based on federal \ntransfer payments. The practical results of federal domination is \npredictable: lifeless reservation economies and the absence of a \nprivate sector to create wealth and sustain employment for Indian \npeople.\n  The current statistical profile of Indian people is poor and shows \nlittle sign of improvement. Despite the popular belief that gaming has \nmade millionaires of all Indians, the reality is otherwise as most \nIndian gaming revenues are more like church bingo than like Las Vegas \nor Atlantic City.\n  In the Great Depression, the national unemployment rate was 20 \npercent and it was called a ``national crisis.'' Indian country has an \nunemployment rate running at 50 percent, and there are no comments, no \nsense of urgency and little attention being paid.\n  There are other reasons job opportunities are needed. In 1996, the \nCongress enacted a welfare reform law that provides transition \nassistance to welfare recipients and rightly requires able-bodied \nAmericans to get and keep jobs. In rural areas, particularly on Indian \nreservations, the welfare reform will hit hard because employment \nopportunities are scarce.\n  The goal of this and future efforts is to increase value-added \nactivities on reservations in such fields as manufacturing, energy, \nagriculture, livestock and fisheries, high technology, arts and crafts, \nand a host of service industries.\n  The United States has the responsibility to preserve, protect and \nmaximize tribal assets and resources, and an obligation to improve the \nstandards of living of Indian people. In this legislation, that \nresponsibility is primarily in removing the barriers to success the \nfederal government itself has created over the years.\n  The bill aims to make best use of and streamline existing programs to \nprovide the necessary tools to enable tribes to attract outside capital \nand technical expertise. This model has proven highly successful in the \nself governance arena and in the Indian job training program, known as \nthe ``477'' program. The bill would provide better coordination of \nexisting business development programs in the Commerce Department and \nmaximize the resources made available to tribes.\n  The tribes have a responsibility as well. As a matter of Indian self \ndetermination, the tribes are increasingly administering federal \nservices, programs, and activities in lieu of the federal government. \nThis has led to more capable and accountable tribal governments. A \nfundamental precept of self-government is a reduction in the dependence \non the federal bureaucracy and federal funds and by assuming a greater \nrole in funding their own self government.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs recently held a hearing on economic \ndevelopment and one of the findings was that the tribes need to provide \ngovernance infrastructure and friendly business environments if they \nwant to attract and retain investment. Whether by adopting commercial \ncodes, or tribal courts that can address business issues, or \nregulations that do not repel the private sector, tribal efforts are \ncritical if this effort is to succeed.\n  Under the bill, the Native American Business Development Office in \nthe Commerce Department will coordinate existing programs, including \nthose for international business and tourism, aimed at development on \nIndian lands. This bill does not create any new programs but rather is \nintended to achieve more efficiency in those that already exist within \nexisting budget authority. The bill also prohibits assistance under the \nact from being used for gaming on Indian lands.\n  In addition, the bill directs the Secretary to create a task force on \nregulatory reform and business development to analyze existing laws and \nregulations that are restraining business and economic development on \nIndian lands. Again, the bill is not intended to create a new entity, \nbut recognizes that there is great need to strip away the layers of \nunnecessary rules and regulations that stifle Indian businesses.\n  I urge those that are critical of Indian gaming to join me in \nproviding alternatives to build strong and diversified tribal economies \nfor the benefit of tribes, tribal members, and surrounding communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the provisions of the \nbill and an article written by James Gwartney for the Wall Street \nJournal dated April 10, 1998, entitled ``Less Government, More Growth'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2010\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Business \n     Development, Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n     United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n     Administration, of the Indian self-determination era of the \n     Federal Government, each President has confirmed the special \n     government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes \n     and the United States;\n       (3) in 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive \n     memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies that \n     obligated all Federal departments and agencies, particularly \n     those that have an impact on economic development, to \n     evaluate the potential impacts of their actions on Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) consistent with the principles of inherent tribal \n     sovereignty and the special relationship between Indian \n     tribes and the United States, tribes retain the right to \n     enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and seek \n     enforcement of treaty and trade rights;\n       (5) Congress has carried out the responsibility of the \n     United States for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and the resources of Indian tribes through the \n     endorsement of treaties, and the enactment of other laws, \n     including laws that provide for the exercise of \n     administrative authorities;\n       (6) the United States has an obligation to guard and \n     preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster \n     strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency among Indian tribes;\n       (7) the capacity of Indian tribes to build strong tribal \n     governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the \n     inability of Indian tribes to engage communities that \n     surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic \n     activities on Indian lands;\n       (8) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives suffer higher rates of \n     unemployment, poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and \n     associated social ills than those of any other group in the \n     United States;\n       (9) the United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n     tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and \n     political conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n       (A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not \n     originate with the tribes; and\n       (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that \n     are not tribal entities;\n       (10) the economic success and material well-being of \n     American Indian and Alaska Native communities depends on the \n     combined efforts of the Federal Government, tribal \n     governments, the private sector, and individuals;\n       (11) the lack of employment and entrepreneurial \n     opportunities in the communities referred to in paragraph (8) \n     has resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal \n     assistance that is--\n       (A) insufficient to address the magnitude of needs; and\n       (B) unreliable in availability; and\n       (12) the twin goals of economic self-sufficiency and \n     political self-determination for American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives can best be served by making available to address the \n     challenges faced by those groups--\n       (A) the resources of the private market;\n       (B) adequate capital; and\n       (C) technical expertise.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To revitalize economically and physically distressed \n     Indian reservation economies by--\n       (A) encouraging the formation of new businesses by eligible \n     entities, the expansion of existing businesses; and\n       (B) facilitating the movement of goods to and from Indian \n     reservations and the provision of services by Indians.\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n       (2) To promote private investment in the economies of \n     Indian tribes and to encourage the sustainable development of \n     resources of Indian tribes and tribal and Indian-owned \n     businesses.\n       (3) To promote the long-range sustained growth of the \n     economies of Indian tribes.\n       (4) To raise incomes of Indians in order to reduce poverty \n     levels and provide the means for achieving a higher standard \n     of living on Indian reservations.\n       (5) To encourage intertribal, regional, and international \n     trade and business development in order to assist in \n     increasing productivity and the standard of living of members \n     of Indian tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency \n     of the governing bodies of Indian tribes.\n       (6) To promote economic self-sufficiency and political \n     self-determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian \n     tribes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Has wise ``government planning'' \n     improved economic performance? Quite the opposite. Robert \n     Lawson, Randall Holcombe and I recently completed a study on \n     the size and functions of government for Congress's Joint \n     Economic Committee. Here are some of our findings:\n       As the size of government has expanded in the U.S., growth \n     of real gross domestic product has steadily fallen. Even \n     though the U.S. economy is now moving into the eighth year of \n     an expansion, the growth of real GDP during the 1990s is only \n     about half what it was during the 1960s and well below even \n     that of the turbulent 1970s. Likewise, as the size of \n     government in other nations has increased, economic growth \n     has declined. On average, government expenditures in the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's 23 \n     long-standing members rose to 48% of GDP in 1996 from 27% in \n     1960. The average economic growth rate fell from 5.5% in the \n     1960s to 1.9% in the 1990s.\n       As the chart nearby shows, there has is a striking \n     relationship between the size of government and economic \n     growth. When government spending was less than 25% of GDP, \n     OECD countries achieved an average real growth rate of 6.6%. \n     As the size of government rose, growth steadily declined, \n     plunging to 1.6% when government spending exceeded 60% of \n     GDP.\n       While growth has declined in all of the OECD countries, \n     those countries with the least growth of government have \n     suffered the least. Between 1960 and 1996, the size of \n     government as a share of GDP increased by less than 15 \n     percentage points in the U.S., Britain, Iceland, Ireland \n     and New Zealand. The average growth rate for these five \n     countries was 1.6 percentage points lower in the 1990s \n     than in the 1960s. In contrast, the size of government \n     increased by 25 percentage points or more in Denmark, \n     Finland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The growth \n     rate of these six countries fell by 5.2 percentage points.\n       In the world's fastest-growing economies, furthermore, the \n     size of government is small, and there is no trend toward \n     bigger government. On average, government expenditures in \n     1995 consumed only 20% of GDP in the five economies with the \n     most rapid real economic growth rates during 1980-95: Hong \n     Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. In these \n     countries, the size of government in 1995 was virtually the \n     same as in 1975. When we looked at a diverse group of 60 \n     nations, we found that the negative relationship between \n     bigger government and economic growth is present in all types \n     of economies.\n       Many policy-makers seem oblivious to these facts. Even \n     though the evidence clearly shows that excessive government \n     expenditures are retarding economic growth, politicians \n     continue to focus on how to spend a possible surplus. What \n     the U.S. and other nations need instead is a long-range \n     strategy to reduce the size and scope of government.\n       Had the public-sector expansion of the past four decades \n     accelerated economic growth, politicians would be rushing to \n     take credit. Since the opposite has occurred, how can we fail \n     to hold them accountable?\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 2011. A bill to strengthen the Federal prosecution and seizure of \nillegal proceeds of international drug dealing and criminal activity, \nand to provide for the drug testing and treatment of incarcerated \noffenders and reduce drug trafficking in correctional facilities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nThe Money Laundering Enforcement Act and the Combating Drugs in Prisons \n                                  Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, joined by Senators Daschle, Kohl, \nFeinstein, and Cleland, I am introducing legislation which will provide \nstate and federal governments with additional tools to fight drug \ntrafficking, money laundering and drug use in prisons. This legislation \nis intended to complement the Administration's comprehensive 10-year \nNational Drug Control Strategy by providing federal prosecutors with \nadditional means to seize assets linked to illegal criminal and drug \nactivity and prevent drug kingpins and others from engaging in money \nlaundering. In addition, this legislation will allow states to use \nfederal prison grant funds to test and treat drug-addicted inmates and \nparolees.\n  I note that the Speaker of the House today is hosting a Republican \nrally to proclaim fault with the Administration's comprehensive drug \ncontrol strategy. Mr. President, the bill that we are introducing today \nis not the easy rhetoric that some have to offer in this crucial area \nof public policy. Here is a chance to actually make a difference. I do \nnot find constructive the efforts of the other body's Republican \nleadership over the past few years to slash assistance for drug \nenforcement, prevention and treatment programs. Twice, in fact, they \ntried to cut the extremely effective Safe and Drug-Free Schools funding \nby 50 percent, just as they significantly reduced support for drug \nprevention and treatment programs when they assumed leadership of the \nCongress in 1995.\n  Nor do I consider it constructive for Speaker Gingrich, as he did in \nhis February radio address, to fault the Administration while at the \nsame time claiming credit for such Administration strategies as a \nnational youth-oriented anti-drug campaign and added support for \ncommunity programs and schools. These are key components of the \nAdministration's 1998 National Drug Control Strategy, including the \nhighly effective radio and TV ads now airing in 12 pilot cities. To \nreally make a difference in more than just the headlines, we need to \nwork together to reduce the quantity of drugs coming into this country \nand the number of drug addicts both in prison and walking our streets.\n\n\n                      Money Laundering Act of 1998\n\n  This act will help prosecutors force international criminals out of \nthe darkness and into the light by greatly reducing their ability to \nhide behind foreign banking laws or other procedural tricks. It will \nalso ensure that defendants arrested overseas are no longer able to use \nthe U.S. courts to their benefit while fighting against being \nextradited to the United States.\n  Another provision in this bill which allows federal prosecutors to \ntemporarily seize U.S. assets owned by individuals arrested overseas \nwill greatly enhance law enforcement's ability to shut down drug \ntrafficking operations based outside the United States. National \nboundaries mean less and less to drug kingpins and other criminals \ntoday and this legislation will help us reform our Nation's laws to \nreflect this reality.\n  This bill would allow a brief ex parte seizure of assets while any \narrest papers are in transit to prevent individuals arrested in another \ncountry from moving the fruits of their crimes from the United States \nto another country. Currently, foreign defendants often move their \nassets virtually instantaneously via electronic transfers while our \nprosecutors are waiting for the arrest records. In addition, defendants \nwould no longer be able to hide behind foreign bank secrecy laws while \nthey claim seized property in United States courts.\n  This bill makes important procedural changes for federal prosecutors: \nit extends U.S. jurisdiction over foreign banks; updates evidentiary \nrules regarding foreign records; allows federal prosecutors to charge \ndefendants who engage in multiple illegal acts with course of conduct \nclaims; and allows prosecutors to charge criminals with conspiracy to \nviolate the laws.\n  This legislation also adds several new crimes to the list triggering \nasset forfeiture, including crimes of violence, additional foreign \ncrimes, and crimes committed by or against foreign governments. While I \nbelieve that these provisions are necessary for prosecutors to carry \nout their important work, I realize that some of these provisions may \nneed to be fine-tuned to accomplish their intended goal. I pledge to \nwork with members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that this \nlegislation is broad enough to meet these goals without being overly \nintrusive.\n  In drafting this bill, I have purposely avoided including several \ndomestic asset forfeiture provisions. While we may have to face these \nthorny issues down the road, I decided to craft a bill which I believe \ncan be supported by the majority of Senators. We can then bring up \nthese more complicated issues after a fuller discussion has taken \nplace.\n\n\n                The Combating Drug Abuse in Prisons Act\n\n  This act will allow states to use any of the funds they receive under \nthe Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing grant \nprograms to provide drug testing and treatment for inmates and other \ncourt-supervised individuals, such as probationers and parolees. With \n80 percent of inmates reportedly linked to drug and alcohol activity \nand with a requirement in place that states develop and implement a \ndrug testing and treatment plan for these individuals by September 1, \n1998, it is critical that this federal funding be made available for \nthese purposes.\n\n  According to a study recently released by the National Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) based at Columbia University, 80 \npercent of individuals currently incarcerated either ``violated drug or \nalcohol\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\nlaws, were intoxicated at the time they committed their crimes, stole \nproperty to buy drugs, or are `regular drug users'.'' This study also \nfound that inmates who are illegal drug or alcohol abusers are the most \nlikely to be repeat offenders. In fact, this study concluded that 61 \npercent of state prison inmates who have two prior convictions are \nregular drug users. Another recent study, conducted by the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, found that over half of all convicted jail inmates \nin 1996 reported having used drugs in the month prior to their offense. \nSixty percent of these inmates also reported using drugs or alcohol or \nboth at the time of the offense for which they were charged.\n  If we want to stem the increase in our Nation's prison population, we \nmust determine which inmates are addicted to drugs or alcohol, reduce \nthe availability of drugs in prisons and ensure inmates have access to \nthe treatment they need while incarcerated. This bill will help states \nmeet all these goals by allowing them to use as much as they choose--or \nas little--of the federal prison funds they receive for drug testing \nand intervention and to develop strategies to reduce drug trafficking \ninto prisons. As Joseph Califano, former Secretary of Health, Education \nand Welfare and president of CASA, noted when the CASA study was \nreleased: ``Releasing drug-addicted inmates without treatment helps \nmaintain the market for illegal drugs and supports drug dealers.''\n  I realize some of my colleagues may be concerned about funds \noriginally designated for prison construction costs being used for drug \ntesting and treatment. Let me assure you that states will retain \ncomplete flexibility under this bill as to how they allocate their \nTruth in Sentencing and Violent Offender Incarceration grant funds. \nBut, I'd also like to point out that according to the CASA study, it \nwould cost states approximately $6,500 per year to provide \ncomprehensive and effective residential drug treatment services to an \ninmate. While this figure may seem high, the study further determined \nthat society will see an economic return of $68,800 for each inmate who \nsuccessfully completes such a program and returns to the community \nsober and with a job. This figure represents the savings in the first \nyear based on the much lower likelihood that the former inmate will be \narrested, prosecuted or incarcerated and includes health care savings \nand the potential earnings of a drug-free individual.\n  James Walton, Vermont's Commissioner of Public Safety, wholeheartedly \nsupports this legislation, and I have always valued his counsel. As the \nhead of Vermont's law enforcement agency, he has first-hand knowledge \nof what the real needs are in my state. Clearly, he believes that this \nlegislation will have a positive effect on ongoing law enforcement and \ndrug control strategies in Vermont. I'm certain it will have the same \neffect across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so \nour federal and state officials have the resources they need to combat \nour Nation's drug problems--both overseas and in our nation's prisons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2011\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, drug trafficking, money laundering and \ndrug use in prisons are significant problems that will continue to \nworsen unless local, state and federal governments can work more \nclosely together to determine viable solutions. Drug trafficking and \nmoney laundering can negatively affect our society in many different \nways, and the use of illegal drugs by prison inmates dramatically \ndeceases any chance they have of getting their lives back on track \nafter their release. Local, state and federal governments are already \nhard at work to determine solutions to these corrosive problems, and I \nam very pleased to join Senators Leahy, Cleland, Feinstein, and Kohl in \nintroducing The Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in \nPrison Act of 1998, which will provide state and federal governments \nwith additional tools to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and \ndrug use in prisons.\n  This legislation will complement the Administration's comprehensive \n10-year National Drug Control Strategy by providing federal prosecutors \nwith additional means to seize assets linked to illegal criminal and \ndrug activity and prevent drug kingpins and others from engaging in \nmoney laundering. Initiatives such as the Safe and Drug Free Schools \nAct, and the Administration's highly effective radio and TV ads \ncurrently airing in 12 pilot cities are sending the kind of anti-drug \nmessages that must reach our young people. The Money Laundering \nEnforcement and Combating Drugs in Prison Act of 1998 adds to these \nefforts by reducing the demand for drugs by allowing states to use \nfederal prison grant funds to test and treat drug-addicted inmates and \nparolees.\n  This legislation will greatly enhance the efforts of prosecutors to \nforce international criminals out of hiding by reducing their ability \nto shield themselves behind foreign banking laws or use other \nprocedural tricks. Moreover, the bill will ensure that defendants \narrested overseas will no longer be able to take advantage of U.S. \ncourts to fight against extradition to this country. It would allow \nfederal prosecutors to temporarily seize U.S. assets owned by \nindividuals arrested overseas and thus dramatically improve the ability \nof law enforcement agencies to shut down drug trafficking operation \nbased outside the United States. Drug kingpins have little regard for \nnation boundaries, and our nations laws must provide us with the \nflexibility necessary to combat them.\n  Studies prove that an overwhelming majority of incarcerated \nindividuals have been heavily influenced by drugs or alcohol, and those \nwho are illegal drug or alcohol abusers are the most likely to be \nrepeat offenders. If we want to stem the increase in our nation's \nprison population, we must determine which inmates are addicted to \ndrugs or alcohol, reduce the availability of drugs in prisons and \nensure inmates have access to the treatment they need while \nincarcerated. This legislation will help states meet all these goals by \nallowing them to use as much--or as little--of the federal prison funds \nthey receive for drug testing and intervention and to develop a \nstrategy to reduce drug trafficking in prisons.\n  State and federal governments are waging a battle against drug \nkingpins, and the Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in \nPrison Act of 1998 will provide much-needed assistance to these ongoing \nefforts. By enacting this bill, I believe we will make great strides \ntoward removing dangerous criminals and illegal drugs from our \nneighborhoods. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2012. A bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs medical \ncenter in Gainesville, Florida, as the ``Malcolm Randall Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center''; to the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs.\n\n\n     malcolm randall department of veterans affairs medical center\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my esteemed \ncolleague Senator Mack, to introduce legislation to rename the \nGainesville, Florida Veterans Affairs Medical Center after its \ndistinguished and long-time Director: Malcolm Randall.\n  After thirty-two years as Director of the Gainesville VAMC, and a \ntotal of fifty-nine years in federal service, Mr. Randall retires \ntoday. He leaves behind a long list of accomplishments and an even \nlonger list of admirers--myself included.\n  Mr. President, allow me to take a few minutes to highlight the career \nof this visionary person--a man who has redefined the term ``public \nservant'' over the last half-century.\n  Malcolm Randall's accomplishments are far-reaching and are a \ntestament to the loyalty and devotion he has shown the United States \nthroughout his lifetime.\n  His extensive service to our nation began when he enlisted in the \nNavy in July of 1942 and was sent off to the South Pacific in the midst \nof World War II. While courageously fighting on PT boats and \nbattleships in the first battle of the Phillipine Sea, Mr. Randall was \ninjured in the line-of-duty. After four years of valiant active \nmilitary service, Mr. Randall continued serving his country through his \ndedicated work in the Veterans' Administration. His outstanding \naccomplishments and achievements during his tenure at the VA have been \nrecognized with the two highest awards that the VA offers: the \nMeritorious Service Award, and the Exceptional Service Award, both of \nwhich recognize his outstanding performance and exceptional \ncontributions to the improvement of health care for veterans.\n  In 1984, President Reagan paid homage to Mr. Randall with the \nPresidential Rank Award for his extraordinary accomplishments in the \nadministration of VA programs in Florida,\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\nand for exemplifying the highest standards in leadership. Most \nflattering to Mr. Randall was that this award was recommended by \ndedicated public servants and local leadership from his own community. \nIndeed, it was this innovative and thoughtful style of leadership that \nallowed Mr. Randall to foresee the challenges and obstacles that the VA \nwould face in the 21st Century.\n  Mr. Randall's dogged determination to serve the veterans of Florida, \ncoupled with his visionary leadership, led to his most significant \ncontribution to our nation's veterans: VA restructuring. As Chairman of \nthe Florida Network of VA Hospitals and Outpatient Clinics, Malcolm \nRandall realized that the VA had to undergo a major transformation to \ncontinue to serve veterans well. He understood that the VA health care \nsystem needed to modernize, become more efficient with its resources, \nand adapt to a new method for health care delivery.\n  Mr. Randall saw the future--that the VA was moving towards a ``no-\nnew-starts'' policy for major hospital construction--and he became an \nearly advocate for a new model of VA health care: a strong network of \noutpatient clinics and hospitals, designed to serve veterans in remote \nareas more effectively. As a result, 7 new outpatient clinics were \nbuilt in Florida, a development which has allowed many thousands of \nFlorida veterans to get the health care they deserve but were \npreviously denied.\n  Throughout his long and successful tenure as Director of the \nGainesville VAMA, Malcolm Randall has also been a leader in introducing \nnew medical technology to improve the quality of care for the heroes of \nour country. His responsibility for VA health planning throughout the \nentire state enabled Mr. Randall to initiate affiliations with three \nmajor teaching hospitals--the University of South Florida, the \nUniversity of Florida, and the University of Miami--and several \ncommunity colleges. These partnerships have allowed veterans to receive \nthe finest care available from institutions renowned throughout the \ncountry.\n  Mr. Randall's excellence has not been limited to his professional \nservice. His community service throughout the state of Florida, and \nespecially in his hometown of Gainesville, has resulted in several \ntributes and distinctions being bestowed upon him, including being \nnamed Gainesville's Citizen of the Year in 1977. The University of \nFlorida also recognized his lifetime devotion to public service by \nawarding him an honorary doctorate of Public Service.\n  Mr. President, it has been one of the great treasures of my life to \nhave shared the friendship of Malcom Randall. As governor and now as a \nUnited States Senator from Florida, Malcom has allowed me to enter his \nclassroom on health care policy and his heart, which is full of \ncompassion for American veterans. All he has done has emanated from his \ndepth of concern for American veterans, firmly attached to his rigorous \nmind and dedicated spirit to put ideas into action. Florida and America \nare fortunate to have had him as a fellow citizen.\n  Mr. President, I salute Malcom Randall for all that he has done on \nbehalf of all of our veterans. It is fitting that one of the best \nmedical centers in the country bear his name.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am proud to support my friend and \ncolleague from Florida, Mr. Graham, as we introduce legislation to \ncommemorate the retirement and life's work of Mr. Malcom Randall. Mr. \nRandall has served his country for 59 years, 55 of which were spent \nwith the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  A native of East St. Louis, Illinois, Mr. Randall graduated from St. \nLouis University with a master's degree in hospital administration. He \nwas among a handful of medical leaders who began to transform the \nhealth care system for veterans at the end of World War II. Mr. Randall \nis the founding Director of the VA Medical Center in Gainesville, and \nhe has served in that post for 32 years. During that time, he has also \nhelped establish VA hospitals and outpatient clinics in other Florida \ncities. The VA Medical Center in Gainesville now serves 10,000 \ninpatients and handles 250,000 outpatient visits per year.\n  Mr. Randall is America's longest serving administrator of veterans' \nhealth care services. He has won numerous awards for his exceptional \nservice, including recognition for ``most outstanding performance'' on \ntwo occasions. He is retiring today, and while I am pleased that he \nwill be able to take some time off to enjoy his years, I am saddened \nthat the Department and the Center will be losing one of its greatest \nchampions, and one of its most dedicated public servants.\n  In further recognition of Mr. Randall's dedication to serving the \nneeds of America's veterans, Bob Graham and I are proposing legislation \nto rename the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida \nas the ``Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter''. Our legislation is identical to legislation offered by \nRepresentative Karen Thurman in the House of Representatives, which is \nsupported by most of the Florida Congressional delegation. I look \nforward to working with my Senate colleagues to recognize and honor the \nwork and service of Malcom Randall, and I wish Mr. Randall well in his \nfuture pursuits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2013. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit children covered under private health insurance under a State \nchildren's health insurance plan to continue to be eligible for \nbenefits under the vaccine for children program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            children's health insurance program legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nclarify that children receiving health insurance under the new \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are eligible for free \nvaccines under the 1993 federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.\n  I want to especially commend the leadership of Congresswoman Jane \nHarman who is introducing an identical bill in the House today.\n  We are introducing these bills because the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services has apparently interpreted the law so narrowly that \nas many as 580,000 children in California will lose their current \neligibility to receive free vaccines, under California's new Healthy \nFamilies program.\n  The federal Vaccines for Children program, created by Congress in \n1993 (P.L. 105-33), provides vaccines at no cost to poor children. In \n1997, as many 775,000 poor children in my state, who were uninsured or \non Medicaid, received these vaccines. California received $60 million \nfrom the federal government to provide them.\n  Mr. President, what can be so basic to public health than \nimmunization against disease? Do we really want our children to get \npolio, measles, mumps, chicken pox, rubella, and whooping cough--\ndiseases for which we have effective vaccines, diseases which we have \npractically eradicated by widespread immunization? Every parent knows \nthat vaccines are fundamental to children's good health.\n  Congress recognized the importance of immunizations in creating the \nprogram, with many Congressional leaders at the time arguing that \nchildhood immunization is one of the most cost-effective steps we can \ntake to keep our children healthy. It makes no sense to me to withhold \nthem from children who (1) have been getting them when they were \nuninsured and (2) have no other way to get them once they become \ninsured.\n  According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation report, 28 percent of \nCalifornia's two-year old children are not immunized. Add to that the \nfact that we have one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. \nOur uninsured rate for non-elderly adults is 22 percent, the third \nhighest in the U.S., while the national uninsured rate is 17 percent. \nAs for children, 1.7 million or 18 percent of our children are without \nhealth insurance, compared to 13 percent nationally, according to \nUCLA's Center for Health Policy Research. Clearly, there is a need.\n  In creating the new children's health insurance program in \nCalifornia, the state chose to set up a program under which the state \ncontracts with private insurers, rather than providing eligible \nchildren care through Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Unfortunately, \nHHS appears to be interpreting this method of providing these children \nhealth insurance as making them ``insured,'' as\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\ndefined in the vaccines law, and thus ineligible for the federal \nvaccines. I disagree.\n  It is my view that in creating the federal vaccines program, Congress \nmade eligible for these vaccines children who are receiving Medicaid, \nchildren who are uninsured, and native American children. I believe \nthat in defining the term ``insured'' Congress clearly meant private \nhealth insurance plans. Children enrolled in California's new Healthy \nFamilies program are participating in a federal-state, subsidized \ninsurance plan. Healthy Families is a state-operated program. Families \napply to the state for participation. They are not insured by a \nprivate, commercial plan, as traditionally defined or as defined in the \nVaccine for Children's law (42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(2)(B). On February \n23, the California Medical Association wrote to HHS Secretary Donna \nShalala, ``As they are participants in a federal and state-subsidized \nhealth program, these individuals are not ``insured'' for the purposes \nof 42 U.S.C. sec. 1396s(b)(B).''\n  The California Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which is \nadministering the new program with the Department of Health Services, \nwrote to HHS on February 5, ``It is imperative that states like \nCalifornia, who have implemented the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (CHIP) using private health insurance, be given the same \nsupport and eligibility for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program at \nno cost as states which have chosen to expand their Medicaid program.'' \nThe San Francisco Chronicle editorialized on March 10, 1998, ``More \nthan half a million California children should not be deprived of \nvaccinations or health insurance because of a technicality. . . ,'' \ncalling the denial of vaccines ``a game of semantics.''\n  Children's health should not be a ``game of semantics.'' Proper \nchildhood immunizations are fundamental to a lifetime of good health. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill into law, to help \nme keep our children healthy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to reschedule \ncertain drugs that pose an imminent danger to public safety, and to \nprovide for the rescheduling of the date-rape drug and the \nclassification of certain ``club'' drug; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 THE NEW DRUGS OF THE 1990s CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the best time to target a new drug with \nuncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug has \noverwhelmed our communities.\n  That is why I introduced legislation last Congress to place tight \nfederal controls on the date rape drug Rohpynol--also known as \nRoofies--which was becoming known as the Quaalude of the Nineties as \nits popularity spread throughout the United States.\n  My bill would have shifted Rohpynol to schedule 1 of the Federal \nControlled Substances Act. Rescheduling is important for three simple \nreasons:\n  First, Federal re-scheduling triggers increases in State drug law \npenalties, and since we all know that more than 95 percent of all drug \ncases are prosecuted at the State level, not by the Federal Government, \nit is vitally important that we re-schedule.\n  Second, Federal re-scheduling to schedule 1 triggers the toughest \nFederal penalties--up to a year in prison and at least a $1,000 fine \nfor a first offense of simple possession.\n  And, third, re-scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to \nreschedule Quaaludes, Congress passed the law, and the Quaalude \nepidemic was greatly reduced. And, in 1990, I worked to re-schedule \nsteroids, Congress passed the law, and again a drug epidemic that had \nbeen on the rise was reversed.\n  Despite evidence of a growing Rohpynol epidemic, some argued that my \nefforts to re-schedule the drug by legislation were premature. \nAccordingly, I agreed to hold off on legislative action and wait for a \nDrug Enforcement Administration decision on whether to schedule the \ndrug through the lengthy and cumbersome administrative process.\n  As I predicted, the DEA report on Rohpynol--handed down in November--\ncorrectly concludes that despite the rapid spread of Rohpynol \nthroughout the country, DEA cannot re-schedule Rohpynol by rulemaking \nat this time.\n  The report notes, however, that Congress is not bound by the \nbureaucratic re-scheduling process the DEA must follow. Congress can--\nand in my view should--pass legislation to reschedule Rohpynol.\n  Specifically the report states: ``This inability to reschedule \n[Rohpynol] administratively . . . does not affect Congress' ability to \nplace [the drug] in schedule 1 through the legislative process''--as we \ndid with Quaaludes in 1984 and Anabolic Steroids in 1990.\n  Let me also note that the DEA report confirmed a number of facts \nabout the extent of the Rohpynol problem:\n  DEA found more than 4,000 documented cases--in 36 States--of sale or \npossession of the drug, which is not marketed in the United States and \nmust be smuggled in.\n  ``In spite of DEA's inability to reschedule [Rohypnol] through \nadministrative proceedings, DEA remains very concerned about the \nabuse'' of the drug.\n  ``Middle and high school students have been known to use [Rohypnol] \nas an alternative to alcohol to achieve an intoxicated state during \nschool hours. [The drug] is much more difficult to detect than alcohol, \nwhich produces a characteristic odor.''\n  ``DEA is extremely concerned about the use of [Rohypnol] in the \ncommission of sexual assaults.''\n  ``The number of sexual assaults in which [Rohypnol] is used may be \nunderreported''--because the drug's effects often cause rape victims to \nbe unable to remember details of their assaults and because rape crisis \ncenters, hospitals, and law enforcement have only recently become aware \nthat Rohypnol can be used to facilitate sex crimes.\n  Nonetheless, ``DEA is aware of at least 5 individuals who have been \nconvicted of rape in which the evidence suggests that [the Rohypnol \ndrug] was used to incapacitate the victim.'' ``The actual number of \nsexual assault cases involving [the drug] is not known. It is difficult \nto obtain evidence that [the Rohypnol drug] was used in an assault.''\n  I would also note that my efforts to re-schedule this drug have \nalready had beneficial results: The manufacturer of Rohypnol recently \nannounced that it had developed a new formula to minimize the potential \nfor abuse of the drug in sexual assaults.\n  This is an important step. But pills produced under the old Rohypnol \nformula are still in circulation, and pills made by other manufacturers \ncan still be smuggled in. Furthermore, the new formula will not prevent \nkids from continuing to ingest this dangerous drug voluntarily for a \ncheap high.\n  In short, stricter, Federal controls remain necessary; and DEA is \npowerless to respond to Rohypnol abuse until the problem gets even \nworse.\n  Therefore, I am reintroducing my bill to re-schedule Rohypnol in \nschedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort to take action against this dangerous drug now, \nrather than waiting for the problem to develop into an epidemic.\n  My bill also places ``Special K''--ketamine hydrochloride--a \ndangerous hallucinogen very similar to PCP, on schedule III of the \nControlled Substances Act. Despite Special K's rising popularity as a \n``club drug'' of choice among kids, the drug is not even illegal in \nmost States. This has crippled State\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\nauthorities' ability to fight ketamine abuse.\n  For example, in February 1997, two men accused of stealing ketamine \nfrom a Ville Platte, Louisiana veterinary clinic and cooking the drug \ninto a powder could not be prosecuted under State drug control laws \nbecause ketamine is not listed as a Federal controlled substance.\n  Similarly, a New Jersey youth recently found to be with possessing \nand distributing ketamine could be charged with only a disorderly \npersons offense.\n  Prosecutors are trying to combat increased Ketamine use by seeking \nlengthy prison terms for possession of the drugs--like marijuana--that \nusers mix with Ketamine, but if it is just Special K, there's nothing \nthey can do about it.\n  I am convinced that scheduling Ketamine will help our effort to fight \nthe spread of this dangerous drug by triggering increases in State drug \nlaw penalties.\n  Without Federal scheduling, many States will not be able to address \nthe Ketamine problem until it is too late and Special K has already \ninfiltrated their communities.\n  Medical professionals who use Ketamine--including the American \nVeterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Nurse \nAnesthetists--support scheduling, having determined that it will \naccomplish our goal of ``preventing the diversion and unauthorized use \nof Ketamine'' while allowing ``continued, responsible use'' of the drug \nfor legitimate purposes. [Letter from Mary Beth Leininger, D.V.M., \nPresident of the American Veterinary Medical Association]\n  And the largest manufacturer of Ketamine has concluded that ``moving \nthe product to schedule III classification is in the best interest of \nthe veterinary industry and the public.'' [Letter from E. Thomas \nCorcoran, President of Fort Dodge Animal Health, a Division of American \nHome Products Corporation].\n  Scheduling Ketamine will give State authorities the tools they \ndesperately need to fight its abuse by young people--and end the legal \nanomaly that leaves those who sell Ketamine to our children beyond the \nreach of the law--even when they are caught ``red-handed''. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  In addition to raising controls on Rohypnol and Ketamine, the \nlegislation I am introducing today would increase the ability of the \nAttorney General to respond to new drug emergencies in the future.\n  Our Federal drug control laws currently allow the Attorney General \nlimited authority to respond to certain new drugs on an emergency \nbasis--by temporarily subjecting them the strictest Federal control \nwhile the extensive administrative procedure for permanent scheduling \nproceeds.\n  But the Attorney General has not been able to use this authority to \nrespond to the Rohypnol and Special K emergencies--because she does not \nhave authority to--move drugs from one schedule to another, or to \nschedule drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has allowed \ncompanies to research but not to sell.\n  This amendment would grant the administration this important \nauthority by--authorizing the Attorney General to move a scheduled \ndrug--like Rohypnol--to schedule I in an Emergency; by applying \nemergency rescheduling authority to ``investigational new drugs''--like \nSpecial K--that the Food and Drug Administration has approved for \nresearch purposes only, but not for marketing.\n  And by providing that a rescheduling drug remains on the temporary \nschedule until the administrative proceedings reach a final conclusion \non whether to schedule.\n  This legislation would give the Attorney General the necessary tools \nto respond quickly when evidence appears that a drug is being abused. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2015. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide incentives for the \ndevelopment of drugs for the treatment of addiction to illegal drugs, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            THE NEW MEDICINES TO TREAT ADDICTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the New Medicines to \nTreat Addiction Act of 1998, legislation that builds upon my efforts in \nprevious Congresses to promote research into and development of new \nmedicines to treat the ravages of hard core drug addiction.\n  Since the first call to arms against illegal drugs in 1989, we have \nlearned just how insidious hardcore drug addiction is, even as the \nravages of substance abuse--on both the addict and his victims--have \nbecome ever more apparent. The frustration in dealing with a seemingly \nintractable national problem is palpable, most noticeably in the heated \nrhetoric as politicians blame each other for the failure to find a \ncure. What gets lost underneath the noise is the recognition that we \nhave not done everything we can to fight this problem and that, like \nall serious ills, we must take incremental steps one at a time, and \nrefuse to be overwhelmed by the big picture.\n  Throughout my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \ncalled for a multifaceted strategy to combat drug abuse. One of the \nspecific steps I advocated was the creation of incentives to encourage \nthe private sector to develop medicines that treat addiction, an area \nwhere promising research has not led--as one would normally expect--to \nproduction of medicines. The bill I am introducing today, the New \nMedicines To Treat Addiction Act of 1998, will hopefully change that. \nIt takes focused aim at one segment of the drug-abusing population--\nhardcore addicts, namely users of cocaine and heroin--in part because \nthese addicts are so difficult to treat with traditional methods, and \nin part because this population commits such a large percentage of \ndrug-related crime.\n  In December, 1989, I commissioned a Judiciary Committee report, \n``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990's.'' In that report, I posed \nthe question, ``If drug use is an epidemic, are we doing enough to find \na medical `cure' for this disease?'' The report gave the answer ``No.'' \nUnfortunately, almost a decade later, the answer remains the same. \nDeveloping new medicines for the treatment of addiction should be among \nour highest medical research priorities as a nation. Until we take this \nmodest step, we cannot claim to have done everything reasonable to \naddress the problem, and we should not become so frustrated that we \neffectively throw up our hands and do nothing.\n  Recent medical advances have increased the possibility of developing \nmedications to treat drug addiction. These advances include a \nheightened understanding of the physiological and psychological \ncharacteristics of drug addition and a greater base of neuroscientific \nresearch.\n  One example of this promising research is the recent development of a \ncompound that has been proven to immunize laboratory animals against \nthe effects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by \nstimulating the immune system to develop an antibody that blocks \ncocaine from entering the brain. Researchers funded through the \nNational Institute of Drug Abuse believe that this advance may open a \nwhole new avenue for combating addiction.\n  Despite this progress, we still do not have a medication to treat \ncocaine addiction or drugs to treat many other forms of substance \nabuse, because the private sector is unsure of the wisdom of making the \nnecessary investment in the production and marketing of such medicines.\n  Private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for \na variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties \ndistributing medication to the target population, and fear of being \nassociated with substance abusers. We need to create financial \nincentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop and market \nthese treatments. And we need to develop a new partnership between \nprivate industry and the public sector in order to encourage the active \nmarketing and distribution of new medicines so they are accessible to \nall addicts in need of treatment.\n  While pharmacotherapies alone are not a ``magic bullet'' that will \nsolve our national substance abuse problem, they have the potential to \nfill a gap in\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\ncurrent treatment regimens. The disease of addiction occurs for many \nreasons, including a variety of personal problems which pharmacotherapy \ncannot address. Still, by providing a treatment regimen for drug \nabusers who are not helped by traditional methods, pharmacotherapy \nholds substantial promise for reducing the crime and health crisis that \ndrug abuse is causing in the United States.\n\n  The New Medicines to Treat Addiction Act would encourage and support \nthe development of medicines to treat drug addiction in three ways.\n  It reauthorizes and increases funding for the Medications Development \nProgram at the National Institute of Health, which for years has been \nat the forefront of research into drug addiction.\n  The bill also creates two new incentives for private sector companies \nto undertake the difficult but important task of developing medicines \nto treat addiction.\n  First, the bill would provide additional patent protections for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat substance abuse. Under the bill, \npharmacotherapies could be designated ``orphan drugs'' and qualify for \nan exclusive seven-year patent to treat a specific addiction. These \nextraordinary patent rights would greatly enhance the market value of \npharmacotherapies and provide a financial reward for companies that \ninvest in the search to cure drug addiction. This provision was \ncontained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy and me in 1990, but \nwas never acted on by Congress.\n  Second, the bill would establish a substantial monetary reward for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat cocaine and heroin addiction but \nshift the responsibility for marketing and distributing such drugs to \nthe government. This approach would create a financial incentive for \ndrug companies to invest in research and development but enable them to \navoid any stigma associated with distributing medicine to substance \nabusers.\n  The bill would require the National Academy of Sciences to develop \nstrict guidelines for evaluating whether a drug effectively treats \ncocaine or heroin addiction. If a drug meets these guidelines and is \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration, then the government must \npurchase the patent rights for the drug from the company that developed \nit. The purchase price for the patent rights is established by law: \n$100 million for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for \na drug to treat heroin addiction. Once the government has purchased the \npatent rights, then it is responsible for producing the drug and \ndistributing it to clinics, hospitals, state and local governments, and \nany other entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs.\n  This joint public/private endeavor will correct the market \ninefficiencies that have thus far prevented the development of drugs to \ntreat addiction and require the government to take on the \nresponsibilities that industry is unwilling or unable to perform.\n  America's drug problem is reduced each and every time a drug abuser \nquits his or her habit. Fewer drug addicts mean fewer crimes, fewer \nhospital admissions, fewer drug-addicted babies and fewer neglected \nchildren. The benefits to our country of developing new treatment \noptions such as pharmacotherapies are manifold. Each dollar we spend on \nadvancing options in this area can save us ten or twenty times as much \nin years to come. The question isn't ``Can we afford to pursue a \npharmacotherapy strategy?'' but rather, ``Can we afford not to?''\n  Congress has long neglected to adopt measures I have proposed to \nspeed the approval of and encourage greater private sector interest in \npharmacotherapy. We cannot let another Congress conclude without \nrectifying our past negligence on this issue. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in promoting an important, and potentially ground breaking, \napproach to addressing one of our nation's most serious domestic \nchallenges.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Moynihan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2017. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide medical assistance for breast and cervical cancer-related \ntreatment services to certain women screened and found to have breast \nor cervical cancer under a Federally funded screening program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n          The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bi-partisan \nlegislation which will allow states the option of providing Medicaid \ncoverage to women who have been diagnosed with breast and cervical \ncancer through the federal government's breast and cervical cancer \nearly detection program.\n  Currently, the CDC breast and cervical cancer program provides low-\nincome, uninsured women with coverage for cancer screening, covering \nmammographies and pap smears. While this program begins to fill a \ncrucial need, this legislation allows Congress to make this program \neven better. The result has often been that uninsured women are \ndiagnosed with cancer and then left to scramble to find treatment.\n  In 1990 Congress passed a bill that was a breakthrough for the early \ndetection of breast and cervical cancer in women. The Breast and \nCervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 authorized the Center \nfor Disease control to increase screening services for women who are \nlow-income. From July of 1991 to March of 1997, CDC's program provide \nmammography screening to over 500,000 women and diagnosed nearly 3,500 \ncases of breast cancer. During this same period, the program provided \nover 700,000 Pap tests and found more than 300 cases of invasive \ncervical cancer. This is good news for the early detection of cancers \nin women.\n  But the bad news is that all women are not getting treated for \ncancer. Screening does not prevent cancer deaths; it must be coupled \nwith treatment. Congress tried to ensure that women would get \ntreatment, by requiring that state programs seek out services for the \nwomen they screen. But wherever I've traveled in New York, I've been \nhearing reports that programs are over burdened. Volunteers are working \nover time. Program administrators are having to rely on public \nhospitals and charity care. Women are having to hold bake sales to get \ntreatment. This is wrong. It's not what Congress intended when it \npassed the Cancer Prevention Act in 1990.\n  Now, a newly published study of the program documents that approaches \nfor delivering treatment services are fragmented, and in danger of \nbreaking down. I am very concerned, Mr. President, that the program is \nover burdened and needs help. The women of America need this program. \nEarly detection saves lives. However, Mr. President, if we are unable \nto treat the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, we have failed \nthem.\n  I commend the local programs that are working hard to line up \ntreatment services for women. These programs are doing whatever they \ncan to see that women with cancer get care. But the fact is that these \nsolutions are labor-intensive and have long-range consequences of the \nprogram itself. The CDC study shows that programs are having a hard \ntime recruiting new providers and must limit the number of women \nscreened. Today the program serves only 12 to 15% of all women who are \neligible nationally. And this percentage is likely to decrease. The \nstudy also shows that fewer physicians will be able to offer free or \nreduced-fee services in the future, because of changes in the health-\ncare system. My point is, and the study shows, that whatever fragile \ndelivery systems for treatment are in place now are in jeopardy and \noverburdened. Women are not getting the treatment they need.\n\n  In June 1997, Senator Moynihan and I were successful in including an \namendment in the Budget Resolution that addressed this and would have \nsolved this problem. Unfortunately, that amendment was passed by the \nSenate but later died in conference. Mr. President, we must not let \nthese women fall through the cracks any longer. This legislation \nprovides a mechanism to fix the problem that these under served women \nface.\n  Mr. President, I began the fight in 1992 for more research funding \nfor breast cancer. With the help of the National Breast Cancer \nCoalition and the\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\nwomen of New York--women like Barbara Balaban, Geri Barish, and Doctor \nSusan Love, Senator Harkin and I started a research program in the Army \nthat has grown to over $750 million and continues to provide research \ndollars for the latest, cutting edge technologies and research.\n  We must not abandon the women of America who are diagnosed with \nbreast and cervical cancer, only to find that there is no way to pay \nfor their treatment. Congress has responded to the call for more \nresearch money for breast cancer, we must now continue that fight to \nprovide increased treatment for every woman diagnosed with breast and \ncervical cancer.\n  The National Breast Cancer Coalition has made me very aware of the \nproblems that women are facing regarding treatment after diagnosis \nunder the CDC program. And I am concerned that the problem is getting \nworse.\n  We make speeches and wear pink ribbons to show our commitment to \nfight breast cancer--but now is the time to act to support a simple \namendment that will make real contribution to the fight against breast \ncancer. It will save lives and ensure that women, when diagnosed \nthrough the federal program, will not have to hold bake sales to get \ntreatment.\n  I join my colleagues, Senator Moynihan, Senator Snowe, and Senator \nMikulski, in sponsoring legislation that will establish a mechanism for \nwomen's treatment. This is a targeted measure that will allow states \nthe option of providing Medicaid to women who have participated in the \nCDC program and have been diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. I \nam determined to solve this problem before Congress is adjourned this \nyear. It is irresponsible of the federal government to do otherwise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \na bill that will put an end to the half-promise the federal government \nhas made to women screened under the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Protection Program. When Congress first passed this program as \nthe Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act in 1990, it was \na breakthrough for early detection of breast and cervical cancer. And I \nwas proud to be its chief Senate sponsor. There is still good reason to \nbe proud of this program. By March of 1997, the program had provided \nmammography screening to over 500,000 women and Pap tests to over \n700,000. Nearly 3,500 women have been diagnosed with breast cancer and \nan additional 300 women with invasive cervical cancer. In Maryland \nalone, by December 1996, the state had provided more than 35,000 \nmammograms and 21,000 Pap tests, and diagnosed nearly 300 women with \nbreast cancer and 13 women with invasive cervical cancer.\n  But when we passed that program we expected--and demanded--assurances \nthat women who are found to have breast cancer be provided the \nnecessary diagnostic services, including breast biopsies and treatment \nservices. The program has not lived up to the promise. While a variety \nof innovative strategies have emerged across the country at the state \nand local levels to help women get treatment, the reality is that the \nsystem is overloaded. Some state programs require providers to arrange \nfor treatment before they can participate in the program; a very few \nlike Maryland have been able to come up with a small pool of general \nrevenues, but generally these funds are available for breast diagnostic \nservices, not treatment. In others, program administrators have to rely \non public hospitals, donated services and charity care. In the end, \nthousands of women who run local screening programs are spending \ncountless hours finding treatment services for women diagnosed with \nbreast cancer.\n  This is not what we had in mind. Not at all. The system for \nobtaining treatment services--which at its best was an ad-hoc \npatchwork--has broken down. Of those women diagnosed with cancer in the \nUnited States, nearly 3,000 women have no way to afford treatment--they \nhave no health care insurance coverage or are underinsured. These women \nwant to pay for their services, but they often simply don't have the \nfinancial resources on their own.\n\n  It's a cruel and heart breaking irony for the federal government to \npromise to screen low-income women for breast and cervical cancer, but \nnot to establish a program to treat those women who have been diagnosed \nwith cancer through a federal program. Screening alone does not prevent \ncancer deaths; but treatment can.\n  A recent study of the program done for the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention found that while treatment was eventually found \nfor almost all of the women screened, some women did not get treated at \nall, some refused treatment, and some experienced delays. The study \nalso underscores the terribly labor intensive efforts that go into \nfinding treatment for these women--often at the expense of screening. \nThe lack of coverage for diagnostic and treatment services has also had \na very negative impact on the program's ability to recruit providers, \nfurther restricting the number of women screened. It is sad that 8 \nyears after enactment, the program serves only 12 to 15 percent of all \nwomen who are eligible nationally. And this is likely to get worse. The \nstudy shows there are already additional stresses on the program as \nincreasing numbers of physicians do not have the autonomy in today's \never increasing managed care system to offer free or reduced-fee \nservices.\n  Breast cancer advocates from across the country are reporting that \nlocal programs are so badly strained that they have resorted to holding \nbake sales and community lunches to raise money for treatment services \nfor the women they serve. Others have cobbled together the funds at \ngreat effort--when they are sickest--and most in need of taking care of \ntheir health. One woman in Massachusetts reported that she cashed in \nher life insurance policy to cover the costs of her treatment.\n  It is clear that the short-term, ad-hoc strategies of providing \ntreatment have broken down: for the women who are screened; for the \nlocal programs that fund the screening program; and for the states that \nface increasing burdens. Because there is no coverage for treatment, \nstate programs are having a hard time recruiting providers, volunteers \nare spending a disproportionate amount of time finding treatment for \nwomen, and fewer women are receiving treatment. We can't grow the \nprogram to serve the other 78 percent of eligible women if we can't \npromise treatment to those we already screen.\n\n  Women shouldn't have to hold a bake sale to get treated for breast \ncancer--especially if the federal government has held out the promise \nof early detection. It is an outrage that women with cancer must go \nbegging for treatment. That's why I'm cosponsoring this bill. It will \nestablish a mechanism for women to be treated. It will guarantee \nMedicaid coverage for necessary treatment services to women who are \neligible for the CDC program, and found to have breast cancer or \ncervical cancer. Although I wish the bill would require the States to \nprovide the benefit, the reality is such that we have made this program \nfor now, an optional benefit, and place the responsibility on the \nStates to choose to participate. By doing so, states would in effect, \nextend the federal-state partnership that exists for the screening \nservices in the CDC program to treatment services.\n  This bill is the best long-term solution. It is strongly supported by \nthe National Breast Cancer Coalition representing over 400 \norganizations and 100,000's of women across the nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to join in and cosponsor this critical piece of legislation \nand make good on the promise of early detection.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague Senator D'Amato, and with Senators Mikulski and Snowe, \nlegislation important to ensuring that women with breast cancer and \ncervical cancer will receive coverage for their treatment. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a successful nationwide \nprogram--National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection program--\nthat screens low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical cancer. \nHowever, CDC's program does not have funding to treat these women after \nthey are diagnosed.\n  The women eligible for cancer screening under the CDC program are \nlow-income individuals and yet are not poor enough to qualify for \nMedicaid coverage. They do not have health insurance coverage for these \nscreenings and for subsequent cancer treatment.\n  From July of 1991 to March of 1997, the CDC program provided \nmammography screening to almost 600,000 women and diagnosed nearly \n3,500 cases of breast cancer. During this same period, the program also \nprovided over 700,000 pap smears and found more than 300 cases of \ninvasive cervical cancer.\n  The CDC screening program has had to divert a significant amount of \ntime and funding in order to find treatment opportunities for the women \nfound to have breast and cervical cancer. The lack of subsequent \nfunding for treatment has, therefore, jeopardized the programs' primary \nfunction: to screen low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical \ncancer. Currently, the program screens about 12 to 15 percent of all \neligible women.\n  A recent study conducted at Battelle Centers for Public Health \nResearch and Evaluation and the University of Michigan School of Public \nHealth on treatment funding for women screened\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\nby the CDC program found that, although funding for treatment services \nwere found for most of these women, they often experienced time delays. \nIn addition, during the search for treatment funding, the CDC program \nlost contact with several women. The study also found that the sources \nof treatment funding are uncertain, tenuous and fragmented. The burden \nof funding treatment often fell upon providers themselves. The \nuncertainty and delays worsen the stress of coping with cancer. Some \nwomen, upon learning that they have cancer, must hold lunches and bake \nsales to raise funds to cover their needed treatment.\n  Our legislation would provide treatment coverage for the women \nscreened and diagnosed through the CDC program and who are uninsured. \nStates will have the option to provide this coverage through its \nMedicaid program. If a state chooses this option, they will receive an \nenhanced match for the treatment coverage, similar to the federal match \nprovided to the sate for the CDC screening program.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has approved this proposal in the past. A \nsimilar provision was included in the Senate version of last year's \nBalanced Budget bill. It is my hope that the Senate will again support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 2018. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity tax credit to employers providing employment in \neconomically distressed communities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                The Reemployment Tax Credit Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that will foster job growth and job creation in distressed \ncommunities. This important legislation, the ``Reemployment Tax Credit \nAct of 1988,'' will provide needed assistance to communities when they \nare impacted by significant job losses.\n  Twice in the last year, communities in my state have suffered the \ndifficult repercussions of massive job losses in the area. The \ncircumstances in Huron and those in the Northern Hills region differed \nconsiderably, however, in both instances the job losses affected far \nreaching elements of the local economy. I proudly introduce this \nlegislation to enhance the ability of distressed communities to address \nthe challenges of sudden economic dislocation.\n  This bill will extend the existing Work Opportunity Tax Credit to \ninclude dislocated workers affected by plant closings or other events \nresulting in extensive job losses. This tax credit accelerates \nopportunities for business growth and expansion in distressed \ncommunities therefore decreasing unemployment insurance expenditures, \nreducing the flight of dislocated workers, allowing families to remain \nin their community and in their homes. It serves to stabilize the local \neconomy and minimize the negative impacts on other local businesses.\n  The most successful and immediate action to address economic \ndislocation is to reemploy workers. The Reemployment Tax Credit Act of \n1998 will make a serious and positive impact on the growth and \nprosperity of our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this \neffort to provide distressed communities with this critical assistance \nto help them recover from extraordinary economic hardship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2019. A bill to prohibit the use of Federal funds to implement the \nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange unless or until the Senate has given its advice and consent to \nratification of the Kyoto Protocol and to clarify the authority of \nFederal agencies with respect to the regulation of the emissions of \ncarbon dioxide; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           the economic growth and sovereignty protection act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nprotect the strength and future growth of the American economy, and to \nuphold the system of checks and balances that is central to our \ngovernment. The Clinton Administration's irresponsibility at the Kyoto \nSummit makes it necessary for Congress to act. On December 11, 1998, \nthis administration agreed to an amendment to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\n  An amendment that clearly did not meet the standards for ratification \nestablished by this body in the Byrd-Hagel Resolution by a vote of 95-\n0. The administration simply ignored the Senate's resolution--thereby \nignoring the will of the American people. The resolution was clear and \nunmistakable it in its criteria. It stated that the administration \nshould not agree to binding emission targets unless developing \ncountries also were bound by the targets and that the administration \nmust not agree to anything that severely damages the economy of the \nUnited States. The Kyoto Protocol fails both tests.\n  On the first criteria, the Kyoto Protocol does not include a single \ndeveloping nation. One hundred and thirty-four developing nations, \nincluding China, Mexico, India, Brazil, and South Korea, many of whom \ncompete with the United States for trade opportunities, are completely \nexempt from any obligations or responsibilities for reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  The Kyoto Protocol would legally bind the United States to reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years \n2008 to 2012. It even goes much further than President Clinton's own \nbottom line that he personally announced last October pledging would \nnot accept a baseline below 1990 levels in greenhouse gas emissions. He \nalso said there must be ``meaningful participation'' from all \ndeveloping countries.\n  It is clear that the Protocol fails the second criteria. Numerous \nindependent economic studies predicted serious economic harm even if \nthe administration had held to its position that it enunciated last \nOctober. These studies found 2.4 million job losses, significant \nincreases in energy costs, a 50-cent increase in gas prices per gallon, \na drop in economic growth rates of more than 1 percent a year, and \nmajor American industries being driven out of business or driven out of \nthe United States--industries like steel, aluminum, petroleum refining, \nchemicals, iron, paper products, and cement.\n  That is why American agriculture, American labor, American business \nand industry and many consumer groups have all united in opposition to \nthis treaty. Yet, our negotiators in Kyoto--the ones who were supposed \nto be looking out for the American people--cut a deal that would have \nhad an even more devastating and extreme impact on the U.S. economy and \non the lives of the American people.\n  The administration's recent attempt to develop an economic analysis \nshowing ``minimal'' harm to the U.S. economy clearly are flawed. No \nmodels, no numbers, no percentages, no economics. It is based on \nfabrication and vapor, on what Senator Hagel called ``wildly optimistic \nassumptions'' such as China, India and Mexico agreeing to the binding \ncommitments in this treaty.\n\n  This is what one observer in Kyoto--the leader on this issue in the \nUnited States Senate, along with Senator Byrd--Senator Hagel, had to \nsay about the administration's activities in Kyoto. ``After Vice \nPresident Gore came to Kyoto and instructed our negotiators to show \n`increased flexibility' the doors were thrown open and the objective \nbecame very clear. The objective was: Let us get a deal at any cost. \nThe clear advice of the U.S. Senate and the economic well-being of the \nAmerican people were abandoned under pressure from the U.N. \nbureaucrats, international environmentalists and the 134 developing \ncountries that were not even included--not even included--in the \ntreaty. The United States of America was the only Nation to come out of \nthese negotiations worse than it came in. In fact, there was no \nnegotiation in Kyoto; there was only surrender.''\n  From an environmental standpoint, the Kyoto ``deal'' is completely \ninadequate. The treaty is so flawed that it will do virtually nothing \nto slow the growth of manmade greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Even \nif one accepts the validity of the science on global warming, which is \nstill uncertain and at best contradictory, this treaty would do nothing \nto stop any of these emissions. The Kyoto ``deal'' excludes the very \ndeveloping nations who will be responsible for more than 60 percent of \nthe world's manmade greenhouse gas emissions early in the next century.\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\n  In fact, as more and more American scientists review the available \ndata on global warming, it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast \nmajority believe the commitments for reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions made by the Administration in the Kyoto ``deal'' is an \nunnecessary response to an exaggerated threat--``to an exaggerated \nthreat'' that the Vice President himself is caught up in making. Last \nweek, more than 15,000 scientists, two-thirds with advanced academic \ndegrees, released a petition they signed urging the United States to \nreject the Kyoto ``deal.'' The petition, expressly states that:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's \n     atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.\n\n  The administration understands that the Kyoto ``deal'' does not meet \nthese standards because they have made it clear that the President will \nnot send this document to the Senate for ratification.\n  However, not only did the administration ignore the Senate when \nagreeing to this deal, they are continuing to ignore it even today. A \nnumber of my constituents, particularly farmers and small business \nowners, have come to me with grave concerns over the administration's \n``back door'' implementation of the Protocol's requirements.\n  For example, the Administration has requested $6.3 billion in its \n1999 budget in order to begin meeting its obligations under the Kyoto \nProtocol. This money would go to a number of federal agencies and \ndepartments including the Department of Energy, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Housing and Urban Development, the Commerce \nDepartment, and the Department of Agriculture.\n  The administration, in a document relating to electricity \nrestructuring, which was circulating through the Environmental \nProtection Agency, referenced reducing emission to ``meet our \ngreenhouse gas emission budget under the Kyoto Protocol.'' The \nmemorandum further states that electricity restructuring also should \ntake environmental concerns into account in order to ``deliver on the \nPresident's commitments.''\n  Many federal agencies are in the process of establishing Kyoto \nimplementation offices. The Environmental Protection Agency currently \nis discussing whether the agency has the power under the Clean Air Act \nor the Energy Policy Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions--a key \nemission limited under the Kyoto Protocol.\n  In the news conference after cutting the deal in Kyoto, \nadministration officials seemed to indicate that since the U.S. has ten \nyears to meet the greenhouse gas emission targets established at \nKyoto--the administration has ten years to involve the Senate in its \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution clearly states that while the \nExecutive Branch has the authority to negotiate international treaties, \nthat only the United States Senate has the authority to ratify such \ntreaties. We cannot allow the Executive Branch to usurp the power of \nCongress by implementing the treaty--a treaty that will have such a \ndevastating impact on the United States--without the Senate first being \nratified by this body.\n  A treaty is the most solemn international obligation that can be \nentered upon by sovereign people. The sovereignty of the United States \nwas purchased with the blood of patriots, and the Constitution defined \nthe treaty making power with great care. The blood and treasure of our \nnation may not be placed at hazard by a treaty unless the President and \nCongress are in agreement. The Framers created this shared power in \npart because the United States intended to reject utterly the European \ntradition that invested the monarch with unfettered power to conduct \nforeign policy--even to the extremity of spending the lives of citizens \nin wars conducted to satisfy his vanity or dynastic ambition. Under our \nConstitution, the President may not on his own bind the sovereignty of \nthe United States to the terms of a treaty unless that treaty has been \nratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\n  The treaty making power, then is not only shared and checked, but \nratification must meet the high standard of a two-third vote. The \nAdministration's Kyoto agenda is constitutionally offensive in several \nrespects. First, the President is not to behave like a pre-democratic \nruler who makes commitments at will that bind the nation. Second, the \nExecutive branch is proceeding to inflict severe damage on our economy \nand our people, without deliberation by the Congress. Finally, the \nAdministration is proceeding to impose an unratified--and therefore \nmeaningless--treaty, a treaty so badly flawed that it would, on its \nface, be rejected by the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the administration's activities \nwill stop merely because members of the Senate, members of the House of \nRepresentatives, or citizens of the United States point out the \nConstitutional implications. Therefore, today I am offering the \nEconomic Growth and Sovereignty Protection Act. This act simply would \nprohibit any federal agency from spending federal funds on implementing \nthe treaty until such time that it is ratified by the United States \nSenate.\n\n  In addition, since the EPA has raised the issue of whether it has the \nability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, this act would make it \nclear that no federal agency has such power without the express \nauthority from the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution cannot be ignored. It established a \nsystem of checks and balances which must be preserved and protected. \nThe interests and the sovereignty of this great Nation cannot be \nignored. To allow other nations' interests to become more important--to \ndictate our domestic policy--would be unconscionable. The will of the \nAmerican people cannot be ignored. To do so would crush the very \nfoundation on which this democracy was established.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 2020. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \nbeneficiaries of the military health care system to enroll in Federal \nemployees health benefits plans; to improve health care benefits under \nCHAMPUS and TRICARE Standard, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n\n\n                 the military health care equality act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nHealth Care Equality Act. Mr. President, it may come a surprise to many \nthat the Department of Defenses has reneged on its promise to those who \nhave honorably served in our military forces. That, Mr. President, is \nthe promise of lifetime, quality healthcare for the military retiree \nand his family. I now introduce legislation that will offer all \nSenators the opportunity to join with me in righting this \nunconscionable wrong.\n  Today our military retirees feel betrayed. Before joining, and while \nserving, they were promised quality, lifetime healthcare. However, that \npromise is being broken. Military health care facilities have closed \nbecause of the downsizing of our military forces. Those military health \nfacilities that remain can treat fewer and fewer retirees. The TRICARE \nsystem has high overhead and its provider fees are so low that many \nhealth care providers will not participate. In addition, in some areas, \nretirees do not have access to provider networks. Finally, the TRICARE \nsystem will not treat Medicare eligible retirees. Mr. President, it is \njust not right that the military retiree is the only Federal retiree \nwho is prevented from using his employer provided health care when \nreaching Medicare age.\n  This legislation requires the DOD to provide all military retirees \nwith health care that is comparable to the care provided by the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, or failing that, to make the FEHBP \navailable. In addition, this legislation would require that TRICARE be \nimproved to the FEHBP level. This Legislation will not prevent a \nretiree from using a military health care facility. However, it will \nimprove and increase the health care choices for our retirees.\n  Our military men and women have given much to protect our country in \ntime of peace and war. We must acknowledge this by providing them the \navailable, affordable, quality health care that they were promised. No \nlesser measure will suffice.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in immediately enacting \nthis\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\nlegislation so that we can now begin to care for military retirees, as \npromised, in a manner they so richly deserve for their service to our \ngreat Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2021. A bill to provide for regional skills training alliances, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             the technology skills partnership act of 1998\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today, joined with Senator Lieberman, I \nam introducing legislation to provide our nation's workforce with the \ninformation technology and computer skills it needs to meet the \nemerging and rapidly changing requirements in our various technology \nsectors. I am delighted to have my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut--whose efforts on behalf of the high technology sector and \nits workforce have been second to none--join as an original co-sponsor \nof the Technology Skills Partnership Act of 1998. The purpose of the \nTechnology Skills Partnership Act is to establish regional initiatives \nto provide the skills that industry and workers require to remain \ncompetitive in the global, high technology marketplace.\n\n  The United States is currently the world's science and technology \nleader. Technical innovation, which according to a 1995 report by the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors has been responsible for more \nthan half of America's productivity growth over the past fifty years, \nhas positioned us at the forefront of the global economy. In my view, \nwe could not have achieved this status without the most skilled, \ninnovative, and competitive workforce in the world. The high tech \nglobal economy is evolving at such a rapid pace however, that if we \nfail to keep our workforce honed and highly skilled --whether in \nadvanced computer programming or computer based manufacturing \ntechnology --we risk losing this edge.\n  A growing number of industries throughout the country are reporting \nserious difficulties in hiring workers with appropriate computer and \ninformation technology skills. Recent reports have estimated up to \n190,000 unfilled information technology jobs in the United States due \nto a shortage of qualified workers. Many businesses point to the lack \nof skilled workers as a primary reason for their limited \ncompetitiveness and growth.\n  In my own State of Maryland, the high technology sector currently \nfaces an estimated lack of 10-12,000 workers with appropriate \ntechnology skills. A recent Maryland Department of Business and \nEconomic Development survey indicates that 80% of firms which hire \nmanufacturing or skilled trades workers, reported significant \ndifficulty in finding applicants with the required skills for \ntechnology intensive jobs. The same survey indicates that more than two \nthirds of businesses hiring computer technicians, engineers, analysts, \nor other technical or laboratory personnel experienced difficulty \nfinding qualified workers. It also mentions that fifty-five percent of \nfirms that hire college-level scientist or technical program graduates \nreported the same difficulty and that 62% of these firms reported that \ntheir need for hiring these types of graduates is expected to increase \nover the next five years.\n  Without the appropriate skills for the new economy, hundreds of \nthousands of American workers face stagnation in their jobs or worse. \nWhile well intentioned, most existing training programs are not \nstructured in a way which addresses this problem from the perspective \nof industry and directly prepares our workers for these types of \npositions. To help meet the demand in this regard, a unique approach \nwhich is flexible enough to address the fluctuations and transitions of \nour high technology economy is required. In order to train and educate \nnew entrants to the workforce, workers dislocated by economic change, \nand workers already in the workplace facing increased demands for \nhigher levels of technology related skills, we must establish an \nindustry driven framework which recognizes and addresses this need on a \ncontinuum. Without such a framework, this country and its workers stand \nto lose significant ground in the global economy.\n\n  While some post-secondary training institutions have reached out to \nindustry and become more customer-focused, more still must identify \nways to respond directly to the changing skills and needs of employers. \nMany community colleges, and even four-year colleges and universities, \nlack the resources to purchase up-to-date equipment on which to train \nworkers in relevant knowledge and skills. In addition, while some \ncolleges and universities have been able to establish partnerships with \nsome larger firms that have human resource departments, building \npartnerships and a two-way dialogue with small and medium-sized firms \nhas proven more difficult.\n  Relevant, focused and systematic training and upgrading of infotech \nskills is essential to linking and transitioning our supply of skilled \nAmerican workers to the powerful and emerging demand of today's high \ntech economy. Without direct participation by industry, however, and an \nunderstanding of regional dynamics which help us identify specific \nsolutions to address specific industry and regional needs, a \nsignificant portion of the U.S. workforce will be left behind.\n  Mr. President, having the appropriate information technology skills \nis becoming more and more important in all sectors of our economy, not \nonly in high and biotech industries and the manufacturing sector, but \nalso in the so-called low-tech industries. More than half of the new \njobs created between 1984 and 2005 require or will require some \neducation beyond high school. The percentage of workers who use \ncomputers at work has risen from 25% to 46% between 1984 and 1993. \nMoreover, firms today are not only using more technology, but are also \nreorganizing production processes in new ways, such as cellular \nproduction, use of teams, and other high performance structures and \nmethods requiring higher levels and new kinds of skills.\n  According to the American Society for Training and Development, \ncompany spending on training has not kept up with today's evolving \nneeds. In 1995, American businesses spent $55 billion a year upgrading \nthe skills of their employees, 20 percent more than a dozen years ago. \nHowever, the number of employees has increased by 24 percent, meaning \nthat private-sector spending hasn't kept pace. In order to bridge this \ngap, we need to pool our resources and coordinate our perspectives on \nthis matter.\n  Most firms, but particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, have \nlimited capacity to engage in significant and sustained workforce \ndevelopment efforts. Managers and owners of most firms are simply too \nbusy running their business to develop training systems, especially for \nnew or dislocated workers. Firms also often lack information on what \nkind of training their firms need and where to get it. As a result, \nmost firms forego training initiatives and instead try to hire workers \naway from other companies in related fields.\n  Moreover, because workers are so transient, individual employers are \nreluctant to bear the burden of training employees, be they new or \nincumbent workers, simply due to the likelihood is that the employee \nwill leave and go to work for a competitor. In light of this \npossibility, many firms simply cannot envision an adequate return on \nthe investment for paying to train their employees. This, coupled with \nan increasingly competitive global marketplace, is one reason why many \nlarger companies that once supported in-house training programs have \nsince eliminated these efforts.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing would establish regional working \ngroups across the country in which employers, public agencies, schools, \nand labor unions can pool resources and expertise to train workers for \nemerging job opportunities and jobs threatened by economic and \ntechnological transition. It will help develop targeted consortia of \nindustry, workers and training entities across the country to assess \nwhere and what gaps in this regard exist and provide the skills that \nindustry and workers require to remain competitive and get ahead.\n  Specifically, it would authorize a grants program--to be overseen by \nthe Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology--and provide up to a $1 million federal match, for every \ndollar invested by state and local governments and the private sector \nfor these working\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\ngroups. The Department would budget $50 million annually for this \npurpose and funds would be allocated through a competitive grants \nprocess, with each consortia of firms as applicants.\n  Through a sector based approach, this legislation would direct \nmeaningful participation in building an alliance by ensuring that each \nconsists of at least 10 firms. These alliances would allow for \nparticipation from state and local officials, educational leaders, \nregional chapters of trade associations and union officials. However, \neach would be predominantly made up of industry, and as I have \nmentioned, would be industry driven. Indeed, if we are going to address \nthe skills crisis in this country, industry must have a leadership role \nin establishing the means by which we continue to build and upgrade the \nskills of workers in technology related fields.\n  Smaller scale versions of the types of skills alliances which my \nlegislation proposes to develop have already shown promise. In \nWisconsin, metal-working firms got together with the AFL-CIO in a \npublicly sponsored effort that used an abandoned mill building as a \nteaching facility, teaching workers essential skills on state-of-the-\nart manufacturing equipment. Rhode Island helped develop a skills \nalliance among plastics firms, who then worked with a local community \ncollege to create a polymer training laboratory linked to an \napprenticeship program that guarantees jobs for graduates. In \nWashington, DC telecommunications firms donated computers, and helped \nto set up a program to train public high school students to be computer \nnetwork administrators and are now hiring graduates of the program at \nan entry-level salary of $25,000-30,000.\n  Each of these initiatives is an investment in our workforce for the \n21st Century. If we are to truly transition the U.S. worker to a \ntechnology based economy, we must ensure that these best practice \nexamples become standard practice. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nensuring the swift enactment of this legislation. I ask that a copy of \nthis legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support as an\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\noriginal cosponsor of my colleague Senator Sarbanes' bill, the \nTechnology Skills Partnership Act of 1998. I am delighted that Senator \nSarbanes has taken the initiative in developing this innovative \napproach to help solve one of the biggest problems this country is \nfacing--an insufficiently skilled workforce. This bill has the bold but \nachievable goal of trying to change the mindset of U.S. companies in \nthis country in favor of collaborating on training skilled workers for \ntheir industry.\n  We are facing a shortage of skilled workers in this country. \nEstimates are as high as 190,000 unfilled jobs in the information \ntechnology industry alone. But it isn't just the high-tech industry \nthat needs workers with high-tech skills. All industries now need \nworkers with computer literacy, including what we might consider \n``lower-tech'' manufacturing and services such as auto repair shops.\n  In the long-term, we need to improve our students' education in the \nmath and sciences and attract more students into these areas. \nUniversities need to attract more college students into scientific, \nengineering, and technical fields. Ultimately, a large part of the \nresponsibility will lie with industry to attract workers into these \ncareers by creating attractive career paths and financial rewards that \ncan compete for the best students.\n  In the short term, high-tech industry would like to raise H1-B visa \ncaps. But we need to do something more than let foreign workers fill \nthe gap in high-tech workers that now exists. We need to train our \nworkforce with skills that fit industry's needs today. Industry must be \na large part of the solution. Only with industry leading the skills \ntraining can we be sure that workers are being trained for jobs that \nactually exist. That is why this bill creates an industry-drive \ntraining program.\n  Why does the federal government need to be involved? Because industry \ndoes not normally cooperate in training workers. Small companies, and \n90% of firms in the United States are small businesses, don't have the \nresources to invest in lengthy training. Larger companies used to \nprovide training programs, but in the high-tech field, workers move \nquickly from one job to another chasing higher salaries. Many companies \nare reticent to invest in long-term training for employees that may \nquickly move on. Cooperation within an industry provides a solution to \nthis problem.\n  The government's role in this bill would be to provide the catalyst \nto bring the companies together to cooperate on training. The federal \nfunds are matched dollar for dollar by, first, funds from the state \nand, second, funds from a consortium of 10 or more companies. The \nfederal funds are meant only to start the process--federal funding ends \nafter three years--and then the states and industry continue the \ncooperative training programs alone.\n  Let me give you an example from my home state: Connecticut. A recent \nreport prepared by Connecticut's Industry Cluster Advisory Board found \nthat:\n\n     . . . the demand for skilled manufacturing workers far \n     exceeds the number of students graduating from manufacturing \n     programs.'' There is a ``negative perception of manufacturing \n     as a career choice.'' People ``still think of manufacturing \n     as a dirty, low-paying environment with no hope for \n     advancement. Today, manufacturing is clean, and typically a \n     computer-based environment which pays an average annual wage \n     in the $30,000 range or more with appropriate skills and \n     training.''\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       Substantial investment in training is necessary for \n     companies to compete in this new environment. However, since \n     most precision manufacturing companies are small businesses--\n     of the 750 in the Hartford region only 7.4% have more than \n     100 employees--companies that are dependent upon their \n     skilled workers for success are not prepared to support \n     worker training.\n\n  The report says further:\n\n       While Connecticut has a wealth of public technical training \n     resources, these traditional programs cannot meet the current \n     demand fast enough and do not have a direct link from \n     training to employment.\n\n  By stimulating industry-led training, we can guarantee a direct link \nfrom training to employment that is missing is traditional public \nsector training programs. In addition, most public sector training \nprograms are focused on unemployed, dislocated, or disadvantaged \nworkers. This program is open to all workers, including incumbent \nworkers who want to improve their skills and increase their \nopportunities for higher wages and advancement. Further, this program \nis specifically created to allow participation by small and medium-\nsized companies.\n  In the last few years, a small number of regional and industry-based \ntraining alliances in the United States have emerged, usually in \npartnership with state and local governments and technical colleges. In \nRhode Island, with help from the state's Human Resource Investment \nCouncil, plastics firms developed a skills alliance. The Wisconsin \nRegional Training Partnership, metal-working firms in conjunction with \nthe AFL-CIO, set up a teaching factory to train workers. While some \npartnerships have emerged around the country, there are documented \ndifficulties in fostering this kind of collective action without some \nfederal backing. Without some kind of support to create alliances, \nsmall- and medium-sized firms just don't have the time or resources to \ncollaborate with anybody on training. In fact, almost all the existing \nregional skills alliances report that they would not have been able to \nget off the ground without an independent, staffed entity to operate \nthe alliance. Widespread and timely deployment of these kinds of \npartnerships is simply not likely to happen without the incentives \nestablished by a federal initiative. This can help create successful \nmodels and templates that others can replicate across the nation.\n  I am proud to support the Technology Skills Partnership Act of 1998 \nand urge my colleagues to join me in taking this step toward an \nimmediate, short-term solution to the shortage of skilled workers in \nour country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Abraham, \n        and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2022. A bill to provide for the improvement of interstate criminal \njustice identification, information, communications, and forensics; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3919-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3940-S3943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n            THE CRIME IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Crime \nIdentification Technology Act of 1998.\n  More than 20 years of experience working in the criminal justice \nsystem have taught me that information is absolutely crucial to \nsuccessful law enforcement. As a prosecutor in Greene County, Ohio; as \nLieutenant Governor overseeing Ohio's anti-crime and anti-drug efforts; \nand later as a member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, I \nhave seen first-hand the importance of information and record-keeping \nto criminal justice.\n  Our state and local law enforcement organizations--as well as our \ncourts--need to develop and upgrade their criminal information and \nidentification systems. The Federal Government has already invested \nbillions of dollars in information and identification systems whose \nbenefits will go largely unrealized--unless states receive the \nresources to be able to participate in these systems. Our national data \nbases are only as good as the information in which the states provide \nby their participation.\n  Unfortunately, there is still a wide disparity between the criminal \nidentification systems that are available--and the ability of state and \nlocal law enforcement to develop and use them. For example, while \ncomputer technology exists that allows law enforcement to match \nfingerprints electronically with criminal history databases, most \nstates lack the equipment and resources necessary to connect on any \nbroad scale with the databases operated by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI).\n  Too many States lack the resources to contribute state criminal \nhistories to the FBI criminal history database in a timely manner or in \na computer-ready format, and have inadequate equipment to retrieve \ninformation from the database quickly or on a widespread geographic \nbasis.\n  While we may disagree about the Brady Act, it funded the National \nCriminal History Improvement Program (N-CHIP), administered by the \nBureau of Justice Statistics, which has successfully helped states \nprepare to perform background checks. Unfortunately, N-CHIP expires \nthis year--but not all states are fully operational.\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n  In addition, the FBI, the National Criminal Center (NCIC) 2000, and \nthe Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System will be \nfully operational--and ready for states to participate--soon.\n  Also, DNA casework testing has more than doubled in the last three \nyears because of demand by law enforcement to provide DNA analysis in \nviolent crime cases. In 48 states convicted offender DNA analysis is \nmandated by statute. Further, advances in the use of DNA to solve \ncrimes based on automated searches of State and National CODIS DNA \nprofile databases are producing DNA matches, generating even more \ndemand for rapid testing of convicted felon DNA samples for database \ninput. The demand for casework results and the need for convicted \noffender database analysis continues to grow at a rate that outstrips \nthe capacities and capabilities of state and local crime laboratories.\n\n  We need to make sure the states are able to make the fullest possible \nuse of this breathtaking technology.\n  That's the idea behind the bill I am introducing today. It would \nprovide $250 million in each of the next five years for grants to the \nstates. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nis directed to make grants to each state to be used in conjunction with \nunits of local government, and other states, to develop, update, or \nupgrade technologies, including the following:\n  Centralized, automated criminal history record information systems, \nincluding arrest and disposition reporting.\n  Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with \nthe Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. Finger imaging, live scan and \nother automated systems to digitize fingerprints and to communicate \nprints in a manner that is compatible with systems operated by states \nand the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III).\n  Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the \nInterstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy \nCompact.\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility \ndeterminations.\n  Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and \ncommunicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, \nprosecution, and corrections.\n  Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting \nof dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI, and to \npromote the integration of court systems with other criminal justice \ninformation systems.\n  Ballistics identification programs that are compatible --and \nintegrated--with the National Integrated Ballistics Network (NIBN).\n  Information, identification and communications programs for forensic \npurposes, including for crime laboratory accreditation.\n  DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes.\n  Sexual offender identification and registration systems.\n  Domestic violence offender identification and information systems.\n  Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide \nstatistical and research products including incident-based reporting \nsystems and uniform crime reports.\n  Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and \nprograms.\n\n  Mr. President, all these proposals have one thing on common: they are \nbased on the principle that technology is the future of police work. It \nis the number one edge our law enforcement officers are going to have \nin the struggle against criminals, well into the 21st century. In this \nsense, crime-fighting is a lot like baseball. It's a game of \npercentages--and everything we can do to boost the average helps the \nteam.\n  We can continue to pursue increasingly sophisticated criminals with \noutmoded twentieth century technology--or we can substantially boost \nour team's average by providing states the Federal assistance required \nto effectively participate in these programs. If we are serious about \nreducing crime in America, the Federal Government has to step up to the \nplate on this key issue of promoting state and local use of available \ncrime-fighting technology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine in \nintroducing legislation to authorize comprehensive Department of \nJustice grants to every state for criminal justice identification, \ninformation and communications technologies and systems. I applaud the \nSenator from Ohio for his leadership. I am also pleased that the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Leader are \noriginal cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation.\n  I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last \n30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely \nfashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st \nCentury, we must provide our state and local law enforcement officers \nwith the resources to develop the latest technological tools and \ncommunications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill \naccomplishes that goal.\n  Our bipartisan legislation authorizes $250 million for each of the \nnext five years in grants to states for crime information and \nidentification systems. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, is directed to make grants to each state to be used \nin conjunction with units of local government, and other states, to use \ninformation and identification technologies and systems to upgrade \ncriminal history and criminal justice record systems.\n  Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, \ndevelop, update or upgrade--\n  State, centralized, automated criminal history record information \nsystems, including arrest and disposition reporting.\n  Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with \nthe Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize \nfingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible \nwith systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III).\n  Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the \nInterstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy \nCompact.\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility \ndeterminations.\n  Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and \ncommunicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, \nprosecution, and corrections.\n  Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms \neligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the \nNICS.\n  Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting \nof dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to \npromote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with \nother criminal justice information systems.\n  Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated \nwith the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics \nNetwork (NIBN).\n  Information, identification and communications programs for forensic \npurposes.\n  DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes.\n  Sexual offender identification and registration systems.\n  Domestic violence offender identification and information systems\n  Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal \njustice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and \nother individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by federal or \nstate law and administered by a government agency.\n  Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide \nstatistical and research products including incident-based reporting \nsystems and uniform crime reports.\n  Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and \nprograms.\n  Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share \nroutine and emergency information among federal, state and local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples from my home State of Vermont \nthat illustrate how our comprehensive legislation will aid state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies across the country.\n  The future of law enforcement must focus on working together to \nharness the power of today's information age to prevent crime and catch \ncriminals. One way to work together is for state and local law \nenforcement agencies to band together to create efficiencies of scale. \nFor example, together with New Hampshire and Maine, the State of \nVermont has pooled its resources together to build a tri-state IAFIS \nsystem to identify fingerprints. Our bipartisan legislation would \nfoster these partnerships by allowing groups of States to apply \ntogether for grants.\n  Another challange for law enforcement agencies across the country is \ncommunication difficulties between federal, state and local law \nenforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice's \nNational Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the nation lack adequate communications systems to respond \nto crimes that cross state and local jurisdictions.\n  A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that \nleft four people dead including two New Hampshire state troopers, \nVermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police \ncruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between federal, \nstate and local law enforcement officers because the two states' police \nradios could not communicate with one another.\n  The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney's \nOffice and others have reacted to this communications problem by \ndeveloping the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the \nnorthern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine \nto integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better \ncoordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly.\n  Our legislation would provide grants for the development of \nintegrated Federal, State and local law enforcement communications \nsystems to foster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights \nproject.\n  In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States \nmeet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For \ninstance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will \nrequire states to update their criminal justice systems for the country \nto benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other \nnational programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic \nviolence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act.\n  Currently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these \nnational crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by \nhelping the each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws.\n  Our bipartisan legislation provides a helping hand with the heavy \nhand of a\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\ntop-down, Washington-knows-best approach. Unfortunately, some in \nCongress have pushed legislation mandating minute detail changes that \nStates must make in their laws to qualify for Federal funds. Our bill \nrejects this approach. Instead, we provide the States with Federal \nsupport to improve their criminal justice idenfication, information and \ncommunication systems without prescriping new Federal mandates.\n  Mr. President, we have patterned the administration of the technology \ngrants under our bill after the highly successful DOJ National Criminal \nHistory Improvement Program (N-CHIP), which was created by the 1993 \nBrady Act.\n  The Vermont Department of Public Safety has received funds under the \nN-CHIP program for the past three years and I have been proud to \nstrongly support their efforts. With that Federal assistance, Vermont \nhas been achieved acquiring the automated fingerprint identification \nsystem in conjunction with Maine and New Hampshire, upgrading its \nrecords repository computer systems, as well as extending their online \nincident-based reporting system to local jurisdictions throughout \nVermont. Our bill builds on the Justice Department's existing \ninfrastructure under the successful N-CHIP program to provide fair and \neffective grant administration.\n  I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's \nleadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal \nhistory records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by \nproviding each State with the necessary resources to continue to make \nimportant efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan bill to provide each \nState with the resources to capture the power of emerging information \nand communications technologies to serve and protect all of our \ncitizens.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, law enforcement agencies in every state \nrely increasingly on criminal history record information. Suspected \ncriminals cross state lines and move between communities, creating an \nunprecedented need for greater cooperation between the 50 states and \nbetween states and the federal government to share this information. It \nis imperative that each state be able to take advantage of emerging \ntechnologies that make this cooperation possible. It is for that reason \nthat I am pleased to cosponsor the State Grant Program for Criminal \nJustice Identification, Information and Communication. This legislation \nwill help states upgrade their criminal justice information and \nidentification operations, assist in integrating those operations, and \nmake those operations compatible with the FBI's communication \ntechnology.\n  Revolutionary technological improvements in communication systems \nallow localities separated by great distances to share information \ninstantaneously. This communication between law enforcement agencies \ncan make the difference between locating suspects and getting them off \nthe streets, or leaving them free to commit more crimes. I believe we \nhave a responsibility to ensure that states have full access to new \ncriminal history record technologies. This legislation will provide the \nfederal financial assistance and leadership that the states need by \nestablishing a $1.25 billion, 5-year, comprehensive federal assistance \nprogram to provide grants to every state for criminal justice \nidentification, information and communications technologies and \nsystems.\n  In addition, grants provided under this legislation will assist \nstates as they upgrade their fingerprint and other identification \ntechnologies so that they are compatible with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's (FBI) criminal history record information systems. The \nFBI will soon implement 2 major information and identification \ninitiatives, the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System \n(IAFIS) and NCIC 2000, that could dramatically improve the access law \nenforcement agencies have to criminal history record information. \nIAFIS, in particular, will greatly enhance the exchange of information \nbetween the FBI and the states, providing rapid electronic submission \nand transfer of fingerprint and criminal history information. The \nstates will need the funding assistance provided by this legislation to \nobtain the equipment necessary to derive full benefit from these new \nsystems.\n  In recent years, Congress has recognized the urgent need to secure \nthe safety of our streets for our children and our families, and this \nhas led to the enactment of federal initiatives, such as sexual \noffender registries, domestic violence initiatives, the National Child \nProtection Act, and the Brady National Instant Background Check System. \nAlthough these initiatives have done a great deal to protect adults and \nchildren in communities nationwide, additional steps need to be taken. \nThe State Grant Program for Criminal Justice Identification, \nInformation and Communication will provide assistance to states so they \ncan take that next step.\n  Criminal tracking programs have been far more effective in \nidentifying and apprehending dangerous criminals than any other \nprograms in recent memory, but we have an opportunity to make these \ntracking programs much more effective. As technology continues to \nimprove this country's communication systems, we must make sure the \nstates are not left behind. If the states cannot access these systems, \nor do not have the funding to obtain them, then this revolutionary \ntechnology will be of little help. By enacting the State Grant Program \nfor Criminal Justice Identification, Information and Communication, we \nhave the opportunity to improve the cooperation between law enforcement \nagencies nationwide.

SALE OF HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED BARLEY TO \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 220\n\n       Whereas, in an unprecedented sale, the European Union has \n     entered into a contract with the United States to sell \n     heavily subsidized European barley to the United States;\n       Whereas the sale of almost 1,400,000 bushels (30,000 metric \n     tons) of feed barley would be shipped from Finland to \n     Stockton, California;\n       Whereas news of the sale has already depressed feed barley \n     prices by at least 24 cents per bushel in the California feed \n     barley market;\n       Whereas, since this market sets national pricing patterns \n     for both feed and malting barley, the sale would mean \n     enormous market losses for barley producers throughout the \n     United States, at a time when United States barley producers \n     are already suffering from low prices;\n       Whereas the European restitution subsidies for this barley \n     amounts to $1.11 per bushel ($51 per metric ton);\n       Whereas the price-depressing effects of this 1 sale would \n     adversely affect market prices for at least a 9-month period \n     as this grain moves through the United States marketing \n     system;\n       Whereas this shipment would be part of about 9,000,000 \n     bushels (200,000 metric tons) of European feed barley that \n     has been approved for restitution subsidies by the European \n     Union;\n       Whereas the availability of the additional subsidized \n     European barley in the international market would not only \n     continue to artificially depress market prices, but also \n     would threaten to open a new channel of imports into the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, as the world's largest feed grain producer and the \n     world's largest exporter of feed grains, the United States \n     does not require imported feed grains;\n       Whereas, at the same time that subsidized European barley \n     is being imported into the United States, some United States \n     feed grains are prevented from entering European markets \n     under European Union food regulations;\n       Whereas United States barley growers are now feeling the \n     negative impacts of the sale, regardless of whether the \n     subsidized European barley was originally targeted for sale\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\n     into the United States and whether the subsidies comply with \n     the letter of current World Trade Organization export subsidy \n     rules; and\n       Whereas the sale not only undermines the intent and the \n     spirit of free trade agreements and negotiations, but also \n     moves away from the goals of level playing fields and \n     fairness in trade relationships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF SENATE ON EXPORT OF EUROPEAN BARLEY TO \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It is sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the European Union should--\n       (A) take immediate steps to cancel the sale of European \n     feed barley to the United States; and\n       (B) establish procedures to ensure that restitution and \n     other subsidies are not used for sales of agricultural \n     commodities to the United States or other countries of North \n     America;\n       (2) the President of the United States, the United States \n     Trade Representative, and the Secretary of Agriculture should \n     immediately investigate the sale of European feed barley to \n     the United States and prevent any future sale of European \n     agricultural commodities to the United States or other \n     countries of North America that is based on restitution or \n     other subsidies; and\n       (3) not later than 60 days after approval of this \n     resolution, the United States Trade Representative and the \n     Secretary of Agriculture should report to Congress on--\n       (A) the terms and conditions of the sale of European feed \n     barley to the United States;\n       (B) the steps that have been taken to cancel the sale and \n     prevent any recurrence of similar types of sales; and\n       (C) any additional authorities that are necessary to carry \n     out subparagraph (B).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, periodically, there are events that help \nfocus and define the problems that this nation faces in its trade \nrelationships with the rest of the world. Today, we are facing another \nglaring example of how this nation becomes the dumping ground for \nsubsidized exports that violates any reasonable understanding of fair \ntrade and level-playing fields.\n  Earlier this month, a sale was made for the shipment of 1.4 million \nbushels of feed barley from Finland to Stockton, California. The irony \nand tragedy of this sale is that the United States is the world's \nlargest producer of feed grains, as well as the world's largest \nexporter of feed grains. There is absolutely no reason for this nation \nto import a single grain of feed barley.\n  The only reason that this sale was feasible was that this shipment is \nheavily subsidized to the tune of at least $1.11 per bushel through the \nEuropean Union's restitution system of subsidies.\n  At a time when farmers across this country are facing some very \nserious economic challenges, including low prices, escalating \nproduction costs, and adverse weather conditions, it is a serious \neconomic blow for them to be undercut by the import of subsidized feed \ngrains. At a time when many farmers are having difficulty getting \ncredit to put in their spring crops because current farm prices do not \ncover production costs, we do not need unnecessary imports to put \nfurther downward pressure on our grain markets.\n  News of this sale of European barley has already depressed feed \nbarley prices by at least 24 cents a bushel in the California feed \nbarley market. Since this market sets pricing trends for both feed and \nmalting barley, this sale of 1.4 million bushels is producing enormous \nmarket losses for barley producers throughout the country. Market \nexperts indicate that this sale will adversely affect U.S. barley \nprices for at least a nine-month period as this barley moves through \nthe U.S. marketing system. It particularly hits home in North Dakota, \nwhich is the nation's largest producer of barley and normally produces \none-third of this nation's barley crop.\n  Compounding the pricing impact of this particular sale is the fact \nthat there is something in the neighborhood of another 9 million \nbushels of feed barley that have been authorized for restitution \nsubsidies by the European Union and which have not yet found a home.\n  This morning at a meeting in the office of Senator Baucus, I and \nother Senators from barley-producing states met with the Ambassador of \nthe Organization of European Communities, Mr. Hugo Paeman. We asked him \nto convey to the European Union that this sale should be terminated and \nthat the European Union should take immediate steps to prevent any \nfuture occurrence of such subsidized sales into the U.S. market. While \nMr. Paeman sought to assure us that this sale was a very unusual \ncircumstance and was not a precedent for additional sales of subsidized \nbarley into the United States, we continue to be greatly concerned \nabout the impact it has already had upon markets and the danger of this \nsale opening a new channel of unfair trade into the United States.\n\n  While I sincerely hope that the European Union will take our concerns \nseriously and take the appropriate actions to terminate this sale and \nprevent future sales, I also recognize that this nation also has a \nresponsibility to fight for fair trade for our farmers. It's bad enough \nthat the European Union would permit such an event to occur. It would \nbe even worse if the United States took no action to stop it.\n  The real tragedy of this situation is that it is very likely that \nthis shipment of highly-subsidized feed barley is permissible under \ncurrent rules of the World Trade Organization. The possibility that \nthis sale is WTO legal doesn't make it any more acceptable to the \nfarmers who have already been hurt by the price reduction that this \nsale has caused.\n  This morning we were told that the European Union had not targeted \nthe United States for this particular shipment of barley, and that it, \nin fact, had been intended for sale to Saudi Arabia. Yet, the reality \nis that this sale is currently scheduled to be shipped to Stockton. \nCalifornia. Again, it makes little difference to U.S. barley growers \nwhether this shipment was originally destined for the United States. \nThe effect on their prices is the same. The damage to our markets is \nthe same.\n  While this sale of heavily-subsidized European barley is \nunprecedented, once a channel of commerce is opened it is often \nextremely difficult to put the genie back in the bottle. That is why \nthat I and my colleagues from other barley producing states are so \ndeeply concerned about this particular event. We have seen a trickle of \nCanadian grain moving across our borders change into a perpetual \navalanche. We have seen assurances and good intentions become the \ngrease by which unfair trade policies have become structural.\n  This particular sale of European barley is another example of many of \nthe ongoing problems that our nation has in achieving fair trade with \nlevel playing fields and reciprocal market access. While I hope that \nthis sale can be terminated and resolved quickly and effectively, I \nalso believe this sale should become a rallying point for not only \nAmerican farmers, but the entire nation in demanding fairness and \njustice in our trade policies and relationship.\n  I am pleased that I have been joined by twelve of my colleagues in \nsubmitting a sense of the Senate resolution which calls upon both the \nEuropean Union and our own nation to take the appropriate steps to not \nonly terminate this sale, but also to ensure that such a sale will \nnever occur again.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to declare my concern \nover the dumping of barley into the American market by a European \nproducer.\n  I share the Idaho barley producers' outrage about the current \nunprecedented movement of heavily subsidized European Union feed barley \ninto the California feed markets. Last week, a 30,000 metric ton cargo \nof European feed barley was sold into the Stockton, California feed \nmarket. As expected, this sale has caused a tremendous ripple in \nAmerican barley prices. In fact, this action has caused the price of \nbarley to drop 34 cents a bushel after the subsidized European Union \nfeed barley sale was announced. This sale undermines both the intent \nand spirit of trade agreements with Europe and contradicts the goals of \ntrade fairness.\n  Any time there is a drastic drop in the price of any commodity, \nAmerica's agriculture community and leaders must take notice. Whether \nthe dumping was intentional or not, we must not allow it to go \nunchallenged and the practice cannot be allowed to continue. American \nbarley producers can compete with any in the world, but there must be a \nlevel playing field. The European Union must now take steps to level \nthat field.\n  I, along with my some of my colleagues, have met with European Union \nAmbassador Hugo Paeman about the problem. Ambassador Paeman has assured \nus that the European Union countries will not repeat the recent sale of \nsubsidized barley into the\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\nUnited States. That would be a disaster for Idaho and American \nproducers. The ambassador also assured us that this is in no way a \nprecedent, and in fact is a unique and isolated event. However, if this \nsale is still allowed to go through, it could create a real concern \nthat this deal will set a precedent.\n  Barley is very important to the economy of my home state. Idaho \nproduces 60 million bushels of barley a year, worth $155.3 million \nannually. We are the second largest barley producer in the U.S. and \nbarley is the state's fifth largest crop.\n  Mr. Chairman, I call for termination of this sale of European Union \nbarley and also for assurances from the European Union that U.S. grain \nmarkets will not be disrupted by unfair trade practices. That is why I \nam submitting a resolution calling on the European Union to halt this \nshipment and for the administration to investigate this unfair \npractice.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in submitting \nthis resolution condemning the subsidized sale of European barley into \nthe California barley market.\n  Today several of us met with the European Union Ambassador, Mr. Hugo \nPaemon, to express our extreme concern about this shipment and about \nthe future it bodes for the trade relationship between the United \nStates and the European Union. Quite frankly, Mr. President, I think \nthat we were heard but I am not sure, in the American vernacular, that \nMr. Paemon quite ``gets it.''\n  Mr. President, I want to suggest that whether this is just a \nskirmish, or whether it is the first battle in what many believe could \nbecome a rapidly escalating conflict over trade in agricultural goods, \nfor barley producers in Oregon and across America, there has been no \nmore serious matter in the past decade.\n  My language is strong, Mr. President, because it is very important \nthat Senators understand that if this shipment proceeds it sets an \nextremely dangerous precedent for our agricultural trade practices.\n  There is a very real concern in Oregon that if we allow this shipment \nof grain, the shipment of which would simply not be possible without an \nextraordinary level of European Union subsidy, then we will have opened \nthe door to further shipments that could have devastating effects on \nour domestic commodity prices.\n  For my colleagues who have not yet heard about this issue, a shipment \nof European Union barley, at a restitution subsidy rate of $51 per \nmetric ton, that was originally targeted into the Saudi Arabian market \nwas not sold. In search of a buyer, this shipment was subsequently sold \ninto the California feed barley market at a price well below the then-\ncurrent market price.\n  Mr. President, the United States is the world's largest producer of \nfeed grains and the world's largest exporter of feed grains. Were this \nEuropean barley not subsidized at half of its value, we would not be \nhaving this discussion because there is no way it could have been \npriced competitively with domestic feed barley.\n  I met this weekend with barley producers in Klamath Falls, Oregon. \nThese folks are already seeing very tough barley prices this season, \ndown about $5 a metric ton from what they have normally received over \nthe decade. They are taking some hits as a consequence of our national \npolicy through the Farm bill of phasing out income maintenance \nprograms. And now the European Union is sending us a heavily subsidized \nshipment that is causing collapse of the market. Enough is enough.\n  This European Union shipment, because it has the capacity to flood \nthe California market for the next 9 months, has caused prices to drop \n$10 per ton in one week. One individual who operates a grain elevator \nin the Klamath described telling a local producer that he had lost some \n$20,000 in 48 hours as a result of this dumping of this subsidized \nbarley into California.\n  These farmers ask, correctly, that if ever there was a time for the \nfederal government to come to the defense of American agriculture, now \nis that time. We face collapse of our American barley market because of \nthis relatively unique occurrence; now is the time to go to the mat in \ndefense of our producers against wholly subsidized foreign dumping.\n  Mr. President, we should also recognize, and thank, the larger \nwholesalers of barley in California who passed up this sale, which to \nthem represented I'm sure a very lucrative marketing opportunity. These \ncompanies understood the damage that the sale would do to their \ncustomers and most reliable suppliers, the U.S. barley producers. But \nsurely if this sale is allowed to go forward, and other fire sales are \nallowed to follow, those firms will no longer be able to afford that \nposture.\n  Mr. President, as a supporter of free trade, and of providing fast \ntrack authority, if we are to retain our credibility with American \nfarmers then we must show the ability to act forcefully when faced with \nthese sorts of irritants to free trade. There is no precedent for this \nsale, and if we allow it to go forward then those of us who believe in \nthe promise of freer trade will have some difficulty explaining to our \nfarmers that greater trade freedom is in their best interest.\n  Mr. President, It is very important to all Oregon producers that the \nU.S. Senate act quickly to respond to this unprecedented attack on one \nsegment of our agriculture industry. I urge the swift adoption of this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3944-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 221--DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 1998, AS ``NATIONAL ERASE \n                  THE HATE AND ELIMINATE RACISM DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Allard, Mr. \nCampbell, Ms. Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \nGrams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nKempthorne, Mr. Mack, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Glenn, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLieberman, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nRobb, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerrey, \nMr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Levin, Mr. Specter, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in \nhomage to an extraordinary group of young people, the Garrett Academy \nof Technology Varsity Boys Basketball Team. On January 2, 1998, these \nyoung men made 32 3-point shots in one game--a new national record. \nSouth Carolina takes tremendous pride in their accomplishment, which \nthey achieved with teamwork and individual excellence.\n  In the last two years, this team has set many individual and personal \nrecords. The Falcons are the defending 7-AA Region Champions and their \ncoach, Michael Bayne, has been named Coach of the Year more than \nfifteen times in various sports. These athletes set a standard of \nexcellence for every field of endeavor.\n  The members of the Garrett Falcons are as follows:\n  Robert Seabrook, who set a State record last year by making 12 3-\npoint shots in one game. Robert, a Senior electronics student plans to \nattend Anderson College on a basketball scholarship.\n  Wil Gibbs, an electricity student, is a Senior and will attend \ncollege in the Fall.\n  Hashem Richardson, a plumbing student, is a Senior and will attend \npreparatory school.\n  Josh Davis, a drafting student, is a Senior and will attend \nSpartanburg Methodist College.\n  Hassan Bartley, an automotive student, is a Senior and will attend \nSpartanburg Methodist College.\n  Kyren Ancrum, a plumbing student, is a Junior and plans to attend \nDenmark Technical College.\n  Ralph Pressley, a plumbing student, is a Sophomore.\n  Louis McCullough, a drafting student, is a Sophomore.\n  Brandon Fields is a Freshman and undecided in his concentration of \nstudy.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the newspaper account of this victory, \n``Garrett Tech's 3-point Baskets Make History'' which appeared in the \nJanuary 8, 1998 issue of Charleston's The Post and Courier be printed \nin the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n     [From The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., January 8, 1998]\n\n                      Garrett Threes Make History\n\n                           (By Jeff Hartsell)\n\n       Robbie Seabrook learned how to shoot a basketball on the \n     hoop at his cousins' house.\n       ``They were all so tall,'' said Seabrook, ``that I had to \n     shoot from outside all the time.''\n       Now that Seabrook is all grown up--he's a 6-3 senior for \n     the Garrett Tech basketball team--the outside shooting touch \n     his cousins forced on him is paying off in a big way.\n       Seabrook is the leading 3-point shooter on a Garrett team \n     that set a national high school record for most 3-point \n     baskets in a game last week.\n       During their own Wall of Fame Invitational last Friday, the \n     Falcons made 32 of 79 shots from 3-point range in a 117-39 \n     victory over Bowman Academy.\n       That performance bettered the 29 treys (in 94 attempts, \n     still a record) made in a game last year by Alexandria High \n     of Juniata Valley, Pa., according to the National Federation \n     of State High School Associations.\n       ``It was pure energy that night,'' said Seabrook, who made \n     nine 3-pointers against Bowman Academy. ``All I know is I \n     didn't get tired in that game.''\n       Neither did his teammates. Point guard Hashem Richardson \n     also made nine 3-pointers, while Will Gibbs added eight and \n     Louis McCollough, Damien Jackson and Brandon Fields had two \n     each.\n       For the season, Garrett (9-2) has made 98 3-point shots in \n     11 games, led by Seabrook, who has hit 52 of 137 treys (37.9 \n     percent) and will play next year at Anderson College, an NCAA \n     Division II school in Anderson.\n       Seabrook, averaging 22 points per game, set a state record \n     last year by making 12 3-point shots in one game and made 34 \n     straight free throws at the end of last season and start of \n     this season.\n       Obviously, Garrett coach Michael Bayne believes in the \n     power of threes.\n       ``Robbie has the green light at any time,'' said Bayne, 60-\n     31 in his fourth season at Garrett after stints at Cardinal \n     Newman in Columbia and Denmark-Olar.\n       ``Most of the other guys have green lights only after \n     penetration. We want to get it inside and dish it out for the \n     square-up three.''\n       That job generally falls to point guard Richardson, a 6-2 \n     senior averaging 31.5 points per game. McCullough, a 6-4 \n     sophomore, scores about 15.8 points per game.\n       Garrett's success in basketball--the girls' team also is \n     doing well at 9-2--has come despite some problems that are \n     unique to the school, known as Garrett Academy of Technology. \n     Garrett reopened as a technical school four years ago after \n     the old Garrett High was closed.\n       Garrett draws students from all over Charleston County, \n     which makes it hard for some players to make it to practices \n     and games. For example, Gibbs, a 6-4 senior, lives in \n     McClellanville, about an hour's drive from the school.\n       And Bayne said many athletes who already have played sports \n     for another school are reluctant to leave that school for \n     Garrett. He said nine of his 12 players had never played \n     organized basketball before they got to Garrett.\n       ``A lot of kids who would like to play sports at Garrett \n     are unable to, because they don't have a way home,'' Bayne \n     said. ``And we only have two players that have played at \n     another school.\n       ``A lot of kids feel a loyalty to a team they've already \n     played for, so we are trying to teach a system to kids that \n     have never played on an organized team before.''\n       With the High School League due to reclassify member \n     schools soon, Garrett has applied to move down to Class A \n     from AA, Bayne said.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words \nabout Jules and Helen Rabin who are long-time, respected Vermonters. \nMarcelle and I are proud to call them our friends. The Rabins exhibit \nwhat so many Vermonters have: a sense of what is valuable and important \nin life. With hard work, dedication, and a great deal of patience, \nJules and Helen have built up a successful family bakery, serving the \nneeds of their community. Over the last 20 years they have become \nmasters of their craft. Recently, one of our local newspapers wrote an \nexcellent article about the Rabins and their bakery. I ask that the \narticle be printed in the Record so that all Senators may read about \nthis fine family.\n  The article follows.\n\n   [From the Rutland Herald and the Sunday Times Argus, Mar. 8, 1998]\n\nIn Search of Sourdough--A Vermont Baker Sets Out to Find--and Make--the \n                              Perfect Loaf\n\n                          (By Kathleen Hentcy)\n\n       When you bite into sourdough bread, your teeth meet with a \n     worthy substance: Crackling hard crust, the bread inside \n     chewy almost to the point of toughness, a sour tang. And once \n     you've chewed and swallowed a few times, a satisfaction that \n     few other breads deliver.\n       Real bread, for my money or effort, must meet this test. \n     And it must proudly withstand toasting and slathering with \n     sweet butter, not in the least smashed, or lessened in its \n     big-holed texture. It should produce a clean crunch when \n     bitten, and when chewed, remain substantial food, not melting \n     into a gooey mash.\n       Overall, bread must take effort to cut, and time to chew \n     and digest. It must, truly, be the ``staff of life.''\n       But buying good sourdough bread can eat up the grocery \n     budget; the loaves typically cost more than $3 each. Besides, \n     I find baking bread to be an almost spiritual experience. And \n     eating fine bread that you made yourself, listening to \n     friends' compliments, is gratifying.\n       I've baked bread since my teen years. Some of what I make \n     is outstanding. Some loaves I give to the sheep.\n       Lately, I've returned to baking sourdough. Sourdough, made \n     with only the wild yeasts that choose to set up home in a \n     culture of water and flour you provide, is wild, unruly \n     bread, its flavor distinctive to the region where it is made. \n     You don't know how the bread dough will behave from baking to \n     baking, since the leavening agent--the sourdough--is very \n     sensitive to atmospheric conditions and room temperature. \n     From my experience, I'd say the baker's temperament is \n     included under ``atmospheric conditions'' and can greatly \n     influence the outcome.\n       I've made attempts at sourdough breads before, keeping a \n     liquid starter in the refrigerator for months. I'd use it for \n     a while, then forget about it and later find a dried-up mass \n     that I'd have to throw out, jar and all. But the loaves I \n     made from those starters never compared to the bread I \n     found at the local food coop.\n\n\n                        the search gets serious\n\n       Last fall, I was bitten by a new ambition: To bake the \n     ultimate ``peasant bread.'' Sourdough French country bread. \n     Pain de Campagne. Those lordly loaves with chestnut-brown \n     crusts that crackle, the trademark large-textured chewy \n     centers, and the sour tang.\n       This bread, and all French sourdough, is made using a \n     doughy sourdough starter rather than a liquid. Once the \n     starter is prepared and a batch of dough is made up, the \n     baker takes off about a cup of dough--called levain, from the \n     old French word for rise, or leaven--to store in the \n     refrigerator. That piece, allowed to warm to room temperature \n     and refreshed with flour and water, provides the basis for \n     the next batch of bread, and so on as long as the baker \n     doesn't forget to take the levain from subsequent batches.\n       Can making that bread be difficult enough to warrant a \n     price of $3 a loaf? If peasants baked these glorious loaves \n     in wood-fired ovens with no refrigeration for the starter, \n     surely I ought to be able to figure this out. Look at the \n     ingredients: flour, salt, water. Some note ``sourdough,'' \n     which, technically, is only more of the first and last \n     ingredients, flour and water. Adding commercial yeast to \n     sourdough is sacrilege.\n       So I got out my bread books, and read about sourdough. I \n     read magazine stories about sourdough. I bought many loaves \n     of sourdough made by several different Vermont bakeries. I \n     made sourdough starter and baked loaves of bread on a baking \n     stone. I didn't feed it to the sheep, but I didn't give it to \n     friends, either.\n       I went back to the books, and finally, to two bakers nearby \n     who make five wonderful kinds of sourdough. I'll tell you \n     what I learned up front: good sourdough bread is definitely \n     worth $3 a loaf. But baking it is worth more.\n\n\n                             in the bakery\n\n       In a small building in the backyard of Helen and Jules \n     Rabin's house, the Rabins continue the tradition of baking \n     the community bread. Helen pulls large hunks of dough off a \n     slouching 75-pound mass on the wooden counter. She places \n     each chunk on a scale and adds enough to make the scale level \n     out at one and three-quarter pounds, then drops the measured \n     blob onto the counter, and starts the process anew. Once she \n     has six or so lumps of dough, she kneads them one by one, \n     shaping them into slender loaves about eight inches long. \n     These are ``French white sourdough,'' or batards, the \n     shorter, fatter version of the popular baguette. In little \n     more than an hour, she will have weighted and shaped 65 \n     batards.\n       Helen and Jules have done this work nearly every week, two \n     days a week, for 20 years. While she mills the grains, mixes \n     the dough and forms the loaves, he builds the fire that heats \n     the oven and eventually bakes the bread.\n       The Rabins began baking bread in 1978, shortly after Jules \n     was laid off from his job teaching anthropology at Goddard \n     College in Plainfield. Five years earlier, after visiting \n     friends who were trying to recreate the lives of 19th-century \n     peasants in the south of France, the Rabins decided to build \n     a massive stone wood-fired oven like those that once dotted \n     the European continent.\n       The Rabins' oven is large enough to bake 250 loaves a day. \n     They bake two days a week, producing 500 loaves out of 750 \n     pounds of dough. When they started making sourdough bread, \n     they had no competition.\n       ``We had an easy ride when we began--people around here had \n     not had such bread,'' Jules says. That meant when they \n     delivered their first loaves, which were dense, unrisen and \n     hard, people still snapped them up. The taste was good, and \n     slowly the texture improved.\n\n\n                          A few secrets found\n\n       ``It took over five years to develop our loaves,'' Jules \n     told me during an earlier visit. This gave me great hope. \n     These people, who routinely make excellent sourdough bread, \n     had once produced loaves similar to what I started with.\n       ``Sourdough is very tricky stuff to work with,'' Jules \n     said, making me feel even better. ``To get even, well-raised \n     loaves is very difficult with sourdough.''\n       But did they seek out instruction in books or from other \n     bakers? No. They figured it out themselves.\n       ``We set ours elves the challenge to bake without yeast,'' \n     he said.\n       The Rabins got their ideal for the kind of bread they \n     wanted from European breads, and Helen once spent a night in \n     a French bakery, watching. But she received no instructions.\n       ``We fiddled and mixed to arrive at what we have today,'' \n     Jules said. He credits Helen with all the brain work in the \n     operation, from building the oven to figuring out how long \n     the bread should rise.\n       And so, on a mild March day, I stand inside the bakery, \n     careful to stay out of the way, and watch, much as I imagine \n     Helen watched those French bakers many years ago. I'm allowed \n     questions, but I avoid direct queries regarding the secrets \n     of sourdough. Not only are the Rabins offering Upland Bakers \n     for sale, and so have to protect their system, but I want to \n     figure out at least some of this process for myself.\n       My time with the Rabins revealed two important lessons. The \n     first is that baking good sourdough requires time. Let the \n     levain warm for a few days after refreshing it, and before \n     mixing the dough. Then, allow the dough to rise for four to \n     six hours, punch it down and form the loaves, and allow those \n     to rise for another four to six hours. The variation in \n     rising times has to do with those atmospheric conditions, and \n     you will know only by trial and error when to bake at four \n     hours and when to wait for six.\n       The other important detail I learned is that sourdough does \n     not have to be babied like yeasted bread dough. The risen \n     loaves can be picked up and placed on the baking surface \n     without worrying about flattening them. Go ahead and slash \n     the tops deeply, to allow the loaf to expand as the hard \n     crust develops.\n       These may sound like trivial details, but on my counter \n     this morning sit the two best loaves of sourdough I have made \n     to date. I haven't yet developed quite the sour tang I like, \n     but the texture and volume of the loaves is beautiful. Toast \n     and tea this morning was especially pleasing.\n       And the Rabins ``refreshed'' this lesson for me: Having the \n     answer as quickly as possible isn't always best. Sometimes \n     it's the process of looking that is the most fun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3949-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3949-S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CBO COST ESTIMATE FOR THE IRS RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. ROTH.

William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2676, the \n     Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are John R. \n     Righter (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-2860, \n     Marc Nicole (for the impact on state and local governments), \n     who can be reached at 225-3220, and Matthew Eyles (for the \n     impact on the private sector), who can be reached at 226-\n     2469.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n       CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, APRIL 30, 1998\n\n  H.R. 2676: Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n1998 (As Reported by the Senate Committee on Finance on April 22, 1998)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       H.R. 2676 would make a number of changes to the management \n     and oversight of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), add or \n     amend more than 70 taxpayer rights, and require the IRS to \n     implement several changes designed to increase the number of \n     forms filed electronically by taxpayers. The Joint Committee \n     on Taxation (JCT) estimates that this act would increase \n     governmental receipts (revenues) by $582 million in fiscal \n     year 1998 and would decrease receipts by a net amount of \n     about $1 billion over the 1998-2003 period. (The act would \n     result in higher receipts for the first three years, but \n     would lead to a gradually increasing loss of receipts in each \n     year after 2000.) Over the 1998-2007 period, JCT estimates \n     that enacting this legislation would decrease governmental \n     receipts by about $9 billion.\n       In addition, CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2676 would \n     increase direct spending by $7 million in fiscal year 1998, \n     about $330 million over the 1998-2003 period, and about $750 \n     million over the 1998-2008 period. Because enacting this \n     legislation would affect both direct spending and receipts, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. H.R. 2676 also would \n     affect discretionary spending, subject to the availability of \n     funds. At this time, CBO cannot estimate the act's total \n     effect on discretionary spending because the extent and \n     results of efforts by the Treasury and the IRS under current \n     law to increase the availability and use of electronic filing \n     by taxpayers are very uncertain, because the Administration \n     has already begun implementing many of the act's procedures, \n     and because we have not had sufficient time to fully review \n     the more than 70 provisions that would affect taxpayer \n     rights. The increase in discretionary spending necessary to \n     implement H.R. 2676 could be substantial. JCT has determined \n     that H.R. 2676 contains five new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA). \n     Title V of H.R. 2676, Revenue Provisions, contains all five \n     mandates. JCT estimates that the cost to the private sector \n     to comply with the new mandates would be $7.1 billion over \n     the 1998-2003 period, which is equal to the increase in tax \n     revenue from provisions that would impose the mandates. \n     The act contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n\n\n                    DESCRIPTION OF MAJOR PROVISIONS\n\n       H.R. 2676 would make a number of changes to the management \n     and oversight of the IRS and to the rights of taxpayers. \n     Specifically, the act would: establish a nine-member Internal \n     Revenue Service Oversight Board within the Department of the \n     Treasury to oversee the service's management, planning, \n     budgeting, and operations; provide the IRS with the \n     flexibility to reorganize its organizational structure and \n     many of its personnel policies; eliminate the IRS Office of \n     the Chief Inspector and transfer most of its responsibilities \n     and resources to a new, independent Treasury Inspector \n     General for Tax Administration within the Department of the \n     Treasury; require the IRS to begin developing a paperless tax \n     return system and authorize it to offer certain incentives to \n     encourage taxpayers to file tax returns electronically; \n     require the IRS, subject to the proper safeguards, to create \n     a system under which taxpayers could review their own IRS \n     files electronically by calendar year 2007; add or amend more \n     than 70 provisions affecting taxpayer rights, including \n     shifting the burden from the taxpayer to the IRS in certain \n     court cases, making it easier for taxpayers to recover court \n     costs and to sue the IRS for civil damages, increasing the \n     amount of interest paid by the federal government to \n     noncorporate taxpayers for overpayments of taxes, suspending \n     the time limit for disabled individuals to file for a refund, \n     and requiring that the IRS provide additional notification to \n     taxpayers of certain rights and deadlines; impose several new \n     reporting requirements on the IRS and JCT; clarify employer \n     deductions for vacation pay and add other measures to raise \n     governmental receipts and partially offset the cost of other \n     provisions; and make numerous technical corrections to the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 2676 is shown in \n     Table 1. The costs of this act fall within budget function \n     800 (general government).\n\n                              TABLE 1--ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT \\1\\\n                                     [By fiscal year in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1998         1999         2000         2001         2002         2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues................          582          814          654         -663       -1,052       -1,328\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            7           55           62           66           69           73\nEstimated Outlays.................            7           55           63           66           69           73\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Implementing the act would also require increases in spending subject to appropriation, but CBO cannot\n  estimate these costs at this time.\n\n       In addition to the above effects, the act also would impose \n     costs on the IRS and JCT, subject to the availability of \n     funds, to carry out various requirements. Those increases--\n     for the IRS only--would probably be substantial, but CBO \n     cannot estimate the act's likely effect on discretionary \n     spending at this time. The major provisions that could affect \n     discretionary spending are discussed in detail below.\n\n\n                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE\n\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 2676 \n     will be enacted by July 1, 1998.\n     Revenues\n       H.R. 2676 would make numerous changes to the Internal \n     Revenue Code.

Most of the projected increase in direct \n     spending would result from the provision that would increase \n     by 1 percentage point the amount paid by the federal \n     government to noncorporate taxpayers who overpay their taxes. \n     Based on our estimate of the amount of annual overpayments by \n     taxpayers of individual income, estate, and gift taxes, CBO \n     estimates that increasing the rate of interest by 1 percent\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n     would increase direct spending by $7 million in fiscal year \n     1998, by $310 million over the 1998-2003 period, and by about \n     $700 million over the 1998-2008 period.\n       Taxpayer Bill of Rights. The act would increase the amount \n     of penalties (payments covering attorneys' fees and \n     administrative costs) and civil damages that courts could \n     award to taxpayers in certain cases brought against the \n     federal government. For penalties, H.R. 2676 would: (1) \n     lengthen the period of time over which taxpayers who \n     substantially prevail against the IRS could recover \n     administrative costs, (2) remove the hourly rate caps \n     limiting the amount of reasonable fees that attorneys can \n     collect in such cases, (3) permit the award of reasonable \n     attorneys' fees to pro bono attorneys, and (4) allow \n     taxpayers to recover reasonable costs and attorneys' fees in \n     cases where an offer to settle the case is made, the IRS \n     rejects the offer, and the IRS later obtains a judgment \n     against the taxpayer in an amount that is equal to or less \n     than the taxpayer's offer.\n       For civil damages, that act would: (1) provide for the \n     payment of up to $100,000 in civil damages to taxpayers in \n     cases where a court finds that officers or employees of the \n     IRS negligently disregarded provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code or regulations, (2) provide for the payment of \n     up to $1 million in civil damages to taxpayers in cases where \n     an office or employee of the IRS willfully violates certain \n     provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and (2) allow individuals \n     other than the taxpayer to sue for civil damages as a result \n     of unauthorized collection actions. Courts could award the \n     damages only after the taxpayer had exhausted all \n     administrative remedies at the IRS. Under current law, \n     taxpayers may receive payments for damages in cases where a \n     court finds that an IRS officer or employee has recklessly or \n     intentionally disregarded provisions of the Internal Revenue \n     Code. The government would pay the additional penalties and \n     damages from the permanent, indefinite appropriation for \n     claims and judgments.\n       Although considerable uncertainty exists as to how the \n     courts would determine and award penalties and damages under \n     H.R. 2676, CBO estimates that the provisions would increase \n     direct spending by $23 million over the 1998-2003 period and \n     by $56 million over the 1998-2008 period. This estimate \n     assumes that broadening and increasing the amount of \n     allowable penalties and lowering the standard for civil \n     damages would result in awards of additional penalties and \n     damages to taxpayers by the courts. Because the provisions \n     affecting penalties would not take effect until 180 days \n     after enactment and because the provisions affecting damages \n     would apply to new actions and would require taxpayers to \n     first exhaust administrative remedies, CBO expects that these \n     provisions initially would have no significant impact on \n     direct spending, but would result in a steady increase in \n     penalties and damages awarded beginning in 1999. On average, \n     we estimate that they would increase direct spending by about \n     $4 million annually over the 1998-2003 period.\n     Spending Subject to Appropriation\n       Electronic Filing. The act's biggest potential impact on \n     discretionary spending involves its requirements to increase \n     the availability and use of electronic filing. H.R. 2676 \n     would generally require the IRS to study and implement \n     several major changes to the way taxpayers file their returns \n     each year. Specifically, the act would: (1) require the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to develop a strategic plan to \n     eliminate barriers and provide incentives to increase the \n     number of returns filed electronically to at least 80 \n     percent of all returns, (2) beginning in fiscal year 2000, \n     extend the due date for electronic filers of information \n     returns from February 28 to March 31, (3) require the \n     Treasury to develop procedures for accepting signature \n     information from electronic filers in a digital or other \n     electronic form, (4) require the Treasury to develop \n     procedures for implementing a return-free tax system \n     beginning with tax years that begin after 2007, and (5) \n     provided the necessary safeguards are in place, require \n     the Treasury to develop procedures to enable taxpayers to \n     review their account information electronically by 2007.\n       The Treasury is already developing or studying most of \n     these proposals. For instance, according to the Department of \n     the Treasury, the IRS currently is using some signature \n     alternatives and studying others. The Treasury also has \n     already awarded a contract to design and develop a large \n     educational campaign to encourage taxpayers to file \n     electronically. In addition, the IRS is implementing new \n     payment methods and preparing its systems to accept new forms \n     that should reduce the amount of paper filed by taxpayers \n     each year. Finally, the Treasury is studying alternatives for \n     allowing taxpayers to eventually review account information \n     electronically. This, even though CBO expects that \n     implementing the act's procedures would increase costs for \n     the Treasury subject to the availability of funds, we cannot \n     estimate the amount that such costs would increase. The \n     amount of the costs would depend, in part, on the overall \n     effort at the IRS to modernize its information systems, for \n     which the Congress has appropriated about $4 billion over the \n     last decade.\n       In general, receiving and processing forms electronically \n     should reduce costs of the IRS in the long run. The IRS has \n     estimated that it costs at least two and one-half times more \n     to process such forms by paper, since the data must be input \n     manually into IRS's systems, the error rate in processing \n     such forms is significantly higher, and the papers require \n     handling and storage. Thus, if enacting H.R. 2676 results in \n     an increase in the number of taxpayers that file \n     electronically with the IRS each year--in fiscal year 1997, \n     19.1 million of the estimated 120 million individual income \n     tax returns were filed with the IRS by computer or phone--\n     then the act should eventually reduce the government's annual \n     costs to process tax information.\n       IRS Oversight Board. H.R. 2676 would establish a nine-\n     member management board within the Department of the Treasury \n     to oversee the management and operations of the IRS. Its \n     responsibilities would include reviewing and approving the \n     agency's strategic plans and annual budget request. The board \n     would consist of six members from outside the federal \n     government, the Secretary of the Treasury, a union \n     representative, and the IRS Commissioner. The act would \n     compensate the nonfederal members at a rate of $30,000 per \n     year, except for the chair, who would receive an annual \n     salary of $50,000. The members also could receive \n     reimbursement for any travel expenses incurred in \n     performing official board work. In addition, the act would \n     allow the board to hire permanent staff. The board would \n     be required to meet at least once a quarter. Upon \n     enactment, the President would have six months to submit \n     nominations to the Senate.\n       Based on the act's requirements and specifications for \n     compensation, CBO estimates that the board would cost less \n     than $500,000 in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and between \n     $500,000 and $1 million in each of fiscal years 2000 through \n     2003. That estimate assumes the board would not meet until \n     the beginning of fiscal year 1999.\n       IRS Management and Personnel Flexibilities. The act would \n     allow the IRS to change its organizational structure and \n     would provide it with significant flexibility in how it \n     compensates, trains, and organizes its workforce. In January, \n     the Commissioner announced plans to reorganize the agency \n     along customer service lines. Because the act would simply \n     allow the IRS to carry out the reorganization plans that are \n     already under development, that provision would impose no \n     additional costs on the IRS. In the case of the personnel \n     flexibilities, the additional costs would likely be \n     significant, although it is difficult to predict how much the \n     IRS would employ such flexibilities and whether the \n     Commissioner could reach agreement with the employees' union, \n     as required by the legislation, regarding measures that would \n     affect its members.\n       CBO estimates that the measures allowing the IRS to \n     increase pay and other forms of compensation could increase \n     annual payroll costs of the IRS by at least several million \n     dollars. In addition, providing the IRS with the authority to \n     offer buyouts without necessarily reducing the total number \n     of positions through calendar year 2002 also could increase \n     its personnel costs by tens of millions of dollars over the \n     1998-2003 period.\n       Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The \n     legislation would eliminate the IRS Office of the Chief \n     Inspector and transfer most of its responsibilities and \n     resources to a new, independent Treasury Inspector General \n     (IG) for Tax Administration within the Department of the \n     Treasury. The new I.G. for Tax Administration would assume \n     responsibility for the duties currently assigned to the \n     Treasury (IG) with respect to the IRS and for the duties \n     currently delegated to the IRS Office of the Chief Inspector. \n     CBO estimates that this provision would have no significant \n     budgetary effect.\n       Taxpayer Bill of Rights. H.R. 2676 would add or amend more \n     than 70 taxpayer rights. In most cases, the new rights would \n     result in minimal additional costs for the IRS to write \n     regulations and procedures, provide additional information to \n     taxpayers, and create or amend tax forms and other tax-\n     related documents, although the sheer magnitude of the number \n     of such changes would likely result in a significant increase \n     in administrative costs, particularly if the changes would \n     require a significant computer reprogramming effort on the \n     part of the IRS. Similarly, the totality of such changes \n     could result in a substantial increase in the workload of \n     the offices of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS. \n     CBO, however, has not had sufficient time to review these \n     provisions and estimate their impact.\n       Complexity Analyses and Studies. H.R. 2676 would expand the \n     responsibilities of the JCT. It would require JCT to prepare \n     a detailed ``Tax Complexity Analysis'' for proposed \n     legislation amending tax laws and to conduct two studies \n     within one year from the date of enactment. The act also \n     would require the IRS to report annually to the House \n     Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on \n     Finance regarding sources of complexity in the administration \n     of federal tax laws and the Department of the Treasury to \n     conduct the same pair of studies required of JCT.\n       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 2676 would cost JCT \n     less than $500,000 a year, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts. Depending upon the amount and nature of \n     tax legislation considered by the Congress, analyzing the \n     complexity of legislative initiatives could increase this \n     cost somewhat. In addition, CBO estimates that requiring the \n     IRS to report annually on the complexity of tax laws would \n     cost less than $500,000 a year. Finally, CBO estimates that \n     the two reporting requirements would cost the Treasury less \n     than $500,000 over fiscal\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\n     years 1998 and 1999. (The Administration is already planning \n     to conduct at least one of the studies.)\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985 specifies procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending and receipts. The projected changes in direct \n     spending and receipts are shown in the following table for \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2008. For purposes of enforcing \n     pay-as-you-go procedures, however, only the effects in the \n     current year, the budget year, and the succeeding four years \n     are counted.\n\n                                              TABLE 3.--SUMMARY OF EFFECTS ON DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS\n                                                        [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1998       1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays.............          7         55         63         66         69         73         77         80         84         88         92\nChanges in receipts............        582        814        654       -663     -1,052     -1,328     -1,713     -1,908     -2,080     -2,269         NA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nN.A.=Not available (JCT has estimated revenue effects through 2007 only.)\n\n        ESTIMATED IMPACT ON STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS\n\n       H.R. 2676 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments. The bill would allow the IRS to collect and \n     remit (from overpayments) certain past-due income tax \n     obligations owed to state governments and would authorize \n     grants for low-income taxpayer clinics operated by \n     institutions of higher education (public or private) and tax-\n     exempt organizations.\n\n\n                 ESTIMATED IMPACT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n\n       JCT has determined that H.R. 2676 contains five new \n     private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA. Title V of the \n     act, Revenue Provisions, contains all five mandates. JCT \n     estimates that the cost to the private sector to comply with \n     the new mandates would be $7.1 billion over the 1998-2003 \n     period, which is equal to the increase in tax revenue from \n     provisions that would impose the mandates.\n       First, the provision clarifying the deduction for deferred \n     compensation is estimated by JCT to increase tax revenue by \n     $3.3 billion over fiscal years 1998 through 2003. Second, the \n     act would change the carryback period and carryforward period \n     for foreign tax credits, which is estimated to increase tax \n     revenue by $2.3 billion between 1998 and 2003. Third, H.R. \n     2676 would freeze the grandfathered status of stapled or \n     paired-share real estate investment trusts (REITs). As a \n     result of the proposed freeze, JCT estimates that tax revenue \n     would increase by $34 million over the 1998-2003 period. \n     Fourth, the act would make certain trade receivables \n     ineligible for mark-to-market treatment, which is estimated \n     to increase tax revenue by $1.4 billion over the six-year \n     period. Finally, H.R. 2676 would add vaccines against \n     rotavirus to the list of taxable vaccines, thus increasing \n     tax revenue by an estimated $15 million over fiscal years \n     1998 through 2003.\n\n\n                    COMPARISON WITH OTHER ESTIMATES\n\n       The committee report filed on April 22, 1998, included an \n     estimate by JCT that enacting H.R. 2676 would increase direct \n     spending by $409 million over the 1998-2002 period and by \n     $989 million over the 1998-2007 period. According to JCT, \n     that estimate would result from enacting three provisions \n     affecting taxpayer rights: (1) increasing by 1 percent the \n     interest rate paid by the government to noncorporate \n     taxpayers who overpay their taxes, (2) expanding the court's \n     authority to award taxpayers costs and certain fees, and (3) \n     adding or increasing civil damages for certain collection \n     actions by the IRS.\n       By comparison, CBO estimates that enacting the three \n     provisions would increase direct spending by $260 million \n     over the 1998-2002 period and by $662 million over the 1998-\n     2007 period. In total, CBO's estimate of the increase in \n     direct spending is about $150 million lower than JCT's over \n     the 1998-2002 period and about $330 million lower over the \n     1998-2007 period. The difference between JCT and CBO \n     estimates results from three factors. First, according to \n     JCT, part of its estimated increase in direct spending \n     includes effects on revenues (about $110 million over the \n     1998-2002 period and about $220 million over the 1998-2007 \n     period). Second, JCT and CBO have different estimates of the \n     extent to which the provision expanding the court's authority \n     to award taxpayers costs and certain fees would increase \n     payments from the Claims and Judgment Fund. JCT estimates an \n     additional $55 million in such payments over the 1998-2002 \n     period and about an additional $150 million over the 1998-\n     2007 period. Finally, JCT and CBO make different assumptions \n     as to the taxes that would be affected by the provision \n     increasing the rate of interest on overpayments. CBO assumes \n     that the provision would apply to estate and gift tax \n     overpayments in addition to individual income tax payments, \n     which increased our estimate of direct spending by about $20 \n     million over the 1998-2002 period and by about $40 million \n     over the 1998-2007 period.\n\n\n                         previous cbo estimate\n\n       On October 31, 1997, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n     Act of 1997, as ordered reported by the House Committee on \n     Ways and Means on October 22, 1997. For the House version of \n     H.R. 2676, JCT estimated that the legislation would have no \n     net effect on governmental receipts over the 1998-2002 period \n     and would decrease them by $2.9 billion over the 1998-2007 \n     period.\n       The Senate version of H.R. 2676 includes several additional \n     measures that would add to the government's revenues, but \n     also includes a more extensive set of new and revised \n     taxpayer rights. In total, JCT estimates that the Senate \n     version would bring in about $0.3 billion more in revenues \n     over the 1998-2002 period, but would decrease governmental \n     receipts by about $6 billion more over the 1998-2007 period.\n       CBO estimated that enacting the House-reported version of \n     H.R. 2676 would increase direct spending by $5 million in \n     fiscal year 1998, $25 million over the 1998-2002 period, and \n     $50 million over the 1998-2007 period. CBO's estimate of the \n     increase in direct spending for the Senate version of H.R. \n     2676 is higher, mostly because we reestimated and \n     reclassified the budgetary effects of several provisions \n     included by JCT as decreases in governmental receipts for the \n     House version of H.R. 2676. Thus, the increase in direct \n     spending estimated by CBO for the Senate version is more than \n     offset by a corresponding reduction in JCT's estimate of \n     reduced governmental receipts. The increase in the rate of \n     interest on taxpayer overpayments is the main provision \n     projected to cause an increase in direct spending in this \n     estimate rather than a decrease in governmental receipts, as \n     was reported for the House version.\n       In addition, the House version would have required that the \n     Secretary make $3 million in annual grants to low-income \n     taxpayer clinics, whereas the Senate version would make such \n     payments subject to appropriation.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \n50th anniversary of the State of Israel, and the enduring, unshakable \nfriendship that has been built between the United States and Israel \nduring those 50 years.\n  Fifty years ago today, according to the Hebrew calendar, David Ben-\nGurion told the world that the State of Israel was born. In that \nmoment, one of the greatest events in the life of the Jewish people \ntook place. Since the Jewish people were expelled from their ancient \nhomeland nearly 2,000 years ago, the desire to return had remained in \nthe hearts and prayers of Jews throughout the world.\n  In the early decades of this century, the Zionist movement brought \nthousands of young, idealist Jews back to Palestine, which was at the \ntime controlled by the Turks, and then the British. They returned to \nthe land, establishing kibbutzim and agricultural settlements, and \nreinvigorated ancient cities. They built the foundations for a state, \njoined during and after the Holocaust by other Jewish immigrants, \nfleeing unprecedented persecution.\n  Supported by Jewish communities around the world, their efforts, and \nthe burning need for a Jewish homeland, were recognized by the United \nNations in the Partition Plan of November 29, 1947, which called for \nthe creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. Six months, \nlater, on May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was formally established.\n  Much like the United States, Israel is a nation of immigrants. The \nestablishment of Israel has provided a home and refuge for more than \n2.6 million immigrants since its inception. They came to escape \npersecution, to build a better life, or simply to participate in the \nrebuilding of a nation.\n  Jews from every continent and dozens of countries, speaking nearly \nevery language on earth, have returned to their ancient homeland: from \nRussia fleeing first pogroms and then Communism; from Germany, Austria, \nPoland, Hungry, Romania, and Czechoslovakia fleeing the Holocaust; from \nIraq, Syria, Yemen, and North Africa fleeing Arab anti-Zionism; from \nIran fleeing the Ayatollahs; and from Latin America fleeing cruel \nmilitary regimes.\n  In the 1990's Israel has seen the largest wave of immigration in its \nhistory. 757,000 immigrants, some 700,000 of them leaving behind the \nchaos of the former Soviet Union, and 14,000 of whom were rescued in \none day in a daring airlift from Ethiopia. Israel has served as a model \nfor ethnic diversity as Jews from all parts of the world have ascended \nto the highest levels of the public and the private sector.\n  Within minutes of Israel's founding in 1948, President Harry Truman \nrecognized the new state. But there was little time for celebration, \nbecause within 24 hours, Israel was attacked by Arab forces from all \nsides. Immigrants who had just fled the horrors of the Holocaust were \ngiven guns and instructions to fight, in languages they did not \nunderstand.\n  In that desperate War of Independence, Israel lost nearly 1% of its \npopulation defending itself. But the military acumen and spirit of \nsacrifice that made that victory possible presaged the building of the \nIsrael Defense Forces--a true citizen army--into one of the world's \nmost respected militaries. In subsequent wars when Israel's survival \nwas threatened--in 1956, 1967, and 1973, Israel fought off seemingly \ninsurmountable odds to retain its statehood.\n\n  As spelled out in its Declaration of Independence, the state was \nformed adhering to democratic and Jewish values, recognizing the \nfreedom of all individuals who reside within it. Israel's vibrant \ndemocratic system embodies many of the same values that America holds \nso dear, including: the separation of powers; concern for human rights; \nan independent judiciary; a representative parliament (the Knesset) \nwith 11 political parties representing Jews, Arabs, Christians, Druze, \nmen and women; a free press with the highest percentage of newspapers \nand readers per capita in the world; an average of 80% voter turnout in \nnational elections; and, guaranteed civil liberties.\n  Over the years, the United States and Israel have built a deep and \nmulti-faceted friendship. Based on common values of democracy and \npeace, and backed by the United States' ironclad commitment to help \nIsrael safeguard its security, the U.S.-Israel relationship is poised \nto develop into an even more intimate one in Israel's next 50 years.\n  In science and technology, trade, culture, and of course, security \ncooperation, the ties grow deeper every year. Most recently Israel and \nthe U.S. have moved to deepen their defense cooperation by expanding \nthe Arrow anti-missile program, developing the Theater High Energy \nLaser designed to defend\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nagainst Katyusha rockets, and by the U.S. providing $25 million for \nanti-terrorism assistance.\n  Thanks to the industriousness of its people, and with the help of \nAmerican financial assistance and free trade agreements with both the \nUnited States and the European Union, Israel has transformed itself \nfrom a small, agriculturally-based economy in a largely desert climate \ninto a modern, successful, high-tech economy.\n  Israel's industrial exports are today 1,380 times what they were 47 \nyears ago. Its Gross Domestic Product has risen from $2.5 billion in \nthe 1960s to $90.6 billion last year. Its computer industry and \nagricultural technology are some of the most successful and innovative \nin the world.\n  Israel has also seen phenomenal growth in health care and education. \nMore than 33% of Israelis have formal schooling of 13 years compared \nfrom 6% in the 1960's and the life expectancy of Israelis is among the \nlongest in the world. It is a sign of Israel's economic maturation that \nin January of this year, Israel and the United States began to discuss \nproposals to reduce and phase out U.S. economic aid to Israel.\n  For Israel's long-term security and economic success, there is no \nhigher priority than the achievement of a permanent peace settlement \nwith all of its neighbors. The peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and \nJordan in 1994 were the first steps in that process. The United States \nhas stood by Israel in its desire to achieve peace with its neighbors, \nand will continue to work to help Israel achieve peace with Syria, \nLebanon, other Arab nations, and, perhaps most urgently, to fulfill the \npromise of the handshake between the late Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser \nArafat on the White House lawn in 1993 by achieving a final peace \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  For all of us who care so deeply for Israel's security, who long to \nsee Israel achieve peace with its neighbors, the current peace process \nhas reached a critical juncture. Since Israel's security can best be \nguaranteed by peace between it and its neighbors, the United States \nmust remain prepared to do everything we can to help reach a successful \nconclusion to this peace process. That is the best 50th birthday \npresent we can give the people of Israel.\n  On this historic occasion, I would like to offer my utmost \ncongratulations to President Weizman, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the \npeople they represent, and express my deep admiration for the \naccomplishments of the State and people of Israel, a nation that has \nrisen from the darkest moments of history to rebuild itself as an \nexample of the capabilities of the human spirit, the unbreakable ties \nthat exist among a people, and the great justice of democracy. May \nIsrael's next 50 years bring it even greater success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3954-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAELI INDEPENDENCE\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we are celebrating one of \nthe greatest achievements of the twentieth century--the founding of the \nstate of Israel. I rise to congratulate the people of Israel for a half \ncentury of independence--and to look forward to a future of peace and \nprosperity.\n  The story of Israel is unique. A people forced into exile, who \nendured centuries of persecution, rebuilt their ancient homeland. They \nforged a nation where they could practice their ancient faith and \ntraditions. They created an open and free democratic society. And \nalways, they offer a home to Jewish immigrants from around the world.\n  The founding of Israel followed the most incomprehensible and evil \nevent of the twentieth century, when the Nazis--with the complicity of \nso many others--sought to exterminate a people. The survivors of the \nHolocaust helped to build modern Israel. Never again will the Jewish \npeople be dependent on anyone else for their security.\n  At first Israelis envisioned an agrarian society. But today, Israel \nis a center for technology and science. American scientists and \nengineers are working as partners with Israelis to develop the \ninnovations of the next century. Our great federal laboratories, like \nthe National Institutes of Health, are now working with Israeli \nscientists on a cure for cancer and other deadly diseases.\n  America's relationship with Israel is also unique. We share common \ngoals, values and interests. We stand by each other in good times and \nbad.\n  Israel has had to endure five wars and live in constant readiness for \nbattle. They live with the constant threat of terrorism. America must \ncontinue to stand by Israel--to make sure they have what they need to \nprotect themselves. We must also stand by them in stopping their \nenemies from developing the weapons of mass destruction--and the \nmissiles to deliver these deadly weapons.\n  We all hope that the next century will bring peace to Israel and its \nneighbors. Five years ago, we witnessed the famous handshakes on the \nWhite House lawn. These handshakes heralded a new commitment toward \npeace.\n  The peace process is now stalled. There is a crisis of confidence and \na lack of trust. There has been a lot of finger-pointing about who is \nto blame. But let's remember how much Israel has given up for peace. \nLet's remember the Sinai and Hebron. No victorious power has ever given \nup more for peace.\n  Mr. President: I salute the people of Israel as they celebrate fifty \nyears of independence, and I look forward to a future of peace, \nprosperity and friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3955-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3955-S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in recognition of the warm bonds of \naffection that exist between the people of Israel and the people of the \nUnited States, and the enduring friendship that unites our two nations, \nI rise today to congratulate the State of Israel on the 50th \nAnniversary of its birth as an independent nation.\n  Mr. President, no people in the world have more in common with \nAmericans than the people of Israel. No two nations are more committed \nto freedom, to justice, and to peace than Israel and the United States.\n  As nations of immigrants, we cherish our common culture and honor the \nrich traditions that make us one. We revere our families, nourish our \nfaith, and never hesitate to make sacrifices in the present if they \nwill secure a better future for our children.\n  As such, we make loyal friends and determined adversaries--as both \nour friends and our foes around the world have learned throughout the \nyears.\n  Mr. President, those shared values and similar heritage have made us \nmore than fellow democracies. They've made us fast friends, valued \ntrading partners, and strategic allies. And I pray that nothing ever \nhappens to change that relationship.\n  These things were never clearer to me than they were when I visited \nIsrael last year. It was, in fact, my first foreign visit as a member \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. What I learned and saw there \nwill remain with me for the rest of my life.\n  Together with my wife, Karyn, I visited Jericho, Haifa and Tel Aviv. \nI traveled to the Golan Heights, spent a night on a kibbutz, and stood \non the shores of the Sea of Galilee. I met with diplomats and military \nleaders, visited industries and hospitals, and throughout it all I was \nexcited by Israel's economy and impressed with its commitment to \ntechnological excellence.\n  But my most memorable moments had nothing to do with international \npolitics or diplomacy. They came from my contact with a people whose \nspirit is as strong and unshakable as the 3,000 years of history that \nlies beneath every step one takes in that holy land.\n  Mr. President, in preparing for my trip to Israel, and especially to \nJerusalem, I read a lot about its topography, its history, its climate, \nand its culture. But nothing prepared me for its incomparable beauty. \nIt is a place whose sights and melodies permeate your being and leave \nan indelible mark on your soul.\n  After experiencing it first-hand, it is not at all hard to imagine \nwhy this 3,000-year-old link--unmatched in all of history--exists \nbetween a place and a people, and why--even through centuries of war, \noppression, exile and dispersion--that link has never been severed.\n  But Israel is much more than its collected history, as the last five \ndecades\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nhave decidedly proven. It is a demonstration of what can be \naccomplished when a people are determined to overcome every obstacle to \nfreedom and self-determination. Although young--50 years is but a \nmoment in the long history of the Jewish people--Israel is today a \nvibrant, thriving democracy whose achievements in science, technology, \nagriculture, industry, and trade are a match for any nation centuries \nolder.\n  Yet while the land of Israel is the land of the Jewish people, it is \nalso the land of us all--as the more than two and a half million \ntourists who visit Israel every year will attest. Few places on earth \nhave been as cherished and as loved by so many millions throughout the \nworld as the places of Israel. It is, as one writer described it, ``a \nsymphony of voices, heard by all the people of the world.''\n  Today, Mr. President, I know all those whose hearts have been touched \nby the music of Israel, join me in wishing her well. Together, we \ncongratulate her on her remarkable achievements, we thank her for her \nfriendship, and we pray for the day when all who dwell within her \nboundaries will, as St. Augustine prayed,\n\n     ``. .  live in such delight,\n     such pleasure and such play\n     As that to them a thousand years\n     Doth seem as yesterday.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3955-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ISRAEL REACHES ITS 50TH YEAR RISING OUT OF THE ASHES OF WORLD WAR II\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, like the Phoenix, the nation of \nIsrael rose out of the ashes of the Holocaust 50 years ago and the 2000 \nyear search for a Jewish homeland ended. But, the birth of Israel was \nfar from easy on that day. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made his \nfirst radio broadcast from an air raid shelter as the precarious new \nnation came under immediate attack.\n  Israel's founding father took the time to remind the first citizens \nof Israel what had been accomplished and what it would take to defend \ntheir dream. Ben-Gurion said, ``whatever we have achieved is the result \nof the efforts of earlier generations no less than our own. It is also \nthe result of an unwavering fidelity to our precious heritage, the \nheritage of a small nation that has suffered much, but at the same time \nhas won for itself a special place in the history of mankind because of \nits spirit, faith, and vision.''\n  In January of this year, I went to Israel for an international \nconference of Jewish legislators from around the world. In our \ndiscussions of the faith that we shared and Israel's 50th anniversary, \nI saw and heard the achievements of the ``spirit, faith and vision'' of \nwhich David Ben-Gurion spoke. That same ethos that was also embraced by \nsuch visionary leaders as Moshe Dyan, Golda Meir, Menachem Begin and \nYitzhak Rabin has helped Israel become a dynamic democracy with a \nthriving economy. I came away from the conference secure in the \nknowledge that Israel's faith and fortitude remain as strong today as \nthey were when the dream was realized five decades ago.\n  I believe it is also important to acknowledge the role the United \nStates has played in the development of Israel over the past 50 years. \nPresident Harry S. Truman, the first head of state to grant Israel \ndiplomatic recognition, expressed its special place in the hearts of \nAmericans as he declared, ``I had faith in Israel before it was \nestablished, I have faith in it now. I believe it has a glorious future \nbefore it-not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of \nthe great ideals of our civilization.''\n  This special partnership which began with Israel's creation has been \nrepeatedly tested since 1948. The United States has been unwavering in \nour commitment to helping the people of Israel develop their own \neconomy and secure their own peace. We have helped give them the time \nthat their founding fathers knew would work in their favor. Mr. \nPresident, it is for these reasons that I was delighted to be a \ncosponsor of House Joint Resolution 102, which the Senate unanimously \npassed last night. The resolution acknowledges the 50th Anniversary of \nthe founding of the State of Israel and reaffirms the bonds of \nfriendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. This \nis a fitting tribute to the history of Israel and I am proud that today \nwe can celebrate this special, half century milestone together. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3956-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF ISRAEL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my honor today to offer my \ncongratulations to the State of Israel on the 50th anniversary of its \nindependence. I am a great supporter and admirer of our close friend \nand ally, and I am proud it has survived and prospered to see this \nmomentous day.\n  In 1948, the modern State of Israel was created as a symbol of hope \nfor the Jewish people--a people who had suffered through the horror and \npain of the Holocaust. We will never forget the terrible evil the Nazis \ninflicted on the world and we will always remember the dangers of \nignoring and appeasing fanatic leaders who climb the ladder by \ntrampling on the innocent.\n  What emerged from 3,000 years of persecution and the nightmare of the \nHolocaust is the greatest tribute to the perseverance of the Jewish \npeople, the State of Israel. Israel has persevered through war, through \nthe murder of its citizens by cowardly terrorists, and through the \nassassination of its leaders.\n  I am proud to say that the United States has helped Israel survive \nand become the strong nation it is today. The United States has a \nspecial relationship with Israel. As two of the world's leading \ndemocracies, we share many of the same values: promoting democracy, \npersonal freedom, and human rights throughout the world. We owe the \nIsraeli people our moral support, for weathering as a free state under \nthe most dangerous conditions. As Americans, we must admire their \ntenacious dedication to the principles of freedom articulated in our \nown country so long ago.\n  Fifty years ago, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, \nbroadcast this statement to the Israeli people:\n\n       Something unique occurred yesterday in Israel, and only \n     future generations will be able to evaluate the full \n     historical significance of the event. It is now up to all of \n     us, acting out of a sense of Jewish fraternity, to devote \n     every ounce of our strength to building and defending the \n     State of Israel, which still faces a titanic political and \n     military struggle.\n       Now is not the time for boasting. Whatever we have achieved \n     is the result of the efforts of earlier generations no less \n     than our own. It is also the result of unwavering fidelity to \n     our precious heritage, the heritage of a small nation that \n     has suffered much, but at the same time has won for itself a \n     special place in the history of mankind because of its \n     spirit, faith and vision.\n\n  To me, the spirit, faith and vision of the Israeli people is what \nmakes this celebration of Israel so special and remarkable. I \ncongratulate Israel on the 50th anniversary of its founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3956-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3956-S3957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \npeople of Israel and all my friends in the American Jewish community on \nthe occasion of the 50th anniversary of the creation of the State of \nIsrael.\n  This significant milestone in Israel's history offers all of us an \nopportunity to reflect on what makes that country so special. Israel \nremains the most important U.S. ally in the Middle East and the only \nmultiparty democracy in the region. The strong and stable friendship \nbetween our two countries, built on a solid foundation of shared \nvalues, mutual support and trust, is in the fundamental interest of \nboth nations. Ensuring the security of Israel will remain one of our \nmost important foreign policy priorities.\n  Transcending political considerations, however, are the profound ties \nwith Israel and pride in its accomplishments felt by Jews worldwide. \nThe State of Israel was created in the wake of the Holocaust and the \ntragic deaths of more than 6,000,000 Jews. Israeli society and its \ndemocratic institutions have been forged under the most difficult \nhistorical circumstances imaginable. Israel continues today to embody \nthe aspirations of Jews from the northernmost villages of the Newly \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union to the tip of South \nAmerica. The struggle of all Jews helped to create the State of Israel, \nand all Jews have reason to celebrate the country's 50th birthday.\n  It is my hope that Israel's next 50 years will see the establishment \nof a\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\npermanent and secure peace in the Middle East, with Israel and its Arab \nneighbors working together to build a better future for all the \ncitizens of the region.

Mr. President, there is a notable chorus of \nSenators congratulating the people of Israel and their government on \nthe occasion of the 50th anniversary of Israel's birth. There are few \nthings that have not been said on the subject of Israel--friend, ally, \ndemocracy. The Congress has spoken on countless occasions about \nJerusalem, our commitment to Israel's security, and to peace in the \nMiddle East.\n  In the end, however, all these expressions, as heartfelt as they are, \npale beside the real miracle of the Jewish people, in exile for 2000 \nyears, having returned to the land of Israel. And on that tiny piece of \nland, smaller than the State of New Jersey, an incredible nation has \nbeen built--a nation that has survived five wars, untold numbers of \nterrorist attacks, and the hostility of most of its neighbors.\n  Israel has absorbed millions of immigrants, providing homes, and \njobs, and schools and freedom. Year to year, day to day, Israel may not \nlook precisely like a land of milk and honey, but for the Jews of \nEurope who survived the Holocaust, and the Russians who survived \nCommunism, it is the Promised Land.\n  Israel is great, not merely because its creation is the fulfillment \nof a biblical promise, or because it is a faithful friend to the United \nStates. It is great because the people of Israel are great people. I \ncongratulate my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and all the \npeople of Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3957-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today is the 50th \nanniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. I would like to \ntake a moment to reflect upon the significance of this historic event.\n  For the nearly two millennia that preceded the founding of Israel, \nJews across the globe had experienced unrelenting persecution, \nculminating in the previously unimaginable apocalypse of the Holocaust. \nIn the wake of Adolph Hitler's effort to exterminate all of the Jews of \nEurope, and his success murdering six million of them, the moral \nimperative of establishing a Jewish state became clear. And so the \nJewish people battled to create that which had only been dreamed of for \n19 centuries: a nation of their own.\n  Their triumph marked the beginning of one of the most inspiring \nstories of the 20th century. That Israel would survive to see today's \nanniversary was far from certain. It's founding brought about the first \nof four wars in which outnumbered Israeli forces somehow managed to \ndefeat or hold off the armies of its hostile neighbors. Israel's \ncourage and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming odds is, quite \nsimply, unparalleled in the modern world.\n  Despite the constant threat to its security, out of the desert, \nIsrael has created a flourishing, democratic society, home to \ninnovative science, cutting-edge technology, and rich culture. Today, \nits economy rivals that of Western Europe in terms of per capita \nwealth.\n  I am proud of the role that the United States has played in helping \nto keep this brave nation alive. To this day, the preservation and \nmaintenance of Israel's national security remains the foundation upon \nwhich U.S. policy in the Middle East rests. Israel remains one of \nAmerica's most trusted allies--a nation with which we have cooperated \nto resolve a variety of regional and global issues. Time and again over \nthe last 50 years, Israel and the United States have demonstrated that \nwe share a special relationship that transcends parochial and short-\nterm policy objectives.\n  I have always believed that there can be no real peace in the Middle \nEast unless Israel's security is guaranteed. That is why, throughout my \ncareer, I have supported strong U.S. economic and military support for \nIsrael. As the greatest democratic nation on the planet, I believe that \nthe United States must do everything in its power to ensure that \nIsrael--the only multi-party democracy in the Middle East--survives.\n  Currently, the best way for the United States to ensure the future \nsecurity and prosperity not only of Israel but of the entire region is \nfor it to play a strong role in keeping the Middle East Peace Process \nalive. If further strife and sorrow in the region is to be avoided, \ndialogue between Israel and her historic enemies must be maintained. \nAlthough the Peace Process has stalled recently, I believe that it can \nbe revived if the United States remains committed to serving as an \nhonest intermediary between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Key \nto the effort to see the participants through this difficult period is \nPresident Clinton's commitment to provide financial and technical \nassistance to Israel to help fight terrorism and to monitor the \nPalestinian Authority's compliance with the Oslo Accords.\n  Mr. President, the Israeli people have demonstrated countless times \nthat they are willing to take risks for peace. That is why I am \nconfident that they will face the challenges of implementing the Oslo \nAccords and the Declaration of Principles with fortitude and \ncreativity. The United States must stand shoulder to shoulder with them \nas they make this effort. Working together, I am confident that we can \nforge a peace that will guarantee that Israel will live to celebrate \nits centennial in 2048.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3957-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3957-S3958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 50 years ago the State of Israel \nproclaimed its independence as a homeland and beacon of hope to Jews \naround the world. At 4:06 p.m. on April 30, 1948, David Ben-Gurion \ndeclared that the establishment of Israel would be effective at \nmidnight the same day. Eleven minutes into the next day, the United \nStates became the first country to extend recognition to the State of \nIsrael when President Truman declared to the American people:\n\n       This government has been informed that a Jewish State has \n     been proclaimed in Palestine and recognition has been \n     requested by the provisional government thereof. The United \n     States recognizes the provisional government as the de facto \n     authority of the new State of Israel.\n\n  The ensuing rejection of Israel's appeal for peace expressed in its \n1948 Declaration of Independence represented a missed opportunity of \nhistoric proportions. The Declaration stated: ``We extend our hand to \nall neighboring states and their people in an offer of peace and unity \nand appeal to them to cooperate with the independent Jewish nation for \nthe good of all.'' Yet for 50 years, the people of Israel have endured \nwar and violent conflict, including a war of independence, the Six Day \nWar, and the Yom Kippur War, weathered constant challenges to their \nsurvival, faced isolation, an economic boycott, and struggled against \nterrorism.\n  To build an independent Jewish nation on a small piece of land would \nhave been difficult even under the most ideal conditions. For Israel to \nhave done so while the country's very existence was constantly being \nthreatened is truly a tremendous accomplishment. In the face of \nhostility and adversity, Israel has persevered and developed into a \nthriving and diverse nation.\n  The special relationship between the United States and Israel is \nfundamentally based on shared values and experiences. As a vibrant \ndemocracy like our own, and despite the heavy burdens imposed on the \ncountry by war, Israel is a land of immigrants and pioneers whose \ndemocratic achievements reflect the hard work, sacrifice, courage, \ndevotion, and self-discipline of its people. Few societies have \nsustained such pressure and kept their commitment to a strong democracy \nas Israel has done. In just 50 years the Israeli people have built \nmodern cities and prosperous farms, and established high quality \neducational and medical institutions. Israel has accomplished this \nwhile remaining a refuge for Jews fleeing oppression and persecution \naround the world, as earlier Israel offered a new life to the survivors \nof the Holocaust.\n  In keeping with its earliest hopes, Israel has been successful in \nforging ties with some of its neighbors and former adversaries, and \nsought to strengthen its security by ending the cycle of conflict and \nviolence marking its first 50 years. Israel's willingness to take risks \nfor peace has been borne out\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nin the Camp David Peace Accord which settled the state of war with \nEgypt, in Israel's recognition of a Palestinian Authority, and in the \n1994 agreement ending war between Israel and Jordan.\n  Throughout these years, through good and difficult times, the United \nStates and Israel have maintained an enduring strategic partnership \nwhich has served us well. The United States commitment to Irsael's \nstrength and security remains firm. As President Clinton declared \nbefore the Knesset in 1994, ``The survival of Israel is important not \nonly to our interests, but to every value we hold dear as a people. Our \nrole in war has been to help you defend yourself by yourself. That is \nwhat you have asked. Now that you are taking risks for peace, our role \nis to help you to minimize the risks of peace.''\n  Today, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Jewish state, we recognize \nthe tremendous achievements of the Israeli people and commemorate the \nfruitful and enduring partnership between our two nations. We wish for \nIsrael the lasting peace and stability its people have long sought and \noffer our congratulations on the inspiring example they have \nset.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3957-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ISRAEL INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today is Israel's Independence Day \nmarking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the modern state of \nIsrael. The last fifty years have fascinated and captivated many of us \nas we have watched and supported this country in its struggle for \nsurvival. Out of the ashes of the Holocaust, Jews from around the world \nconverged on this small but holy land to build a modern state in a \nplace where Jews had maintained a presence for thousands of years. From \nthe first days of statehood in 1948 when its neighbors declared war and \nattempted to obliterate it from the map, Israel has defied the odds and \nendured in the most dangerous of neighborhoods. Each decade since 1948 \nIsrael has survived a major war with its neighbors: Suez in 1956, the \nSix Day War in 1967, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the war in Lebanon in \n1982 and then the deadly Iraqi Scud missiles launched against its \npeople in 1991. Yet in the midst of all these wars, tens of murderous \nterrorist attacks, and a crippling Arab economic boycott, Israel has \nbuilt a vibrant democracy and a robust economy.\n  The United States has not been a bystander in this remarkable \ntransformation. We have provided needed assistance, in recognition of \nour shared democratic values, and we have benefited from a close \nstrategic alliance. There is a special and enduring relationship \nbetween the United states and Israel dating back to the days when the \nUnited States was the first nation to recognize Israel when it declared \nits independence. As Israel marks its jubilee year, we celebrate that \nrelationship.\n  Mr. President, I want to salute the people of Israel for all they \nhave achieved in the last fifty years. I join with the Jewish community \naround the world, which has provided support and received moral and \nspiritual sustenance from Israel, in wishing them well. May they go \nfrom strength to strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3958-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3958-S3959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISRAEL'S BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 50th birthday \nof the State of Israel, a birthday reached after half a century of \nstruggle, of perseverance, and on too many occasions, for too many \nfamilies, of pain. We also celebrate half a century of vision--and hope \nabove all else that when we join together to recognize the 100th \nbirthday of the State of Israel we will do so in an age of lasting \npeace.\n  It is only fitting that the sense of joy that has accompanied this \nhistoric milestone for Israel here in the United States is exceeded \nonly within the borders of Israel itself. Israel and the United States \nshare great ideas as well as a great alliance; and the security of \nIsrael is indispensable to the security of the United States.\n  We accept this fact as central to our foreign policy, to our national \ninterests, and to our view of the world itself. It has been true since \nthe day of Truman and we pray this truth will guide us through the next \nmillennium.\n  But we sometimes forget that these two great nations--the United \nStates of America and the State of Israel--share another rare quality, \nas Prime Minister Netanyahu stated so eloquently. Neither country is \njust a spot on the map, a piece of geography; both are founded on a \nshining vision of human dignity and purpose.\n  It was an American poet who wrote, ``Nothing grows, unless first a \ndream.'' Those like Elie Weisel remind us that not even dreams survive \nwithout a great struggle. The Jewish people have taught us much about \ndignity and purpose because they have preserved their dream and their \nundying vision through two thousand years in exile and persecution. To \narrive at this historic day they had to outlast history's fiercest \nfires of hate.\n  That resilience is testimony to a vision forged in adamantine; to the \nstrongest wills and the bravest hearts; an unbreakable spirit that keep \nIsrael alive and daring even into the twenty-first century. It is that \nsame will that we all pray will guide Israel to an era of peace in the \nMiddle East.\n  Tonight we pay tribute to those who will never see that era of \nharmony, that day when Israel is a homeland and a safe haven for all \nwho share in that vision. We remember those who died in the hope that \neven if they could not know peace and safety, those who bore their name \nmight live the dream for them. That sacrifice inspires us all to push \nforward.\n  I will never forget that when, addressing age old violence and the \nawful spectacle of man's inhumanity to man, Prime Minister Rabin \nexclaimed ``Enough is enough.'' He touched a chord within anyone who \nmourns an innocent life lost, who thinks about the future doctor, \nteacher, nurse, scientist, poet, diplomat, or artists that will never \nbe. Behind all the words and diplomatic documents, shrouded by the haze \nof the gunfire, that is the reality that must be changed before it \nhappens again and again.\n  On my first trip to Israel, I toured the country from Kibbutz Mizgav \nAm to Masada to the Golan. I stood in the very shelter in a kibbutz in \nthe north where children were attacked and I looked at launching sites \nand impact zones for Katousha rockets. Like many visitors, I was \nenthralled by Tel Aviv, moved by Jerusalem and inspired by standing \nabove Capernaum, looking out over the Sea of Galilee, where I read \naloud the Sermon on the Mount. I met people of stunning commitment, who \nhonestly and vigorously debated the issues as I watched and listened \nintently. I went as a friend by conviction; I returned a friend at the \ndeepest personal level.\n  That understanding, that sense of kinship, is shared not just between \na set of leaders or between families, but by two nations with a shared \nfaith in the power of the human spirit. The United States and Israel \nwill walk forward together\n  Herzl's famous words, ``If you will it, it is no dream,'' signify the \npromise and the greatest power of Israel--and the hope, after half a \ncentury, that a fair and secure peace is finally within reach. For our \npart as Americans, we must dedicate ourselves to pushing ahead in the \ncoming years more committed than ever to support Israel in the \nexacting, essential, and sometimes tense search for that dream.\n  A pain which the heart can never forget reminds us that the ashes of \nHolocaust victims were scattered on the wind. But that wind also \ncarries on it their prayers and purpose--above mountains and sea, \nacross hundreds or thousands of miles, so that the pain of history is \nredeemed in the land of Israel. It is a sacred place--for those who \nhave made it their home and for all the world. So let us now resolve \nagain that in the next fifty years, as in the past five decades, we \nwill make our best efforts to keep secure this sacred land.\n  In many respects, our task as Americans, as a good ally and a \ncommitted world neighbor, appears easier in the reflection of history. \nThe memory will never escape me, the emotions that touched me on top of \nMasada, when I stood on that great plateau where the oath of new \nsoldiers used to be sworn against the desert backdrop and the test of \nhistory. I had spent several hours with Yadin Roman debating whether or \nnot in fact Josephus Flavius was correct in his account of the siege--\nwhether these really were the last Jews fighting for survival--\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nwhether they had escaped since no remains were ever found. Finally, \nafter our journey through history, which we resolved with a vote in \nfavor of history as recorded, we stood as a group at the end of the \ncliff and altogether we shouted across the chasm--across the desert and \nacross time--Am Yisrael Chai. And across the silence we listened as \nvoices came back; faintly we heard the echo of the souls of those who \nperished--Am, Yisrael Chai. The State of Israel lives. The people of \nIsrael live.\n  We must do our part to see that future generations are born into and \nlive in a peace that will never be questioned.\n  We celebrate half a century of struggle and victory for the people of \nIsrael, living every day in a dream that is timeless. We pray tonight \nfor a peace for all the ages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3958-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3959-S3960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL ERASE THE HATE AND ELIMINATE RACISM DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 221 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senators Burns and Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 221) to designate April 30, 1998 as \n     National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Baucus and \n48 other of our fellow colleagues, to a resolution to designate April \n30 as ``National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.'' As you \nknow, we introduced a similar resolution last year, which the Senate \npassed through unanimous consent. In order to continue eliminating \nracism and hate crimes, we must again recognize April 30 as a day to \nstop racism and hate crime. Through recognition of such a day, we as \ncitizens can stand together in order to prevent future crimes from \noccurring.\n  According to the United States Department of Justice, there were over \n8,000 racially and biased crimes committed last year. Because of this \nhigh number, my colleagues and I have stood up to recognize, for a \nsecond year, the importance of preventing such crimes from continuing. \nWe must work together, as adults and children, to bring our Nation back \nto its origin, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of press \nand freedom of thought.\n  We as an elected body must promote this recognition by passing this \nresolution again this year. We must remember that diversity has been a \ncornerstone of our Nation's heritage and should continue to be. An \nunderstanding of individual differences promotes unity throughout our \ncommunities and States. We must take it upon ourselves to promote these \ndiversities and pass this Senate resolution.\n  I would like to thank the YWCA and many organizations throughout the \nUnited States for their assistance in supporting diversity throughout \nthis year and every year. I would also like to thank all of my \ncolleagues that have joined and will join us in recognizing a way to \neradicate the forces that divide our country.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the second \nanniversary of National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day. \nEarlier today, I introduced with my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBurns, along with many others from across the nation, a resolution \nmarking this notable occasion.\n  In 1964, Mike Mansfield of Montana, then majority leader of the \nUnited States Senate, ushered through this body the landmark Civil \nRights Act. It is his tradition of integrity and foresight in both \nMontana and the nation that inspires us in our actions today.\n  In the last several years, however, Montanans of a different \ngeneration have come under the microscope of less favorable scrutiny. \nThe reputation of Montana as a state of forward-thinkers and tolerant \nindividuals was marred by the standoff between the FBI and the so-\ncalled Freemen outside Jordan, and a series of hate crimes in some of \nour cities.\n  What has frustrated me and many other Montanans, however, is the lack \nof attention to the vast majority of Montanans--the people who are \nwilling to stand up to bigots and hate groups. It is these folks who \nprovide us with stories of hope and courage and let us know that our \ncommunities and our neighbors will not stand for bias and hate-\nmotivated behavior.\n  It is important because these encouraging stories are becoming \ncommonplace in Montana. Whether it is a community like Billings that \nstands up to a group of skinheads, or a Missoula high school class that \ndevotes an entire project to studying the holocaust, Montanans are \nmaking a real and positive difference in our society.\n  There is no doubt that we have come a long way as a nation. But with \n8,000 hate crimes reported to the U.S. Department of Justice each year, \nit is clear we still have much more work to do.\n  In addition to taking this day to recognize the importance of the \nfight, we must continue to support groups like the Northwest Coalition \nAgainst Malicious Harassment, the Montana Human Rights Network, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights and the many other groups and \nindividuals who continue this work every day.\n  I know a simple Senate resolution, or even a national conference, \nwill not end the problems we still have. A piece of paper alone cannot \nteach a child that hate is wrong. But I do believe a piece of paper can \nmake people think. A conference will not end intolerance. But it can \nmake people talk about hate crimes. Designating today as a day to \naddress these important problems is a first step and it can light a \nspark of hope in people's hearts and minds.\n  Again, perhaps our predecessor in the Senate, Mike Mansfield, when \nspeaking about the task in 1964, said it best when he noted:\n\n       What we do here in the . . . Congress will not, of itself, \n     correct these faults, but we can and must join the wisdom--\n     the collective wisdom of this body--to the efforts of others \n     in this Nation to face up to them for what they are--a \n     serious erosion of the fundamental rock upon which the unity \n     of the Nation stands.\n\n  Tolerance and respect are our nation's bedrock. Today we can join \ntogether to renew the fight for a better America. And if we continue to \nlook at the good, courageous, decent things our neighbors are doing, \nthe sparks of hope we light just might catch fire, in Montana and all \nacross the country.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 221) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n       Whereas the term `hate crime' means an offense in which one \n     or more individuals, commits an offense (such as an assault \n     or battery (simple or aggravated), theft, criminal trespass, \n     damage to property, mob action, disorderly conduct, or \n     telephone harassment) by reason of the race, color, creed, \n     religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, physical or \n     mental disability, or national origin of another individual \n     or group of individuals;\n       Whereas there are almost 8,000 hate crimes reported to the \n     Department of Justice each year, and the number of hate \n     crimes reported increases each year;\n       Whereas hate crimes have no place in a civilized society \n     that is dedicated to freedom and independence, as is the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the people of the United States must lead and set \n     the example for the world in protecting the rights of all \n     people;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should take \n     personal responsibility for and action against hatred and \n     hate crimes;\n       Whereas the Members of Congress, as representatives of the \n     people of the United States, must take personal \n     responsibility for and action against hatred and hate crimes;\n       Whereas the laws against hate crimes, which have been \n     passed by Congress and signed by the President, must be \n     supported and implemented by the people of the United States \n     and by Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials \n     and other public servants: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--(1) designates April 30, 1998, \n     as `National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day'; and \n     (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States and throughout the world \n     to recognize the importance of using each day as an \n     opportunity to take a stand against hate crimes and violence \n     in their nations, states, neighborhoods and communities.\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/30/senate-section/article/S3959-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3959-S3960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL ERASE THE HATE AND ELIMINATE RACISM DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe clerk read the resolution and the preamble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 222) to commend Stuart Franklin \n     Balderson.\n       Whereas Stuart F. Balderson became an employee of the \n     United States Senate on May 23, 1960, and since that date has \n     ably and faithfully upheld the high standards and traditions \n     of the staff of the United States Senate for a period that \n     included 19 Congresses;\n       Whereas Stuart F.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Stuart F. Balderson.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment on the \npassage of this important resolution to thank Stewart Balderson for his \nnearly four decades of distinguished service, as has been referenced in \nthe resolution, and wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his \nlife.\n  Stuart Balderson truly is an institution within an institution.\n  He began his career in the Senate finance office when he was 22--and \nLyndon Johnson was still the Majority Leader.\n  He has stayed there for 38 years--through the tenure of 12 Senate \nSecretaries--working in every department: payroll, accounting, \nretirement and benefits, and legislative budgeting.\n  In 1980, he assumed the top position in that office, Financial Clerk \nof the United States Senate.\n  I first came to the Senate in 1973, as a staffer for another South \nDakota Senator.\n  As anyone who has ever worked here knows, the finance office is one \nof the first offices you visit after you're hired. You go there to fill \nout your W4 and your insurance forms and other necessary pieces of \npaper.\n  From that day until today, I have been impressed with the efficient \nand friendly service in that office. And I believe that is a direct \nreflection of the man who has run it so well, and for so long.\n  I am not alone in my admiration.\n  In 1992, Stuart Balderson was named ``Congressional Staffer of the \nYear,'' by Roll Call newspaper. He was given the award at the Senate \nStaff Club Dinner Dance.\n  That night, in his acceptance speech, he said of this Senate, ``I \nlove the institution, and I work very, very hard for its financial \nintegrity.''\n  He went on to regale his fellow diners with his recollections of what \nthe Senate was like back in 1960, when he came here.\n  He recalled how giants like Everett Dirksen, Hubert Humphrey and Sam \nErvin used to drop by the finance office just to chat. There was a real \n``sense of family'' on the Hill back then, he said. Everyone knew \neveryone.\n  He said he also remembered thinking that he would ``never get \nanywhere here, because it looked to me like everyone had been here \nforever, and wouldn't leave until they died at their desks.\n  ``But, I quickly found out,'' he added, ``that these people were the \nsources of knowledge and wisdom, and I found myself calling on them \nconstantly.''\n  Clearly, Stuart Balderson was wrong in thinking he'd never go \nanywhere in the Senate finance office.\n  But he was right about another thing: The dedicated men and women who \nhave served this Senate for years truly are sources of knowledge and \nwisdom--for all of us.\n  They are our institutional memory, and our connection to a different \ntime--a time when people on the Hill focused less, perhaps, on party \nlabels, and more on common goals.\n  Over the years, Stuart Balderson has earned his place among those \nsages.\n  I know I speak for countless Senators and Senate staffers when I say, \nwe will miss his professionalism, and dedication, and his ever-friendly \nmanner.\n  We thank him for his many years of impeccable service to this great \ninstitution. And we wish him all the best on his retirement.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nthat was read be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
