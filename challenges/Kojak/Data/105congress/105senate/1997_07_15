Mr. President, I like to talk today about the \nstateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund which doubles \nboth the pleasure of those who use outdoor recreation facilities as \nwell as the money. The stateside matching grant program of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund basically provides two for the price of one, \nand I will explain that a little further. The Land and Water \nConservation Fund grant program, or the LWCF as it is known, has had a \nsubstantial long-term effect on our overall attitudes and policies \ntoward outdoor recreation. The land and water stateside program has \ntruly a unique legacy in the history of American conservation and \nrecreation.\n  When I say stateside program, I am talking about a State/Federal \nmatching grant. What better way for the Federal Government to \nparticipate than matching local funds for public parks and recreation \nfacilities. Local funds provide an opportunity for involvement and \npride and responsibility by the communities at hand.\n  The first legacy of this kind is the notion basic to the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund Act that States must assume the leadership role \nas provider of recreation opportunities. It should not be left to an \nindifferent Federal Government headquartered in Washington, DC. It \nshould start in the communities where the people recreate.\n  From a historic perspective, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \ncontributed significantly to outdoor recreation. Through fiscal year \n1995, a total of 37,300 projects had been approved to support the \nacquisition of\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\nopen space for park land and the development of outdoor recreation \nfacilities. The Federal share of $3.2 billion has been matched by State \nand local contributions, for a total investment of over $6.5 billion in \nlocal park and recreation. So when you take Federal matching with the \nState matching, you get two for the price of one.\n\n  I think it also important to note from where the Federal share comes. \nIt comes from OCS revenues; that is, off-shore oil and gas revenues. As \na consequence, for those who are very sensitive about OCS drilling, I \nshould point out that the revenue stream to provide the matching grants \nfor the Federal share for land and water conservation comes \nspecifically from OCS. If we do not have offshore oil and gas \nexploration, we are not going to have the money to fund the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. Last year, OCS revenues totaled over $3 \nbillion.\n  I believe, with advanced technology, we can safely pursue OCS \nactivities off our shores and also provide a revenue stream for \nrecreation through the Land and Water Conservation Act. The facts \nshould not be lost on this body, the realization of just where these \nfunds come from.\n  Further, States have received over the years about 8,200 grants and \ncounties some 4,800, while cities, towns, and other local agencies \nmatched more than 24,000 grants. The facilities that the $6.5 billion \ninvestment has bought are those that are down your street, across your \ntown, in the inner city, and virtually every nook and cranny of our \ncountry. The parks and facilities serve virtually every segment of the \npublic. Millions of Americans have walked and jogged and picnicked, \nhiked, biked, fished, hunted, golfed, or played ball in at least one of \nthese areas. These are the destination parks and facilities for \nfamilies, campers, and hikers, areas where kids learn to play baseball, \nlearn to swim, and really get an appreciation of nature. And those are \nthe facilities in their neighborhoods and near their homes.\n  Further, the statewide program is unquestionably one of the most \nsuccessful programs established by Congress. The Americans for our \nHeritage and Recreation Coalition, consisting of a number of groups \nwhich banded together to seek reliable funding sources, concluded that \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund is ``arguably the most important \nenvironmental program of this century'' and that a reliable source of \nfunding should be restored.\n  I had the pleasure of recently addressing the Conference of Mayors in \nSan Francisco. There were over 400 mayors there led by Mayor Daley of \nChicago and Victor Ashe of Knoxville. They unanimously passed a \nresolution strongly urging the Congress and President to restore \nfunding to the statewide LWCF program. The Western Governors \nAssociation passed a similar resolution. I ask unanimous consent that \ncopies of both of these resolutions be printed in the Record for the \nbenefit of my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      65th Annual Conference of Mayors, San Francisco, June 20-24\n\n                                Adopted\n\n\n                    land and water conservation fund\n\n       1. Whereas, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) was \n     established by Congress over thirty years ago to provide \n     quality recreation for the American public; and\n       2. Whereas, in the past LWCF has provided federal matching \n     assistance to states and their localities for acquiring land \n     and developing quality public outdoor recreation facilities \n     for the benefit of present and future generations of \n     Americans; and\n       3. Whereas, the results of the program are evident in \n     nearly every community in the nation through projects ranging \n     from inner city playgrounds to suburban baseball fields to \n     state natural areas; and\n       4. Whereas, over the past couple of years there has been no \n     funding for state and local parks projects under LWCF despite \n     availability of royalties from Outer Continental Shelf Oil \n     and Gas payments pledged to the Fund; and\n       5. Whereas, it is the local park which is the most used and \n     visited of any parks in our national parks system,\n       6. Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the United States \n     Conference of Mayors urges the President and Congress to \n     recognize the outstanding legacy of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund and the continuing unmet need for local \n     public outdoor parks and recreation facilities by increasing \n     the appropriations in the next fiscal year budget for the \n     state and local grants portion of LWCF; and\n       7. Be it further Resolved, That the United States \n     Conference of Mayors urges the President and Congress to \n     strongly consider the parks and recreation needs of state and \n     local governments at the same time it considers national park \n     priorities as outlined in the 1997 budget agreement; and\n       8. Be it further Resolved, the United States Conference of \n     Mayors reaffirms its support for the 1994 report by the \n     National Park Service's Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     Review Committee which recommended a 30 percent allocation of \n     LWCF to local governments; and\n       9. Be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution \n     be forwarded to the bipartisan leadership of Congress.\n       Project Cost: Unknown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       Western Governors' Association, Medora, ND, June 24, 1997\n\n                        Policy Resolution 97-012\n\n     Sponsors: Governors Bush and Geringer.\n     Subject: Allocation of Land and Water Conservation Fund \n         Appropriations.\n\n\n                             a. background\n\n       1. In 1964, the President and Congress enacted one of the \n     most successful and far-reaching pieces of conservation and \n     recreation legislation in America's history, the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund.\n       2. The Act emphasizes a leadership role for the states in \n     achieving a national outdoor recreation system which requires \n     commitments to planning, establishment and expansion, and \n     funding of projects on a coordinated basis at the local, \n     state, and national level.\n       3. The Fund has provided more than $5.6 billion to acquire \n     new federal park and recreation lands and has provided \n     matching grants to state and local governments which have \n     resulted in the establishment of over 27,000 basic recreation \n     facilities in every state and territory of the nation (or \n     37,300 new or improved basic recreation facilities).\n       4. The Fund receives deposits from three sources:\n       a. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) revenues derived from \n     leasing oil and gas sites in coastal waters (approximately \n     90% of total deposits).\n       b. Sale of Federal surplus real properties.\n       c. A portion of Federal motorboat fuel taxes.\n       5. In 1995, a National Recreation & Park Society survey \n     indicated that state and local recreation agencies needed \n     $27.7 billion in capital investment for rehabilitation, land \n     acquisition, and construction for the next five years. The \n     survey additionally estimated that state and local agencies \n     would have only half of these necessary funds.\n       6. These estimates indicate a long-term deficit of public \n     recreation investment nationally.\n       7. In 1976, the Act was amended by:\n       a. raising the Appropriation ceiling from $600 million to \n     $900 million; and\n       b. changing the allocation formula, which had given 40 \n     percent to federal agencies, to read that ``not less than 40 \n     percent of any appropriation would go to Federal agencies.''\n       8. While states received approximately sixty percent of the \n     allocated grant money before 1976, during the last ten years \n     they received, on average, only 7.5% of the allocated grant \n     money from the LWCF.\n       During Fiscal Year 1996 and 1997, states received zero \n     funding from the LWCF, despite a large increase in OCS \n     revenues.\n\n\n                     b. governors' policy statement\n\n       1. A true partnership to ``Build a Nationwide System of \n     Parks'' can only be achieved by increasing LWCF \n     appropriations and by balancing the funding between federal, \n     state and local agencies.\n       2. To rebuild this partnership and revive the true intent \n     of the LWCF Act, Congress should increase LWCF appropriations \n     and amend the LWCF to increase the percentage of LWCF funds \n     allocated to the states to 50 percent.\n\n\n                   c. governors' management directive\n\n       1. Western Governors' Association shall survey this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, western congressional delegations, \n     and appropriate House and Senate committee chairmen and \n     ranking minority members.\n       2. Western Governors' Association staff and Natural \n     Resource Group shall continue to monitor and study this issue \n     and recommend specific action items for the Governors.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in campaigning for the Presidency of \nthe United States, candidate Bill Clinton at the time stated:\n\n       I will acquire new park lands and recreation areas with \n     funds now available in the Federal Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund to increase opportunities for hunting, \n     fishing and other outdoor recreation activities.\n\n  Candidate Clinton said:\n\n       I would increase funding for several programs. . . and \n     reinvigorate the Land and Water Conservation Fund to make \n     more funds available for the acquisition of public outdoor \n     open spaces.\n\n  And he also said:\n\n       I would also make funds available from the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund to help address critical infrastructure \n     needs in State and local facilities.\n\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\n\n  Unfortunately, I guess our President has overlooked it or was kidding \nbecause if you look at the administration's proposal for the stateside \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Act which would address the \ncritical needs in State and local facilities, there is a large zero.\n  Secretary Babbitt, in May 1996, in an interview with the San Jose \nMercury News, is credited with stating that he is working on a proposal \nto take the Land and Water Conservation Fund off budget, so a full $1 \nbillion a year can be spent on the parks. Reportedly, the Secretary \nsaid that the effort would not occur until the next year, meaning that \nit would be contingent on President Clinton's reelection. Well, it is \nnow next year. President Clinton has been reelected. The \nadministration, however, has been silent vis-a-vis the proposal for the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  We have instead a proposal to use $315 million of the $700 million \ncontained in the budget agreement for the purchase of the Headwaters \nForest in California and a mine in Montana. We do not know an awful lot \nabout the Headwaters Forest acquisition. We do know that the Headwaters \nForest is 40 air miles from the nearest national forest. We know that \naccess to the Headwaters Forest is extremely limited. We know that the \nagreement with the current landowner of the Headwaters Forest is \ncontingent on a favorable ruling by the Internal Revenue Service. \nGetting a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service is a \nherculean effort, and I am not sure that the IRS knows how to basically \nspell the word ``favorable,'' but that is a subject for a statement for \nanother day. The bottom line is that these projects have never ever \nbeen authorized by the appropriate committees of jurisdiction. No \nhearings, none whatsoever. No hearings have been held and no \nlegislation has been introduced. This is from an administration that \nprides itself in the public process. Public process suggests \nlegislation, suggests hearings, and action by the appropriate House and \nSenate committees. Neither of these have been proposed in the case of \nthe acquisition of the area known as the Headwaters Forest in \nCalifornia or the area proposed for the mine purchase in Montana.\n  This is very much like the recent land grab in the State of Utah. \nThere was a process ongoing where the committees were discussing the \nmerits of withdrawing 1.6 million acres of public land in Utah and \nputting that land in wilderness. While these discussions were \noccurring, the administration saw fit to invoke the Antiquities Act \nand, overnight, basically put this 1.6 million acres in Utah into \nwilderness over the objections of the Utah congressional delegation and \nUtah's Governor. The President's action occurred without any hearings, \nwithout any public process. And, ironically, the announcement came not \nin Utah but in front of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.\n  Well, the media saw fit to not make an issue of it so not too many \npeople in the United States reflected on the inconsistency between the \nPresident's promises and his actions.\n  But, again, this is what is proposed in the budget agreement: the \npurchase of the Headwaters Forest in California and a mine in Montana--\nno hearings, no public participation in the process, simply an outright \npurchase. This is not the purpose of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n\n  We do not know just what is their objection, relative to the \nprocedure, but as the Senator who is chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, the fact that the administration is circumventing \nthe public process is certainly, in my opinion, inappropriate.\n  What we do know is that the benefits derived from funding the \nstateside Land and Water Conservation Fund program are great. That is \nwhy we should take the $315 million and invest it in the State matching \ngrant program because it will return over $630 million in benefits.\n  Roger Kennedy, former Director of the National Park Service, perhaps \nput it best when he said,\n\n       Without a doubt, the Land and Water Conservation Fund ranks \n     highest among the most successful and significant \n     conservation/recreation movements ever experienced in these \n     United States. This State-driven program has resulted in much \n     needed and highly beneficial public outdoor recreation \n     opportunities for the benefits of all the people. More \n     accessible park and recreation facilities have become a \n     reality.\n\nand continue to become even a greater use and benefit to the Nation.\n  Mr. President, it is very difficult to compare the relative value of \nexpanding a wildlife refuge, say, in the Florida Keys, with the \naddition of acreage to a unique urban park such as the Presidio in San \nFrancisco. It is difficult to compare the value of supplementing \nFederal holdings in Glacier National Park with a purchase of land, say, \nnext to Gettysburg National Battlefield. But those are the types of \ndecisions that are faced day-in and day-out by the Congress in \ndetermining priorities for funding under the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and \nthose in the Senate to provide funding for the stateside Land and Water \nConservation Fund Grant Program. In the absence of these grants, I fear \nlocal park and recreation services will fail to meet the ever-growing \ndemands of the American public and the Federal Government will be asked \nto fill the void. It is a role the Federal Government cannot and should \nnot play. The answer to this dilemma is simply the stateside matching \ngrant of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Mr. President, I have already noted the action taken by the mayors of \nthe Conference of Mayors in San Francisco relative to support of this \nprogram because it is so significant relative to community involvement \nand community responsibility. I urge my colleagues to reflect on that, \nas well as, again, on the statement from the Western Governors Council \nin support of this program.\n  There is one other item I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues relative to action before this body. I ask unanimous \nconsent, since no other Senator is seeking recognition, that I may \nspeak for another 5 minutes on chemical weapons disposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7429-7", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7431-S7432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHEMICAL WEAPONS DISPOSAL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I intended to offer an amendment to the \ndefense appropriations bill that would have stricken the language that \nmade it impossible for the Department to study alternatives to the \nmethods we currently employ for disposing of chemical weapons. During \nthe consideration of the Defense authorization bill last week, I \noffered an amendment to provide for a study. This amendment was readily \naccepted by the floor managers and was included in the final bill which \nthe Senate passed overwhelmingly last Friday. Depending on the \nconclusions of the study, the taxpayers of this country could save \nsomewhere between $3 and $5 billion. This is real money. Perhaps they \ncould save much more in the cost of disposing of these chemical \nweapons.\n  This was just a study. It did not mandate changes in the program at \nthis time. It merely provided Congress with an opportunity to \nresponsibly evaluate alternatives in the future. I think it is clear we \nneed to take a fresh look at this program so we can responsibly \nevaluate whether safer and cheaper alternatives to the present system \nexist.\n  In 1985, the Congress directed the Army to destroy our stockpile of \nobsolete chemical weapons. These are the nerve gases and the various \nother agents that are so deadly. The Senate took action and reiterated \nthis commitment by ratifying the Chemical Weapons Treaty earlier this \nyear, and we are in the process of disposing of those weapons. But the \npresent system, I suggest, is not working the way it should. The \npresent system is increasingly expensive, and a timeline for completion \nof the program is increasingly uncertain.\n  If we look at the figures, according to the GAO, the program faces \ndramatically increasing costs. I am going to describe where these \nweapons are in a moment. The stockpile disposal program went from an \ninitial estimate of $1.7 billion as the cost of disposing of these \nchemical weapons in 1985 to a current estimate of about $12.4 billion. \nSo, as we begin to look at the cost of disposing of these weapons, why, \nthe cost just simply goes out of sight. The nonstockpile program could \ncost an additional $15.1 billion and it is estimated now to take 40 \nyears to complete.\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n  We have these weapons stored in various locations around the country. \nClearly, we want to dispose of the weapons. But now they are telling us \nit is going to take 40 years to dispose of them. It is a hole out there \nwe are going to pour money into for 40 years. The estimate is a minimum \ncost of over $27.5 billion. But, remember, that is up from what the \noriginal estimate was in 1985 of $1.7 billion. So we go from $1.7 to \n$12.4 to $15.1 to $27.5. And now we are talking about 40 years.\n  These stockpiled munitions are, obviously, highly deadly. Their long-\nterm viability is questionable. We simply cannot continue to postpone \nour responsibility to act on this program at this time. We have \nstockpiled munitions at nine sites, and here they are, Mr. President, \nwith disposal facilities up and running at only two. The only two we \nhave running are one out in the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Atoll, out \nthere, about 600 miles south of Hawaii, and recently, Tooele in Utah is \nup and running. These facilities are costing well over $1 billion in \nTooele, and the Johnston Island site is somewhere around $1.3 billion \nor thereabouts.\n  It is interesting to note where we are. We are in Alabama, we are in \nArkansas, we are in Colorado, we are in Maryland, we are in Kentucky, \nwe are up here in Indiana, and, of course, we are in Umatilla, OR. \nEvery State is sensitive, including the State of my friend, the Senator \nfrom Oregon. The reality is they want this removed from these various \nStates where they exist. So the Department of Defense and the Pentagon \nand the appropriate committees have determined the best way to get rid \nof it is to build individual sites at each of the seven or eight--or \nactually potentially nine--sites, at a cost of over $1 billion, and, \nonce the material is disposed of, that terminates the facility because \nit is not beneficial for anything else.\n  However, it is interesting to note a couple of facts. In the Johnston \nAtoll, most of the material that is being incinerated there and \ndisposed of came from NATO. It came from Europe. It was shipped across \nthe ocean. Some of it came from Guam. That facility is functioning. It \nis underway. There is a prohibition about it taking any more. I can \nunderstand the sensitivity of the delegation from Hawaii, but, again, \nas we look at this catch-22 that we are in, I am just wondering, is it \nnecessary that we build six new plants? Or, can we somehow look at some \nother alternatives? Is there a way to incinerate this at sea? We have \nbuilt incinerating barges and facilities before quite successfully. Is \nthere an advanced technology? What the Senator from Alaska has proposed \nis a study, a study to see if there is another and more beneficial \nreturn for the taxpayers of this country for the disposal of this \nweaponry.\n  In Oregon we have the adjacent coastline. In Aberdeen--in several of \nthese areas we are not too far from the water. But each is very \nconcerned about shipping this material across another State to get it \nto a place where you can dispose of it. So we are in this round-robin \nhere. Nobody wants the stuff. Everybody wants to get rid of it. Nobody \nwants it to cross their State line. Nobody wants to take any more. \nNobody wants to accumulate it and reduce the cost. So we simply sit \nhere and watch the costs go up to $27 billion, we watch the time \nextended to up to 40 years, and we are being irresponsible by not \nallowing a study.\n  That is what my amendment would have done. It would have been to \nallow a study. However, because there is a prohibition even against a \nstudy, the conference and/or the committee itself is refusing to accept \nmy amendment, which I can understand, given the sensitivity. I can \nunderstand how the process works around here. But I think we need to \nhighlight how irresponsible we are in just ducking this issue and \nhoping that it will be resolved on somebody else's watch.\n  We have stockpiled these munitions at nine sites. We cannot, by laws \nthat we passed, transport these munitions. So, you know, the \nalternative is to build these sites at more than $1 billion each at the \nsame time we continue to face permitting problems at every Federal \nsite, every local level at the other seven sites, and a start date for \nconstruction seems to be extended on and on and on. The logic of the \npresent disposal system really escapes me, and, as a consequence, I \noffered the amendment so we could take a rational look at what we are \ntrying to accomplish with regard to this problem.\n  This again, Mr. President, is just a study. But in order to take a \nrational look at the program, it is imperative that all aspects of the \nprogram be considered so we can best evaluate how to proceed.\n  I hope the conferees on this bill will consider their responsibility \nand reconsider the Senate language which permits us an opportunity to \ntake a second look. It does not demand that we do anything. It is not \nthat we ship anything, not that we do not build these, it simply says, \n``Is there another, a better, a more efficient, cost-savings way?'' I \nthink there is. To suggest we are going to eliminate even the ability \nto take a look at this program, I think is terribly irresponsible on \nthe part of those who bear the responsibility of addressing this, \nbecause this is just a study. What is the harm in looking at the \nproblem?\n\n  I had proposed striking the prohibition against the study. We could \nalways ask the inspector general for a study, and probably will. But I \ndid want to take an opportunity to present before the Members the \nreality. This is something we cannot hide. We cannot overlook this. We \nhave a responsibility to address it. We are spending huge amounts of \nmoney, and the public should recognize just what our alternatives are \nand face up to the fact that this was created as a consequence of \ndecisions made in the national defense interests of our Nation. We \ncreated this terrible nerve gas. I have seen the canisters it is in. I \nhave seen how they dispose of it at Johnston Island and the manner in \nwhich it is taken into chambers where the explosive charge is removed, \nthe gas is incinerated in one chamber in a closed cycle and the \nexplosive material is taken in another chamber and incinerated. This \nwas the development prototype.\n  But, here we are today faced with the inability to even look at a \nbetter way of disposal because of the sensitivity of this issue and the \nconcern, if you do a study and you find a better way, it might suggest \nyou might have to move it, and, therefore, you would have to move it \nacross another State, and they don't want that to happen. So leave it \nwhere it is, simply build the plants and get on with it and spend God \nknows how many billions of dollars in the process.\n  So, you might say the Senator from Alaska is a little sensitive to \nthe prohibition to even allow a study and an evaluation of a better way \nto meet our obligations to dispose of our chemical weapons.\n  You might say, ``What in the world is the Senator from Alaska doing \nin this area?'' Under the responsibility as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I have spent an awful lot of time on the \nmerits of moving high-level nuclear waste across the United States at \nvarious sites over an extended period of time. Hundreds and hundreds of \nshipments have moved safely without incident. I am suggesting that we \nhave the technology to move this lethal material to a place to dispose \nof it that is appropriate, even perhaps in a self-contained facility \noffshore that could contain the physical process of disposal at a much \nless cost.\n  With that, Mr. President, I simply make an appeal to my colleagues to \nrecognize the extent of our responsibility to successfully dispose of \nour chemical weapons that have accumulated over a long period of time \nin a manner that is most responsible to the taxpayers, as well as safe, \nby using American ingenuity and technology.\n  Seeing no other Member on the floor, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, on July 2, a series of high-wind storms \nraged through my State of Michigan. They struck in numerous communities \nranging from Chesaning, a small city in Saginaw County, to Thetford and \nVienna Townships in Genesee County to Holly, MI, and Oakland County, to \nparts of the city of Detroit to the small communities of Highland Park \nand Hamtramck in Wayne County, and then ultimately across to Lake St. \nClair passing through several of the communities on the east side of \nour State, including Grosse Pointe Farms and Grosse Pointe.\n  In their wake, they left enormous damage, destruction and the loss of \nhuman life. Already--and I give great compliment to both our State as \nwell as our Federal emergency services--we have had great assistance in \ntrying to address the problems left behind by this storm. The folks \nfrom FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were quickly on the \nscene to give advice and counsel to our State authorities, and then to \nassess the damage for purposes of determining what Federal assistance \nmight be provided.\n  Our own State government, under the leadership of John Engler, was \nquick to act through its emergency services to assist the various \ncommunities affected. And I am happy to report that by and large we \nhave had a remarkable public response, not just through the government \nagencies, but also through the volunteer efforts of people in \ncommunities throughout our State who have risen to the challenge of \naddressing this serious disaster and crisis.\n  In the aftermath, we have moved forward in seeking the designation of \na disaster area for a number of the communities that were struck by \nthese storms. Just last Friday afternoon, the President declared parts \nof Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb Counties as disaster areas, as well as \npart of Saginaw County. And we are delighted by that news.\n  At the same time, I just yesterday morning visited an area that has \nnot yet had such a designation made regarding it. That is the area \noutside of the city of Flint, MI, Thetford Township. And in visiting \nThetford Township yesterday, I could not help but immediately conclude \nthat we need to expand the designation of disaster areas to include \nthis township and the neighboring township of Vienna Township in \nGenesee County.\n  According to the National Weather Service, three tornadoes hit this \narea during the storm. These communities are small. The population of \nThetford Township is roughly 8,000 to 9,000 people. Almost all of them \nare in one form or another in the business of agriculture. Many of them \nare family farmers.\n  This township--approximately 36 square miles--is almost exclusively \nfarmland north of the city of Flint. Just to put it in perspective what \ntranspired there, one individual was killed, a variety of livestock \nwere likewise lost, two huge steel power lines were down, feed bins \nwere overturned, barns were obliterated, silos were decapitated.\n  I visited a number of these farms yesterday and was amazed that more \npeople weren't hurt, because the devastation and damage was incredible. \nIt looked, as I reported in my last remarks about the storms, like a \nHollywood movie set, except this was not acting, this was real, and \nfamilies affected were not actors and actresses, but real people in our \nState.\n  So I pledged yesterday that I would come back today and not only talk \nabout this, but work to try to secure for these tiny communities the \ndesignation as disaster areas that has been afforded much larger \ncommunities throughout the State who likewise are deserving of such \ndesignation being affected by the storms.\n  Again, I want to thank the President. I want to thank FEMA for their \nrapid response to our requests last week. And I say that I do not think \nthere is going to be any cost involved in expanding the designation to \ninclude Thetford and Vienna Townships, but the injuries and the damage \ndone there are every bit as real and every bit as serious to those tiny \ncommunities as was the case in larger ones.\n  Interestingly, although wholly unconnected with my visit yesterday, \nin the Detroit Free Press a story about these communities ran entitled \n``Hardy Farmers Weather the Storm; Despite Damage, They're \nRebounding.'' I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, July 14, 1997]\n\n  Hardy Farmers Weather the Storm-- Despite Damage, They're Rebounding\n\n                            (By Bill McGraw)\n\n       Thetford Township.--Don Rasmussen took refuge in a big cow \n     barn on the dairy farm he manages when the sky turned black \n     and the wind began to howl.\n       Parts of other buildings began blowing through the air. The \n     rain fell sideways. The noise grew into a constant roar.\n       Then it really got crazy.\n       ``The cows just freaked,'' Rasmussen recalled Friday, while \n     a newborn calf nearby was taking its first steps. ``All \n     around me, they were stampeding. They aren't the most \n     intelligent animals, and they had no idea what was happening. \n     They just ran.''\n       Rasmussen remained safe, both from the tornado and the \n     stampeding Holsteins, and guided a reporter Friday around the \n     battered farm near Clio in Genesee County.\n       Tornadoes don't usually hit big cities, so the impact of \n     the July 2 storm on Detroit and its suburbs has dominated \n     news coverage. But the National Weather Service identified \n     three twisters in the rolling farmland outside Flint, and at \n     least one passed through the 1,000-acres owned by Larry Niec. \n     The result: six dead cows and heavy damage.\n       Because of storm damage estimated at $2.3 million to this \n     and other sites in southern Michigan, the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture's Farm Service Agency last week asked that \n     federal low-interest loans be made available to Michigan \n     farmers like Niec. This assistance would be separate from the \n     federal funds President Bill Clinton approved Friday.\n       Niec (pronounced NEESE), who looks younger than his 51 \n     years, said: ``We have insurance. It covers a lot, but not \n     everything.''\n       His farm looks like a giant worked it over with a \n     sledgehammer.\n       ``It's so sad,'' said Rasmussen, 47, who lives across the \n     street from Niec's 300-cow dairy operation.\n       The gusts decapitated silos, obliterated barns, overturned \n     heavy feed bins, toyed with a semi-trailer, scattered calf \n     hutches and downed two huge steel towers that carry several \n     power lines. The storm thoroughly spooked the cows, but \n     Rasmussen said most of them appear to have returned to \n     normal.\n       The winds spared some things, such as the manure lagoon and \n     an old red barn. But there is so much damage that the \n     insurance adjuster has yet to complete his estimate.\n       As the storm moved away, friends and relatives arrived to \n     help round up the cows, calm them, take them to the milking \n     parlor and ship the daily output of 1,750 gallons of milk.\n       Rasmussen and Niec are sanguine about the future.\n       Niec notes that the tornado damage, while spectacular, is \n     no more harmful than the droughts, fluctuating milk prices \n     and bad crops that have made dairy farming a tough way to \n     earn a living.\n       When friends asked Niec how he stood the stress, he told \n     them it isn't much different from any other day.\n       Said Niec: ``We're going to suffer, but we know how to \n     suffer.''\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Featured in the story is discussion of a gentleman named \nLarry Niec. Larry's 1,000-acre farm is depicted here with a caption \nthat reads in part: ``strewn with pieces of once-sturdy buildings, like \nhis roofless dairy barn and severed silo. Six of his cows were killed \nduring the storm.''\n  Obviously, a very difficult time in the farm season for him and for \nhis neighbors. And I do not want to read from the entire article now. \nIt is included in the Record.\n  As I say, the devastation was incredible. Mr. Niec, of course, being \na hardy soul, as depicted in the headline of the story, noted that the \ntornado damage, while spectacular, is no more harmful than the \ndroughts, fluctuating milk prices, bad crops, and so on, which the \nfarmers learn to live with in their day-in and day-out existence. When \nfriends asked Larry how he stood the stress, he told them that it isn't \nmuch different from any other day. He said, ``We're going to suffer, \nbut we know how to suffer.''\n  I met Larry yesterday and he, indeed, is somebody who will persevere. \nAs I said, the cost and the damage is so considerable that we need some \nhelp for these folks as well. Of course, under the current system, they \nwill be entitled to the assistance of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture and through the Small Business Administration. But it is my \nfervent view that the communities of Thetford and Vienna Townships \ndeserve to be designated, as some\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\nof the others have, as an official disaster, to receive a broader range \nof support that they deserve and should be available to them.\n  Without going into all of the details, I can only say, if you drive \ndown any of the roads, whether it is Center Road or Genesee Road or \nBray Road in Thetford Township, as I did yesterday, and you see the \ndecapitated silos with huge chunks of cement strewn everywhere and \ntrees in which semitruck trailers ended up after they were hurled into \nthe air, and if you see the huge openings that have been driven through \nthe fields and the forest lands, you know if this area doesn't qualify \nas a disaster area, I don't know what would, Mr. President.\n  The damage was not just of public property; it is to private \nproperty, also. Happily, it wasn't more serious, but definitely it \ndeserves our attention. For that reason, today I will be writing our \nGovernor, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nauthorities, to ask that the designation be expanded to include this \ncommunity. I hope they will respond as they have responded already. I \nwish to make it clear that I don't know of any reason not to, nor in \nany way am I criticizing actions today. We are moving piece by piece \nthrough the process. I hope they will respond to this as well and help \nus to make sure that these people--they may be small in numbers, as I \nsay, but the people who live there are just as real as the folks in all \nthe other communities. So I intend to work very hard to make sure all \nthe relief possible is made available to them.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7433-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHATHAM STUDENTS EXCELL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

A team of these students excelled \nrecently against other teams representing schools in all 50 States and \nthe District of Columbia in the nationwide finals of the ``We the \nPeople. * * * The Citizen and the Constitution'' competition. This \ntalented and knowledgeable group of students demonstrated their \nexpertise on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and were \nrecognized above other teams for their superior knowledge on this \ntopic.\n  These issues are at the heart of our democracy and our constitutional \nsystem of government. It is gratifying that so many students across the \ncountry are learning about these issues at an early age.\n  The Bill of Rights, in particular, teaches important values about \nindividual freedom and responsibility, and is the basis for our most \nprecious liberties.\n  The students at Chatham High School deserve great credit for their \nachievement. I commend them for their skill and dedication. \nMassachusetts is so proud of them all--Heather Baker, Taylor Brown, \nJonathan Buck, Lauren D'Elia, Hannah Farnham, Casey Jordan, Joshua \nLamoureux, Jill Matteson, Nathan Miller, Allison Morris, Nalinee \nMurphy, Douglas Smith-Elion, Rebecca Spencer, and Joseph Thonus.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the emerging \nbudget surplus and what Congress should do about it. According to \nrecent Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and Budget \nestimates, the fiscal 1997 budget deficit could be smaller than $50 \nbillion. The reason: Robust economic growth continues to boost tax \nreceipts beyond projections. As a result, the deficit is declining \nrapidly and the budget could be balanced by the year 2000 or earlier.\n  Further, if the President signs a tax bill that includes a deep cut \nin the capital gains tax, a budget surplus could emerge next year. \nEconomist Larry Kudlow predicts that cutting the top capital gains tax \nrate to 20 percent could produce a $90 billion revenue windfall next \nyear, assuming only 15 percent of investors realize their stock market \ngains from 3 years ago.\n  The question we face is this: Should future budget surpluses--if they \nmaterialize--be used to retire the national debt, increase Government \nspending, or further reduce taxes?\n  Our colleague, Representative Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, has offered \nThe National Debt Repayment Act which proposes to use budget surpluses \nprimarily to retire the national debt. This legislation would earmark \ntwo-thirds of any surpluses to debt reduction and only one-third to tax \nreduction. The plan attempts to build budget surpluses in future years \nby limiting the growth of Government spending at 1 percentage point \nlower than the growth of tax revenues.\n  Although well-intentioned, the bill contains several problems. First, \nit would have the practical effect of locking-in high tax rates on the \nAmerican people. Under the plan, Congress would have to maintain a tax \nburden that is higher than is necessary to pay for current Government \nspending. In fact, as economist Bruce Bartlett points out, ``(the \nNeumann) plan actually implies a stiff tax increase. Revenues as a \nshare of gross domestic product would rise from 19.9 percent next year \nto 20.8 percent in 2002,'' producing one of the highest tax burdens in \nU.S. history. Further, because the plan calls for revenue growth to \noutrace spending growth, Congress will have the perverse incentive to \nkeep taxes high.\n  Second, the bill does nothing to reduce the size of the Federal \nGovernment. It is designed to generate budget surpluses, but does \nnothing about the actual levels of either Government spending or \nrevenues. As long as tax revenues are growing, Government spending can \ngrow too.\n  Third, the bill would preclude significant tax rate reductions and \nfundamental tax reforms in the future. In my view, any budget surplus \nwould be far better spent by cutting taxes that are most burdensome and \nstifling to economic growth. Enacting pro-growth tax reforms and \nincreasing the size of\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nthe economy would make it easier to carry the debt burden.\n  Fourth, in effect, the bill would keep taxes on Americans \nunnecessarily high primarily to retire debt held by foreign interests. \nAccording to the Treasury Department, foreign and international \ninvestors owned $1,199.1 billion of the total $3,451.7 billion in \nprivately held public debt in 1997. In contrast, U.S. individuals owned \nonly $355.4 billion. By my lights, we ought to use any budget surpluses \nto provide relief to American taxpayers before making advanced debt \npayments to foreign central bankers and other investors in China, Japan \nand Germany.\n  Overall, the bill is based on misconceptions of the true economic \nimpact of the debt. According to most economists, the figure that \nreally counts is not the total debt per se, but rather debt's size \nrelative to the overall economy. As the Wall Street Journal recently \nnoted, the debt as a share of GDP ``was as high as 111 percent in 1946, \nafter we'd run up a debt to defeat Hitler--a cause worth some debt.'' \nBut because of the post-war economic boom--boosted in the 1960's by \nPresident John F. Kennedy's tax rate reductions--the debt fell back to \n24 percent of GDP in 1974. The Journal goes on to note that the debt \n``rose again with the great inflation and spendthrift Congresses of the \npast two decades, but it stabilized at 50 percent of GDP in 1995 and is \nprojected to decline slowly . . .''\n  Furthermore, the economic benefits of running budget surplus are not \nat all clear. It is worth nothing that Great Britain ran budget \nsurpluses in 1988, 1989, and 1990 equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP--\nequivalent to a U.S. surplus of $100 billion--yet British interest \nrates increased.\n  Mr. President, to ensure that we return higher-than-expected revenues \nto the taxpayer, I have introduced the Economic Growth Dividend \nProtection Act (S. 800). Under my bill, if tax revenues received by the \nTreasury in the next 5 years exceed those projected under the budget \nagreement, the revenues will be made available for tax cuts first. If \nthe Congress fails to pass tax cuts, then the surplus is reserved for \ndeficit reduction--not new Government spending.\n  In summary, Mr. President, we should reduce the burden of the \nnational debt. But setting in stone today a policy to run huge budget \nsurpluses well into the next century is a recipe for higher taxes and \nslower economic growth. In my view, the best way to reduce the debt \nburden is to run a balanced Federal budget with firm controls on \nGovernment spending and to cut taxes that hinder economic growth. In \nthe event that Congress does cut tax rates and overhaul the tax system, \nwe could then decide to use any resulting tax revenue surplus to pay \ndown the debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles on this subject that \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and Washington \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 15, 1997]\n\n                     Why Pay Off the National Debt?\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       A balanced federal budget is not even law, much less \n     reality, but already a Republican congressman is proposing \n     legislation to deal with the surpluses he thinks will follow.\n       A surplus happens when the government raises more than it \n     spends. The last time was 1969, but we're getting closer. The \n     deficit for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30 will be \n     about $45 billion.\n       What to do with the extra revenues flowing into Washington? \n     Rep. Mark Neumann (R-Wis.), in a plan that's been embraced by \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich and become the hot fiscal topic of the \n     summer in conservative circles, wants to use the money to pay \n     off the national debt.\n       On its face, this sounds like a reasonable idea. It's \n     actually dangerous and distracting. First, it just won't \n     happen: If we start running surpluses, politicians will spend \n     them. That's not just a guess. Just look at this year's \n     budget. With pressure from a burgeoning deficit relaxed, \n     Congress and the White House devised a budget in May that \n     sharply increases the growth of spending.\n       But let's pretend that Congress and the president can \n     muster the discipline to enforce the Neumann plan. If \n     spending grows at 4 percent (which is, indeed, the rate in \n     the new budget) and if revenues grow at 5 percent (they've \n     been rising at 7 percent since 1992), then the entire \n     national debt can be wiped out by the year 2026 if we use the \n     excess cash to pay off Treasury bonds.\n       Isn't this an admirable goal? Not really. The federal debt, \n     which is the total of all the deficits we've piled up over \n     the years, isn't such a terrible thing--especially if it \n     remains at current levels. Right now it's about 50 percent of \n     our gross domestic product, but if we run balanced budgets \n     through 2026, it will fall to less than 25 percent of GDP--or \n     back to 1960's levels.\n       The argument about the evil of the federal debt is based on \n     a fallacy, which is that it's a burden on future generations \n     of Americans. This is what Neumann himself, a former math \n     teacher and real estate developer, means when he says he \n     wants children to ``inherit a debt-free nation.''\n       But this popular analysis misses half the equation. If we \n     simply balance budgets, then today's $5.4 trillion debt will \n     perpetually be on the Treasury's books. But that debt will be \n     balanced by $5.4 trillion in assets. Roughly four-fifths of \n     those assets--beautiful T-bonds--are held by Americans. Thus, \n     our children won't merely inherit debt, they'll inherit \n     bonds.\n       Neumann gripes about the $300 billion or so in interest on \n     that debt. But this money, in fact, is one of the few benign \n     federal spending programs. Private bondholders who earn \n     interest are likely to invest that money more productively \n     than Washington does.\n       And the interest earners aren't merely fat cats. A 1984 \n     Treasury study concluded, ``We find no basis for the belief \n     that interest payments on the public debt lead to greater \n     inequality in the distribution of income.'' Remember, the top \n     10 percent of Americans pay 59 percent of all income taxes, \n     so, in a worst case, interest is being paid by the rich to \n     the rich.\n       The point is that Americans, at the very same time, are \n     both borrowers and lenders, as Francis X. Cavanaugh, a former \n     Treasury Department official, explains in ``The Truth About \n     the National Debt.'' He also notes that Abraham Lincoln ``may \n     have been the only president to recognize both sides of the \n     ledger.''\n       In 1864, Lincoln told Congress, ``The great advantage of \n     citizens being creditors as well as debtors, with relation to \n     the public debt, is obvious. Men can readily perceive that \n     they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to \n     themselves.''\n       Lincoln was urging Congress to go into debt to pay military \n     expenses. Debt, in other words, is simply a way to get the \n     dollars to pay for what we want government to do. The other \n     way is taxes.\n       Debt and taxes are simply matters of financing. The truly \n     important public policy question is: What should government \n     do? Fight a war against slavery and on behalf of union? \n     Certainly. Fund railroads, corporate welfare and collective \n     health care systems? I don't think so.\n       But Congress keeps spending more and more. Total spending \n     will rise from $1.6 trillion in 1997 to $1.9 trillion in \n     2002--a rate well in excess of inflation.\n       Milton Friedman once said that he would rather have a $1 \n     trillion budget that is way out of balance than a $2 trillion \n     budget that is in balance. He's right. The true goal is to \n     reduce government spending. The aim of balancing the budget \n     (or running a surplus) is merely a tactic to secure the \n     prize: a smaller government that takes fewer resources and \n     limits fewer liberties.\n       Alas, Neumann, like so many Republicans, has been blinded \n     by balanced-budget rhetoric and missed this true goal. Under \n     his plan, for example, an incredible $33 billion out of the \n     surplus would go to replenish the highway trust fund, which \n     would mean more spending on pork. At a meeting last week, \n     Gingrich argued for appeasing big-spending Republicans like \n     the notorious Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster since they \n     represent one leg of the GOP ``three-legged stool.''\n       It's a stool that ought to be knocked over. Believers in \n     smaller government have a very simple job to do: Make it \n     smaller. When that happens, Americans will be able to keep \n     more of what they earn and the federal debt will simply \n     wither away.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 2, 1997]\n\n                    Misguided Strategy to Trim Debt\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       Last week, columnist Robert Novak reported that House \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich has ``enthusiastically embraced'' a \n     proposal by freshman GOP Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin to \n     begin paying off the national debt. Upon hearing this news, \n     Jack Kemp quickly shot a memo off to Mr. Gingrich strongly \n     urging him not to endorse the Neumann plan, saying it would \n     impose unnecessary austerity on American taxpayers. Instead \n     of paying off the debt, we should cut taxes, Mr. Kemp said.\n       The basis of the Neumann plan is that revenues probably \n     will rise faster than assumed in the budget agreement, \n     providing budget surpluses in future years. Based on past \n     experience, Mr. Neumann believes that revenues will rise \n     closer to 6 percent per year, rather than the 4 percent \n     growth assumed in the budget agreement. If spending is no \n     higher than projected by the agreement, this theoretically \n     would provide a budget surplus of almost $200 billion by \n     2002.\n       Mr. Neumann believes that if a surplus emerges it should \n     largely be used to retire public debt. His legislation would \n     earmark two-thirds of any surpluses to debt reduction and \n     only one-third to tax reduction. Furthermore, Mr. Neumann \n     believes that by holding the growth of spending to 1 percent \n     less than the growth of revenues, the entire national\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\n     debt can be paid off by 2026. This, he says, would save a \n     family of five $600 per month that they are now paying in \n     taxes for interest on the debt.\n       In truth, Mr. Neumann's plan isn't so much a bad one as a \n     misguided one. The likelihood of budget surpluses emerging \n     under any revenue assumption is absurd. The money will all be \n     spent long before any surplus arises. Moreover, his notion \n     that Congress can simply pass a law that will hold spending \n     to less than the growth of revenue is extraordinarily naive. \n     We tried that with Gramm-Rudman, and the first time the \n     spending cap began to pinch, Congress promptly repealed it.\n       Moreover, Mr. Neumann seems not to realize that his plan \n     actually implies a stiff tax increase. Revenues as a share of \n     gross domestic product would rise from 19.9 percent next year \n     to 20.8 percent in 2002, using his numbers and the \n     Congressional Budget Office's GDP forecast. Also, he made \n     a mathematical error in computing the cost of interest on \n     the debt. With net interest at $248 billion and a \n     population of 268 million, the actual cost of interest for \n     a family of five is $385 per month, not $600.\n       But the major problem with Mr. Neumann's proposal is a \n     misconception about the burden of debt. Interest on the debt \n     is no more a ``burden'' than the interest homeowners pay on \n     their mortgages each month. To think otherwise is to believe \n     that everyone who owns a home would be better off selling it \n     and renting instead, just so they can be debt-free. The \n     reason people don't do this is because they believe they are \n     better off with the house and the debt.\n       Of course, taxes are higher than they would be if there \n     were no debt. And if the debt could magically be extinguished \n     it would certainly be worth doing so. But maintaining a \n     higher tax burden than necessary to pay for current spending \n     just to reduce the debt is a terrible misuse of tax revenue. \n     The money would be far better spent eliminating the worst \n     federal taxes, those that are hindering growth and making it \n     harder to carry the debt.\n       In 1848, John Stuart Mill attacked a proposal similar to \n     Mr. Neumann's in England. ``I conceive that the increase of \n     revenue should rather be disposed of by taking off taxes, \n     than by liquidating debt,'' Mill wrote. Cutting taxes removes \n     a real burden on people, reducing debt does not.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 2, 1997]\n\n                          Invincible Ignorance\n\n       Democrats who want to retake Congress have found the issue \n     they've been looking for: It's the plan now being offered by \n     Republican Mark Neumann of Wisconsin and supported by Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich to run federal budget surpluses. If Republicans \n     embrace this idea, Dick Gephardt will be Speaker in no time.\n       Now that Republicans can at least claim to have balanced \n     the budget, if only in five years, they're looking for \n     something else to do. You might think tax reform or securing \n     pensions for the Baby Boomers would be in order. Mr. Neumann \n     wants to do nothing so tangible. Instead he wants Republicans \n     to stand for the abstraction of paying down the national debt \n     by the year 2026, even if it means taxing Americans at higher \n     rates than are needed to balance the federal books.\n       Both the economics and politics of this proposal make it \n     nutty even by Beltway standards. Mr. Neumann is like many \n     businessmen-turned-politicians who hold the mercantilist view \n     that debt is the worst economic evil. Adam Smith pointed out \n     the folly of this 200 years ago when he observed that the \n     point of economics isn't to collect gold in a nation's vault; \n     it is to improve the living standards of everyone.\n       Mr. Neumann would amass a modern-day gold hoard, which he \n     imagines would accumulate to pay Social Security for Baby \n     Boom retirees. This assumes politicians won't tap this \n     surplus in the meantime, despite 70 years of recent political \n     history. But even if the pols left the money alone, the \n     government would in essence merely be using that surplus to \n     buy back its own bonds. It wouldn't change Social Security's \n     actuarial problem one iota.\n       When the Baby Boomers begin to retire in 2012, the \n     government would still be faced with a choice of raising \n     taxes, cutting Social Security benefits or reissuing bonds \n     (i.e., reborrowing). Social Security benefits will always \n     have to be paid out of payroll taxes at the time or with \n     future borrowing. The best way to ensure higher tax revenues \n     is to grow a bigger economy in the meantime, but Mr. Neumann \n     would maintain higher tax rates that would reduce the \n     economy's growth potential. Mr. Neumann's proposal assumes \n     the federal government can create more wealth than private \n     Americans.\n       In any event, he misjudges the history and menace of debt. \n     Economists the economy, or GDP. This was as high as 111% in \n     1946, after we'd run up a debt to defeat Hitler--a cause \n     worth some debt. But it gradually fell back down again as \n     the economy expanded--to about 24% of GDP in 1974. It rose \n     again with the great inflation and spendthrift Congresses \n     of the past two decades, but it stabilized at 50% of GDP \n     in 1995 and is projected to decline slowly if Congress \n     shows any spending discipline.\n       Of course, Mr. Neumann also frets with other pols about \n     having to pay $250 billion in interest each year on the \n     national debt. But interest payments are the least \n     destructive spending the federal government does. At least it \n     doesn't subsidize lawsuits, dubious art or liberal lobbies.\n       The silver lining here, we suppose, is that this idea is so \n     politically dumb it would never really happen. Democrats \n     could campaign as balanced-budget liberals, proposing to \n     spend the new tax revenues on health care and children. In \n     response, Neumann Republicans would become the Debt \n     Retirement Party. This is the castor-oil path that has ruined \n     parties of the right in Europe and Canada. While Mr. Neumann \n     does propose to return one-third of any year's surplus in tax \n     relief, that message would be swamped by the two-thirds going \n     into the national vault.\n       In sum, the Neumann plan would return Republicans to their \n     historic role as ``tax collector for the welfare state.'' \n     That's what Mr. Gingrich once called Bob Dole, but with his \n     support for Mr. Neumann (Budget Chairman John Kasich is also \n     a co-sponsor) he owes Mr. Dole an apology. The Neumann plan \n     puts Mr. Gingrich squarely in the Hoover-Ford-Bush austerity \n     tradition of the GOP. The last Republican we heard such a \n     proposal from was none other than George Bush's budget \n     director, Dick Darman.\n       It's possible this New Darmanomics is a poll-driven \n     continuation of the GOP's balanced-budget myopia. But it may \n     also be a matter of simple ignorance. We can therefore hope \n     that economically literate Republcians--Majority Leader Dick \n     Armey, Senator Phil Gramm--will be able to educate their \n     colleagues. Short of that, we recommended to Mr. Neumann and \n     his allies Adam Smith's ``Wealth of Nations,'' or for a \n     shorter read, ``Hamilton's Blessing'' by John Steele Gordon. \n     They might learn something.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Up to $4.5 million of funds available to the \n     Department of Defense may be available for the payment of \n     claims for loss and damage to personal property suffered as a \n     direct result of the flooding in the Red River Basin during \n     April and May 1997 by members of the Armed Forces residing in \n     the vicinity of Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, \n     without regard to the provisions of section 3721(e) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I offer today with my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, an amendment that would prevent unintended \ndiscrimination against Grand Forks AFB personnel as the Defense \nDepartment provides compensation for personal property losses incurred \nas a result of this spring's unprecedented flooding in the Red River \nValley. This legislation has been requested by Air Force Secretary \nSheila E. Widnall, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, \nand the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Transportation Command, Gen. \nWalter Kross, with the support of Gen. Howell Estes, Commander in Chief \nof the U.S. Space Command.\n  As my colleagues are aware, last week I offered this amendment to the \nfiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill with Senators Dorgan, \nWellstone, Johnson, and Daschle. It was accepted by the Armed Services \nCommittee, but I look forward to its inclusion in the fiscal year 1998 \nDefense appropriations bill before us as well. This will ensure that \nboth defense measures passed by the Senate this year are in agreement \nthat disaster relief must be provided to personnel on an equitable \nbasis.\n  As I have discussed on the Senate floor on several occasions, Mr. \nPresident, this winter and spring were the most severe in my State's \nhistory, culminating in a 500-year flood. Damages to property stretched \ninto the billions, and the disruption to families and the community was \nincalculable.\n  Confronted with a disaster of almost Biblical proportions, the able \nmen and women of Grand Forks AFB helped fight the flood. They manned \n``sandbag central,'' helped evacuate the city of Grand Forks, and \nprovided shelter, food, and comfort to thousands of flood refugees. \nMany Air Force officers and enlisted personnel worked tirelessly, even \nas their homes were washed away, resulting in almost total personal \nproperty losses.\n  Fortunately, current law allows the Defense Department to provide \npersonal property compensation to personnel once personal insurance and \nany other Federal assistance has been exhausted. Separate compensation \nfrom the military is appropriate, Mr. President, in light of the fact \nthat servicemembers, their families, and their property have been put \nin harm's way as a result of assignment orders. Those residing in Grand \nForks AFB housing are currently able to benefit from this assistance.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, we have a catch 22 problem. The \nfamilies that suffered the most--those living off-base in the city of \nGrand Forks because of on-base housing shortages--are getting no help. \nThis is because existing law prevents ``Federal agencies from paying \nclaims for losses incident to service which occurs at residences not \nprovided by the United States,'' to quote an Air Force analysis.\n  Mr. President, the men and women of Grand Forks AFB were there when \ntheir country needed them. The amendment I have offered here again \ntoday would ensure that their country does not allow them to endure \nunfair and unintended discrimination in their hour of need. It would \nwaive the provision that prevents them from receiving assistance. This \naction would be consistent with earlier legislation passed in 1992 on \nbehalf of Homestead AFB personnel living off-base who had suffered as a \nresult of Hurricane Andrew.\n  On behalf of the more than 700 Air Force families living in the city \nof Grand Forks when the levees broke, I would like to extend my thanks \nagain to the Senate and the able leadership of the Armed Services \nCommittee for passing this amendment last week. Today, sincere thanks \nshould also go to the distinguished leadership of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, to Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye, \nfor their willingness to work with Senator Dorgan and myself to bring \nthe authorization and appropriations measures into agreement on this \nimportant matter.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to recognize again the \nexemplary work of everyone at Grand Forks AFB during this spring's \nflooding. In accepting thousands of flood refugees at the worst of the \ndisaster, the base provided warm, safe housing for countless families. \nThey also provided something else, something even more important--a \nsense of hope that has helped preserve Grand Forks' sense of community. \nAt a time when nearly the entire city was submerged by the rising \nfloodwaters and its most historic areas burned, the importance of this \ncannot be overstated.\n  Again, Mr. President, let me thank the committee and the Senate for \ntheir careful consideration of this amendment, which will ensure that \nall Air Force personnel in the flooded area are treated equitably. I \nlook forward to its approval as part of the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nappropriations bill, retention in conference, and passage into law.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on my flood \nrelief amendment, which is now pending to the defense appropriations \nbill.\n  As my colleagues know, this spring the Red River Valley suffered its \nworst flooding in recorded history. Personnel at Grand Forks Air Force \nBase pitched in to fight the flooding that everyone knew would come--\nthey helped operate ``Sandbag Central'' to enable volunteers to go to \nthe front lines on the dikes.\n  When the water finally won, a 500-year flood emptied Grand Forks, ND, \na city of 50,000 people, and sent 4,000 residents to the Grand Forks \nAir Force Base for shelter. Many of my colleagues saw on television the \nbase hangar that was converted to a shelter and that provided refuge \nfor those citizens.\n  What my colleagues may not know is that many of the base personnel \nwho fought the flood for weeks were themselves victims of the flood \nwhen it came. Over 700 military personnel were forced to evacuate \nduring this disaster. And 406 servicemembers have suffered losses to \npersonal property, including 95 families whose homes were inside the \ndiked area near the Red River and were extensively damaged.\n  However, without the flood relief authority my amendment would \nprovide, these servicemembers will be victims of unintended \ndiscrimination.\n  If these servicemembers had lived on base, they would be eligible to \nfile a claim with the Department of Defense for losses incident to \nservice. The Air Force pays such claims pursuant to section 3721 of \ntitle 31 of the United States Code. But as the law now stands, military \npersonnel living off base are not eligible to file such claims, even \nthough they are stationed at Grand Forks Air Force Base as a result of \ntheir military service.\n  My amendment would simply permit the Air Force to reimburse these \nservicemembers for their losses despite the fact that they lived off \nbase. It makes available up to $4.5 million of the funds already \navailable to the Department of Defense for paying claims.\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n  Let me assure my colleagues that this amendment supplements private \ninsurance and benefits provided by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency. Air Force claims practices and FEMA regulations prohibit \nduplicative benefits. Military members who have private insurance will \nbe required to file claims against that insurance before the Air Force \nwill pay claims under this amendment.\n  I understand that this amendment is acceptable to the Chairman, \nSenator Stevens, and to the ranking member, Senator Inouye. I thank \nthem very much for their support of this amendment, and for the work of \ntheir staffs in clearing this amendment.\n  I look forward to this amendment's approval by the Senate, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment is supported by the \nDepartment of the Air Force, and we are prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 850) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in the order pertaining to this bill that \nwas agreed to last evening, there is a second Dorgan amendment that I \nam authorized to withdraw. I ask that it be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. Is the amendment I have offered \ntogether with my friend from Hawaii, No. 846, still the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that the amendment \npending before the body is amendment No. 848 offered by the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there also pending behind that 846?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 851\n\n(Purpose: To set aside $36,000,000 of O funds for an authorized Navy \n   program to demonstrate expanded use of multi-technology automated \n   reader cards throughout the Navy and the Marine Corps, including \n demonstration of the use of the so-called ``smartship'' technology of \n            the ship-to-shore worked load/off load program)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nRobb of Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Robb, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 851.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8099. Of the total amount appropriated under title II \n     for the Navy, the Secretary of the Navy shall make \n     $36,000,000 available for a program to demonstrate expanded \n     use of multitechnology automated reader cards throughout the \n     Navy and the Marine Corps, including demonstration of the use \n     of the so-called ``smartship'' technology of the ship-to-\n     shore work load/off load program.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last evening the Senator from Hawaii and \nI discussed this amendment with the Senator from Virginia. We are \nconvinced that it will bring about savings of taxpayer funds and that \nit should be adopted at this time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The amendment (No. 851) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 846\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate my amendment No. 846.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 846.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Alaska.\n  The amendment (No. 846) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have now pending, under the orders \nagreed to last evening, the Feinstein amendment on land transfer, a \nFeinstein amendment on NATO expansion cost caps, the Graham amendment \non electronic combat testing, the pending Harkin merger cost amendment \nNo. 848, a managers' amendment from Senator Inouye, and one for myself, \nwhich we will join together, and two McCain amendments, one dealing \nwith foreign flag vessels, and one ``Buy America'' amendment.\n  I urge Members of the Senate to come and offer their amendments. We \nare asked by leadership to see if it is possible to finish this bill \nbefore the recess for the Tuesday meetings of both parties. The Senator \nfrom Hawaii and I are prepared to try to do that if Members would come \nand offer their amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 852\n\n                 (Purpose: To strike out section 8097)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 852.\n       Strike out section 8097.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment strikes section 8097 from \nthe Defense appropriations bill in its entirety.\n  This provision has nothing to do with national security issues. It is \npurely and simply an example of pork-barrel spending that has nothing \nto do with defense.\n  The provision earmarks $250,000 for the maritime technology program. \nDo not be deceived by the amount of money. The $250,000 is the \nbeginning of what could turn into a multimillion-dollar bailout for a \ncruise ship line and ships to be constructed in a certain shipyard.\n  The money would be used to establish a pilot project to transfer \ncommercial cruise shipbuilding technology to U.S. shipyards--on its \nface it is an innocuous idea, even though it doesn't have a lot to do \nwith national defense or anything--utilizing the experience of U.S. \nflag cruise ship operators, and protecting the operation of a foreign-\nbuilt U.S. flag cruise ship and two newly constructed U.S. flag cruise \nships around the Hawaiian Islands.\n  The last goal of the pilot project is, I suspect, the most important \nand most disturbing aspect of the program.\n  As I mentioned, this provision only earmarks $250,000. I also \nmentioned that money has nothing to do with defense.\n  The Maritech Program is a very limited program, and this $250,000 \nearmarked represents a large portion of available Maritech funds.\n  I suspect very strongly that this is not the end of the drain on \ndefense dollars for this cruise ship program. I fully expect to see \nmillions of dollars set aside to build these cruise ships and \nsubsequent bills, whether it is the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill this year or in next year's defense appropriations \nbill.\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\n  If the past is any indicator, this is just the beginning of a \nmultimillion-dollar waste of defense dollars.\n  Was the Commerce Committee asked to review this proposal? No.\n  Should the Commerce Committee have been asked to review this program? \nYes.\n  This provision waives three established laws:\n  One, it bypasses the established process for reviewing the Jones Act, \nPassenger Service Vessel Act, and coast-wise endorsement waivers.\n  Ordinarily, the Commerce Committee considers action on each requested \nwaiver. This legislation did not come before the Commerce Committee and \neffectively waives these laws for an unidentified foreign-built cruise \nship.\n  In my view, should the Commerce Committee approve this proposal as \nwritten? No.\n  Frankly, that is the precise reason this provision is in this bill \nand not in the Commerce Committee bill.\n  I wonder if anyone can tell me exactly how many cruise ship operators \ncan meet the exact criteria spelled out in the provision of the bill.\n  I quote:\n\n       $250,000 should be made available to assist with a pilot \n     project that will facilitate the transfer of commercial \n     cruise shipbuilding technology and expertise, and enable the \n     operation of a U.S. flag foreign-built cruise ship and two \n     newly constructed U.S. flagships.\n       That a person (including a related person with respect to \n     that person) within the meaning of 46 U.S.C. Section 801, may \n     not operate a U.S. flag foreign-built cruise ship, or any \n     other cruise ship, in coastwise trade between or among the \n     islands of Hawaii, upon execution of the contract referred to \n     in this section and continuing throughout the life expectancy \n     . . . of a newly constructed U.S. flag cruise ship referred \n     to in this section, unless the cruise ship is operated by a \n     person that is . . . operating a cruise ship in coastwise \n     trade between or among the islands of Hawaii on the date of \n     enactment, except if any cruise ship constructed pursuant to \n     this section operates in regular service other than between \n     or among the islands of Hawaii.\n       Provided further, That for purposes of this section, the \n     term ``cruise ship'' means a vessel that is at least 10,000 \n     gross tons . . . and the berth or stateroom accommodations \n     for at least 275 passengers.\n\n  Mr. President, the list goes on and on.\n  This is really unacceptable. This is really unacceptable.\n  In my view, I understand there is only one cruise ship operator in \nHawaii that can meet this criteria. Only one. And that operator is \nbeing handed a 30-year to 40-year monopoly for his existing business.\n  How many times has the U.S. Senate so blatantly set up a monopoly set \naside for any individual or business? Why would we want to start now? \nOn the very rare occasions that Congress has permitted a monopoly \noperation, such as Conrail, it was to ensure availability of adequate \ndomestic transportation in the absence of any other possible viable \nalternative.\n  I personally know of no other monopoly operation other than the \nConrail example.\n  Many of my colleagues in this Chamber profess to be concerned about \nthe growing consolidation in the defense industry, expressing worry \nthat overconsolidation will lead to monopolies in the defense industry.\n  I have long been a free trade advocate, and I believe in our existing \nreview. Why wouldn't that same concern about unfair anticompetitive \nrestrictions apply in this case? Why is this legislative monopoly \nnecessary?\n  The current operator of this cruise ship operation in Hawaii has \noperated for many years without this legislative protection. He is \nprotected from foreign competition under existing laws and does not \nneed the protection of Congress to replace his existing ship with new \nships.\n  What is the urgency of including this language in this defense \nappropriations bill, or, for that matter, in any other bill?\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that this provision was \ninserted in this bill. But it is not necessary. It wastes defense \ndollars, and it sets up an ill-considered monopoly for one single \nentity.\n  Mr. President, if this amendment is not stricken from the bill and it \nsurvives conference with the House, I would strongly recommend that the \nPresident of the United States, in the exercise of his line-item veto \nauthority, eliminate this egregious example of pork-barrel spending.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, 40 years ago the United States shipping \ninterests controlled the Mediterranean. Most of the cruise ships in the \nMediterranean, if I may remind my colleagues, were made in the United \nStates. They had crews of American sailors, and we carried passengers \nnot only from the United States but all over the world.\n  At the same time, we also dominated and controlled the cruise ship \nindustry in the Caribbean. The same is true in the Pacific. For that \nmatter, 40 years ago the United States shipping interests sailed the \nseven seas and controlled the seven seas.\n  Today, we have one company that has one cruise ship. No shipyard has \never made a cruise ship since 1956. That is 40 years. For 40 years, our \nshipyards have not built a cruise ship. Today, we have one, an old \nship.\n  And what is the situation? The fastest growing part of the tourist \nindustry of the world is cruise ships. We see that on television every \nnight, every 30 minutes on just about every channel--love boats, \nholiday boats, and most of the passengers are American. These cruise \nships are built in foreign shipyards, and they are manned by foreign \nsailors.\n  It may interest you to know that just last week the Wall Street \nJournal reported that cruise ship workers on foreign flag vessels work \nbetween 16 to 18 hours a day and get paid by the cruise lines about \n$1.50 a day before tips--$1.50 a day before tips. That is their take-\nhome pay because the cruise ship owner says, well, he has a free bunk; \nwe give him three meals a day. This is gravy for him, $1.50 a day.\n  That is why we cannot compete with them. We insist that all of our \nships maintain the highest health standards. Wage and hour provisions \nthat apply here in the Nation's Capital will apply on cruise ships \nmanned by Americans. The cruise ships operating in the Hawaiian waters \ntoday pay not minimum wage but union declared wages. They are much, \nmuch higher than union wage, and they get paid more than $1.50 an hour.\n  Many of us felt that the time had come to stop this, to reinvigorate \nthe industry, and we came up with this plan. This plan reminds us of \nwhat happened to the United States in World War II--for that matter in \nWorld War I--the Korean conflict, and even in Vietnam. Since we do not \nhave a fleet of troop carriers, we have always had to call upon private \nshipowners to come forth with their passenger vessels, convert them \ninto troop carriers, and sail the seven seas.\n  Mr. President, as a young man of 18, I crossed the Pacific on a \nluxury cruise ship which was converted into a troop carrier. Going \nacross the Atlantic, I am sorry to say, it was not a cruise ship; it \nwas a tanker, but there were many other cruise ships in operation at \nthat time.\n  This program, the Meritech Program, has been authorized. It has been \noperational. And up until now they have come up with plans on how to \nbring about the construction by private industry of passenger vessels \nthat can be converted for defense purposes if the need should arise. \nThis provision in this bill is to implement those plans.\n  I can assure you, if the Senator from Arizona wishes, we will put in \nclear language that says this ship will be built with private funds. I \ncan assure one and all that if this will satisfy my friend from \nArizona, I would like this language put in the appropriate place: \n``Provided further, that none of the funds provided in this or any \nother act may be obligated for the construction of vessels addressed by \nthis section.''\n  If it is appropriate, I ask that this provision be made part of the \nbill before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will ask, does the Senator ask \nunanimous consent----\n  Mr. INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To place the appropriate language in the \nlegislation?\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I just want to clarify, I understand that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My reservation is as follows. My understanding is that \nthe Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii are willing to \nmodify the language of the bill that states that no Federal money will \nbe spent for the construction of a cruise ship or the tooling up of a \nshipyard for that construction. If that is correct, then I appreciate \nthe agreement of the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from Alaska \nand we will make that change and propose that change shortly.\n\n  Is that the intent of the Senator from Hawaii?\n  Mr. INOUYE. That is the intent of the language. I believe the \nlanguage is clear.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside my amendment at this \ntime and we will revisit it when the language, modifying language is \nmade up, and I will at that time make a motion to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have another amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Does it mean that \nthe McCain amendment is set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is it the intention of the Senator from Hawaii \nunder the UC agreement that his legislation has been modified under the \nprevious UC request?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Presiding Officer is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a little bit of a parliamentary \nsituation here. It is not clear to me whether the language of the \nlegislation will be modified--and then I would ask unanimous consent to \ndrop my amendment--or is it language that will be added to the \namendment which would then be acceptable? I would ask the President as \nto what the parliamentary situation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for a moment.\n  If there is no objection, the unanimous consent request by the \nSenator from Hawaii will be considered as an amendment to the bill by \nthe Senator from Alaska. Upon passage, then the Senator from Arizona \ncould be recognized to withdraw his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 854\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 854.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert: ``: Provided further, \n     That none of the funds provided in this or any other Act may \n     be obligated for the tooling to construct or the construction \n     of vessels addressed by this section''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 854) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 852, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment, the \npending McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then the amendment No. 852 is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 852) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 853\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to waive limitations \n applicable to uses of funds for procurements from foreign sources as \n               necessary to protect cooperative programs)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have another amendment at the desk, and \nI ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 853.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (a) The Secretary of Defense shall waive \n     generally with respect to a foreign country each limitation \n     on procurements from foreign sources provided in law if the \n     Secretary determines that the application of the limitation \n     with respect to that country would impede cooperative \n     programs entered into between the Department of Defense and \n     the foreign country, or would impede arrangements for the \n     reciprocal procurement of defense items entered into under \n     section 2531 of title 10, United States Code, or under any \n     other provision of law, and the country does not discriminate \n     against defense items produced in the United States to a \n     greater degree than the United States discriminates against \n     defense items produced in that country.\n       (b) Subsection (a) applies with respect to--\n       (1) contracts and subcontracts entered into on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) options for the procurement of items that are exercised \n     after such date under contracts that are entered into before \n     such date if the option prices are adjusted for any reason \n     other than the application of a waiver granted under \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Subsection (a) does not apply to a limitation regarding \n     construction of warships.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a simple and straightforward \namendment that simply levels the playing field between U.S. and foreign \nmanufacturers. This amendment promotes U.S. products, not by enforcing \nrestrictive barriers on open competition and free trade, but by \npromoting sound and beneficial economic principles.\n  This amendment waives restrictions on the procurement of certain \ndefense items with respect to a foreign country if the Secretary of \nDefense determines they would impede cooperative programs entered into \nbetween a foreign country and the Department of Defense. Additionally, \nit would waive protectionist practices if it is determined it would \nimpede the reciprocal procurement of defense items in that foreign \ncountry and that foreign country does not discriminate against defense \nitems produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United \nStates discriminates against defense items in that country. This \namendment would apply to all contracts and subcontracts entered into on \nor after the date of enactment, including any option for the \nprocurement of items that are entered into before the date of enactment \nif those option prices are adjusted for any other reason.\n  I have spoken of this issue before in this Chamber and the potential \nimpact on our bilateral trade relations with our allies because of our \npolicy toward Buy America. From a philosophical point of view, I oppose \nthese type of protectionist trade policies because I believe free trade \nis an important component of improved relations among all nations and a \nkey to major U.S. economic growth.\n  From a practical standpoint, adherence to Buy America restrictions \nseriously impairs our ability to compete freely in international \nmarkets for the best price on needed military equipment and could also \nresult in a loss of existing business from longstanding international \ntrading partners. While I fully understand the arguments by some to \nmaintain certain critical industrial base capabilities, I find no \nreason to support domestic source restrictions for products which are \nwidely available from many U.S. companies, that is, pumps produced by \nno less than 25 U.S. companies. I believe that competition and open \nmarkets among our allies on a reciprocal basis provide the best \nequipment at the best price for U.S. and allied militaries alike.\n  There are many examples of trade imbalances resulting from \nunnecessary Buy America restrictions. Let me cite one case in point. \nBetween 1991 and 1994, the Netherlands purchased $508 million in \ndefense equipment from United States companies, including air-refueling \nplanes, Chinook helicopters, Apache helicopters, F-16 fighter \nequipment, missiles, combat radios, and training equipment. During the \nsame period, the United States purchased only $40 million of Dutch-made \nmilitary equipment. In recent meetings, the Defense Ministers of the \nUnited Kingdom and Sweden have apprised me of similar situations. In \nevery meeting, they tell me how difficult it\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nis becoming to persuade their governments to buy American defense \nproducts, because of our protectionist policies and the growing Buy \nEuropean sentiment.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that this amendment will end \nonce and for all the anticompetitive, antifree trade practices that \nencumber our Government. I only look forward to the day when my trips \nto the floor to highlight Buy America provisions are no longer \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial by Secretary \nWeinberger and Dr. Schweizer that appeared in today's USA Today be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, July 15, 1997]\n\n         Pentagon Lopping Off Military Muscle in Favor of Pork\n\n             (By Caspar W. Weinberger and Peter Schweizer)\n\n       In 1938, the British Royal Navy counted 308 ships on its \n     active roster, and Great Britain ruled the waves. This \n     massive armada required 11,270 admiralty officials and \n     clerical staff for its management. Thirty years later, the \n     British Navy was down to just 114 ships, a decline of more \n     than 60%. However, the number of brass hats and \n     administrators had increased to 33,574. At its peak, the \n     British Navy required 37 desk sailors per ship. At its low \n     point, 295.\n       C. Northcote Parkinson tracked these trends and proclaimed \n     what eventually became known as one of Parkinson's famous \n     laws: The number of subordinates increases at a fixed rate \n     regardless of the amount of work produced. What was true for \n     a declining Britain is applicable to present-day America. Fat \n     in the military bureaucracy continues to expand at the \n     expense of military muscle. Congressional action to limit \n     further base closings last week and the recently released \n     Quadrennial Defense Review does nothing to correct this \n     dangerous reality. The Pentagon is putting the best possible \n     light on further reductions of 60,000 active-duty troops, \n     arguing that cuts are necessary in order to procure more \n     advanced weapons. But choosing between force size and \n     weaponry is a lose-lose situation. We need both large forces \n     and advanced weapons to maintain our battlefield edge and \n     minimize U.S. casualties. What we need to cut is fat.\n       Just how badly has our military ``muscle'' been affected? \n     The stated policy of the United States is to be able to fight \n     two wars at once. But as Professors Frederick Kagan and David \n     Fautua of the United States Military Academy point out, we \n     would have trouble fighting and winning one war today. \n     Consider our victory in Desert Storm. The United States \n     committed seven active Army divisions, three Marine Corps \n     divisions and two additional combat brigades from other units \n     to the ground war. Of the seven Army divisions, five were \n     ``heavy'' units--mechanized and armor. We were able to build \n     this force from a total of 18 Army divisions. Now we have but \n     10 Army divisions, and only six are ``heavy.'' Many are \n     already committed to other overseas assignments such as Korea \n     and, therefore, would be unavailable for a regional conflict.\n       Since Desert Storm, defense spending has declined 24% in \n     constant dollars, and manpower has been cut 27%. The Navy has \n     lost 34% of its ships. Air Force tactical squadrons have been \n     cut by 28%. Budget cuts also have led to a reduction in \n     our overseas presence. By 2000, about 90% of our combat \n     power will be based in the continental United States. Lack \n     of funds means we may not even reach the battlefield. The \n     Army's capability to deploy forces has dropped 44% and the \n     Navy's support ships, critical for overseas operations, \n     have been slashed 61% since 1991.\n       But budget cuts not only have led to force reductions. \n     Existing units have been dramatically hurt by serious \n     training deficiencies. At Camp Pendleton, Marines have \n     trekked 17 miles to training ranges to conserve truck fuel \n     and tires. Air Force personnel are now regularly deployed \n     overseas well beyond the recommended 120-day maximum, causing \n     serious psychological and training problems. Some tank crews \n     have been forced to park their tanks and conduct training \n     dismounted, walking around pretending to be tanks, in order \n     to cut costs.\n       The great paradox is that this small and grossly \n     underfunded military has been called on to increase its \n     overseas operations. Our two post-Cold War commanders-in-\n     chief--Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton--have \n     dispatched troops abroad more often than the United States \n     did in the previous 20 years. The military has conducted \n     expensive operations in Haiti, Rwanda, Liberia, Cuba, Panama, \n     Southwest Asia, Iraq and Somalia. Rather than deal with this \n     squeeze, the defense review calls for further reductions.\n       The military has already borne a disproportionate share of \n     cuts and now accounts for less than 20% of the federal \n     budget. Of the federal jobs lost since fiscal 1992, more than \n     89% have come from the Department of Defense. Rather than \n     cutting forces as the defense review recommends, troop levels \n     should be maintained at present levels. Savings should come \n     from cuts in civilian personnel and nondefense programs, not \n     out of the military's core competence of fighting wars. Today \n     the Pentagon spends more than 40% of this budget on \n     infrastructure, running cafeterias and day-care centers and \n     paying accountants. The only portions of the budget that have \n     grown since the end of the Cold War have been for the Defense \n     Logistics Agency, which handles warehousing, inventory \n     control and the transport of supplies, and the Defense \n     Finance and Accounting Service, which manages payroll and \n     budget. Many of these functions could be privatized. The \n     Pentagon estimates privatization could save $14 billion. \n     Others put the savings at $30 billion.\n       Reductions also could come from programs that have been \n     foisted on the Pentagon that have nothing to do with defense. \n     About $28 billion is being spent on environmental compliance \n     and cleanup. Millions are going to a jobs program that \n     updates the Bay Area Rapid Transit System. These programs may \n     be worthwhile, but they shouldn't be funded with scarce \n     defense resources.\n       The defense review fails to deal with the underlying \n     resource problems that plagues the military. Let's prove \n     Parkinson wrong by preserving our military capability and \n     lopping off the fat.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that this amendment is \nacceptable to the managers of S. 1005. I have discussed this with the \nSenators from Alaska and Hawaii and both staffs. Basically, as I said, \nit gives discretion to the Secretary of Defense as far as restrictive \nBuy America provisions are concerned. This amendment gives the \nSecretary of Defense the kind of latitude that is necessary in order to \nmake sure that our national security and warfighting capability is \nprotected.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. We find no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding this is quite similar to a \nprovision that is already in the armed services bill. And under those \ncircumstances we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nHearing none, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 853) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from \nAlaska for their cooperation and assistance on both amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. It is my understanding the Harkin \namendment is ready to go to a vote at any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending question before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We still have three amendments that could be offered \nbefore the lunch hour, and that is the Feinstein amendments and the \nGraham amendment.\n  Mr. President, there is in the order a managers' package that enables \nme to offer an amendment. I do offer the amendment. It is the only item \nin this managers' package. It is the amendment of the Senator from \nIndiana [Mr. Coats].\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 855\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside for the Information System Security Program \n $15,708,000 of the amount provided for the Army for other procurement)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk for Mr. \nCoats and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Coats, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 855.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 24, line 6, after ``2000'' insert the following: \n     ``: Provided, That, of the amount appropriated under this \n     heading, $15,708,000 is available for the Information System \n     Security Program, of which $5,500,000 is available for \n     procurement of Airterm KY-100 devices''.\n\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this conforms this bill to an authorized \naccount that was added to the authorization bill when it passed the \nSenate, and I urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. INOUYE. We concur.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 855) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I implore Senators Feinstein and Graham \nto offer their amendments. We are ready to proceed. I think we could \nfinish the bill before the lunch hour. I see the Senator from Texas is \non the floor, and I yield the floor to her in the hope she will yield \nthe floor to the others if they arrive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 849\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I assure the distinguished chairman, \nif the other two pending amendments' authors come to the floor, I will \nyield.\n  I wanted to speak about an amendment that has just been agreed to. \nThe chairman offered the Hutchison-Lott-Lieberman-McCain-Warner \namendment earlier. It is something we have been working on, actually, \nfor the last few days, trying to come up with language that everyone \ncould support. In fact, everyone has now agreed to support it, so it is \na sense of the Senate with 100 percent approval of language that says \nwe are very concerned about the situation in Bosnia, we are concerned \nabout the indicted war criminals not being brought to justice. All of \nus are concerned about that, because, under the Dayton accords, the \nthree parties to the agreement, the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Muslims, \nand the Croats, were supposed to do that and it has not happened.\n  At the same time, our amendment states that the administration should \nconsult closely and in a timely manner with the Congress on the NATO-\nled Stabilization Force's mission concerning the apprehension of \nindicted war criminals, including any changes in the mission which \ncould affect American forces. I think this is a very responsible \nstatement for the Senate to make because it is very important if there \nis a change in mission with regard to the apprehension of war criminals \nand if American forces are going to be involved, that the Congress \nunderstand that fully because that is not our understanding today nor \nis it part of the Dayton accords.\n  So, having been burned in Somalia when there was mission creep \nwithout the complete accord of Congress, I think it is important that \nwe learn from history and take the responsible role that Congress \nshould take.\n  I am concerned that we do this in a very, very clear thinking, \nresponsible way. I look at the Washington Times from this morning where \nthe headline is, ``Serbs Threaten End Of Dayton Pact.'' It has a quote \nfrom an ex-teacher--an ex-teacher. He says: ``I used to wave to them, \nthe NATO troops, and had my little daughter wave when they pass by. But \nnow I told her to spit at them.''\n  I think we have to understand that what we do has consequences. I \nhope NATO will carefully look at how we go about changing any kind of \nmission. Certainly we expect, in Congress, to have a role in that. But \nI also think it is important that we go back to the Dayton accords. The \nDayton accords provide the three parties will apprehend war criminals. \nI hope that is what happens, because there were heinous crimes \ncommitted--heinous crimes. No civilized nation, no civilized person \ncould look at what happened in Srebrenica--it was clearly an \nassassination of men and boys. It was ethnic cleansing. That's what it \nactually was. We ought to stand against that. We do stand against it.\n  But, let's make sure that as we go forward we do it in a measured, \nresponsible way so what we do is helpful, that we keep the Dayton \naccords, and that we do not have mission creep with American troops \nthat would put them in harm's way, or in a combat situation if they are \nnot prepared--if we are not prepared--for that eventuality.\n  So I think we have taken a responsible step. I appreciate the work of \nthe chairman. I appreciate the work of the Democrats and Republicans on \nthis issue where we do want to speak with a unified voice. It is \nimportant that we do. That is what we have done today.\n\n\n                     passenger safety modifications\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman and the \ncommittee for adding funds for passenger safety modifications for the \nAir Force. The committee's initiative is both timely and appropriate \nand recognizes the need to provide the most up-to-date available safety \nequipment to aircraft transporting our military personnel. I would like \nto clarify a point with the chairman. Mr. Chairman, is the $75 million \nadded by the committee for aircraft passenger safety modifications to \nbe sent on the acquisition of navigation and safety equipment to \ninitiate phase II of the Defense Department's initiative to modify \nmilitary passenger aircraft? Is it the intent of the committee that \nthis additional funding be spent on the following equipment and \ntechnologies: enhanced Ground Proximity warning Systems [EGPWS] with a \ndigital terrain data base, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance \nSystems [TCAS], predictive windshear radar, cockpit voice recorders, \nand flight data recorders?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. The Air Force has indicated \nspecifically that EGPWS and TCAS for selected aircraft are part of the \nphase II modifications. The Air Force also has unfunded requirements \nfor flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders. The committee \nappreciates the Senator's interest and leadership on this issue.\n\n\n                UH-60L BLACK HAWK IN THE NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would greatly appreciate it if my \ncolleagues, the chairman of the appropriations Committee and the \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee would join \nwith me in a colloquy regarding the committee's support for a \nfirefighting demonstrator kit for the UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter for \nthe Army National Guard. It is my understanding that the Army National \nGuard needs and wants improved capability on its UH-60L Black Hawk \nhelicopter to enable them to more effectively augment the firefighting \ncapabilities of State and local government other Federal agencies.\n  To this end, the Army is pursuing a cooperative research and \ndevelopment agreement or CRADA with Sikorsky Aircraft to obtain this \ndemonstrator aircraft. Once received, this modified Black Hawk will be \nused in a 3-month, National Guard, operational suitability test with \nthe Los Angeles County Fire Department.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of this firefighting demonstration kit for \nthe Black Hawk helicopter. I agree that this program should be treated \nas any other item of special interest in the National Guard and Reserve \nMiscellaneous Equipment account, and am happy to support the Senator \nregarding this issue.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I, too, am a strong supporter of this firefighting kit. \nCalifornia is especially hard hit, each year, by wildfires and I fully \nunderstand the great resources necessary to battle these fires. I am \nhappy to join with the chairman of the committee in urging that this \nprogram be given high priority in the National Guard and Reserve \nmiscellaneous equipment account.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank both the Chairman and the ranking member for \ntheir interest in this program and their support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 856\n\n (Purpose: To express the Sense of Congress regarding cost-sharing for \n                           NATO enlargement)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feinstein, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 856:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.    . SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the Sense of Congress that should the Senate ratify \n     NATO enlargement, current proportional cost-sharing \n     arrangements will remain in place and that the proportional \n     cost of the U.S. share of the NATO common budget should not \n     increase.\n\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Defense appropriations bill which expresses the Sense of Congress \nthat U.S. payment for the cost of NATO enlargement is contingent on our \nNATO allies' willingness to pay their fair share of the costs of NATO \nenlargement as well.\n  I was concerned and surprised to read French President Chirac's \nstatement last week that ``France does not intend to raise its \ncontribution to NATO because of the cost of enlargement.''\n  Mr. President, we all know that NATO enlargement will cost money. And \nthose costs must be borne fairly by all members.\n  If France or Germany or any other member of NATO is unwilling to pay \nits fair share, then this seems to me to be a faulty foundation for the \nexpansion of NATO.\n  Indeed, as an article in the July 14-20 issue of Defense News stated:\n\n       Its decision to admit new members threatens to tear the \n     Western alliance asunder if the European allies fail to \n     shoulder a larger proportion of NATO's future security costs, \n     according to U.S. and European diplomats and analysts.\n\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make clear that the United States \nis willing to pay its share of the cost of NATO enlargement. No more. \nNo less.\n  But this amendment also makes clear that if the Europeans are \nunwilling to pay their share of the costs, then the United States will \nnot pay either.\n  The bottom line is that the costs should be fairly met and paid for \nby all Alliance members. The United States can not and should not pick \nup the share of European countries unwilling to do their part.\n  This amendment, I believe, sends a strong message to our European \nallies as we enter into the NATO enlargement process that if we are to \nenlarge the alliance it must be done fairly, and it must be done right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the pending \nFeinstein amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Rescinding Action on Amendment 856\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I find I acted prematurely. I ask the \npast action be rescinded and the Feinstein amendment remain the pending \nmeasure before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will take that under consideration.\n  Upon considering the request by the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1005, the \nDefense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. The pending bill \nprovides $247.2 billion in total budget authority and $244.4 billion in \ntotal outlays for the Department of Defense. There are some major \nelements to this bill that are important programs for the Senate to \nreview.\n  According to preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the bill, as reported, is within the Defense Subcommittee's \nsection 602(b) allocation and, thus, complies with the requirements of \nthe Budget Act.\n  The bill is fully consistent with the bipartisan balanced budget \nagreement. Senators may have heard or read statements to the contrary, \nbut I can assure them that the bill in no way transgresses the \nagreement. I can also assure Senators that any misunderstanding in the \nadministration about this matter is in the process of being clarified.\n  The bill fully funds certain important initiatives that were \nrequested by the President, including a 2.8 percent pay raise for all \nmilitary personnel and the end strengths for all of the active and \nreserve military services. The bill also funds needed increases in each \nof the major accounts of the defense budget.\n  The Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the \nSubcommittee staff deserve the thanks of the Senate for their extremely \nskillful crafting of this bill. It makes the best possible use of the \ndefense funds available and sustains our national defense posture \nconsistent with the Defense Department's new roadmap, the Quadrennial \nDefense Review.\n  I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Senate Budget Committee \ntable displaying the budget impact of this bill be placed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                S. 1005, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL               \n                                         [Fiscal year 1998, $ millions]                                         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Defense  Nondefense    Crime   Mandatory    Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n  Budget authority.........................................   246,981  ..........  ........        197   247,178\n  Outlays..................................................   244,202          7   ........        197   244,406\nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority.........................................   246,988  ..........  ........        197   247,185\n  Outlays..................................................   244,232          7   ........        197   244,436\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority.........................................   243,698         27   ........        197   243,922\n  Outlays..................................................   243,409         31   ........        197   243,637\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority.........................................  ........  ..........  ........  .........  ........\n  Outlays..................................................  ........  ..........  ........  .........  ........\n                                                                                                                \n             SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:                                                                  \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority.........................................

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Pilot Program Tagging Hydrocarbon Fuels\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to enter \na colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens. As the chairman knows, title III, subtitle \nC, section 339 of the recently adopted Defense authorization bill \nprovides for the Secretary of Defense to conduct a pilot program to \ndetermine if hydrocarbon fuels used by the Department of Defense can be \ntagged for analysis and identification. Mr. President, $5 million was \nauthorized to conduct this program.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, who ably serves on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nis correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is anticipated that this program will deter theft, \naid in the investigation of fuel theft, and facilitate determining the \nsource of surface and underground pollution in locations where the \nDepartment and civilian companies maintain separate fuel storage \nfacilities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct in her description of this \nprogram as approved by the authorizing committee and the full Senate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is my understanding that this pilot program could \nalso be funded through title IV of the pending bill, research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation, particularly the Defense-wide \nfunding provisions.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, the Senator is correct on the likely source of \nfunding for this pilot program.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I look forward to learning the results \nof this pilot program and thank my distinguished chairman for his able \nassistance. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 848\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair \nplace before the Senate the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Bumpers, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 858.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  . FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) the Department of Defense budget is insufficient to \n     fulfill all the requirements on the unfunded priorities lists \n     of the military services and defense agencies;\n       (b) the documented printing expenses of the Department of \n     Defense amount to several hundred million dollars per year, \n     and a similar amount of undocumented printing expenses may be \n     included in external defense contracts;\n       (c) printing in two or more colors generally increases \n     costs;\n       (d) the Joint Committee on Printing of the Congress of the \n     United States has established regulations intended to protect \n     taxpayers from extravagant government printing expenses;\n       (e) the Government Printing and Binding Regulations \n     published by the Joint Committee on Printing direct that, \n     ``... it is the responsibility of the head of any department, \n     independent office or establishment of the Government to \n     assure that all multicolor printing shall contribute \n     demonstrable value toward achieving a greater fulfillment of \n     the ultimate end-purpose of whatever printed item in which it \n     is included.''\n       (f) the Department of Defense publishes a large number of \n     brochures, calendars, and other products in which the use of \n     multicolor printing does not appear to meet the demonstrably \n     valuable contribution requirement of the Joint Committee on \n     Printing, but instead appears to be used primarily for \n     decorative effect; and\n       (g) the Department of Defense could save resources for \n     higher priority needs by reducing printing expenses:\n       Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should ensure that the \n     printing costs of the Department of Defense and military \n     services are the lowest amount possible;\n       (2) the Department of Defense should strictly comply with \n     the Printing and Binding Regulations published by the Joint \n     Committee on Printing of the Congress of the United States.\n       (3) that the Department of Defense budget submission for FY \n     1999 should reflect the savings that will result from the \n     stricter printing guidelines in (1) and (2).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Bumpers \namendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 858) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that all of the \namendments that were ordered to be called up, or had the right to be \ncalled up under order 108 entered into last night have now been \ndisposed of. Is that the opinion of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It appears that the amendments on that list \nhave been offered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know of no further amendments.\n\n\n               United States Military Presence in Bermuda\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week I had worked out an amendment with \nthe managers of the national defense authorization bill that provided \nfor the Secretary of Defense to study and report on the status of \nenvironmental problems in Bermuda associated with the United States \nmilitary presence on that island for more than 50 years. Senator \nInhofe, the subcommittee chairman was particularly helpful in working \nwith me.\n  Inadvertently that amendment was not included in the managers en bloc \namendment package on Friday afternoon. However, I am very grateful to \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Arms Services Committee that, by \nunanimous consent, they have agreed to include this amendment in the \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, for more than 50 years, United States military \npersonnel were deployed to bases on the Island of Bermuda. In fact, \nUnited States bases occupied approximately one-tenth of Bermuda's land \narea. The 1941 Leased Bases Agreement formalized the conditions under \nwhich the United States military remained in Bermuda until 1995. The \nUnited States was not charged a penny in rent for its use of these \nproperties during all of that period.\n  I know that the distinguished ranking member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Inouye, is fully aware of the \nquestions that have been raised related to the United States military \npresence in Bermuda. I would ask him whether he believes that this is \nsomething that the Secretary of Defense should look into?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut that I am aware of matters related to the bases in Bermuda. \nI know, for example, that the bases in Bermuda very effectively \ncontributed to United States. national security during World War II and \nthroughout the cold war. I am also aware that with changed world \ncircumstances, it became clear during the 1990's, that it was no longer \nnecessary for the U.S. military to continue to maintain bases there. \nAnd, on September 1, 1995, U.S. military forces formally withdrew from \nthe island.\n  Certainly it seems very logicial for the Secretary of Defense to be \nasked to look into matters related to our presence there.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, I know that my distinguished colleague from \nHawaii knows well that Bermuda is actually a tiny group of islands, 21 \nsquare miles in land area. Its environmental situation is unique in \nmany respects--land is obviously scarce, fresh water resources are very \nlimited, and storage capacity for hazardous waste disposal doesn't \nexist. It is also one of the most northerly coral reef areas, making \nthe marine environment surrounding the island extremely fragile as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I call to the attention of my distinguished colleague \nfrom Hawaii that it would appear that the formerly United States \noccupied properties that have now reverted back to Bermudian \nauthorities could pose a number of problems for that Government--\nproblems that they are now seeking our help in ameliorating. These \nproblems include soil and ground water pollution and asbestos hazards \ncontained in now deserted U.S. military installations on the bases.\n  For example, most of the buildings on the bases will require \ndemolition, if this property is to be useable again. That means that \nthe hazardous asbestos must also be removed and appropriately stored. \nIn addition, industrial wastes and raw sewage that were disposed of in \nBassett's Cave over time will pose a threat to parts of the island's \nwater system unless they are removed. Underground and above-ground \npetroleum storage tanks--many in poor condition--are leaking into \nsurrounding soils and ground water. Left behind landfills are also \ncausing environmental problems.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Connecticut \nthat I believe that President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and others \nin this administration care deeply about environmental issues. Clearly \nthe United States cannot resolve every environmental problem that \nexists in every part of the globe. However, under the circumstances, \ngiven the special relationship between the United States and Bermuda, \nit is particularly appropriate for the Secretary of Defense to study \nthis problem and report back to the relevant committees. I will look \nforward to reading that report.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for his \ninterest in this matter. I too look forward to being kept informed \nabout progress on this issue.\n\n\n                           QDR IMPLEMENTATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR] outlined a \ndirection for the Air Force to consolidate force structure and reduce \nmanpower. Included in the QDR is a proposal to transfer one active duty \nfighter wing to the reserve forces. General Fogleman recently informed \nme that the Air Force was specifically exploring a number of options to \naccomplish this directive.\n  Because of the changes that may occur as the Department of Defense \ndownsizes, I would expect the Air Force to alert Congress as important \ndecisions are made, and will outline the rationale behind their \nconclusions. Is it the chairman's expectation that this will be the \ncase?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator raises a good point. I would expect the Air \nForce to inform Congress of major decisions, such as the one to which \nthe Senator was referring. I would also expect the Air Force to be able \nto outline sound reasons for their actions.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chairman, as the Air Force determines where fighter \nunits will be located, these decisions will inevitably impact how our \ntest and training ranges are utilized. Consequently, I believe it would \nalso be reasonable for the Air Force to outline how changes in force \nstructure will impact the use of test and training ranges.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe this is a reasonable request, and I expect the \nAir Force to outline impacts of test and training range utilization as \na result of changes in force structure to the Congress.\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE LEGACY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Members of the Senate may have read in the \npapers a few weeks ago about the discovery of a Revolutionary War \ngunboat found in the waters of Lake Champlain, bordering my home State \nof Vermont. There, perfectly preserved in the cold, fresh, dark water, \nlying upright on the bottom, is a 54-foot gunboat, its mast still \nstanding and its bow cannon in place.\n  This gunboat is one of eight led by Benedict Arnold against the \nBritish in the Battle of Valcour Island on October 11, 1776. Only four \nvessels survived the battle, but the British were forced to delay their \ninvasion from Canada for an extra year, giving the Americans critical \ntime to prepare defenses.\n  Mr. President, this historic find led the former curator of naval \nhistory at the Smithsonian's American History Museum, Mr. Philip \nLundeberg, to say, ``This could prove to be the most significant \nmaritime discovery in American history in the last half century.''\n  The exact location of the ship is a secret, and it will not be \ntouched until maritime archeologists, working with the Navy and local \nauthorities, develop a comprehensive management plan to preserve and \nprotect this amazing discovery. The ship may be left as an underwater \nmuseum, or it may be feasible to raise and preserve it. We will not \nknow until the management plan is completed.\n  In the bill before the Senate today, the Appropriations Committee \nfunded a modest program called Legacy, which coordinates cultural \nresource management efforts among the four military services. I ask my \nfriend from Alaska, will the Senator support my effort in conference \nwith the other body to designate a small amount of Legacy funding to \ndevelop the management plan that will preserve and protect this \nimportant historical find?\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This discovery is one of the great military history \nfinds in memory, and I believe that we have an obligation to ensure \nthat this ship is properly preserved. This type of discovery is why the \ncommittee created the Legacy Program in 1991, under the leadership of \nthe senior Senator from Hawaii. I strongly support the proposal of the \nSenator from Vermont, and I am hopeful that his view will prevail in \nconference.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his consideration.\n\n\n                   Operation and Maintenance Account\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of this bill, Senator Stevens, in a colloquy concerning the \nfunding of the operation and maintenance account for the Department of \nthe Army.\n  For some time, I have been concerned about the deteriorating \nconditions of the historic buildings at the Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter Annex at Forest Glen, MD. In response to my amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act last year, the Department of the \nArmy recently submitted a Comprehensive Plan for the Basic Repair and \nStabilization for the Historic District of the Forest Glen Annex. This \nplan identified the need for $9.8 million in fiscal 1998 to take care \nof the critical needs for stabilization of the historic buildings at \nthe Forest Glen Annex.\n  I want to inquire whether there is sufficient funding within the \nArmy's real property maintenance account to implement this plan.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, the committee has provided additional funding in \nthe amount of $87.5 million to address the funding shortfall in the \nArmy's real property mainenance account. Recognizing that the Army has \nprioritized its real property maintenance shortfalls, I am confident \nthat the Department will work with you to address your concerns \nregarding the Annex.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the recommendations of the defense \nsubcommittee for the Department of Defense Appropriations measure for \nFY 1998. The $247.2 billion recommended for the programs under the \njurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee is within the subcommittee's \nallocation in both budget authority and outlays, and is $1.2 billion \nbelow the amount authorized by the Senate for these programs in the \nAuthorization bill which was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate last \nweek. The recommendations have been unanimously supported by all \nmembers of the Defense Subcommittee, an event which is noteworthy, and \nis a reflection on the judgment, experience and abilities of the \ndistinguished leadership of the subcommittee, my friend, the Chairman, \nthe Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and the senior Senator from \nHawaii, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Inouye.\n  The bill is noteworthy for the consensus that underlies it, and the \nSenate is fortunate to have these two senior Senators, with vast \nexperience in defense matters, at the helm of our post-war defense \nspending. Central elements of American leadership in the post-cold-war \nworld are the readiness, capabilities and further development of our \nmilitary forces, present in all major regions of the world, exercising \nleadership in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific. While the \nagenda for American leadership will change, and is changing, we have \nwitnessed, several times in this century, the risk that abdicating such \na leadership role can entail. The need for such leadership is a jointly \nheld responsibility of the Administration and the Congress. It is clear \nthat America is not retrenching radically from its commitments and its \nfar-flung presence as a result of the end of the cold war, in some \nhistorical variance with the practice of our nation in times of peace \nin the past.\n  Mr. President, the quality of life and the need to attract excellent, \nmotivated people for the armed forces is a critical ingredient of our \nlong-term success in carrying out our commitments. I note that the \nSubcommittee has produced recommendations with a top priority of fully \nsupporting our men and women in uniform, including funding for a 2.8 \npercent pay raise for military personnel.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill, worthy of the strong support of \nthe Senate. It is the product of a truly bi-partisan process, and comes \nwith the unanimous support of the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee. I commend the leadership of that Committee, and the capable \nstaff of Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye in putting this bill \ntogether.\n\n\n                       allowability of esop costs\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska in a brief colloquy, not just in his capacity as \nfloor manager of the fiscal year 1998 Defense appropriations bill, but \nalso as a leading proponent of the legislation that created employee \nstock ownership plans [ESOP's].\n  Mr. President, the Defense Contract Audit Agency [DCAA] is \nthreatening the viability of ESOP defense contractors by applying \ndifferent determinations of ESOP costs than the Internal Revenue \nService and the Department of Labor. It is my understanding that \nCongress intended that ESOP cost issues be governed by the tax and \npension laws and regulations administered by those offices, not DCAA. \nIf this matter is not resolved when the defense appropriations \nconference committee meets, would the distinguished chairman be willing \nto try to assist in resolving it at that point?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania for recalling that I was an original sponsor of the \nlegislation that encouraged companies to become employee-owned by \nestablishing ESOP's. I will certainly try to do what I can to help \nsolve the situation the Senator has described.\n\n\n                        research and development\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof engaging my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee and the distinguished ranking minority \nmember, in a colloquy regarding support for evolving telemedicine \ntechnologies, research and development on an advanced double hull ship \ndesign and research and development of the helicopter vectored trust \nducted propeller.\n  Mr. President, we all recognize the need to continue efforts to \ndevelop telemedicine services for our Armed Forces. I note in \nparticular, efforts by institutions in the Northeast to design a \ntelemedicine trauma/emergency medical services system to provide \nnecessary diagnostic and treatment interventions and improve medical \noutcomes.\n  Advanced research and development for the Navy is vital to ensure \nforce readiness and capability for our Navy well into the future. The \nNavy is currently facing a technical challenge in design and \nmanufacture of very large and complex structural systems that have \nhistorically been made of traditional steel materials but are now \nincorporating the use of more advanced materials like non-magnetic \nsteels. Currently, there is no comprehensive initiative in the Navy to \ndevelop the most promising application of these new materials--a \nnonmagnetic, stainless steel advanced double hull warship design. The \nmarriage of the advanced double hull concept with nonmagnetic steels \noffers the potential to reduce acquisition costs and improve \nsurvivability. I support a development program for the stainless steel \nadvanced double hull concept that combines numerical analysis \ntechniques with large-scale representative testing.\n  Mr. President, in another area of military research and development, \nI point out the survivability and cost-effectiveness benefits from use \nof vectored ducted propeller helicopter technology. Research and \ndevelopment of this design will ensure that our Armed Forces are \nprepared for the next century. I look forward to working with my two \ncolleagues during conference to address these programs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. These are three very important and valuable programs for \nthe readiness and capability of our Armed Forces. I have long been a \nsupporter of telemedicine initiatives and its application to military \nobjectives. In addition, I recognize the need to continue research and \ndevelopment of advanced technology for hull and aircraft design. I \nbelieve these programs deserve a thorough review and look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Pennsylvania in conference.\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I also thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. Telemedicine, particularly those initiatives focused \non emergency and trauma care are essential for the highest quality \nmedical care for our troops. I too look forward to working with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania in conference.\n\n\n                  PERSIAN GULF WAR ILLNESSES AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues, Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye, for their work on this appropriations bill \nand the bipartisan spirit in which it was crafted.\n  I wish to speak for a moment on the amendment I offered on Persian \nGulf war illnesses that was accepted by the chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  The amendment will provide $4.5 million for the Department of Defense \nand the Veterans Administration to determine what treatments are \nworking for those who are afflicted with Persian Gulf war illnesses.\n  The reasonableness and necessity for action along these lines seem so \nobvious that many of my colleagues probably find it difficult to \nbelieve that such action has not already been taken. To allay their \ndoubts, let me quote directly from a GAO report released just last \nmonth: ``There is an absence of efforts to measure Gulf War veterans \nclinical progress. This leaves the government unable to promptly \ndetermine the quality and effectiveness of treatments currently being \nprovided to Gulf War veterans.''\n  That's not an angry Senator making unsupported allegations. That's \nthe objective, nonpartisan view of the General Accounting Office.\n  Mr. President, at this point, it seems to me that we've left our \nailing troops on the battlefield. Here we are, 6 years after the end of \nthe Persian Gulf war and it takes an act of Congress to begin an \neffective examination of which treatments are most effective in caring \nfor our veterans with Persian Gulf war illnesses.\n  While I am heartened by the fact that we're offering examinations to \nthose who served in the Persian Gulf War, I feel it's important to take \nthe next step to determine what happens after that initial examination. \nOften I hear stories of families being forced to look outside the \ngovernment agencies to get the care and compensation their Persian Gulf \nwar veterans deserve.\n  So those are the reasons that I offered the amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill and the Defense appropriations bill. Mr. President, \nnearly 700,000 men and women served in our Armed Forces in the Persian \nGulf war. Five thousand of them were constituents of mine. Depending on \nwhat reports you read, as many as 10 percent of those who served are \ntoday ailing from some form or another of these Persian Gulf war \nillnesses. That's far too many to be left out on the battlefield. One \nailing veteran forgotten by this country is too many. I expect to see \nsome progress now on finding and employing effective treatments for \nthose with Persian Gulf war illnesses.\n  Let me again express my gratitude to the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Hawaii for approving of this funding and accepting the \namendment. I'm sure they feel equally compelled by the issues raised \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) The Secretary of Defense shall waive \n     generally with respect to a foreign country each limitation \n     on procurements from foreign sources provided in law if the \n     Secretary determines that the application of the limitation \n     with respect to that country would impede cooperative \n     programs entered into between the Department of Defense and \n     the foreign country, or would impede arrangements for the \n     reciprocal procurement of defense items entered into under \n     section 2531 of title 10, United States Code, or under any \n     other provision of law, and the country does not discriminate \n     against defense items produced in the United States to a \n     greater degree than the United States discriminates against \n     defense items produced in that country.\n       (b) Subsection (a) applies with respect to--\n       (1) contracts and subcontracts entered into on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) options for the procurement of items that are exercised \n     after such date under contracts that are entered into before \n     such date if the option prices are adjusted for any reason \n     other than the application of a waiver granted under \n     subsection (a).\n       (c) Subsection (a) does not apply to a limitation regarding \n     construction of warships.\n       Sec. 8105. It is the sense of Congress that should the \n     Senate ratify NATO enlargement, that the proportional cost of \n     the United States share of the NATO common budget should not \n     increase, and that if any NATO member does not pay its share, \n     the United States shall not pay either.\n       Sec. 8106. Congress finds that the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission directed the transfer of only 10 \n     electro-magnetic test environment systems from Eglin Air \n     Force Base, Florida, to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.\n       Sec. 8107. (a) Findings.--(1) The Department of Defense \n     budget is insufficient to fulfill all the requirements on the \n     unfunded priorities lists of the military services and \n     defense agencies;\n       (2) the documented printing expenses of the Department of \n     Defense amount to several hundred million dollars per year, \n     and a similar amount of undocumented printing expenses may be \n     included in external defense contracts;\n       (3) printing in two or more colors generally increases \n     costs;\n       (4) the Joint Committee on Printing of the Congress of the \n     United States has established regulations intended to protect \n     taxpayers from extravagant Government printing expenses;\n       (5) the Government Printing and Binding Regulations \n     published by the Joint Committee on Printing direct that ``. \n     . . it is the responsibility of the head of any department, \n     independent office or establishment of the Government to \n     assure that all multicolor printing shall contribute \n     demonstrable value toward achieving a greater fulfillment of \n     the ultimate end-purpose of whatever printed item in which it \n     is included.'';\n       (6) the Department of Defense publishes a large number of \n     brochures, calendars, and other products in which the use of \n     multicolor printing does not appear to meet the demonstrably \n     valuable contribution requirement of the Joint Committee on \n     Printing, but instead appears to be used primarily for \n     decorative effect; and\n       (7) the Department of Defense could save resources for \n     higher priority needs by reducing printing expenses.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Therefore, it is the sense of the \n     Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should ensure that the \n     printing costs of the Department of Defense and military \n     services are held to the lowest amount possible;\n       (2) the Department of Defense should strictly comply with \n     the Printing and Binding Regulations published by the Joint \n     Committee on Printing of the Congress of the United States;\n       (3) the Department of Defense budget submission for fiscal \n     year 1999 should reflect the savings that will result from \n     the stricter printing guidelines in paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 1998''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate \nturn to the consideration of Calendar No. 107, S. 1004, the energy and \nwater appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1004) making appropriations for energy and water \n     development for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that while this bill is on the \nfloor, Bill Perret, a congressional fellow, be extended floor \nprivileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, obviously, with the distinguished \nchairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, taking care of the \ndefense of our Nation in 1 day in the Chamber, I am challenged and \nchallenge the Senate to do likewise in this very important bill. I hope \nwe can finish tonight. Senators who are within earshot or their staffs, \nclearly we intend to move right ahead. We know of only two amendments--\nthere may be many, many more, but we know of only two, and we expect \nSenators who have those amendments to come down here as soon as \npossible. It is not beyond reason that we can finish this this evening.\n  I have some brief opening remarks, Mr. President, that I will make at \nthis point. And, again, I ask that Senators who have amendments, \nwhether they be add-ons or deletions, come to the floor and we can \naccommodate them almost forthwith.\n  I wonder whether Senator Reid would not agree with that statement \nwith reference to anyone on that side who has an amendment. We are \nready.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I have communicated by telephone with the chief of \nstaff of one of the Senators who is going to offer an amendment, and \nshe indicated that that Senator would be available any time after 3 \no'clock today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, S. 1004 was reported by a vote of 28 to zero from the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations on Thursday, July 10, was filed that \nevening, and it has been available for Members since Friday, July 11.\n  Senator Reid, who this year became the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, and I have worked closely together to craft a balanced \nbill. We believe it addresses the concerns of the Members of the Senate \nand the concerns of the President of the United States.\n  The recommendation before the Senate provides $20.7 billion in new \nbudget authority, $11.7 billion within the defense function, and $8.9 \nbillion of that is within the domestic discretionary program. In this \nappropriations bill, in essence, a little over half of its total money \nis for defense purposes, and most of that, not all of it but most of \nit, has to do with the preservation and retaining the fidelity of the \nnuclear arsenal that the United States has in these very difficult \ntimes when we are building down and we are no longer doing underground \ntesting.\n  The recommendation is $1.9 billion in budget authority below the \nrequest of the President. That reduction results from the \nsubcommittee's recommendation that we not provide for full asset \nacquisition, which saved about $800 million in budget authority, and \nprovide only $300 million of a requested $1 billion for an initiative \nto privatize a portion of the Department of Energy's cleanup work.\n  Now, Mr. President, I might explain, in no way are we doing less in \ncleanup. There is an effort to go at this waste cleanup program--which \nis very, very difficult, very cumbersome, very bureaucratic and costing \na lot of money--there is an effort of the administration to move in \nanother direction and to try to come in with privatization, which would \npermit somebody powerful of resources and of talent to bid a total \ncleanup project for a certain amount of money and then the Federal \nGovernment, when they are finished, would pay them for that.\n  The Department knows that this is a very big venture requiring some \nvery new management skills, and we in our bill are saying let us take \none-third of this new effort, not the whole thing. It was all budget \nauthority with no outlay request attendant to it to speak of. And we \nsaid let us go with $300 million instead of $1 billion to see how the \nprogram works.\n  It has been modified and language has been supplied in this bill so \nthat the major one that they wanted to go out to privatization bid \nprobably on the west coast will probably fit.\n  Now, it is interesting that while much time is spent on the defense \nnuclear aspects, and we could spend this afternoon in debate on the \nfloor on that aspect, there is a large portion of this bill that has to \ndo with funding that is not defense. The discretionary function is $103 \nmillion less than the request.\n  However, within the lower amount, the subcommittee has increased \nspending for water projects by $229.5 million above requests. The \noffsetting savings were derived principally from the Department of \nEnergy's nondefense functions.\n  I must tell Senators that of all the subcommittees I have been on \nthat garner comments and letters and requests from fellow members, this \nsmall portion of the bill, the water projects of America, brings us \nmore requests than any subcommittee I have served on, because all the \nwater projects in America, the flood protection projects that have the \nFederal Government involved, the Bureau of Reclamation, and all the \nCorps of Engineers projects across this land are all in this section--\nthe dredging, the ports that we maintain, and so it is not easy to make \nends meet here. Senators are not going to get everything they think \ntheir projects need because we cannot afford them anymore, and two very \nlarge projects that are ready to go through the Corps of Engineers, one \nin West Virginia and one in the State of Kentucky, we cannot start them \nbecause of all of the programs that are still backed up in terms of \navailable resources.\n  The time might come when perhaps a large bipartisan group might want \nto tell the executive branch, in its next budget, that they better do a \nlittle better in this field because we are going to have to take money \naway from something else in Government to satisfy these needs because \nso many Senators feel so strongly about them.\n  The savings that we have put in our bill with reference to the \ndomestic part are $43 million from solar and renewable energy. The \ncommittee recommends $301 million, a $35 million increase over last \nyear. That is a $35 million increase. Mr. President, $67 million was \nsaved from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where it recommends $243 \nmillion, a $24 million increase over the current year; $20 million \nsaved from the nondefense cleanup, but we provide $437.6 million, a \n$109 million increase over current year; $25 million is saved from \nscience by not providing for the next generation of Internet programs--\nwe believe that can wait a year--and $30 million for the Yucca Mountain \nprogram; leaving $160 million on the nondefense side and $190 million \nin the defense function.\n  We believe this is adequate to move ahead in a steady, go-as-you-can \napproach that has been taking place for at least the last 3 years. Mr. \nPresident, $18 million was saved from uranium decommissioning and \ndecontamination programs. The committee has protected science funding. \nAnd, while it was unable to provide an increase, as many Members \nrequested, it did provide $2.2 billion of the $2.3 billion requested in \nthis field. Within the atomic energy defense activities budget, this \ncommittee included $4.3 billion for weapons activities and $5.3 billion \nfor environmental restoration and waste management.\n  I think it is noteworthy that we are now beginning to spend more, and \nthis is in billions of dollars, on the environmental restoration and \nwaste management in this country, the result of our nuclear programs \nwith reference to our defense and the use of the various facilities for \natomic and hydrogen bombs--we are spending more than we are in the \nactual weapons activities. And we are moving in a brand new direction \nin terms of weapons activities, in that we no longer test our nuclear \nweapons underground. Since we do not, because Congress has said let us \nnot do that, obviously we have to assure the fidelity, trustworthiness, \nand safety of these weapons another way. And we are busy doing that \nunder the title of ``science-based stockpile stewardship,'' something \nnew. We hope in the next 4 or 5 years we can display to everyone that \nindeed we can continue to certify\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nthe well-being of this weapons system without underground testing \nthrough the use of new devices and new science at the three major \nnuclear Laboratories, Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia.\n  The committee reduced the Department of Energy's privatization \nproposal. I have expressed that in my opening remarks. We continue to \nmaintain the ability to manage a technically challenged fixed-priced \ncontract. As a result, the House and Senate committee proposed \nsignificant reductions for the $1 billion requested. That is because \nthere is general concern about whether the Department has the ability \nto manage the technical part. The Committee on Appropriations \nrecommends $343 million, to be exact, with reference to this work.\n  The leadership has expressed its intent that the Senate this week \ncomplete consideration of three appropriations bills: defense, which we \njust completed; energy and water, a small bill compared to the defense \nbill but a very important one from the standpoint of our defenses; \nscience, and our water resources.\n  I understand we want to go ahead and do foreign operations also. We \nwould like very much to finish tonight so we can move right along on \nthis schedule.\n  So, I want to say to everyone, I am very hopeful we can handle this \nbill in the manner that the chairman and Senator Inouye, the ranking \nmember, handled the previous bill.\n  My remarks are completed. I understand my good friend, the ranking \nmember from Nevada, wants to make opening remarks, and then we will be \nready for any other Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this bill is the only one of the 13 \nappropriations bills that every dollar that is in the bill is \ndiscretionary funding. It is extremely important, every dollar that we \nhave in this bill, that it go to the right source or sources. As the \nranking member of this subcommittee, I have worked very closely with \nthe chairman of the subcommittee. He has been very open, invited me to \nmeetings with Cabinet officers, and this has been a joint venture, this \nlegislation, as well it should be.\n  I know the chairman of the subcommittee worked very closely for many, \nmany years with the then chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett \nJohnston, and then when the roles reversed, they also worked very \nclosely together. This is a bill that cries out for bipartisanship. It \nis a bill that affects very important aspects of this, our Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bill can be supported by the entire Senate because we have \napproached it on this basis. It has been a difficult bill, but I think \nwhat we have arrived at is equitable and good public policy, despite \nvery difficult circumstances. One of the difficulties the subcommittee \nfaced is one that cannot be solved easily and that is the significance \nof these water projects around the Nation. The Corps of Engineers \nprograms, both general investigations and construction, received \nbalanced increases over last year's budget while the operation and \nmaintenance aspect of their program was reduced by some $200 million.\n\n  The budget for the Bureau of Reclamation, which for western Senators \nis extremely important because the Bureau of Reclamation is principally \nresponsible for the arid States of the West, increased by $2 million \nover last year despite the budget proposal that would reduce the \nprogram account. The Bureau of Reclamation's first project ever in this \ncountry was in Nevada. In 1902 that program started, named after a \nNevada Congressman named Newlands, who eventually became a Senator. So \nwe are very familiar in Nevada with the good that the Bureau of \nReclamation does and the bad they have done in years gone by.\n  During the process of their developing programs in this country, some \nof the things they did simply have not worked out very well. But it was \nnot because there was any ulterior motive. It was simply the arid West \nthey were trying to make blossom like a rose. In some places they did, \nin some places they didn't.\n  Water projects are often maligned as excessive and unnecessary items \nin appropriations bills. Being from probably the most arid State in the \nUnited States, I disagree. Water projects are extremely important. If \nit were not for water projects, the city of Las Vegas, the county of \nClark, simply would not be the most rapidly growing area in the Union. \nIt is because of water programs sponsored by the Federal Government \nthat that area has been able to grow the way it has, because of the \nSouthern Nevada Water Project, funded by this Congress.\n  Our country has been described as a fortress nation with two large \ncoasts and waterways throughout the continent playing a role in \ncommerce, recreation and education as well as other functions. \nCommunities around the Nation are directly affected by water projects \nthat do, in fact, have Federal interests. I have given one example. I \nwant this Senate to know that what we have done has taken a great deal \nof thought, the expertise of our very good staffs, and a lot of time.\n  Starting with the largest water concern in the Nation, I would like \nto direct the Members' attention to a section of this bill dealing with \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers program entitled ``Flood Control, \nMississippi River and Tributaries.'' This is a so-called earmark. I \nguess we could call it that. A lot of people deride this earmark. This \nis for almost $300 million.\n  We know the Mississippi River is the most important waterway in this \ncountry and has been for more than a century. The Mississippi River has \nthe third largest drainage basin in the world, draining over 41 percent \nof the United States and covering 1,245,000 square miles.\n  The $289 million we have appropriated is probably not enough, but \nit's the best we could do. The Mississippi River has flooded over the \nyears, but due to the flood control levee system as put in place by the \nCorps of Engineers, over $8 billion in flood damages were averted in \nthe 1993 flood alone. So, I think, by anyone's estimate, we should \nreceive a passing grade on a cost/benefit scale. This is an earmark, a \nhuge one, that is important.\n  Let's take a smaller earmark, what some people direct their attention \nto, the extensive coastline America has and other smaller drainage \nbasins and locations such as Assateague Island in Maryland. We have \nrecognized the importance of Assateague Island in Maryland, and since \n1935, when a Federal navigation project was first started and disrupted \nnatural sand distribution, the shoreline has been eroding. There is now \na severe threat of unnatural erosion and accelerated shoreline \nmigration. We have appropriated money in this bill to stop this damage \nfrom occurring. Because, if the damage occurred without Federal \nintervention, the bays, commercial routes, the recreational island and \nthe mainland would be irreparably damaged.\n  This is an earmark. It is important for one of the States of the \nNation, and we have stepped forward and the Corps of Engineers has \ndeveloped a comprehensive water resources investigation in this area, \nand we will complete the preconstruction engineer design \nrecommendations for this project. This is important.\n  There are numerous other projects just like this. Let me talk, \nthough, about a number that are important, I think, in this bill. \nBecause water is a precious commodity in the West, as I have already \ntalked about, the use and study of water impacts every community. Water \nreclamation and desalinization projects, authorized in the last \nCongress, are of vital importance to lower Colorado River communities, \nthe Columbia-Snake River area and to rural communities.\n\n  We know that desalinization is important. Senator Paul Simon, who has \nrecently retired, believed in this significantly. He asked me to make \nsure that we did not forget about the things that he tried to do in \nthis Congress. I think we have done that in this bill. Desalinization \nis important. It is more than finding out if we can change the ocean \nwater to fresh water. It is dealing with rivers that have become very \npolluted and have too much salt in them. So, this is important.\n  We have done things dealing with desalinization in this bill. Of \nparticular note in this legislation, the importance of funding for the \nCALFED Bay Delta Ecosystem Restoration Project, another earmark, $50 \nmillion, which is to\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nassist California to understand the water systems and developing a \nbalance to the uses of the vast California water system.\n  But the State of California has stepped forward. They have a \nmultiyear funding program that they are going to work on with us. \nTheirs is almost $1 billion, the voters of the State of California \napproved. We have an obligation to come forward, I believe, as does \nthis committee, and help them with this project. So I appreciate the \nconcerns expressed in the report language about the CALFED Project. I \nthink the concerns are fair and constructive, and I hope the Bureau and \nmany proponents recognize the necessity to design this project and \nactivities so we can feel confident in the use of taxpayers' moneys. \nThere is no mistake, this is important to California. I support the \ncommittee in their efforts to fund this.\n  I have mentioned four or five projects in this bill. There are some \nwho come and say, ``Why do you earmark these?'' We earmark them because \nthat's our obligation. We have three separate but equal branches of \nGovernment. I think we would be foolhardy and it would not make our \nFounding Fathers smile if we just accepted everything that the \nadministration wanted. We have our own voice, our own concerns, and \nthey are expressed in this bill.\n  I support the subcommittee in the work that has been done dealing \nwith renewable projects. The chairman of the subcommittee has talked \nabout some of them, but I want to repeat, we have an almost $15 million \nincrease in this bill for solar energy--for solar energy. We have a $4 \nmillion increase for hydrogen energy development. We have almost $6 \nmillion for wind energy development. And we have geothermal energy \ndevelopment at a slight increase. Alternative fuels are the answer to \nthe problem in the world to come in the United States. We have \nrecognized that.\n  I would have liked to give solar much, much more and hydrogen and \nwind and geothermal. But we have increased these in spite of a budget \nthat is very spartan in nature.\n\n  Before we go to the energy side of the bill, I would like to say, \nconsidering the many demands on the Corps and the Bureau, nobody \nreceived all the moneys they wanted or requested, but we tried to be \nevenhanded about the projects, as well as taking into consideration the \nposition of the agencies themselves.\n  The nondefense programs in the Department of Energy were also \nstretched due to the outlays and allocations, as well as the demands of \nthe activities.\n  The work at Yucca Mountain is continuing. I don't like Yucca \nMountain. I wish it weren't there. But I felt in fairness and being a \nconstructive member of this committee that we should continue the \nfunding. I think, though, for example, the latest work they did there, \nbuilding a 4\\1/2\\-mile tunnel through a mountain which cost $60,000 a \nfoot, the subcommittee was very responsive in setting the workload that \nshould take place with this facility at Yucca Mountain.\n  The budget authority and outlays do not provide for the entire \nprivatization effort but does support continued waste management and \ncleanup at a level that will maintain a scheduled cleanup of sites that \nhave served the Nation in the past and now should be taken care of.\n  The atomic energy defense activities of this bill is, I feel, a grave \nand momentous responsibility, and the chairman of the subcommittee and \nI have recognized that. We may talk of these amounts as dollars, but we \nrecognize that literally the work we do here is the difference between \nhaving a safe and reliable nuclear arsenal and one that is more prone \nto accidental problems. We understand how important this is.\n  So, Mr. President, this appropriations bill is important, because it \nprovides a transition between a world in which we tested nuclear \ndevices--we tested almost 1,000 nuclear devices at the Nevada test \nsite. That program is over with, we hope. We hope that nothing occurs \nthat the President will have to exercise his emergency powers to again \nstart nuclear testing at the test site. What this bill has done is take \ninto consideration that for 50 years of brinkmanship, we can now look \nat a world that is relatively safe. With these tens of thousands of \nnuclear warheads, we have to make sure that they are, I repeat, safe \nand reliable, and we have taken that into consideration with this \nlegislation that is now before the Senate.\n  The world still provides no safe haven from international conflict, \nand some of our potential enemies remain armed with the most \ndestructive weapons in mankind's history. So we must remain ready and \ncapable of responding to many threats from those or other weapons of \nmass destruction, not because we want or should wage war with these \ndemonic weapons, but because we want to wage peace by deterring their \nuse by any government forever.\n  If we could put the nuclear genie back in the bottle, we would do it. \nBut I am sure of one thing, and that is the nuclear threat still exists \nand will continue for an indefinite period. Experience has shown the \nbest response to this threat is to remain so capable that no government \nwill ever perceive any advantage from a nuclear attack. So we must \nretain indefinitely a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile.\n  Although we must remain ready, we want to reduce the incentive for \nother countries to increase their arsenals. We want to stop the \nunending spiral of development of increasingly dangerous weapons by \nthose nations that already have nuclear arsenals. I think this \nlegislation does that.\n  This country has advocated, through the President, a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty to stop that developmental spiral and remove that \nincentive.\n  So now, for the foreseeable future, our country must maintain its \nnuclear deterrent in a completely different way compared to past \npractice and experience. No longer can we test new designs for their \nsafety and reliability. No longer can we test new designs of weapons, \nwe can only test weapons for safety and reliability. That is important.\n  No longer can we assure stockpile safety and reliability by replacing \nold designs and weapons with new ones. We must get along with what we \nhave, and we have to make sure they are safe and reliable. We must rely \non present designs and weapons in the stockpile, so we have to develop \nthe understanding of how age will affect their safety and reliability, \nand we must acquire this knowledge while testing the weapons and \ndesigns.\n  The Department of Energy, in consultation with its National Weapons \nLaboratories and with the Department of Defense, has concluded that the \nonly assured way of certifying an aging stockpile without testing in \nthe traditional fashion is to understand the science of weapons \nmaterials, components and systems, and, with that understanding, to use \ncomputer-based simulator performance to evaluate safety and \nreliability, and that is what this legislation which is now before the \nSenate does.\n  This so-called Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program has been \nreviewed completely by experts from inside and outside the program and \nexperts both inside and outside the Government. These experts have \nconditionally agreed the science-based program can succeed. It can \nsucceed provided appropriate investments are made in scientific \nresearch, in experimental facilities and in advance computational \ncapabilities. These conditions are faithfully reflected by the atomic \ndefense activities budget and in the energy and water development \nappropriations bill.\n\n  When this program was originally conceived, its budget dimensions \nwere estimated under a variety of assumptions, some of which have not \nbeen realized. For example, it was assumed that START II ratification \nby Russia would have been achieved. It hasn't. Failure to ratify START \nII has required greater investments in weapons surveillance and \nmaintenance, causing unexpected costs for both the national \nlaboratories and the plants.\n  In addition, more weapons in the stockpile has accelerated the \nrequired schedule for tritium production which is one of the elements \nin a weapon that lasts a little over 10 years and must thereafter be \nreplaced. So we must periodically look at this product in our active \nstockpile.\n  Guaranteeing tritium production capability on this new schedule has \nrequired simultaneous exploration of two research options, neither of \nwhich is\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\ncheap. Furthermore, the greater maintenance load on our plants has \ndelayed our planned progress toward downsizing and has required \ninvestments in plant infrastructure that we did not anticipate.\n  Finally, reductions in administration costs by the Department of \nEnergy has not been realized as quickly as expected.\n  The future will be defined by progress toward ratification and \nimplementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and it depends \ncritically on our confidence and reliability and safety of our enduring \nstrategic nuclear stockpile.\n  A principal discussion that has taken place is the role of the \nstockpile stewardship and the science activities that need to occur to \nmaintain a certified state of readiness. Because we studied these \ndefense issues closely, this subcommittee has provided sufficient \nfunding for the national ignition facility as a cornerstone of the \nscience-based stewardship, and we integrated the Nevada test site and \nnational laboratories in the defense program to assure a certifiable \nstockpile.\n  Mr. President, I wish it were possible for every Member of the U.S. \nSenate to take a tour through our national laboratories to find out how \nessential they are to the literal safety of this world. They do \ntremendous work with little fanfare. I have become a real fan of our \nnational laboratories.\n  This bill is fair and reasonable. I support the efforts of this bill \nto seek more efficiency within the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are in the process of clearing a \nnumber of amendments. I, once again, ask Senators who have any \namendments that they are certain have to be offered if they would get \ndown here as soon as possible. If they are the only two amendments, it \nwould seem to me it would be reasonable for us to be telling the \nSenators and our leadership that we could finish tonight, provided we \ndon't have to just wait here with nothing to do. I understand the \nschedules and other subcommittee hearings and the like. But I, once \nagain, urge either of the two Senators who have an amendment that we \nunderstand might be offered that they get down here as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, I thought I would discuss a \nlittle bit about this bill I think is interesting and might make it \neasier for those who are wondering, as you look at the Department of \nEnergy's role--and it has a lot of roles, a lot of missions, it might \nbe a little easier to identify what we are doing as a Nation in various \nareas.\n  So what we have done is we have kind of reorganized the way the bill \nshows the functions at the Department of Energy. I call to anyone's \nattention who is interested the report accompanying this bill at page \n88, title III, the Department of Energy, because we have broken it down \ninto the energy research, we have broken it down into what we call \nscience.\n  I would just like to talk about science for a minute, because across \nthis country--incidentally, the science portion of this bill costs $2.2 \nbillion. We hear, and I am sure the occupant in the Chair in his \ncapacity from his State with INL there and a lot of science going on, \nour academic and business leaders say, if you are going to reduce \nspending, don't reduce what we are spending on basic science. We are \nall hearing that. We funded the President's request in basic science. \nIf you look in this reorganization effort, science is made up of high-\nenergy physics, nuclear physics, biological and environmental research, \nbasic energy sciences, and other energy research.\n\n  It is very, very important that everybody understand that this is not \njust a Department of Energy bill that has to do with petroleum and \nnatural gas. It has to do with subjects I spoke about, some of the most \nprofound and deep science that America is doing anywhere with reference \nto physics, with reference to biological and environmental research.\n  For instance, this Department has one-third of the budget, Mr. \nPresident, of the human genome research project. The human genome \nresearch project is about 7 years old, maybe 8, and two-thirds of it is \nrun by the National Institutes of Health and one-third by the \nDepartment of Energy. Many scientists have said it is mankind's most \nserious and potentially effective research project for wellness. For \nwhat we have been doing with the genome project is to map all of the \nchromosomes of the human body and to discern from within those \nchromosomes where the dread diseases are located. It doesn't mean we \nknow how to cure them because we know how to locate them, but for most \nof our adult life, we heard every 3 or 4 or 5 years a group of great \nscientists would announce they had located the genes for multiple \nsclerosis. They were in an effort that might have taken 20 years to \nlocate that, because they had to do it without regard to the relevancy \nof doing all of the chromosomes of the human body.\n  Because of computers and other things, we are well on the way to \nhanding to the scientists of the future the chromosome locations inside \nus for all of the dread diseases, and then it will be up to \npharmaceutical researchers and basic researchers to find if there is \nsome way that we can effect cures. That is why it is seen as the \nbiggest wellness effort, and one-third of that lies within the \nDepartment of Energy. It is interesting, it is there for a number of \nreasons. I won't talk about the parochial interests which I had \nsomething to do with. But essentially, this Department was doing a \ngreat deal of genetic work, as the occupant of the Chair knows. Because \nof Hiroshima, Nagasaki, some of the most indepth preservation of \nradioactive impacts on the human genetic system and research on that, \ninstruments to do the research were within this Department. So when \nSenators wonder what the Department of Energy does, that is one. That \nis $1.2 billion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. While we are waiting for amendments to come, I will also \nask the Senator, I was struck after having become the ranking member of \nthe committee going to one of the national laboratories not in your \nState--I want to make sure everybody understands the national \nlaboratories are important. They are important because they are in New \nMexico, California and other places. Let's talk about the one in \nCalifornia.\n  Much of the research we hear so much about dealing with genomes, \ntrying to determine what our bodies are made of started in national \nlaboratories.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The work we are doing in Lawrence Livermore in California \nis mind-boggling work done there.\n  I ask the Senator, what would the state of scientific research be in \nour country today if it were not for the national laboratories?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, you know, everybody around would \nsay you asked the right person, because I am absolutely convinced that \nthe national laboratories--and there are more than the big three we \nhave just alluded to that are part of this, the Department of Energy--\nwhile they may not have been created in their inception to do the kind \nof research they are doing today, or the three we speak to, they were \ncreated and started up because of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and \nnuclear energy. And everybody related to that, the design, the making, \nthe disarming, huge assemblages of the greatest physicists and \nscientists that America has ever brought up, ended up in these \nlaboratories doing this kind of work.\n  The result of that is they are doing all kinds of basic research \nbecause they are there and they have big equipment to do their jobs. I \nwould surmise that as many breakthroughs in science have come about \nbecause of the national laboratory system as any other single \ninstitution or entity in America's modern history.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield, maybe even in the history of \nthe world.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could be.\n  Mr. REID. For example, at Lawrence Livermore, I spent some time with \na Dr. Campbell, who is one of the leading experts in the world on \nlasers. Lasers were invented in 1917 by Albert Einstein. It took \nscientists 43 years, and it was finally proven at Lawrence Livermore \nthat he was right, that the formula he came up with in 1917 dealing\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nwith laser technology, that he really knew what he was talking about.\n  But for the work done in our laboratories, things like this, they may \nhave come to be, but it would have been years in the future. If you \ntalk about great scientific minds in the last 50 years, they have all \nworked in these laboratories.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right.\n  I want to, again, if there is a little bit of time, to remind fellow \nSenators of another thing.\n  You know, a very large group of Senators, just speaking of our body, \nour Senate, are always very concerned about the adequacy of defense \nspending. And I think we see that in the bill that just passed with \nvery large support. We see it in the willingness of the U.S. Senate to \nset up a wall and say the appropriations for defense are separate from \nthe domestic appropriations, and you cannot take from defense to spend \nin domestic. You need a supermajority to do that because we think it is \nso important that we do right by defense.\n  But I think what happens is that sometimes many of the Senators do \nnot realize, and maybe it is because we have not done a very good job \nof telling them, that a portion of the defense of our Nation is done \nnot in the defense budget but in this budget, by the Department of \nEnergy in its nuclear weapons work. All of the money for that comes out \nof this defense pot of money that I just talked about, with a wall \nsaying this money cannot be used for anything else; it is transferred \nfor that part of Government to this subcommittee and to the Department \nof Energy to do the nuclear deterrent work in the broadest sense of the \nword.\n  Now we have decided to engage in a big, vast experiment regarding the \npreservation of these nuclear weapons in terms of their safety, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. We have said no more underground \ntesting, which my friend from Nevada had a very major parochial \ninterest in and which went on in his State for many, many decades, that \noffered direct objective proof of the reliability and the qualitative \ncapability and quantitative capability of the weapons. We decided as a \nCongress, and the President agreed, that we would not do that anymore.\n  Now, it is obvious that we have not gotten rid of our nuclear \nweapons, and we will not for a long time, even though we are hopeful \nthat with the various treaties we will get this number down, and \nhopefully there may be even a giant effort to get it down even more. \nBut in the meantime, what nobody seems to understand--or, I should say, \nfew understand--is that we have to spend money on some new techniques \nto make sure the weaponry is safe and trustworthy and that it will be \nfaithful to its mission because we cannot test it anymore.\n  So we are engaged in a major transition. I have alluded to it, my \nranking member has. It is called science-based stockpile stewardship. \nThe greatest scientists and physicists and others have joined together \nwith the Department of Energy saying, ``Since we can't test, we have \ngot to find some other ways based on science.'' And, Mr. President, we \nare engaged in very large computer experiments. In fact, we are pushing \nthe threshold of computer capability more by this requirement than any \nother requirement in America. The push for bigger and faster computers \nis being done by our response to the science-based stockpile \nstewardship.\n  In addition, each of the major laboratories, since we will no longer \nmake new bombs, no longer design new bombs, are engaged in their part \nof trying to make sure that the weapons are reliable. If, indeed, there \nis a dispute today on the floor on whether we are spending too much for \nthis, I am prepared to go into a lot of detail, none of which is \nsecret, about the certification process as to the well-being of the \nweapons.\n\n  These three laboratories, headed by civilians, have essentially \nmaintained our nuclear deterrent position for all these decades because \nthey surround themselves with the best; we fund the best equipment, and \nthey have always kept us from having a war. They have kept us highly, \nhighly competitive so that nobody, including the Soviet Union, dared \nventure anything in the field of nuclear weapons.\n  These same laboratories must continue to certify the reliability of \nthese weapons. It is not just some figment of someone's imagination \nthat they are important. The truth of the matter is, the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, in agreeing to no more underground testing, studied it and \nworked with the best scientists around and concluded that they would go \nalong if, in fact, the national laboratories were given sufficient \nresources and the lab directors could certify to them and the President \nregularly that we were able to verify the effectiveness, the safety of \nthese weapons systems in ways that did not need underground testing as \na quantifier or objective determinator.\n  That makes the work of this Department in this regard as important, \nin my opinion, as anything within the defense budget of the United \nStates. I do not believe, properly presented to any legislator and any \npolicymaker, they could disagree.\n  In this bill, there is about $4.3 billion--and remember, we just \npassed a defense budget an hour ago, about $250 billion. So let us put \nit in perspective. The science-based stockpile stewardship, the \nmaintenance of and attesting to the reliability of the nuclear weapons, \nis being done for about $4.3 billion by essentially three national \nlaboratories who work for us.\n  It seems to me that when it comes to these budgets, we ought to not \nfail to understand that it is part of the defense of our Nation. When \nit comes to maintaining these science-based efforts, some of them are \nnew and very major. A whole new device and system will be established \nat Lawrence Livermore. A lesser facility is almost completed to do an \nx-ray type activity at Los Alamos. And all three laboratories are \nbeginning to do, with early completion dates, major, major computer \nprograms so that many of the tests can be done by simulation that were \ndone before by actual tests.\n  So I hope, when it comes to where does the money go from the Defense \nDepartment, that everyone will understand it is very, very important \nthat we adequately fund defense, but it is probably even more important \nthat we properly allocate money to the laboratories of this Nation \nwhich are doing the deterrent work with reference to our nuclear \narsenal.\n  Now, there are many other great laboratories--one is in the State of \nthe occupant of the chair--that do great science work for the \nDepartment of Energy. One could stand here and go through each one and \nsay how important it is, and much of it is not discernible easily as \nbeing directly related to energy because it is science of some very \nspecial quality that can be done by the people and the other things \nthat are present in these various facilities.\n  So the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which I have not yet mentioned, \nis the natural next episode that follows on the American Government's \nagreement not to do any more nuclear underground testing. And the next \nthing will be, can the world agree to it? That treaty is going to be \ncalled the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Obviously, it is ready. It is \nin the possession of the executive branch. And soon--I do not know \nwhen, but it cannot be a long way off--it will be submitted to the \nSenate for its approval and ratification and/or amendment, I assume.\n  I think it is important that everyone know that the questions that \nare going to be asked have to do with this appropriations bill, \nquestions like, are we adequately funding what is required by the \nlaboratory directors of the laboratories that are nuclear weapons \nlaboratories? Are we funding the program properly for the next 5-year \ninterval so that we can say with confidence that the international test \nban treaty can be entered into?\n  Obviously, I am putting the Senate on notice, in a way, that some \nwork has to be done clearly to make sure that the Joint Chiefs and the \nlab directors, the three laboratory directors, can be assured there \nwill be adequate funding. We are working on that now with the \nadministration and the Departments of Defense and Energy so we are able \nto come to the floor and say with as much certainty as we can, \nconsidering our democratic processes, that we are funding the basic \ninstitutional thrusts required to make an international treaty a valid \nand good thing for America set up alongside of the test ban that we \nhave passed.\n  There will be many other ramifications to that test ban treaty, and I\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\nthink one is obvious. If we find out that we absolutely cannot get \nalong without it, what happens? I think that will be addressed, too. \nThese scientists will tell us whether this science-based stewardship is \nworking or not. And if they end up saying it cannot work, it cannot do \nthe job, then what happens if we are bound in a treaty? And I think \nthat will be addressed in due course.\n  I still do not see any Senators present who want to offer amendments, \nso I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, while no amendments have been offered, \nwe have been doing our very best to work with any amendments that we \nare aware of, and starting late yesterday and today we have had some \namendments that we have cleared on both sides. There are eight in \nnumber. I am going to send these eight amendments to the desk shortly. \nThey are an amendment on behalf of Senator Byrd regarding Stonewall \nJackson Lake, an amendment on behalf of Senator Daschle regarding the \nCheyenne River Sioux Reservation, Senator Kempthorne regarding a McCall \narea waste water reclamation and reuse, an amendment on behalf of \nSenators Bingaman and Domenici regarding the Butte Reservoir pipeline, \nan amendment on behalf of Senator Wyden regarding watershed agreements, \nSenator Biden and Senator Roth regarding the Delaware coast, an \namendment on behalf of Senator Bumpers regarding the Southwest \nexperimental fast oxide reactor, and an amendment on behalf of Senator \nBoxer regarding Greenville Road.\n  I send the amendments to the desk and ask that they be considered en \nbloc, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, once again I would like to repeat and \nurge that our fellow Senators come down here if they have amendments. I \nknow we have to protect Senators and we\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\nhave rules, but it would not be too farfetched for third reading to \noccur here any time if no amendments are in order. And I do not want to \npursue that very vigorously even under regular order or the rules, but \nI do think there are a number of Senators and a lot of people waiting \non the floor for what may be one or two amendments.\n  I certainly once again urge and beg my fellow Senators to get them \ndown here so we can finish this work. All of us have many things to do, \nand we are very cognizant of your responsibilities, I say that to those \nSenators who have amendments, but we ought to try to keep the Senate \nbusy when we are open and this would help us very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have told the Democratic Senators who have \nindicated they may offer amendments that we are going to go to third \nreading in the near future, and I do not know when that will be, but I \ntold them it would be relatively soon. I do not have nearly the \nexperience that the chairman of the full committee has, the manager of \nthe bill, but I have been here going on 15 years, and that is one of \nthe things that is really concerning to me, that is, how long we wait \nuntil we wrap these things up. I know the Senator would use good \njudgment in that regard, but I think all good things must come to an \nend, and I think in a reasonable period of time we should go to third \nreading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, is there anything pending? What is the \nparliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no amendments pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 867\n\n(Purpose: To fund the Department of Energy's Weapons Activities Account \n             at the level requested by the Administration)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 867.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        Reduce the amount on line 4 of page 23 by $258,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we discussed this for just a moment the \nother day in the full Appropriations Committee, but here is my concern. \nI want to voice those concerns both for the Record and for a response \nby the chairman of the subcommittee dealing with weapons activities.\n  Now, for the Record and people who read it and may not know, the \nEnergy Department not only tries to develop solar energy and better \nways to explore for oil and gas and that sort of thing, the Energy \nDepartment is also charged with the responsibility of developing and \nmaintaining our nuclear weapons. They build them, they stockpile them, \nthey guarantee to the people of this country their safety and \nreliability. They guarantee the safety of them for our benefit; they \nguarantee the reliability of them for the benefit of the Defense \nDepartment which is going to put these nuclear weapons on submarines, \nmissiles, and so on.\n  But I have been concerned about the amount of money we are spending \non that. What I wanted to do was to engage the chairman in a discussion \nof why we are spending the kind of money we are on this project.\n  For example, this year, 1997, the year we are in right now, we are \nspending somewhere around $120 million to $200 million more on the so-\ncalled DOE weapons activities account than we did in 1996. Senator \nHarkin and I offered an amendment last year to strike that or to lower \nit. I forget exactly how the amendment read, but we tried to cut this \nlast year, as the chairman will recall. We got 37 votes.\n  You know, I am tired of jousting with windmills around here. I have \nenough sense to know when you are going to prevail, when you have a \nfighting chance and when you do not.\n  But in any event, this year the President requested--these figures \nblow your mind--the President requested $4.044 billion for this so-\ncalled DOE weapons activities account--$4.044 billion. And this bill \ncontains $258 million more than the President requested.\n  This is a very arcane account, very difficult for laymen to \nunderstand. I must say, I am a layman from the standpoint of the \ncomplexities of testing or trying to make sure that our weapons \nstockpile is safe and reliable. I am a layman in that regard. I am not \na layman in regard to money. I understand that $258 million is a lot of \nmoney. When we appropriate $258 million more than the President \nrequested--and the President asked for a fairly substantial increase--\nwhen we go above that by $258 million, then I think I am within my \nright and, as a matter of fact, my duty to raise the question of why we \nare spending this much money when you consider the fact that there is \nno Soviet Union. They do not exist anymore, and so far as I know, they \ndo not represent a nuclear threat to this country at this point and, \nhopefully, never will again. By the same token, Mr. President, we do \nnot represent a nuclear threat to the people of Russia today.\n  If I had asked this question--I do not want to go too far afield from \nthe specifics of what I want the chairman to address, but I daresay, in \n1987, for example--the Soviet Union essentially folded in 1990, 1991; \nand for all the years after World War II until that point, the defense \nbudget was driven, driven almost exclusively, by the threat of the \nSoviet Union. I daresay, if I had asked any Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs during that period, from 1947 to 1948 until 1990, how much could \nwe cut the defense budget if the Soviet Union suddenly went away, I \nwould guess that the smallest number I would have gotten would have \nbeen $50 billion and the maximum number at least $100 billion. I am \ntalking about from generals and admirals.\n  So, all of a sudden, here we are 7 years after the demise of the \nSoviet Union, and the defense budget we approved in the authorization \nbill that we just passed yesterday is $268 billion. Now, I voted for \nit--but I felt it was way too much money--because there were some \nthings in it that I thought were fairly important, and we are always \ntrying to balance things. Anybody can pick one thing out of a bill they \ndo not like and vote no. I dislike this so much I am tempted to vote \nagainst energy and water, but I am not going to vote against the bill \nbecause there are a lot of good things in it.\n  I am not going to accord, indulge, myself the luxury of saying, \nsimply because there are half a dozen things in there I object to I am \nnot going to vote for it. There are all sorts of water projects and \nenergy things that are very important to me. This is about a $21 \nbillion bill. I am not objecting to the $4 billion in weapons \ndevelopment. I am only objecting to what I consider excessive \nincreases.\n  Now, having said all of that to the Senate, I am a strong believer in \nthe test ban treaty. The Senator from Nevada may correct me on this, \nbut I believe 1993 was the last year we had underground tests of \nnuclear weapons in Nevada. When we quit testing in Nevada, I considered \nthat a hallelujah day in this country. I had been fighting for a long \ntime, even before the Soviet Union disappeared, to stop nuclear \ntesting, underground testing, in Nevada. I thought it was senseless. I \nthought there must be other ways that we could test and determine \nthe reliability of weapons without actually setting off those \nexplosions.\n\n  Mr. President, here we are now. We are still talking about a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty, which I strongly favor. We do not have \nit. There are a lot of people in this body who would not vote for it if \nthe Russians unilaterally disarmed tomorrow. But I happen to think it \nwould take us a long way further than we are right now down the path \ntoward the kinds of, what shall I say, comfort and good feeling we have \nabout the future of nuclear weapons.\n  So, Mr. President, when I look at these figures, this $4.302 billion \naccount, which is $258 million more than the President requested, \nconsiderably\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nmore, over $300 million more than the House bill provides--let me \nrepeat that. While we are at $4.302 billion, the House is at $3.943 \nbillion, or $350-plus million less than the Senate; and both the House \nand Senate authorizing bills are less--are less--than the Senate \nappropriations bill which we are considering on the floor at this \nmoment.\n  So, Mr. President, I intended to offer this amendment as much as for \nany other reason to engage the distinguished Senator from New Mexico in \na colloquy and let him explain. I know he has an explanation. He is \nvery knowledgeable on these things. Let him explain to the Senate why \nthese rather unusual increases, when everybody else is taking a hit--\nthere are a lot of water projects in this bill that he could not fund \nbecause they do not have the money to do it. Of course you couldn't.\n  Before I finish, I ask the Senator from New Mexico, do the firewalls \nthat we have in place apply to the Department of Energy's defense \nactivities?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, only in this respect. The money \nfor the DOE defense work comes out of the total amount available for \ndefense under the budget, and that total amount is subject to a \nfirewall. Whatever you take out of it, like the money you are \ndescribing, the firewall carries with it, so that in this bill you \ncould not move defense money to water projects because there is a \nfirewall around the subdefense money, which is exactly the same as the \nbig defense 050 function called defense.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say, the $268 billion defense authorization bill \nwe passed last evening, does that include the roughly $17 billion in \nthis bill for nuclear weapons?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is not $17 billion in here.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think $17 billion is the right figure, roughly $17 \nbillion in nuclear, is there not, in the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is $11.8 billion in total defense money in this \nbill.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. OK.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And $4.3 billion is weapons.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So $11.8 billion. Is that all in the $268 billion \nauthorization bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is. There will not be more money spent. There will \nnot be any accumulation. The total amount we put in the budget will \ninclude the bill Senator Stevens passed and this money. It will equal \nthe total amount of defense money. There is no add-on for this.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me close with one observation, because I did not \nhave the correct figure a while ago.\n  Last year's bill, last year's Senate energy and water bill, the same \nbill we have on the floor right now, provided $270 million more than \nthe President asked for and $300 million more than the House provided. \nSo we had $270 million more last year than the President requested and \n$258 million more this year than the President requested. That is well \nover half a billion dollars in 2 years, as I say, when everybody else \nhas suffered.\n\n  So I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he would care to respond to \nmy complaints about what I consider excessive increases in the DOE \nweapons development activities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me first say to you, I believe that this discussion \nand what you have done in the past in an effort to make sure that we \ncan answer and respond to inquiries about the sufficiency or whether we \nappropriated too much are good for the Senate and good for the American \npeople. So from my standpoint, I am glad you are here on the floor. And \nI am glad you in the past have challenged us.\n  I have tried very hard to answer up to a responsibility that almost \nno one understands, and that is that the entire safety of the nuclear \narsenal is funded in this bill. Most people think it is in that big \ndefense bill. It is in this bill.\n  Let me move on to a couple of other things. The overall expenditures \nin this bill, compared to the present, the overall amount in budget \nauthority is $1.9 billion less between defense, nondefense, water and \neverything else. But we had increased water projects, which you alluded \nto, on their own by $229 million. You have been an advocate, and we \nworked with you, on many of those. They are tough to fund. But they did \nnot come out of the defense money anyway. You quite appropriately \nasked, are they walled off? They are. That is a big part of this bill, \nand growing in difficulty.\n  If you would have come down and said, ``I would like to engage you, \nSenator, in about an hour discussion on whether we're going to be able \nto pay for water projects,'' I would be a little more concerned, \nbecause I am not sure we can, because we are not putting any more money \nin this domestic part of this bill, and we are asking for more and more \nwater projects.\n  One part of our Government says, we do not want to do any more, we \nwant to increase the ratio of support locally. And we keep saying we \nhave to keep doing them because they are needed.\n  So I want to establish those fundamental issues.\n  Now, let me move on. If I were the only one, singularly, who thought \nwe had to have an increase of about $300 million in the defense part of \nthis bill for nuclear weapons safety, I would probably be a little \nfrightened here on the floor because you are very persuasive. But I \nworked with the ranking member, who is a diligent Senator. He started \nsaying, ``I want to learn everything I can. I want to meet with \neverybody you meet with. When you bring the Secretary of Defense in, I \nwant to be there. When you bring in the DOE, I want to be there. When \nyou bring in the security people out at Berger's office, I want to be \nthere.''\n\n  We have both concluded that there have been some things that have \noccurred since the President submitted his idea of about $4 billion a \nyear for the safety, well-being, and fidelity of the nuclear arsenal. \nWe are going to discuss those with you here in a minute.\n  But let me first say, that $4.3 billion is not to manufacture a \nsingle new weapon. I think everybody should know that. People keep \nsaying we are making nuclear weapons. You know we are not--no nuclear \nweapons and no nuclear weapons designs. But what we have, Senator--and \nthis is not a secret number, and it is not subject to my call--is we \nhave a minimum of 6,500 nuclear weapons. That is the allowable under \nSTART II.\n  Now, I am not, in this bill, permitted to challenge whether we need \nthem or not. I am only permitted to respond to lab directors and the \nnational security advisers on how much do we need to make sure they are \nsafe, and some of them are running out of their durability. A number of \nthem will be old in 5 years, sufficient for us to wonder what we should \ndo with them.\n  Now, what we used to do, Senator, is perform some rather objective \ntests in Nevada. On this floor, the three of us probably have discussed \nthat as much as anyone else, and the Senator from Nevada knows about \nall that testing. That used to be an objective way of measuring certain \nthings. Now, before we entered into that agreement, before the \nPresident said let's cut off underground testing and sent up his \nproposal and started lobbying for it, and before Congress would approve \nit, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had a lot of questions. Essentially, \nbelieve it or not, they literally had to do with, how do we maintain \nthe arsenal without the tests?\n  Frankly, Senator, I didn't make that deal either, although I am glad \nto live with it. I will say what you have said. I hope the whole world \njoins us now. In fact, I am leaning strongly in support of the \ninternational treaty banning it. But I guarantee you that it has no \nchance of passing, if Senators can come to the floor and have credible \ninformation that those who are in charge of making sure those weapons \nare safe, the parts are replaceable, if they are broken down. If \nanybody in the security department of our country can say we don't have \nenough money in there to do that, that treaty will go down in flames. \nAnd I can tell you there will be Senators who are going to say that, \nregardless of what we put in this bill.\n  But I am not convinced that $4 billion, which was in the President's \nbudget, and $4 billion for the next 5 years, will do that. Now, it \nseems simple, Mr. President, that we ought to just go from underground \ntesting, get a few scientists and a few machines ordered, and we ought \nto test these weapons. But I tell you, if you want me to, I will read \nyou the definition of safety that has been in existence regarding \nnuclear weapons since 1968.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wish you would do that.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They are incredible. America wants them safe. In 1968, \nthe then President of the United States entered into the following \nunderstanding, and the criteria are summarized as follows:\n\n       One, in the event of a detonation, initiated at any one \n     point in the high-explosive system----\n\n  That is not the bomb----\n\n     the probability of achieving nuclear yield of greater than 4 \n     pounds of TNT shall not exceed 1 in a million.\n\n  Not that it will cause a bomb. Just 4 pounds of TNT, a chance of 1 in \na million.\n\n       The probability of premature nuclear detonation of a bomb \n     due to bomb component malfunction shall not exceed one in a \n     billion in any environment the bomb is designed to \n     experience, or one in a million for accident when the weapon \n     is exposed to an environment outside its designed parameters. \n     Quantitative criteria are also used to certify weapon \n     reliability.\n\n  Now, Senator Bumpers, the answer to your question is that the \nscientists who developed them, the scientists who designed them, the \nscientists who supervised their building and their destruction are now \nasked to try a whole new approach and come up with a science-based \nstockpile stewardship initiative. And they are not going to be \nabsolutely certain that it is going to work. But we have to give them \nwhat is necessary for them to say we are moving toward making sure that \nit will work.\n  Now, I am not going to go into any more detail about the Nevada Test \nSite or anything else. I am merely going to say that we have concluded \nthat a number of things must be done in order to achieve this stockpile \nstewardship relationship. One--and you will understand this in a \nminute--massive new supercomputer capability to model, in three \ndimensions, the workings of the nuclear weapon is required in these \nlaboratories. Massive. In fact, it will be the driving force for \nsupercomputing in the future, because you need so much computer \ncapability. Facilities that improve our understanding of how material \nbehaves at very high temperatures and pressures found within nuclear \nweapons, and the enhanced diagnostic capability.\n\n  See, now we have to have some diagnostic capability to look into the \nbombs and into the explosives and see how things are working. We didn't \nhave those like we now are going to have in the next 5-year program.\n  And then I add, Senator, five things that have happened since the \nPresident and many of us--in fact, I will confess to you that I worked \nwith the administration on this $4 billion idea, which was $4 billion a \nyear. Let's see if it will make that stockpile stewardship solid. But \nthere are five things that haven't come to fruition that cost more \nmoney.\n  One--and you know this--START II has not been ratified. So the \nlaboratories are having to maintain a larger number of weapons of more \ndesigns than they anticipated.\n  Second, the plants that we have to produce more spare parts and \nreplacements are not being built down because we haven't built down the \nstockpile. And the delay in reducing the stockpile has increased the \nneed and the schedule for tritium production. All of these were \ndiscussed, incidentally, in your absence, not only by me, but by \nSenator Reid when we explained what was in our bill during the \nintroduction of it today.\n  And then there have been some very expensive, unexpected maintenance \ncosts. I trust we will leave it at that. DOE's administrative costs \nhave not declined as were envisioned in 1992.\n  I would like, if the Senator would agree, to let Senator Reid take a \nfew moments to also address your inquiry. Before I do that, I wonder, \non the Democrat side, if the Senator knows of any additional amendments \nbesides the amendment that is expected to be voted on. We are not ready \nyet. We would like to make a list so we know there are no further \namendments.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arkansas that I \nthink he has rendered service to the Senate and this country by coming \nhere today and allowing us to speak about something that the manager of \nthe bill and I feel is the most important obligation we have, and that \nis to make sure that our nuclear deterrent is safe and reliable. There \nis no better spokesperson for that than the senior Senator from \nArkansas, who not only has, over his many years in the Senate, been \nconcerned about the weapons system of this country, but also, I say, \nwith the greatest respect, his wife Betty Bumpers has worldwide fame as \na result of the organization she formed called Peace Links and has been \ninvolved for many, many years in making our world a more peaceful \nplace. So I think it is very appropriate that the Senator would come \nand talk about this issue today.\n  I say to my friend from Arkansas that the appropriations for atomic \nenergy defense activities aren't driven by any parochial interests or \nState interests. These appropriations are driven by the program \nrequirements to provide for the national and strategic security of our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, we have the stockpile. We are going to have it for the \nforeseeable future. We must continually study it and assess it for \nsafety and reliability. The Senator from Arkansas said in his statement \nthat when the moratorium came on underground nuclear testing, as we \nhave known in the past, that he anticipated there would be other ways \nof testing. That is absolutely right. The scientists have come up with \nother ways than the underground testing that we had for so many years.\n  The first such test was conducted in Nevada just a few weeks ago. It \nwas called a sub-critical test. It is just as stated. They start \nconducting an experiment using nuclear materials, but the experiment is \ncontrolled so that a critical mass is never achieved. That means that \nno significant nuclear reaction, no nuclear chain reaction can occur.\n  That is what Senator Domenici was talking about. The computers take \nover. There is no explosion, but they are able to determine, through \nthe computers, what would have happened had the test gone critical. And \nthe first test was extremely successful. They had 140 optical channels \nto acquire data from the experiment, and they were able to get \ninformation from 139 of those.\n  The reason those tests are important, I say to my friend from \nArkansas, is we have to manage the stockpile because it is continually \nchanging as it gets older. We have to look at some of the nuclear \nmaterials that decay with time and need periodic replacement. Some of \nthe bonding materials that hold the components together, or in place, \nchange chemically over time and become less effective as bonding \nagents. Some of the products of chemical change inside the weapon are \ncaustic and attack or corrode other materials and components. It's like \nwhen you go to a drugstore and you go to the pharmacist and you order a \nmedication. Right now, many of the big drugstore chains are able to \ndetermine if you are taking other medication that might interact with \nthe stuff that you are getting from the drugstore. Well, the same basic \nfunction is performed here. We need to know what happens when these \nchemicals react because this is one of the main aging effects that \nmight make the weapon unsafe or unreliable.\n  Some materials corrode from other effects, including exposure to the \natmosphere and to radioactivity that is unavoidable in these kinds of \nterrible weapons of destruction.\n  So the safety and reliability of the stockpile will change with time. \nDeterrence requires that we understand these processes and their \nconsequences far better now because the stockpile will never again be \ntested under the new international agreements we have sponsored.\n  When I first came to the House of Representatives, one of the first \nvotes I cast was a very controversial vote for the Congressman from the \nState of Nevada, and that was regarding the nuclear freeze. I voted for \nthat nuclear freeze when I was in the House of Representatives because \nI believe the problem in the world today is not nuclear testing, it's \nnuclear weapons; we have too many of them. The manager and I have \nworked on a way of reasonably testing these weapons. I refer the \nSenator from Arkansas, and everybody within the sound of my voice, to \nthe report filed with this bill. I am not going to read all of the \nlanguage in the report, but I am going to read a few things because I \nthink it answers many of the questions that the Senator propounded.\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n  The second paragraph:\n\n       The mission of defense programs is to maintain the safety, \n     security, and reliability of the Nation's enduring nuclear \n     weapons stockpile within the constraints of a comprehensive \n     test ban, utilizing a science-based approach--\n\n  I repeat that: ``a science-based approach''\n\n     --to stockpile stewardship and management in a smaller, more \n     efficient weapons complex infrastructure. The future weapons \n     complex will rely on scientific understanding and expert \n     judgment, rather than on underground nuclear testing and the \n     development of new weapons, [We are not going to rely on that \n     anymore] to predict, identify, and correct problems affecting \n     the safety and reliability of the stockpile. Enhanced \n     environmental capabilities, and new tools in computation, \n     surveillance, and advanced manufacturing will become \n     necessary to certify weapon safety performance and \n     reliability without underground nuclear testing.\n\n  That is what this money is for:\n\n       Weapons will be maintained, modified, retired, and \n     dismantled as needed to meet arms control objectives or \n     remediate potential safety and reliability issues. As new \n     tools are developed and validated, they will be incorporated \n     into a smaller, more flexible and agile weapons complex \n     infrastructure for the future.\n\n  I think the Senator will agree that is a great goal for us to obtain:\n\n       The Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program is a \n     single, highly integrated technical program for maintaining \n     the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile in \n     an era without underground nuclear testing and without new \n     nuclear weapons development . . .\n\n  Skipping on, I say to my friend from Arkansas:\n\n       There are three primary goals of the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Management Program:\n\n  Reading from page 100 of our report:\n\n       (1) provide high confidence in the safety, security, and \n     reliability of the U.S. stockpile to ensure the continuing \n     effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear deterrent while \n     simultaneously supporting U.S. arms control and \n     nonproliferation policy;\n       (2) provide a small, affordable, and effective production \n     complex to provide component and weapon replacements when \n     needed, including limited lifetime components and tritium;\n       and (3) provide the ability to reconstitute U.S. nuclear \n     testing and weapon production capacities, consistent with \n     Presidential directives and the ``Nuclear Posture Review,'' \n     should national security so demand in the future.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Arkansas, we are doing not only what is \nrequired for national security but we are also following the directives \nof the President of the United States. That is what is so sensitive \nwith the obligation that we have been given.\n  On this same page, skipping down to the bottom of another paragraph:\n\n       The President has also requested a new annual certification \n     process to certify that the stockpile is safe and reliable in \n     the absence of underground nuclear testing, and to produce a \n     statement about the future confidence in the safety and \n     reliability of the stockpile.\n\n  So that is what this is all about. There has to be a certification, \nrequired by the President, that the stockpile is safe and reliable. It \nis not easy. It takes money.\n  One of the programs that the Senator from Arkansas should be aware of \nis that there is going to be a new National Ignition Facility built \nthat we talked about earlier today that will be the foundation for this \nnew science-based stockpile stewardship program.\n  It is expensive to do that. When underground nuclear testing stopped, \nwe had no idea that to build a facility like that would cost $1 \nbillion. That is for brick and mortar. Work is beginning. The funding \nof that is in this bill. It will be developed in the State of \nCalifornia. We are appropriating about $187 million in this bill for \nthat program that we never anticipated would be constructed.\n\n  So what we are doing in this bill regarding our weapons systems, in \nmy opinion, I say to my friend from Arkansas, is a relatively small \namount compared to the Defense appropriations bill which we just \npassed, but it is just as important, even though it involves a very, \nvery small amount of money compared to the Defense appropriations bill. \nWhat we are doing here deals with weapons of mass destruction. It \ndoesn't deal with whether we are going to build an F-22, or a joint \nstrike fighter, or whether we are going to have an aircraft carrier. It \ndeals with weapons of mass destruction.\n  What this subcommittee has done within its best ability, and with the \nbest judgment we have, is we have come up with funding to provide the \nPresident and this Nation with a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say to both the Senator from New \nMexico and to the Senator from Nevada, for whom I have the utmost \nrespect and friendship, that I do not disagree with very much of \nanything either of them just got through saying. And they said it very \nwell. I would like to say to the Senator from Nevada that that was \nindeed a courageous vote when he voted for the nuclear freeze, \nparticularly as the Senator from Nevada. It was a very courageous vote. \nBut, as he knows, correct votes around here are often very courageous. \nSometimes we lose Senators because they cast too many courageous votes. \nIt doesn't happen very often. Probably it ought to happen more often \nthan it does.\n  But, in any event, I compliment him on that. I have always been in \nsupport of the nuclear freeze. I have been for 2\\1/2\\ years standing at \nthis desk back here talking about the insanity of the number of nuclear \nweapons in both our stockpile and the Soviet Union's, now Russia's, \nstockpile when both countries always had hundreds of times more weapons \nthan it would take to destroy the planet. So I have fought with some \nsmall measure of success to bring some sanity to the whole thing.\n  I just close out by this question that, as I say, troubles me. And \nthe reason that I came over here to offer this amendment to this bill \nwhich we are now debating, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, is \nthat it contains $4.302 billion for nuclear weapons, for weapons \nactivities, and the uses, which the Senators have described, to provide \nfor the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. Nobody would \nquestion that for a moment. I mean we have enough problems about how we \nare going to dispose of all of this stuff. That is one of hottest \ndebates we have had so far in the Senate: How we are going to get rid \nof nuclear materials. But here we have a $4.302 billion bill. And this \nis the thing that causes me some considerable concern: that it is $284 \nmillion above what the Senate authorizing committee just authorized \nyesterday.\n  When I first came here, and up until recently, you could not \nappropriate more money than the authorizing committee authorized. And \nwe are reaching the point where we don't need authorizing committees \nanymore because we routinely exceed what they recommend.\n  So this bill is $284 million above the Senate authorized amount, $258 \nmillion more than the President recommended, $336 million more than the \nHouse authorized, and $359 million more than the House Appropriations \nCommittee approved.\n  Here are three authorizations, plus the President's request. And the \nPresident's request is supposed to reflect what DOD, the Defense \nDepartment, wants. We don't separate the two. When we talk about the \nPresident's request, we are speaking for the Defense Department. Here \nwe are appropriating $258 million more than the President and DOD asked \nfor.\n  So here we are $250 million-plus above everybody--the President, the \nauthorizing committee, the House authorizing committee, and the House \nAppropriations Committee.\n  So I know the Senator can understand why that piqued my curiosity.\n  I would be delighted to yield the floor to the Senator, if he would \nlike to respond to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think maybe if the Senator from \nArkansas ever thought that bringing down an amendment or discussion \nlike this was futile, I believe this is the best explanation of what we \nare doing in the Department of Energy with reference to nuclear \nweapons. Maybe I have not been here for every discussion. But I think \nhe has pushed us to discuss things that should have been discussed \nregularly, and more people should understand it. I can tell you that \neverybody knows that I have a lot of this activity in my State. But I \nam firmly convinced that we had better not come in on the short side of \ndollar expenditures on this process which is going to end up --and this \nought to be dear to\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\nthe Senator from Arkansas because he is one of the leaders in trying to \nstop the testing. But if we are going to keep these people who are in \ncharge of these laboratories able to certify that these weapons aren't \ngoing to go awry, or become unsafe, or deteriorate, then we had better \nnot come on the short side of appropriating for their core staffers, \nand for the equipment and science research that they need.\n\n  Frankly, I laud those experts within the Department of Defense, \nEnergy, and outsiders who came up with the substitute transition \napproach to move from testing to this science-based stockpile \nstewardship. But I can tell you from visiting the laboratories, talking \nto the directors, and talking to the people in charge of the divisions \nthat are most contentious regarding having the right staff to do this \nnew job, I am convinced that they have one tough job.\n  Like I said to the Senator from Arkansas. I wish we could say we \ndon't have this arsenal to maintain. And the Senator knows we had more \nthan we needed. I think we have to say about our laboratories and their \nresponsibilities that they kept us in a state of readiness when nobody \ndared to do anything. And I think we all agree with that. Thus, the \nworld has not had a nuclear device exploded intentionally to harm \npeople or things since the ones that happened in Japan. That is because \nwe had great laboratories with the greatest scientists we could put \ntogether keeping us out there.\n  I think we must do the same on this transition in 5 to 10 years. I \nworked very hard at this. I want to tell you that I don't believe that \nwe know yet whether this 4.32 is the right number.\n  And, in answer to the last inquiry, we are not finished. We have to \ngo through a House that has less. In answer to the question about the \ndefense authorization versus appropriations, they are not finished yet. \nThe House has different approaches. In fact, the Senator might have \nasked why they appropriated less than was authorized in the previous \nbill. That is because we are not through yet. There are disagreements.\n  But I thank the Senator for the dialog today. And I am very pleased \nthat I was able to contribute to it. I hope I was, and I thank the \nSenator for his questions.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for both \nmanagers of this bill, the chairman and ranking member.\n  Let me just say that the Senator brought this up. I deliberately did \nnot mention Sandia and Los Alamos and the fact that Nevada receives a \nsubstantial part of this money because I don't really care where the \nmoney is spent. This is an issue to me that transcends the parochial \ninterests of jobs. It is not that that isn't important to the Senator. \nOf course it is. It is important to me when I am fighting for something \nfor my State. But, as I say, there is something here that transcends \nthat; that is, how much money we are spending on this.\n  I tell you that I share the Senator's concern for the same reasons \nthat the Senator stated. My only concern is whether or not we are \nappropriating way too much money to accomplish what is, indeed, a very, \nvery legitimate end.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of the \nadditional funds provided to the Department of Energy for stockpile \nstewardship and stockpile maintenance under this appropriation bill. I \ndo so both as someone who has followed nuclear weapons' issues for many \nyears and as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces, which has authorizing jurisdiction \nover these funds.\n  In testimony before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, two \ncompelling points were made about these programs.\n  First, we are only beginning to learn how to certify the safety and \nreliability of the stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This \nSpring was the first time that the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy jointly made this certification. This procedure is \nnow required by law to be completed each year. As time goes on and the \nnuclear weapons stockpile continues to age, our ability to certify the \nstockpile without testing will become more and more dependent on new \nscience and technology that will emerge from the stockpile stewardship \nand stockpile management program. This conclusion was agreed to by all \nconcerned--by Assistant Secretary Vic Reis on behalf of the Department \nof Energy and by General Habiger on behalf of the Strategic Command.\n  Second, there is considerable skepticism here in the Senate and in \nthe defense community that the science-based stockpile stewardship can \nsucceed over the long term. There are many who believe that the design \nof nuclear weapons relies so much on art as opposed to science that we \nwill inevitably have to return to underground nuclear testing. I hope \nthat this is not true, and I believe that ending underground nuclear \ntesting is so important a policy objective that we must give science-\nbased stockpile stewardship every chance to succeed. While the \nPresident shares this concern, it must also be recognized that his \nbudget request had to strike a balance on many different dimensions and \nthat even within the Department of Energy programmatic tradeoffs had to \nbe made. We received strong testimony in the Armed Services Committee \nthat the President's request was not adequate in a number of areas \nreceiving extra funds in this bill, and I think that there is a good \ncase to be made for keeping those funds in this bill.\n  For example, on the stockpile stewardship side, we had the following \ntestimony from the Director of the Sandia National Laboratories:\n\n       The costs of stockpile stewardship are not a linear \n     function of stockpile size. A threshold capability will be \n     needed to support the stockpile as long as it numbers in \n     thousands, especially with the sophistication and demand for \n     reliability that is associated with the systems on which \n     deterrence rests today. I believe that we are near that \n     threshold now, especially in light of the closures and \n     changes that have occurred in recent years.\n\n  I don't believe that we ought to be addressing the question of the \nsafety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile by seeing how close we \ncan get to the threshold at which we can no longer certify the safety \nand reliability of the stockpile.\n  Another Director of a nuclear weapons laboratory, Dr. Bruce Tartar of \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, had this to say:\n\n       The greatest challenges [to stockpile stewardship] lie \n     ahead. The demands on the Stockpile Stewardship and \n     Management Program will grow as weapons in the enduring \n     stockpile continue to age. The U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile \n     is now older on average than it has ever been. And, the \n     reservoir of nuclear test and design experience at the \n     laboratories continues to diminish.\n\n  Further, on the stockpile management side, the DOE production plants \nthat make nonnuclear components for the enduring stockpile are in sorry \nphysical shape. Some 80 percent of the nonnuclear components in nuclear \nweapons wear out and have to be replaced, during the lifetime of that \nweapon. Thus, there is an important continuing role for the DOE \nproduction plants in maintaining the enduring stockpile. The Armed \nServices Committee received credible testimony that the President's \nbudget request was inadequate to do so. The budget request, for \nexample, would result in a budget shortfall for one plant alone, the \nKansas City plant, of nearly $56 million--$30 million for production \noperations and $26 million for capital equipment and infrastructure \nrequirements. The president of the division of Allied Signal who is \nresponsible for the Kansas City plant had this to say before the Armed \nService Committee, in regard to the President's budget:\n\n       In my view, diminishing support for the production plants \n     would be extremely shortsighted and dangerous for the \n     complex. For plants to be effective members of the team, we \n     must have current and future capabilities to participate \n     fully . . . [Implementation of the programmatic environmental \n     impact statement for stockpile stewardship and management] \n     will require future funding to downsize the plants \n     physically, funding to recapitalize the plants so they are \n     able to function properly once they are fully downsized, and \n     adequate short-term funding to carry out production missions \n     for current requirements.\n\n  I believe that the additional funding in this bill is necessary and \nappropriate, and I can assure the Senator\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\nfrom Arkansas that as we go to conference on both this bill and the \nDefense authorization bill, we will arrive at final totals for funds \nauthorized and appropriated that will result in the best possible, and \nmost cost-effective program for maintaining the safety and reliability \nof the stockpile.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I just state that I think Senator Feingold is \nready to go with an amendment. Is that correct? Then we are working on \na list of amendments. We will have it momentarily on all of the other \namendments, most of which we think we have resolved.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 1004.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 868\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Brownback, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered \n     868.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 15, line 10, after ``appropriated'', insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall, not later than November 15, 1997, provide a \n     report to Congress on a revised project plan for the Animas-\n     LaPlata project that reduces the total cost of the program to \n     the Federal Government, limits the diversion of water from \n     the Animas River to an amount recommended by the U.S. Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, and ensures the project will be \n     designed and implemented in the most cost-effective manner \n     for the federal government: Provided further, That none of \n     the funds appropriated in this or any prior act may be \n     expended for construction until a project has been authorized \n     at a date subsequent to the enactment of this appropriations \n     act''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nBrownback] and the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain]. This \namendment is the product of negotiations of a number of Senators and \nprovides that none of the funds appropriated in this bill for the \nAnimas-La Plata project can be expended for construction until the \nSecretary of Interior submits a report on a new scaled-down project \ndesign and the new project is actually authorized by Congress at a date \nsubsequent to the date of the enactment of this bill.\n  Mr. President, what this amendment means is that we will stop and \nevaluate what should be done before we spend more Federal dollars on \nthis project. As colleagues may recall from my statement last year on \nthis matter, the currently authorized Animas-La Plata project is a \ntaxpayer-funded water development project planned for southwest \nColorado and northwest New Mexico. The project is designed to supply \n191,230 feet of water. The Animas-La Plata project consists of two \nmajor reservoirs, 7 pumping plants and 20 miles of canals and pipes and \nwill pump water over 1,000 feet uphill, consuming enough power to run a \ncity of 60,000 people to supply municipal, industrial and irrigation \ninterests.\n  Last Tuesday, Mr. President, prior to the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee markup of the legislation that is before \nthis body, those who support the construction of the Animas-La Plata \nproject announced that they have developed what they believe to be a \ncheaper and scaled-down alternative. The announcement of an alternative \nsends a clear signal to this body. After 30 years and $71 million in \nappropriations to date, the project costs of Animas-La Plata are too \ngreat and there are too many lingering substantive questions to proceed \nwith the original design.\n  As I indicated during the discussion over the fiscal year 1997 energy \nand water appropriations legislation, I do support the search for an \nalternative to Animas-La Plata. In fact, legislation that I introduced \non March 13, 1997, cosponsored also by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. \nBrownback] and also by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Gregg] and sponsored in the other body by my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin [Mr. Petri] and the Congressman from New York [Mr. \nDeFazio], deauthorizes the current Animas-La Plata reclamation project \nand directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with the Southern Ute \nand Ute Mountain Ute tribes to find an alternative to satisfy their \nwater rights needs.\n  However, the taxpayers should not continue to be asked to sock money \naway in Bureau of Reclamation construction accounts as a placeholder \nfor an option that has not yet fully been analyzed and authorized.\n  This new alternative by the proponents has not had a full cost \nevaluation by the Department of Interior and, of greater concern to me, \nrequires statutory changes to be implemented that I think should be \nreviewed by the authorizing committee in question.\n  It is the jurisdiction of this body's Energy Committee to determine \nthe benefits of a reclamation project, and it is the responsibility of \nthe Interior Department to make certain that the Federal Government's \nlegal responsibilities to the Ute tribes under any sort of an agreement \nare met.\n  This revised project, which would be evaluated by the Department of \nInterior under our amendment, at a minimum may require major changes to \nseveral relevant laws and agreements. The 1986 Ute Settlement Agreement \nmay have to be renegotiated to reflect changes in water allocations \namong parties to the agreement, particularly the reduced quantity of \nwater, changes in contract and repayment requirements and obligations \nand changes in cost-sharing requirements. The 1988 Colorado Ute Indian \nWater Rights Settlement Act may also need changes to conform to a new \nagreement and new requirements.\n  Finally, the Water Supply Act of 1958 would need to be changed to \nmodify or waive current requirements that the beneficiaries of \nmunicipal and industrial water repay the Federal Government for \nconstruction costs with interest and pay for the Bureau of Reclamation \noperations and maintenance costs that are attributable to the amount of \nwater they receive.\n  Let me make it clear, Mr. President, because we will be reauthorizing \nthis project at some date in the future, the language in this amendment \nallows the Secretary to explore and recommend any appropriate \nalternative, including nonstructural alternatives, in developing a \nrevised plan for submission to Congress.\n  These issues will all be assessed under the amendment we are offering \nbefore any funds can be expended in the construction of a new project. \nI think this is a responsible way to proceed, and I am pleased that so \nmany Members of the Senate have worked together toward this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold \namendment, of which I am a cosponsor, and associate myself with the \nSenator's comments.\n  I would like to note first that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. \nCampbell], has done an outstanding job in representing his State in the \nwork he has done on this particular project, and I realize I come late \nto this project and this proposal that he has worked on for a number of \nyears. But as a new Senator looking at it, I have some questions about \nthis particular project and this particular proposal, and that is why I \njoin in this amendment. I know it has gone on for some period of time, \nand this has been a fight that has existed for some long period of \ntime. But I think there are some questions that need to be answered. I \nthink we have now started to take some of the tentative steps toward \nresolving those issues.\n  No. 1, this ought to be scrutinized by the authorizing committee \nrather than going through the appropriations process. That seems to be \nthe legitimate way to go for us. It should first and foremost proceed \nthrough the authorizing committee, and this will give us a chance to \nbetter develop an alternative plan.\n  There are significant environmental questions regarding the issue of \nthis particular project. Those have been in\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nexistence for some period of time, and they are the product of a lot of \nthese studies that have been going on, and yet they still remain. There \nis a great deal of division about the impact on the environment, the \nimpact on endangered species. That is why it seems to me, again, it is \nwise to go back to the authorizing committee, to have an authorization \nprocess to take place with this particular bill.\n  That is what this amendment does. It directs the Department of \nInterior to take certain steps toward what will lead to a legally \nbinding agreement that will secure the tribes' water rights and will \nenable us to make certain that our tax dollars are spent wisely and we \nkeep any environmental impacts small. So I agree with the Senator from \nWisconsin that while these are very difficult things to do because \nthere is a lot at stake in what various people want for their \nparticular States, for their particular areas, in looking at these \nprojects they may well at the end of the day prove to be very wise \nprojects. This one, I think, has proceeded in the wrong fashion. It \nneeds to go back to the authorizing committee. I think the amendment we \nhave put forward here has some strong bipartisan support. It is a \nsensible project. It does not kill the project. It simply says let us \ngo back and take it through the right and appropriate steps. I think \nthat is prudent in answering the difficult questions that exist.\n  So I rise in support of this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair. I rise in opposition to this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, in the years I have been in the Senate, what has \nalways interested me is the history of these desks. If you open these \ndesks, as many of my colleagues have and most people who are students \nof history of the Senate know, inside the drawer literally every \nSenator who has served in the Senate has signed his name and noted the \nState from which he came. I often wonder, when I read the names of \nthose Senators in the drawers and the little accompanying booklet that \ngoes with it, how they voted on issues that affected the American \nIndian.\n  In this particular desk, we will probably not know without extensive \nresearch how Senator Townsend or Senator Kean or Senator Goldsborough \nor Senator Brown or Senator Case or Senator Duff, to mention just a few \nwho have used this desk, voted on American Indian issues. But during \nthe days when ``Manifest Destiny'' was the national watchword, I wonder \nif they voted with the pack to take away the last remaining land and \nwater possessions and freedom of the American Indian, or did at least a \nfew show courage and stand up for fairness by protecting a people who \ncould no longer defend themselves. I wonder, did they subscribe to \nAbraham Lincoln's creed that ``all men are created equal,'' or was the \njingo of Andrew Jackson's day, ``The only good Indian is a dead \nIndian,'' their guiding principle?\n  Today, I stand at the desk of my friend and colleague, Senator Pete \nDomenici, from New Mexico, who is managing this bill on the majority \nside. Senator Domenici is known nationwide in Indian country for his \nfairness and leadership in making sure that the lives of the American \nIndians are just a little better. And to my left, Senator Reid of \nNevada, who is managing for the minority side, has the same reputation. \nI am very gratified that they are here in the Chamber with us today. I \nam hopeful that the attitude exemplified by these two outstanding \nsenators, the new enlightened attitude, marks a change for the entire \nsenate from that attitude of those forgotten Senators whom I mentioned \nearlier and upon which they made their decision concerning the first \nAmericans.\n  We do not intentionally kill Indians with bullets or disease anymore. \nBut it seems clear that some of our brothers still want to kill their \nlivelihood, kill their opportunity, kill their future, kill their \nculture, and kill their natural resources that we promised them in \nevery one of the 472 treaties that we then broke as an arm of the U.S. \nGovernment. And, by the way, Mr. President, American Indians broke none \nof them.\n\n  I guess what amazes me the most about those who advocate taking away \nwhat little American Indians have left are often Senators who neither \nhave the institutional memory of the 1968 authorizing act of the \nAnimas-La Plata or the 1988 bill that I carried 10 years ago which \nimplemented a compromise agreement that was signed into law and has \nbeen supported by every President since 1988. These Senators are often \nones who have never even seen an Indian reservation.\n  To them, I would say go out and spend some time in an Indian \ncommunity that has a 75-percent unemployment rate, as one reservation \nin Senator Reid's State, in Owyhee, NV, does have. Speak to families \nwhose children have dropped out of school and then committed suicide as \nan escape from a hopeless, dark future.\n  One out of every two teenage girls and one out of every three teenage \nboys try suicide in their teenage years in some reservations. This is \nnot a Third World country I am speaking about. It is a daily experience \nfor many American Indians in this, the greatest country on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  Go out and speak to the social workers inundated with problems of a \ndepressed culture and little resources to help. Listen to the \nfrustrated tribal council members who try to cope with fetal alcohol \nsyndrome, a rate so bad that on some reservations one out of every four \nIndian babies born suffers from some degree of fetal alcohol syndrome, \nsome to such a degree that they have to be institutionalized for life \nat the taxpayer's expense.\n  All of those problems, Mr. President, were inherited as side effects \nof what was called ``westward expansion,'' and the ensuing lack of \nopportunity continues to this day. I would tell my colleagues to go out \nthere and experience hunger and sickness that is a daily experience for \nall too many American Indians. And then come back here to this floor \nand tell their colleagues how we do not owe Indians anything. But do \nnot tell us that you are doing it in their best interest or in the \ninterest of saving taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, all they have to do is look at the amount we spend now \nin Federal programs, about $1.5 billion through the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs last year and about $2 billion through the Indian Health \nService. Almost all of it is to help a people who have become dependent \non Federal programs through no cause of their own.\n  We will soon debate in this Chamber, Mr. President, the expansion of \nNATO and the billions of dollars that expansion will cost the American \ntaxpayer, and as sure as I am standing here, some on this floor will \nsupport that expenditure of all those billions and still vote to take \naway the last best chance for economic independence for the Southern \nUtes and the Ute Mountain Utes right here in my State of Colorado.\n  When we speak of spending taxpayers' money, where is it written that \nall those billions that go to foreign countries are justified when we \ncannot find a pittance to help American Indians?\n  The Animas-La Plata is an agreement that must be honored. Not only \ndid the tribes agree to the project but the States of Colorado and New \nMexico did, too, a number of water conservancy districts did, and nine \nFederal agencies all agreed to the compromise of 1988. We are now being \nasked to compromise a compromise of the original 1968 authorization. \nCongress approved the settlement agreement in the Colorado Ute Indian \nWater Settlement Act of 1988 and President Reagan signed it into Public \nLaw, and it has been supported by every President since.\n  The only thing we are asking in this appropriations bill is what the \nPresident has in his budget. Too many people are dependent on this \nproject, both Indian and non-Indian, to simply disregard it. Anyone \nfrom the American West can tell you, and particularly the American \nIndian, water is life. Water is the lifeblood of our future. This \nsettlement fulfills the rights of tribes for water on the reservation. \nIt settles disputes and removes causes for future litigation. It \nsecures the tribes' opportunity to generate revenue from the use of \nreserve rights obtained under the agreement and authorizes them to sell \nor exchange or lease some of their water.\n  Construction of the Animas-La Plata water project is essential to \nthat settlement. If the project is not completed\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nby the year 2000--and it is highly likely it may not be now, since the \nagreement was 1988 and the agreement stipulated they would start \nconstruction by 1990 and we are already behind by 7 years--the tribes \nhave the option to go back to court to pursue their original claims in \nboth the Animas and La Plata Rivers. Their victory in court would be \ncertain and would trigger years of costly litigation among the United \nStates, the State of Colorado, and water right holders throughout the \nregion, wreaking havoc on the economies and water administration in \nColorado.\n  I might also point out that when we get into that expensive \nlitigation at taxpayers' expense, it is going to be one Federal agency \nsuing the other Federal agency, because the Bureau of Indian Affairs is \nresponsible for protecting the Indian people, as you know. They will be \nsuing the Bureau of Reclamation for noncompliance. Guess who pays for \nthe expensive attorneys on both sides of the equation?\n  The Supreme Court has held, in Winters versus the United States, that \nthe United States, if the United States enters into a treaty with an \nIndian tribe creating a reservation, it impliedly reserves sufficient \nwater to irrigate the reservation lands. Based on that doctrine, which \nmandates that Indian tribes get water, not money, the United States in \n1976 filed reserved water right claims on behalf of both tribes. These \nreserved water rights would have preempted the vested water rights of \nnon-Indian water users in the San Juan River Basin, drying up family \nfarms and ranches that have existed in that area for years and years.\n  You can imagine how the non-Indian people feel about tribes going \nback to court and exerting their rights. They have these priority \nrights because they were there first, and they rarely lose in courts.\n  The Indian tribes do not want to go back to court. Their neighbors do \nnot want them to go back in court. They, instead, chose to settle, and \nthat is what the 1988 agreement was about. It is just lucky, I think, \nfor the majority of the people in our area that the Ute Indians \ncontinue to give in the same generous spirit that they once gave their \nland and lives to build this great Nation.\n  In looking at the Feingold amendment, it is simply divided into two \nparts. The first part is a diversion and the second part is a killer.\n  Mr. President, let's not add to the dismal record of our treatment of \nthe American Indians. Let's do the right thing and defeat the Feingold \namendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I move to table the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the motion to table takes no debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is a nondebatable motion. \nIt takes unanimous consent to proceed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \ntabling motion at this time in order to address this issue. I believe \nthe other Senator from Colorado wishes to address the issue as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I have no objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent I and the Senator from Colorado \nbe allowed to address this amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin \nprior to the tabling motion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time might you need, Senator? As much as you \nwant, but let's agree to it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will need 7 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I can keep my remarks brief and then submit my full \ncomments for the Record. If I can have a couple of minutes, that will \nbe sufficient.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent we proceed in the following \nmanner: The tabling motion be set aside so Senator McCain can speak for \nup to 10 minutes, Senator Allard for 10 minutes, and the Senator from \nNew Mexico up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me first of all start out by expressing my admiration \nand respect for the Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell. If there \nis any voice that is needed on behalf of native Americans in this body, \nit is that of Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell has the understanding, \nthe compassion, and, frankly, the credibility that no one else in this \nbody has concerning native American issues, along with others. \nHis advocacy for native Americans is something that has earned, not \nonly the respect of his colleagues here, but the respect and \nappreciation of millions of Americans both Indian and non-Indian alike.\n\n  I believe this amendment satisfies the concerns of native Americans \non this issue and at the same time reduces the costs rather \ndramatically. I believe it is a workable compromise that, hopefully, \nwill prevent us from revisiting this issue year after year. I remind my \ncolleagues, the original proposal by the Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold, was to do away with all funding for this project. \nThis is a significant step backward from that position and one that I \nhope we can support.\n  This amendment retains the $6 million currently in the bill for \ncontinuing negotiations and environmental assessments required for the \nAnimas-La Plata project. It requires the Secretary of the Interior to \nreport to Congress on a reduced, scaled-down plan for the project which \nwould have reduced costs for the Federal Government. Finally, the \namendment prohibits the use of any funds for construction of the \nproject until authorization is provided for a new project.\n  This is necessary because there are many legitimate concerns for the \nplan for the Animas-La Plata project. It's very expensive: $750 \nmillion. It includes some issues that raise serious environmental \nconcerns which need to be addressed. Yet, we need to resolve this \nlegitimate water rights claim for the Ute Tribes in Colorado and New \nMexico. They need to be resolved, I have no doubt. I point out, without \nthose water rights being resolved, then we will be, as the Senator from \nColorado so graphically described, abrogating our responsibilities by \nsolemn treaty to the Ute Tribes. This amendment will preserve the \nfunding necessary to go forward with environmental assessments and \nnegotiations necessary to conclude a revised, scaled-down project plan. \nWithout such an agreement and without a much more fiscally responsible \nplan, the United States could be liable for hundreds of millions of \ndollars to settle these water rights claims.\n  I want to point out that the Indians are part of this proposal that \nis embodied in this amendment. The parties principally concerned, \nincluding the Indians, with resolving this plan announced on July 8, \n1997, a new plan that would save the taxpayers over $400 million and \nreduce the environmental impact of the project while maintaining our \ntreaty commitments with the Ute Tribes. I want to point out that the \nUte Tribes' opinion on this issue is that we would maintain our treaty \ncommitments to those tribes.\n  This plan would save a great deal of money. The previous plan would \nhave cost almost $750 million while the new plan is estimated to cost \nabout $290 million--a savings of $460 million. The new plan reduces the \nFederal share of the project's cost, $257 million, and requires $33 \nmillion in State and local cost sharing. The plan will resolve \nlegitimate water rights claims without costly litigation. It complies \nwith the spirit of the 1988 Colorado Indian Water Rights Settlement Act \nand will honor a 130-year-old treaty commitment to the Ute Tribes. The \ntwo Ute Tribes have accepted this plan as a final settlement of their \nwater rights claims. The new, scaled-down plan significantly reduces \nthe environmental impact of Animas-La Plata. Water flow diverted from \nthe Animas River will be limited to 14.5 percent of the river's average \nannual flow, which is slightly more than half the diversion under the \noriginal plan. The new plan includes a proposal to protect endangered \nfish in the Animas\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nRiver system, which has been approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService. A dam on the Animas River will not be necessary because the \nnew plan does not include diversion of water for irrigation facilities. \nThe new plan redirects the project to provide maximum benefit to the \nUte Tribes.\n  The plan ensures that tribes will receive two-thirds of the water \ndiverted from the Animas River. The previous plans guaranteed large \namounts of water to local agricultural interests rather than Indians. \nThe new plan is fully supported by the tribal, State and local \ngovernments most directly affected by the Animas-La Plata project.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased when diverse groups, including tribes, \nState governments and local communities, get together to solve common \nproblems. I think the revised plan recently announced by the interested \nparties should be seriously considered by everyone concerned.\n  In the meantime, I believe we should proceed with the environmental \nassessments and necessary discussions to ensure the most fiscally \nresponsible plan will be developed to meet the U.S. treaty obligations \nand finalize a cost-effective plan for this project.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which will ensure \nthat we move forward in a timely fashion with a cost-effective, fair, \nand supportable Animas-La Plata project.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield for a question by the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. My question, first of all, is have you visited with \nleaders of the two tribes today, Senator?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response to the question, I have not visited with the \nleaders of the two tribes today. I have been briefed on the proposal \nthat has the signatures of the tribal membership's leaders is on it. \nThat was briefed to a number of people, including members of my staff.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I appreciate that. Then I would like to make the record \nclear, Mr. President, that I have met with the tribal representatives \ntoday, and they are absolutely opposed to this amendment. They have \n``an alternative proposal,'' but if it should be looked at, it should \nbe done fully through the authorizing committee as a bill, open to \npublic hearings, and not put into an appropriations bill where no one \nhas the time to read it. I haven't even read the proposal myself, and I \nlive there.\n  So there will be no mistake, the tribes today, as of today, said they \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment \nis based on a proposal brought forward, not only by the tribes, but \nalso the local authorities who are affected by the project. I certainly \ndo not dispute the word of the Senator from Colorado. If he has that \ninformation, I hope he will supply the letter for the Record. I am sure \nhe will be able to do that.\n  I think this proposal was brought forward in recognition that the \nentire Animas-La Plata project, because of the incredibly high-cost \nassociated with it, was in significant danger. The project almost was \ndefunded last year, in a very close vote here in the Senate. It was my \nbelief, and remains my belief, that the Feingold amendment is a \ncompromise that seeks to continue the funding and at the same time \nscale down the project and take into consideration the environmental \nconcerns and also comply with our treaty commitments to the Ute Tribes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope I am clear in my respect for the \nSenator from Colorado. But I also hope I am clear that never at any \ntime have I ever supported a measure that would be in violation of the \nsolemn treaty commitments that we have made. It is my understanding \nthat this amendment is in full compliance with the treaty commitments \nthat have been made concerning the water rights of the Ute Tribes.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. If the Senator would yield for a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute 20 \nseconds left. He can yield to whomever he wishes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, with that, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter signed by Chairman Judy Knight \nFrank, the chair of the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe and Chairman \nClement Frost, Southern Ute Indian Tribe, July 15, 1997, which opposes \nthis amendment.\n  If the Senator did not get a copy of this, I apologize for that. But \nI will be happy to share this with him and have that in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    July 15, 1997.\n     Members of the U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members: Construction of Phase I of the Animas-La \n     Plata project is a requirement for the completion of the \n     Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, and we \n     continue to seek fulfillment of that Act. Controversy has \n     delayed construction of the project, even those facilities \n     approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1991 and \n     directed by Congress in its FY 1996 Energy and Water \n     Appropriations bill to be built without delay.\n       We have tried, in every venue including a process \n     established last year by the State of Colorado and the \n     Department of the Interior, to address those controversies in \n     a responsible way, but in a way which fulfills the intent of \n     the Settlement--providing us with the water promised our \n     people in 1868 to meet our present and future needs.\n       We support Senator Campbell and Senator Domenici's \n     continuing efforts to ensure that the federal government \n     lives up to its obligations and trust responsibilities \n     identified in the 1988 Act. Of utmost importance to us is the \n     prompt construction of facilities which will protect that \n     water for the Tribes, and those facilities have been \n     authorized, analyzed and approved in many jurisdictions, \n     including the United States Congress. Funding for the \n     continued effort to build these facilities, making a stride \n     toward fulfillment of the Settlement Act of 1988, is \n     absolutely necessary.\n     Judy Knight Frank,\n                             Chair, Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe.\n     Clement Frost,\n                                 Chair, Southern Ute Indian Tribe.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, for his fine work. I would like to \nrecognize the tremendous work that my colleague and fellow Senator from \nColorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, has done on behalf of native \nAmericans.\n  I rise in opposition to the Feingold amendment. I rise today to offer \nmy support for the Animas-La Plata project.\n  This issue has been very contentious for a very long time. While the \nproponents of the amendment are well-intentioned, they are also very \npoorly informed. I can think back, maybe 3 or 4, maybe 6 months ago, \nwhen there was some activism within America, saying we ought to \napologize to native Americans. If we are really concerned about what \nhappens to native Americans, we ought to first look at keeping our \nword, keeping those treaties which we have signed.\n  The 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act recognized \nthe legitimate water rights claims established by treaty, way back to \n1868, and again promised the Ute Indian Tribes a permanent, reliable \nwater source to meet their present and future needs. These are rightful \nwater rights that have been affirmed by the Supreme Court and ratified \nby Congress. The Animas-La Plata project, the foundation for this \nsettlement, would divert a portion of the annual runoff from the Animas \nRiver into an off-stream reservoir, rather than damming the river and \nflooding the river valley. This project fulfills an obligation that we \nhave to the Indian tribes that we should not forsake. This is a treaty \nobligation. That is what those who favor elimination would like \neveryone to overlook.\n  The Rocky Mountain News, a major paper in the Rocky Mountain region, \nin an editorial published last week, made this point very well when \nthey wrote of the opponents to this project:\n\n       They will do anything, it seems, to achieve their goal of \n     seeing the United States break another agreement with Indian \n     tribes.\n\n  As the Ute Tribe stated recently, we only ask that Congress, which \npromised the two tribes adequate water supply when they placed us on a \nreservation over a century ago and agreed to a full-size Animas-La \nPlata in 1988, be fair with us now and support a reduced facility and \nsettlement.\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\n  What opponents of this project don't understand is that in the West, \nunless we have a facility to store water, we cannot really settle the \nwater claims of the Indians. What happens if we don't fund this \nproject? The tribes will sue, and instead of living up to our \nagreements, we will see litigation, and I don't think that is where we \nwant to be going.\n  But the issue here is bigger than just another project. The issue \nhere deals with not breaking another treaty with another tribe.\n  I yield time to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I forgot to have printed in the Record \nearlier in my comments two editorials from our State's two major \nnewspapers: one from the Rocky Mountain News dated Thursday, July 10, \nthe headline saying: ``The Utes' Generous Offer.'' It is an editorial \ndealing with how fair and understanding and conciliatory the Utes have \nbeen in the whole question of building this project. The other \neditorial I would like to have printed in the Record is from the Denver \nPost, which is our State's largest newspaper, and the headline is very \nsimply: ``Double-crossing the Utes.''\n  Let me read one paragraph from that very strong editorial:\n\n       The real question now is simply: How many times do Animas-\n     La Plata opponents think they can double-cross the Utes?\n       When the Utes asked for a $714 million project, opponents \n     said a $264 million project would do. When the Utes offered \n     to accept a $257 million project, the opponents then dangled \n     the vague hope of a $167 million handout. If Animas-La Plata \n     opponents now succeed in killing even the Utes' own scaled-\n     down plan, would they really have any incentive to keep even \n     that promise?\n\n  The answer is no.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these two editorials printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                        Double-Crossing the Utes\n\n       On Oct. 11, 1995, foes of the Animas-La Plata water \n     project, led by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, released \n     with great fanfare an engineering study claiming that a \n     smaller version of the project would fufill most of its goals \n     at a cost of just $264 million--barely a third of the $714 \n     million cost of the full project.\n       Leaders of the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes \n     reacted warily, suspecting that the supposed alternative was \n     a diversionary tactic intended to stall A-LP until it could \n     be killed entirely.\n       Guess what? The Utes were right.\n       The proof came last week when A-LP supporters unveiled \n     their own version of a downsized project--with a federal \n     price tag of just $257 million, $7 million less than \n     environmentalists supposedly were willing to accept in 1995. \n     Just as the Utes had feared, the project's foes reacted with \n     a furious attack on a plan very close to what the opponents \n     themselves proposed in 1995.\n       While tribal elections have consistently shown that the \n     great majority of Utes support A-LP, a small dissident group \n     led by Sage Remington opposes the project. Remington was on \n     hand last week to tout yet another supposed ``compromise'': \n     asking Congress to give the Utes $167 million to buy land and \n     water rights if and when they become available.\n       Ute Mountain Ute Chairman Judy Knight Frank and Southern \n     Ute Chairman Ray Frost have firmly rejected such a cash \n     handout. The Utes don't need money to buy more water rights. \n     To convert the theoretical rights they already own to \n     reality, the tribes need a reservoir to store the water so \n     they can use it when they need it.\n       The real question now is simply: How many times do A-LP \n     opponents think they can double-cross the Utes?\n       When the Utes asked for a $714 million project, opponents \n     said a $264 million project would do. When the Utes offered \n     to accept a $257 million project, the opponents dangled the \n     vague hope of a $167 million handout. If A-LP opponents now \n     succeed in killing even the Utes' own scaled-down plan, would \n     they really have any incentive to keep even that promise?\n       Chairman Frost had an answer to that question last week, \n     based on the Indian people's long and sorry history of being \n     cheated out of their land and water.\n       ``They'd probably give us $24. That's what they paid for \n     Manhattan.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Rocky Mountain News, July 10, 1997]\n\n                        The Utes' Generous Offer\n\n       Critics are lining up already to denounce the latest, \n     scaled-back version of the Animas-La Plata water project in \n     southwestern Colorado, announced this week in the nation's \n     capital. They will do anything, it seems, to achieve their \n     goal of seeing the United States break another agreement with \n     Indian tribes.\n       Such stubbornness was to be expected. Still, this week's \n     initiative by the two tribes--the Ute Mountain Utes and the \n     Southern Utes--should at least put their antagonists \n     temporarily on the defensive. After all, for years those \n     critics have complained that a majority of the water from \n     Animas-La Plata would go to non-Indian users. With this new \n     proposal, that is no longer true. In fact, the tribes would \n     get two-thirds of the water.\n       For years the critics have also worried about the effect of \n     the project on endangered species. Now the tribes wish to \n     take only the amount from the Animas river--57,000 acre-\n     feet--that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has said could \n     be withdrawn without harming two endangered fish species.\n       Why does none of this sway the coalition that opposes \n     Animas-La Plata? Because they believe the project is an \n     example of ``corporate welfare'' and an old-style federal \n     water scheme that fails any reasonable economic test. Whether \n     Animas-La Plata costs $680 million in federal revenue (the \n     previous version) or $257 million (under the latest scheme) \n     doesn't really matter. They're against it, and that's that.\n       We might oppose Animas-La Plata as well, save for the fact \n     that the two tribes are involved. Like it or not, they happen \n     to possess agreements from federal and state officials--\n     including a previous U.S. president--promising them that \n     Animas-La Plata would be built to fulfill their historic \n     water rights.\n       Pledges of that nature might not mean much to a single-\n     minded coalition battling corporate welfare, but it should \n     mean something fairly profound to most of the rest of us. \n     After all, double-crossing Indian tribes is a habit that \n     government was supposed to have outgrown. And just because \n     the tribes might be able to obtain enough water through \n     another means is irrelevant. They have not chosen another \n     means. They have chosen the Animas La-Plata project and the \n     government of the United States has promised them they could \n     have it.\n       Now those tribes have scaled their ambitions back--again--\n     and would like to see others meet them halfway.\n       They shouldn't hold their breath.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Idaho, Senator \nCraig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nKristine Svinicki on my staff be allowed the privilege of the floor for \nthe remainder of the consideration of S. 1004, the energy and water \ndevelopment appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in 1988, I helped my colleague from \nColorado, Senator Campbell, develop and pass the Colorado Ute Water \nSettlement Act. It was fair and responsible at that time to deal with a \ndispute that could only be dealt with in the nature that we solved it \nwith this legislation.\n  From that point to now, there has been discussion and dispute and a \nsubstantial scaling down of this project. In the high deserts of the \nWest, water is everything. If my colleague from Wisconsin lived in the \ndeserts of the West, he would be scrambling to secure water for his \npeople. He doesn't live there. He doesn't understand the importance of \nthis very, very critical water issue.\n  This is a balanced compromise with all parties sharing. These \nIndians, these native Americans without water can find it very, very \ndifficult to eke out an existence, whereas, with water, they have an \nopportunity with agriculture to prosper and develop their lands. That \nis what this issue is all about.\n  Let us keep our word and our promise. Let us develop an understanding \nthat when we, from the West, come to our colleagues asking for the \ndevelopment of water in the high deserts, that we work cooperatively \nwith them to do so, as we worked with our colleagues from the upper \nMidwest to secure flood control and those kinds of things where they \nhave an abundance of water and we have little to no water.\n  This is the important issue. I hope the amendment will be rejected by \nthe Senate, recognizing the promises and the commitments made and the \nkind of cooperative relationship we have with all of our colleagues, \nwhere one has an abundance of water; in this instance, we have little \nto no water. Therefore, to secure, to maintain, to ensure an \nenvironment, to actually increase the abundance of wildlife, one must \ncatch and store the water when it is available, and that is what this \nis all about. Not only for resource use, for environmental reasons, but \nmost assuredly to enhance the ability of native Americans in this \ninstance to improve their\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nlot and to gain what is responsibly and rightfully theirs.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will reject this amendment and get on \nwith the commitment we made in 1988 for this very important water \nproject.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reiterate that it is more than just \napologizing to the native Americans in this instance, it is keeping our \nword, it is keeping our agreement, a treaty with the native Americans. \nAgain, I think we ought to stand by the side of my Senator from \nColorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, in fighting this amendment, \nand support him in his efforts in trying to provide a better life for \nhis people and the native Americans in southwestern Colorado.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before I use my 10 minutes or allocate \nit to somebody, I would like to propose a unanimous-consent request \nthat has been cleared on the other side. Let me read it and read the \namendments that are listed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order to S. 1004 and they be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments:\n  Feingold-Brownback amendment No. 868;\n  Torricelli-Lautenberg amendment on Green Brook;\n  Kempthorne amendment on fish friendly turbines;\n  Bumpers amendment on 10-mile bayou;\n  Levin amendment on Great Lakes basin;\n  Biden amendment on Dewey-Rehoboth Beach;\n  Biden amendment on St. George's Bridge;\n  Daschle-Johnson amendment on Crow Creek rural;\n  Murkowski amendment on DOE external regulation;\n  Dorgan-Conrad amendment on Devils Lake;\n  Burns amendment on hydrogen R\n  Shelby amendment on Lake Tholocco Dam;\n  Bond relevant amendment;\n  Managers' amendment;\n  Moseley-Braun amendment on McCook Reservoir; and the\n  Dorgan relevant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the disposition of the above-listed amendments, S. 1004 be \nread a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill; further, when the Senate receives the House companion measure, \nthe Senate immediately proceed to its consideration. I further ask \nunanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and \nthe text of the Senate bill, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof, \nand the bill be read a third time and passed. I further ask that the \nSenate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senate for accommodating me. Might I say, \nof the nine or so amendments, I believe six will be resolved at least \nby mutual agreement between sides, so we will not have much left.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say, I do not believe the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin has any time. Tabling the amendment would be up. Is the \nSenator desirous of speaking?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for 1 minute on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator has 1 minute to speak on his amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to clarify that the comments of \nthe Senator from Idaho made great focus on the fact I am not from the \nWest. The fact is, Senator John McCain is a cosponsor of this \namendment, supports and believes it is reasonable and has a great \nfamiliarity with the concerns of the West.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I also want to make one thing clear. In contrast to the \nSenator from Colorado, this amendment provides for the authorizing \ncommittee to act on a revised project plan. It does not put into effect \nthe alternative plan. It does not prejudge what the project will look \nlike. It allows full public hearings before Congress acts. It does not \nstrike any funds, it simply says the funds in the bill cannot be \nexpended for construction of a new project until it is authorized. I \njust wanted to clarify that. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I have 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me tell the Senator from Wisconsin, it \nis not my intent to impugn his integrity. I am simply saying when you \nlive in a State with an abundance of water, your feelings about water \nare different. My colleague's State of Arizona is abundant with water \ntoday as a desert because this Congress saw fit to pour hundreds of \nmillions of dollars into water development in his State, and his State \nis the great beneficiary of those programs today.\n  Whether you agree or disagree, the reality is, Arizonans know how to \nallocate water resources most effectively. But the Ute Indians have not \nhad that opportunity, and I am simply saying that when you are in a \nhigh desert, you recognize that if human life is to exist, it exists \nonly in the presence of water.\n\n  I think my colleague understands that, but having been born and \nraised in the high deserts of the West, I think there is an \nunderstanding and appreciation that is sometimes difficult to convey, \nand that was my intent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for all Senators, I don't know what \ntheir evening schedule is, but I have not been told to create any \nwindow. We are going to vote in about 10 minutes on the motion to table \nthe Animas-La Plata amendment offered by Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. President, if I thought this amendment offered by Senator \nFeingold and the distinguished occupant of the chair would, in fact, \nkeep alive the Animas-La Plata project in a manner that had a \nreasonable chance of succeeding, I would be over here asking my friend \nfrom Arizona to go find our Indian leaders and let's go out in the hall \nand agree to it.\n  I am not talking about anybody's intent, but I am telling the Senate \nthat if this amendment becomes law, I do not believe the project has a \nchance of going anywhere.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is given broad latitude by this \namendment to make decisions about the project which I don't believe the \nU.S. Congress should give him for a project as controversial and \nsubject to pressure as this one. I make no reference to him personally \nor his abilities as Secretary, but I just don't believe that we can \ntell the Indian people that allowing Secretary Babbitt to decide what \nwill be a cost-effective way of completing the project--that is one \nitem in the amendment--will ever work.\n  The amendment states that the Secretary shall come up with a project \nthat limits the diversion of Animas-La Plata as recommended by the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service; let me say that number is about 57,000 acre-\nfeet annually. That is what the number ought to be; not a new number \nproposed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife, because they have already agreed to \n57,000 acre-feet. I don't want Fish and Wildlife in 2 or 3 years taking \nyet another look and then changing what they think ought to be \ndiverted.\n  This project is controversial because it costs money and it is giving \nwater to Indian people who have been denied their legitimate water \nrights. I believe Ute tribes have a very good case to make that the \nU.S. Government has denied them promised water rights,\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nand this project is a solution to getting the Utes wet water and \navoiding costly litigation.\n  I do not believe we ought to allow this amendment which permits the \nSecretary of the Interior or anyone other than Congress to decide the \nfate of the project. That is my feeling, I say to Senator Campbell, and \nI believe what we have done--so the Senate will understand, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee put in this bill precisely the amount of money \nthat the President of the United States asked for. No more, no less.\n  With this appropriation, development of this project, I believe \nrightly so, will be able to proceed in an orderly manner. This \namendment allows the Secretary of the Interior to define this project. \nNobody else has mentioned the Secretary of the Interior's role in this \namendment, but I think if you read it carefully, it gives him all kinds \nof authority to decide the fate of this project. The Secretary already \nhas delegated much of that authority to the Governor and Lieutenant \nGovernor of Colorado to have meetings with the interested parties to \nsee if they can resolve the issue. I just do not believe this amendment \nfurthers the goal of getting the Indians their water.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I point out, it was the Fish and Wildlife Department \nthat has thrown so many roadblocks in front of the Animas-La Plata \nalready under the guise of the Endangered Species Act, as you know.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I do not want to go back over all \nthe problems that we have had with eight or nine departments of the \nGovernment fighting against each other with regard to this project, but \nthe Senator is correct.\n  But I do want to say, for anybody who is listening, the Senator from \nColorado--who occupies my seat; he just said that a while ago while I \nam here in this one--has said it right.\n  We ought to solve this problem and give to these two Indian tribes \nwhat they deserve; promised water. They have been most patient, most \nwilling to compromise in a realistic way.\n  I add just parenthetically that my little State has been waiting \nforever for about 20,000 acre feet of water that they are entitled to \nunder the project. That is a lot for that part of New Mexico.\n  I do not want to sit by and watch those rights be subject to anyone \nother than the U.S. Congress' determination on how we ought to proceed \nin getting this project completed. I believe in due course we can \nsatisfy our obligations to the Utes and other water users because a lot \nof new ground has been turned; new agreements are being worked out \nbetween many water users in that four-corners region.\n  The opponents to the project have attended these meetings in the \nnegotiation process; I hope a number of you who are proposing this \namendment do not necessarily agree with all of those who oppose this \nproject. Some opponents find reason to oppose it once a month, maybe. \nMaybe in some cases they have found three or four reasons a month, and \nthey rest a while and then they found six or eight more reasons to \noppose this project in 6 months' time. There are those who will oppose \nany project, no matter how worthy.\n  In any event, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I understand the yeas and nays have been ordered on the motion to \ntable. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table the \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nenergy and water appropriations bill and specifically for funding for \nthe McCall, ID, wastewater treatment facility. I would like to thank \nSenator Domenici for including funding for this important project in \nthe bill and Senator Craig for his support and leadership on this issue \nin the committee.\n  Cascade Reservoir is a federally owned facility located downstream of \nthe city of McCall on the north fork of the Payette River, and is the \nsecond most used recreation site in the State of Idaho. The community \nis currently operating with a wastewater treatment plant that ranges \nfrom inadequate to dangerous. Water flowing into the Cascade Reservoir \nin Valley County, ID, has reached a dangerous level of phosphorus and \nalgae. This level is much higher than what is considered healthy for \nboth human recreation and sustaining wildlife. The plant must be \nupgraded, but the community needs Federal money to do it.\n  The most recent data indicates that high phosphorus contributions \nfrom the surrounding watershed have caused and will continue to cause \nsignificant deterioration of water quality in the reservoir. The \nsituation is so bad in Cascade Reservoir that at one point, in 1994, \nfish were dying at a rate that was too fast for fish and game \ninspectors to count. The fish died because of the high water \ntemperatures and low oxygen levels in the water caused by dramatic \nalgae growth. In 1993, a severe outbreak of toxic blue-green algae \ncaused the death of 23 cattle after they drank water from the \nreservoir. A public health advisory was issued advising the public to \navoid contact with the reservoir.\n  The city of McCall is using an innovative approach to solving the \ndual problem of poor wastewater management and lack of irrigation water \nin the area. Wastewater from the facility will be used to provide much \nneeded irrigation water to local farmers. The treated wastewater will \nprovide phosphorus and nitrogen which are ordinary elements of \nfertilizer. This will reduce the need for farms to use chemical \nfertilizers, while at the same time cleaning up the reservoir.\n  This program is a prime example of how different levels of government \ncan cooperate to benefit both the community and the environment. The \ncost of the project will be shared by the Idaho State Legislature, the \nIdaho Department of Environmental Quality, the city of McCall, and the \nlocal irrigation district.\n  Cascade Reservoir is a major recreation facility for the largest \npopulation base in the State of Idaho. Without this Federal assistance, \nquality of human life and survival of wildlife will be significantly \nimpacted. In short, the $2.5 million for the McCall Wastewater \nTreatment Facility is crucial to Idaho.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee \nrecognized the urgency of this project and included an appropriation \nthat will allow McCall to once again enjoy a clean and safe wastewater \nsystem.\n\n\n                   WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to note that the passage of the \nenergy\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nand water appropriations bill brings us one step closer to the \ncompletion of the West Valley demonstration project in western New \nYork. In 1982 we authorized the West Valley demonstration project, in \nwhich we would learn to take liquid nuclear waste and mix it with \nglass. The process is called vitrification, and yields ten foot high \nglass logs that can be stored safely. After 14 years of preparation, \nresearch, and testing, vitrification began last July. On May 28 the \n100th glass log was produced.\n  The success of the vitrification process developed at West Valley and \nat Savannah River in Georgia led the Department of Energy to select it \nas the preferred method of disposal for such wastes. This is an \naccomplishment that the many hundreds of people in western New York who \nworked on the project can be most proud of.\n  They have another 110 logs to go at West Valley, but the method \nworks. Through fiscal year 1997 we have spent $1.2 billion on the \nproject. The final amount in the bill for next year has not been \ndetermined, but it will it will bring the total over $1.3 billion. This \nhas been money well spent, and will continue to be. We have learned to \ndispose of one type of hazardous waste, and can dispose of others with \nthe vitrification process.\n\n\n                  Jeffords/Bryan Amendment to S. 1004\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by Senators Jeffords and Bryan to bring solar and \nrenewable energy funding levels closer to the administration request \nthan was provided in the Appropriations Committee's bill. And, to \nclarify the importance of continuing Department of Energy support for \nsolar thermal energy dish/engine systems.\n  The committee report proposes to disallow the continued deployment of \nadditional dish/engine systems. Such a prohibition would stifle some \nvery promising environmental technology and most probably break a cost-\nsharing agreement between the Department and Stirling Thermal Motors of \nAnn Arbor, MI. And, the language unfairly singles out solar dish/engine \nsystems for elimination, even though competing and funded technologies \nare more mature and nearer to commercialization.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment so that precommercial \nresearch and development can continue on important solar technologies, \nincluding solar thermal dish/engine systems. These systems, including \nthermal motors, have great potential for providing cleaner and more \nefficient electrical power for all sectors of the economy, potentially \nincluding transportation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Energy and Water Appropriations Act \nfor the current year imposed a 9-percent reduction of the Department of \nEnergy's Departmental Administration Account. That account funds the \noffice of the Secretary, Human Resources, and general counsel among \nother things.\n  However, in imposing that reduction, the Department did not impose \nany reductions in the Office of General Counsel. As a matter of fact, \nwhile other offices lost 40 or more people, the Office of General \nCounsel lost only 1 position.\n  In drafting its recommendation for departmental administration, the \ncommittee directed that the Office of General Counsel assume a \nreduction to bring its staffing levels back into balance with the rest \nof those in departmental administration.\n  The committee's recommendation did not take into consideration the \nfact that the Department has proposed to shift 19 lawyers, previously \nfunded out of the Interior appropriations bill, into the account funded \nby this bill.\n  I have committed to the Secretary of Energy that, in the statement of \nmanagers accompanying the conference report, I will work to include \nlanguage that clarifies our intent. I do believe that the Office of \nGeneral Counsel should not be insulated from the reductions Congress \nwisely imposed last year. However, it was not our intent to impose \noverly harsh reductions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the Subcommittee in \nthis regard. I will work with him and our House colleagues in \nconference to ensure that any reduction in the Office of General \nCounsel is fair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                            Renewable Energy\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I Mr. President, thank the chairman for his excellent \nwork on the fiscal year 1998 energy and water appropriations measure. \nSenator Domenici clearly understands the importance of renewable energy \nto the future of this Nation. I wish to commend him for his dedication \nto the development of solar, wind, biomass, and other technologies that \nare vital to our Nation's energy interests. I know many of my \ncolleagues join me in thanking him for his leadership in this area. I \nwould merely like to clarify a couple of the provisions regarding \nrenewable energy in the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wish to thank the Senator for his kind comments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The report language on wind energy research, \ndevelopment and deployment restricts support for small wind, when in \nfact the Department of Energy has several ongoing research activities \nin this area. Is it the intention of the Senate that these and other \ncost-shared programs currently conducted in collaboration with DOE, the \nnational laboratories, and U.S. industry should not be continued?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the answer is no. The energy and water \ndevelopment bill does not intend to impede research, development, and \ndemonstration activities for small wind programs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In addition, is it the Senator's understanding that the \nSolar Thermal Power Program would receive an additional $4.8 million \nfrom available funds? And if so, of this amount, $3.8 million will be \navailable for solar dish engine technologies and the remaining $1 \nmillion will go to the solar industrial programs. This would bring the \ntotal solar thermal account to $19.1 million.\n  Further, is it also the Senator's understanding that the solar \ninternational account will receive an additional $2 million, bringing \nthe total for this program to $4 million. Is it also the Senator's \nunderstanding that the program allocation will be used in support of \nthe Committee on Renewable Energy Commerce and Trade?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n              consortium for plant biotechnology research\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As a long-time supporter of domestically produced \nrenewable fuels, I am very interested in encouraging the Department of \nEnergy to do whatever it can to promote the development of new and more \nefficient processes for converting plant material into practical \ntransportation fuels. It is my understanding that DOE consistently \nfunds the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research--known as CPBR--\nalthough at levels below which it can use. The work of this consortium \nof university researchers has lead to significant progress in more \nefficiently utilizing plants and plant waste for the production of \nrenewable fuels and of bringing these research innovations to the \nmarket. It is my hope that DOE will be willing to fund CPBR at between \n$2 and $3 million in fiscal year 1998. Do you agree that DOE should \ngive special consideration to funding CPBR at that level?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I recognize how important the development of a strong \ndomestic renewable fuels industry is to the Senator. Moreover, I agree \nthat the work of CPBR has been very useful in developing new and more \nefficient ways to convert plant material to renewable fuels and commend \nDOE for its past support of CPBR. I would urge DOE, as part of its \nannual process to determine its priorities and funding awards, to \nseriously consider supporting CPBR at the levels you cite.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I also recognize the valuable research performed by the \nCPBR and urge DOE to give it every consideration as it makes its fiscal \nyear 1998 funding decisions.\n\n\n                     RENEWABLE ENERGY DEMONSTRATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to highlight \na provision in the energy and water appropriations bill which could \nbegin to address some of the energy generation problems facing very \nrural areas. The bill provides modest funding for the deployment of \nsolar, wind, fuel cell, and biomass technologies in remote areas of the \nUnited States.\n  Producing and distributing power in rural areas is a challenge in and \nof itself. Distribution lines are often more\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nexpensive and difficult to establish, and communities are often forced \nto rely on cheaper, but more polluting fuel sources. This demonstration \nwill provide the resources to look at the effectiveness of less \nnoxious, renewable energy technologies.\n  One application of this kind of demonstration which has come to my \nattention is a proposal in Vermont to replace polluting diesel engines \nwith modern fuel cell technology for snow production. One of the last \nplaces you might think of air quality problems is in the mountains of \nVermont. But in fact, four of the six largest sources of NOx \nemissions in the State are ski resorts which often use inefficient and \ndirty burning diesel engines to produce snow. Because of the remoteness \nof snow production facilities, other, cleaner commercial energy \nalternatives are not an option. This funding would allow States like \nVermont to experiment with energy production technologies that can work \nefficiently while greatly reducing NOx and particulate \nmatter emissions.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from New Mexico for funding this \nvaluable initiative and ask for his comments on this possible \napplication of fuel cell technology to the problem I have described in \nVermont.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and \nagree that this is exactly the kind of problem the subcommittee had in \nmind when proposing this demonstration. Remote areas of the United \nStates do face unique energy production and distribution problems as \nthe Senator from Vermont has aptly described. It is the committee's \nintention that the demonstration be directed to addressing these types \nof issues in rural areas.\n\n\n  Mecklenburg County Streambank stabilization and restoration project\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senator Domenici on \nan excellent bill. We all realize that he and his staff have been \noverwhelmed by requests for this bill, in particular by U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers project requests. I think I speak for all of us when I say \nthat he has done an excellent job balancing out the requests. No one \nreceived all he or she requested, but I believe we have all been \ntreated fairly.\n  In this vein, I want to comment on a very worthy project from \nCharlotte, NC, which was not able to be included in the bill, the \nMecklenburg County streambank stabilization and restoration project.\n  I am informed that the House has allotted $1 million for this very \nworthy project. When we go to conference, I look forward to working \nwith Senator Domenici to ensure that the House appropriation for this \nmatter remains in the final bill. The project is a good one, and seeks \ninnovative methods of addressing problems of degradation of streams, \npollution of surface waters, and flood protection. It also enjoys \nwidespread support in the Charlotte area.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I commend my colleague for bringing this worthy project \nto my attention, and also look forward to working with him on it during \nconference.\n\n\n                 PROVISION FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to address a provision of S. 1004, \nthe appropriations bill for energy and water development for fiscal \nyear 1998. I refer specifically to the President's request for a new \ninitiative within the Department of Energy, called nuclear energy \nsecurity. The bill before us contains no funding for this new \ninitiative. I wish to address my colleagues on the reasons for the \nsubcommittee's treatment of this initiative and the direction in which \nI believe the Department should focus its nuclear energy research and \ndevelopment program.\n  The committee report to accompany S. 1004 states that although the \ncommittee supports the use of nuclear energy to produce electricity, \nthe Department's proposed program to address technical issues will have \ninsufficient impact to justify the expense and therefore, no funding \nwas provided. I am concerned that the Department of Energy will take \nthe wrong message from this action.\n  It is my view, as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as a \nmember of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, that this \ncountry needs a viable nuclear energy program--both for our energy \nsecurity and for our national security. Recently, the President \ncommissioned his Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, \nEnergy Research and Development Panel to study and report back on \nwhether the United States should have a nuclear energy program and if \nso, what its goals should be both domestically and internationally. A \nlot of good work on this issue has been done, or is underway within the \nDepartment of Energy and the national laboratory complex. Specifically, \nSandia National Laboratories, in New Mexico has contributed \nsubstantially.\n  While I won't delineate the findings at length at this time, let me \njust indicate to my colleagues, that the greatest minds that we have \nnationally to weigh in on this question have done so, and they believe \nthat the failure to have a strong nuclear energy research and \ndevelopment program will diminish our national security, our economic \ncompetitiveness, and the public well-being. The bottom line is that as \nour primacy in nuclear R declines, we will lose our ability to \nparticipate on the world stage and to observe and understand the \ncivilian nuclear programs of emerging nations.\n  For these reasons, it is my hope that the Department will continue to \nconstruct, and will propose as appropriate, a nuclear energy program \nthat fulfills these goals.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the \nstatements made by my colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho. Through \nthe investments already made at its national laboratory sites, such as \nthe Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Argonne \nNational Laboratory, the Department of Energy has a research capability \nof both personnel and facilities, which can ensure that the nuclear \nenergy program of this country does not fall behind that of other \nnations. But we will only be assured of keeping a viable nuclear option \nin this country if DOE proposes and implements nuclear energy research \nprograms to safeguard our position as a nuclear leader worldwide.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to add another voice to \nthis discussion, and another point that has not yet been addressed. In \nMay of this year, I wrote a letter to Mr. Daniel Reifsnyder of the U.S. \nDepartment of State, transmitting my comments on the Draft Second U.S. \nClimate Action Report. In this letter, dated May 15, 1997, I reminded \nMr. Reifsnyder that nuclear energy is responsible for 89 percent of all \nthe carbon dioxide emissions avoided by U.S. electric utilities between \n1973 and 1995 and that over 1.9 billion metric tons of carbon emissions \nhave been avoided in the United States alone through the use of nuclear \nenergy. Nuclear energy has made and can continue to make tremendous \ncontributions in avoiding carbon emissions. Although the contributions \nof nuclear energy appear to have gotten little acknowledgment in the \nU.S. Climate Action Report, if we look at what is happening \ninternationally, we see that other countries have not failed to take \nnotice of the nuclear option. Specifically, France and Japan continue \ntheir reliance on nuclear energy for substantial percentages of their \nenergy needs, and China has ambitious plans for developing its civilian \nnuclear program. The failure of this country to take a long term view \nand invest in nuclear research and development has the potential to \ndamage not only our own civilian program, but our ability to observe \nand influence the programs of other nations.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the comments \nmade by my colleagues regarding our need for a strong nuclear energy \nprogram. I agree that nuclear energy research and development enhance \nboth our economic competitiveness on the civilian side and our national \nsecurity by allowing us to participate as a full partner in the uses of \nnuclear energy worldwide.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues in calling for both a strong nuclear energy program at the \nDepartment of Energy and in calling for national attention to the need \nfor nuclear energy to provide energy security to this Nation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me thank all of my colleagues who \nhave expressed their views on this important issue and let me add a \nfinal thought. As the Congress continues its consideration of de-\nregulation or restructuring\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\nof the electric power industry, and the legislation already introduced \nin both bodies on that subject, I ask my colleagues to consider the \ncontribution of nuclear energy, both as a safe and reliable source of \npower--part of our energy security--and its contribution in lowering \nemissions of greenhouse gases. If this country's nuclear plants are \nrendered uneconomic by the advent of competition in the electric \nindustry, as some claim, we need to ask ourselves what will replace \nthese plants. As cost estimates for decommissioning balloon out of \ncontrol, we should be asking what technology investments DOE could be \nmaking to bring these estimates back in line with reality. A strong \nnuclear energy program is part of the answer.\n\n\n                                 sefor\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the senior \nSenator from Arkansas in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would be pleased to join the subcommittee chairman in \na colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in last year's Energy and Water \nDevelopment Act, a provision was included that directed the Department \nof Energy to determine if it has any legal obligation regarding the \nSouthwest experimental fast oxide reactor [SEFOR] or any similar \nnuclear facilities that have been transferred from Federal to non-\nFederal ownership. The Department has completed a draft memorandum that \nindicates that the Department has no legal obligation regarding SEFOR.\n  However, the senior Senator from Arkansas' interest in SEFOR \ncontinues. Early today, an amendment to S. 1004 was accepted on behalf \nof the senior Senator from Arkansas that would provide for an \nassessment of the cost of decommissioning the Southwest experimental \nfast oxide reactor.\n  It is important to note that the acceptance of this amendment does \nnot indicate that the Senate disagrees with the initial findings of the \nDepartment of Energy that the Department has no legal obligations with \nregard to the SEFOR. The interest of the Senate is simply to understand \nwhat the decommissioning costs of a reactor such as the SEFOR might be.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague, the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. I don't think it \nwould be appropriate for the Senate to take a position on the issue of \nliability. That is for the courts to decide.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, we can announce that this was the last vote for today. We are \nworking on a unanimous-consent agreement that we think we will have no \nproblem having agreement to. Basically, we would have the vote on final \npassage of the energy and water appropriations bill tomorrow after the \nfirst vote on the foreign ops bill. We don't know an exact time, but we \npresume some time after 11 o'clock or early afternoon. We are trying to \naccommodate Senators' schedules.\n  Momentarily, we will ask for that unanimous consent. That is the gist \nof the request we will make.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I propound this unanimous-consent \nrequest, I want to confirm again that we have discussed this with the \nminority leadership. Mr. President, I want to commend the good work and \nleadership we have seen today again by the chairman of the energy and \nWater Subcommittee of Appropriations. Senator Domenici has done an \nexcellent job, with the able help of the Senator from Nevada. The fact \nthat they have gotten this bill basically ready for final passage and \nthat we will have the vote tomorrow morning is a real credit to the \ngood work they have done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on final passage of the Energy \nand water appropriations bill occur immediately following the first \nvote tomorrow on or in relation to the foreign operations \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, there will be no more votes this evening. It is \nmy understanding that the managers will be able to wrap up the Energy \nand water appropriations amendments this evening, and the Senate will \nbegin the foreign operations appropriations bill at 11 a.m. on \nWednesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I, too, want to commend the subcommittee \nchairman and ranking member of the subcommittee. I also want to call to \nthe attention of the Senate the fact that this hearkens me back to the \ndays when we had real bipartisan cooperation on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n\n  I want to thank all members of the committee for that cooperation, \nfor showing what can be done when we work together and try to resolve \nissues and accommodate the needs of the various Senators and our \nindividual States. These two Senators have done an excellent and \nadmirable job today on a very difficult bill. I am confident that we \nwill see that in final passage tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow, we will proceed to the foreign assistance bill. I hope we \nsee a similar approach on that bill so that we can go forward and have \nthe legislative bill before the Senate on Thursday.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman \nof the Energy and Water Subcommittee for his work in bringing this bill \nto the Senate.\n  While I commend the chairman for his efforts, I have concerns about \nthe trends in the funding levels that are being proposed for the \nMississippi River and tributaries projects, particularly those in the \nYazoo Basin of Mississippi.\n  The President's budget proposed a 20-percent reduction from last \nyear's level for Mississippi River and tributaries construction \nprojects. The budget also proposed cutting projects in the Yazoo Basin \nby over 50 percent. As the committee has indicated in its report that \naccompanies this bill, this reduction, along with others in operations \nand maintenance and investigations, is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, Congress addresses flooding and other natural \ndisasters as they occur around the country. The victims who have \nsuffered damages derive benefits from supplemental disaster assistance \nlegislation, as we saw just recently. This year, it was the Dakotas and \nother States. A few years ago, it was in the Midwest when the Missouri \nRiver flooded, and nearly every year, there is some degree of flooding \nin the Yazoo Basin in the State of Mississippi. The lower funding \nlevels that are being proposed for projects to control flooding in the \nYazoo Basin result in more delays, higher construction costs, and more \ndamages occur year in and year out from floods in this region of the \ncountry. It will also result in increased spending on disaster \nassistance instead of funding long-term solutions to the flooding that \noccurs in this area. These delays will only increase the likelihood and \nthe severity of flooding in the future and damages that result from \nthose floods.\n  Incremental funding for these and many other Federal construction \nprojects is a reality of the current budget environment. But \nincremental funding results in cost increases over the life of a \nproject that has been authorized and that has been partially funded in \nthe past. It will cost $54 million as a result of even a ten-year \nfunding cycle on the three main projects just in the Yazoo Basin \nalone--the Upper Yazoo project, the Upper Steele Bayou project, and the \nBig Sunflower River Maintenance project. That amounts to a 20 percent \ncost increase.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to work with the committee and the \nsubcommittee to identify the levels of funding necessary to maintain \nproject\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\nschedules that are more realistic and more cost-effective in the \nfuture. I hope that we can reach agreement and convince the \nadministration that it needs to recognize the inevitable consequences \nof these budget cuts that are, year-in and year-out, submitted to the \nCongress on these projects.\n  My friend from New Mexico has done an excellent job, a masterful job \nin dealing with all of these pressures and cross-currents of interests \nthat flow to this committee and are involved in the development of this \nlegislation. And so I am proud of the work product that he has \nproduced, and we support it. I am voting for it. We hope that by \nworking together we can continue to identify ways to assure adequate \nfunding levels for these projects that have been authorized for a long, \nlong time.\n  Read the book ``Rising Tide,'' which talks about the beginning of the \neffort to get the Federal Government's resources involved in the \nMississippi River and tributaries project. It is on the best-seller \nlist now and I invite everyone to read that book. There are projects \nwhich I have identified in this project definition that are still not \ncompleted, and that flood was in 1927. We continue to, incrementally, \npiecemeal, see these projects increasing in real costs because of the \nfailure to address them in a more aggressive way.\n  That is the point of my statement. People are beginning to wonder--\nare these projects ever going to be finished? They have a right to \nraise the question. If they are not finished, the flooding that occurs \nevery year is going to continue to be an annual disaster for the folks \nin this region.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Mississippi, during the day, in your absence when you were \nbusy attending that very difficult hearing that you are part of, I \ncommented on the fact that one of the growing difficulties in this bill \nis the water project section, because every year more projects that are \ngood and that are necessary--and many that we haven't completed--are \nshowing up and we are not getting an allocation of resources sufficient \nto do them. What we have been doing is putting little pieces of money \nin. That is what you just called--that means, for instance, this year \nthere are two major flood projects that we cannot start, that have been \nyears in the design, that are ready to go. We just don't have the money \nto do it.\n\n  I was predicting today that in 3 or 4 years, if we don't find more \nresources for the water projects--because many people don't think they \nare very important, and we don't get much support from the White House \non them, frankly. They are trying to change the formula right in the \nmiddle of the stream on who pays for what. If we don't get more \nresources, the situation you predict will become reality. I am going to \ndo my best, but there isn't enough money to complete the projects we \nhave been committed to with the kind of allocation we get. I thank the \nSenator for his kind comments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the chairman will yield. In response to \nthe Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from New Mexico, these \nwater projects are important because they save lives. Some of them are \nimportant--we tend to think that when they are written in the \nnewspaper, they are projects that just look good at home and these are \nthings people talk about as being pork. The fact of the matter is that \nwe have projects in Nevada that have saved people's lives as a result \nof having them in the project. They have saved immense dollars in \nproperty that would have washed away. Even in an arid State like Nevada \nwe have floods. They are not sustained floods like you have in other \nparts of the country, they are flash floods; but they can be very \ndamaging to property and to people.\n  So I commend the Senator from Mississippi in focusing attention on \nthese very important projects. The Senator from New Mexico and I have \nhad to deal with these for the last 7 or 8 months. It is very difficult \nto decide which ones should get money and how much they should get. \nEvery one of them--I should not say every one--the vast majority of \nthem are extremely important, and it is too bad we can't fund them all \nbecause it would be good for the country.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Scott \nBurnison, a detailee in my office and in the Budget Committee, be \ngranted floor privileges during the remainder of this bill and for the \nconference report on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is the third time in 2 days that I have \ncome to the floor of the Senate to address the flawed practice of \nearmarking funding for local projects in appropriations bills.\n  I recognize the hard work that the managers of the bill have put into \nexpeditiously moving this measure through the Senate. I thank them for \ntheir tireless efforts and appreciate that their jobs have not been \neasy.\n  But I must repeat a criticism I have made many times during \nconsideration of appropriations bills and will continue to make as long \nas the practice of earmarking continues: This bill inappropriately and \ninequitably singles out projects for funding based on criteria other \nthan national priority and necessity.\n  I recognize that the custom has long been to earmark all of the Army \nCorps of Engineers projects in the energy and water appropriations \nbills. I continue to find this practice, frankly, unnecessary if the \nprojects are truly worthy of support and are of sufficient priority on \na nationwide comparison. I hope we can work together to find a better \nsystem of ensuring full and fair consideration of all proposed \nprojects.\n  I believe that the States and the Army Corps of Engineers should \ndevelop a priority list based on national need. The projects on the \npriority list would then be funded in a lump sum appropriation. By \nemploying such a priority list, we could end the practice of earmarking \nprojects for funding based on political clout and focus our limited \nresources, instead, on those areas with the greatest need nationwide.\n  It is clear, however, that for many projects, earmarking is the only \nway to ensure the money is spent. Earmarking is particularly useful in \nensuring that funds are spent for lower priority, unrequested projects \nfor which Members of this body have sought appropriations.\n  This year, the energy and water appropriations bills and report \ncontain more than $300 million in earmarks for projects not included in \nthe budget request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these unrequested earmarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Unrequested Earmarks Contained in the 1998 Energy and Water \n                Appropriations Bill and Committee Report\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Earmark                        Bill or Report Cite     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNorco Bluffs, California--$200,000.......

Mr. President, we have no way of knowing whether all or \npart of this $300 million should have been spent on different projects \nwith greater national need and higher national priority. Earmarking \nfunds for special interest projects is the most obvious form of pork \nbarrel spending, and it is a waste of taxpayer dollars at a time when \nour national debt exceeds $5.3 trillion. I believe that we should stop \nearmarking projects just because they serve the interests of Members of \nCongress.\n  I am also concerned that certain projects in the bill are funded ``at \nfull Federal expense,'' while others are not.\n  No explanation is given. So I can only be left to wonder why.\n  For example, at page 6 of the bill, the Secretary of the Army is \ndirected to ``design and implement at full Federal expense'' a project \nfor the Tug Fork and Levisa basins in West Virginia and Kentucky. I \nmight add that this funding ``at full Federal expense'' is for a \nproject that receives a total of $55.7 million in earmarked \nappropriations, which is $47.7 million over the budget request.\n  What makes this project worthy of such a large add-on of $47.7 \nmillion? Why should this project be funded solely by the Federal \nGovernment, or rather all the Federal taxpayers, while other projects \nrequire cost-sharing by the States and local governments and \ncommunities that stand to benefit from their construction? None of \nthese answers are apparent to this Senator.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am again, as I am on an annual basis, very \ndisappointed to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission will be \nfunded again this year. This commission was established as a temporary \ncommission in 1965--1965, 32 years ago. This program singles out one \nregion for special economic development grants when the rest of the \nNation has to rely on their share of community development block grants \nand loans.\n  Certainly the Appalachian Regional has no monopoly on poor, depressed \ncommunities in need of assistance. I know that in my own State, despite \nthe high standard of living enjoyed in many areas, some communities are \nextremely poor and have long been without running water or sanitation. \nWe need to reconsider the utility of the Appalachian Regional \nCommission in light of pressing needs in other areas of the country.\n  Mr. President, our current system of earmarking to fund unrequested, \nlower priority, and unnecessary projects is fundamentally flawed. I \nhope that someday we will develop a better system, one which allows the \nprojects with the greatest national need to be funded first.\n  Mr. President, I noted recently a poll, as I have seen many of them, \non the approval rate of Congress, which is about 40 percent. That is \none of the highest numbers that I have seen recently.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of reasons the Congress of the United \nStates is held in low esteem, and it would take a long time to go \nthrough them. I did notice in that same poll that the approval rating \nof the President of the United States is 64 percent. I would argue, Mr. \nPresident, that one of the reasons we are held in low esteem by the \nAmerican people--because they believe that we do not wisely and \nefficiently and on a basis of need and priority spend their tax \ndollars. And every time we pass an appropriations bill that has this \nkind of unnecessary and wasteful spending in it, which is no one's \npriority that I know of, nor go through any scrutiny or any process \nthat would give them that priority, the esteem with which the American \npeople hold us continues to be less. And I know that this practice has \nbeen going on for many years, and unfortunately and tragically paying \non for many years in the future.\n  But I will continue to come to the floor, and where it is the most \noutrageous and egregious I will propose amendments to strike. \nOtherwise, I will point out those areas where I think that the spending \npractices of the appropriations process is not in the best interests of \nthe entire Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say with the greatest respect to my \nfriend, who I consider one of the fine Members of this body, that we \nhave worked very hard to make sure that there aren't some nameless, \nfaceless bureaucrats making all of the decisions for this $21 billion \nof discretionary spending in this bill. The separation of powers gives \nus\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\nnot only that right but that obligation. We have an obligation to \nmaintain the power of the purse strings. That is what the legislative \nbranch of Government was devised to do when the Framers of this \nConstitution established the Constitution.\n  Projects that are in this bill serve people, communities, and States. \nI say that I think it is really unfair to this body, to the taxpayers \nof this country, and to the people of the State of Arizona to say that \nthose things that we have earmarked here are wasteful, pork-barrel \nprojects.\n  For example, we have investigations going on with the Corps of \nEngineers in the State of Arizona that deal with significant projects. \nWe have colonias along the United States-Mexican border, Arizona, and \nTexas. There we are spending $100,000. Corps of Engineers: Gila River, \nNorth Scottsdale, AZ, $400,000; Gila River, Santa Cruz River Basin, AZ, \n$400,000; Rio De Flag, Flagstaff, AZ, $325,000; Rio Salado Watershed \nEcosystem, AZ, $550,000; Tres Rios, AZ, $400,000; Tucson Drainage Area, \nAZ, $825,000.\n  We have for operations and maintenance, Corps of Engineers: Alamo \nLake, AZ, $1.55 million for inspection of completed works, Arizona, \n$107,000; Painted Rock Dam, AZ, $2.293 million; scheduling reservoir \noperations, Arizona, $22,000; Whitlow Ranch Dam, AZ, $199,000.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that we made those decisions \nrather than some bureaucrat who the people of Arizona will never see, \nwho would remain in an office back here someplace in Washington next to \nsome computer rather than a human being. We made that decision along \nwith many hundreds of thousands of hours of work by our staff.\n  I will not go into a lot more detail other than to say that \nappropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation is done very similarly. We \nhave made decisions in this bill that were important to the people of \nthe State of Arizona.\n  Yuma Area project is provided $1.67 million in this bill; West Salt \nRiver Valley, water management study, $475,000; Verde River Basin \nmanagement study, Bureau of Reclamation, $475,000.\n  I could go on for several more minutes reading off the things that \nthis committee did in relation to the State of Arizona which were \nimportant decisions that we made. I think it is important that we make \nthem. Again, I repeat, better that we make these decisions than some \nnameless, faceless bureaucrat who wouldn't even know where the State of \nArizona is. The States of New Mexico and Nevada border on the State of \nArizona. We feel an obligation to distribute this money in a way that \nwe feel is fair.\n  So I have great respect for my friend from the State of Arizona, but \non this issue I think he is wrong.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't seek to engage in argument with \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona. But I will say for the Record \nthat I don't believe this bill and what is in it in any way contributes \nto what the people's image of Congress is. I think it is a very good \nbill. I think there is less earmarking than usual. And in fact most of \nit, if you look at it carefully, is probably something this body would \napprove of overwhelmingly.\n\n  Having said that, I compliment the Senator on his diligence, Senator \nMcCain, and for his continued hard work in this area. All of us are \nlearning and being pushed by him to do a better job each time we \nappropriate the money that the taxpayers send up here for us to use.\n  Mr. President, we very soon will have a tender of seven amendments en \nbloc. That will wind up the amendments for this bill, and the only \nthing remaining then will be the final vote tomorrow as per the \nunanimous consent request which will follow after the first vote that \noccurs on the foreign operations bill. We will have a couple of minutes \nthen, Senator Reid and I, to make a few comments about those who have \nhelped us and worked hardest with reference to this bill. Rather than \nto do that tonight, we will do that for a few minutes each tomorrow \njust prior to the vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          external regulation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from New Mexico regarding a section of the report \naccompanying the energy and water appropriations bill entitled \n``External Regulation.'' This section addresses DOE's ongoing \nevaluation of the question of whether DOE's nuclear facilities should \nbe subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I would \nlike to clarify that this section of the report is intended to allow \nDOE to gather quantitative and qualitative information on external \nregulation to serve as guidance to the authorizing committees as they \naddress this issue in the future.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from Alaska's reading of the \nlanguage.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to further clarify that this language is \nnot intended to endorse or accelerate the pace of external regulation, \nwhich should be the subject of hearings and legislative action on the \npart of the authorizing committees, and that the Senator will work with \nme to ensure that the statement of managers reflects this \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator and agree to work with him on \nthis as we move forward.\n\n\n                        budget impact of s. 1004\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 1004, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act, 1998, is within its allocation of \nbudget authority and outlays.\n  The reported bill provides $20.8 billion in budget authority and \n$13.5 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent \nagencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When \noutlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken \ninto account, this bill provides a total of $20.9 billion in outlays.\n  For defense discretionary programs, the Senate-reported bill meets \nits allocation in budget authority and is $2 million below in outlays. \nThe bill also is below its nondefense discretionary allocation by $46 \nmillion in budget authority and $1 million in outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           S. 1004, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL           \n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]                                   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime  Mandatory    Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n  Budget authority...........................................   11,803      8,993    ......  .........   20,796 \n  Outlays....................................................   11,995      8,885    ......  .........   20,880 \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority...........................................   11,803      9,039    ......  .........   20,842 \n  Outlays....................................................   11,997      8,886    ......  .........   20,883 \nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority...........................................   13,615      9,018    ......  .........   22,633 \n  Outlays....................................................   11,813      8,856    ......  .........   20,669 \nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority...........................................  ........  ..........  ......  .........  ........\n  Outlays....................................................  ........  ..........  ......  .........  ........\n================================================================================================================\n              Senate-Reported Bill Compared to--                                                                \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority...........................................  ........

The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 869 through 875) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendments en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come back to the floor because, although \nI left the floor, I made the mistake of doing so.\n  The Senator from Nevada read a list of projects for which money is \nbeing appropriated for the State of Arizona. What the Senator from \nNevada failed to note was that funding is exactly--and I look at it on \npage 11 of the bill--exactly that requested by the administration \nhaving gone through a merit-based system which then had the \nadministration request funding on projects that had already been \nauthorized.\n  That is a far different--a far, far different procedure, Mr. \nPresident, than that of the long list of earmarks that I submitted for \nthe Record which have nothing to do with anything except or--let me put \nit this way in the most charitable fashion, Mr. President--that has no \nmethodology nor any merit-based system that I know of that will call \nfor the funding of these projects.\n  I also point out just for the Record that Arizona, with the agreement \nof the rest of the delegation, gave up $4 million that the \nadministration was going to spend on the Central Arizona project, gave \nup an additional $4 million. So perhaps the Senator from Nevada did not \nunderstand what my point is. My point is that we certainly fund \nprojects that are requested, that make a case for them, for which there \nis a merit-based system--not by computers but by judging them with \nother projects. I do not think the Senator from Nevada understood my \npoint. I have no complaint about projects which the administration \nrequests and they are funded. My complaint is about earmarking for \nprojects including the Appalachian Regional Commission and other \nprojects which I submitted a list of. They are two different things.\n  If the Senator from Nevada would agree that we will go through the \nsame system that we went through in order to arrive at the funding for \nthose projects he pointed out, there would be no Member as happy as \nthis one--none in this body.\n  So I hope the Senator from Nevada would commit to the same process we\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nwent through that achieved that funding for these projects he read off \nfor the State of Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry the Senator from Arizona had to come back. \nCertainly as indicated on the Record, I only had positive things to say \nabout the Senator from Arizona.\n  I do say--and he and I have a disagreement on how bills like this \nshould come to be--I believe that we as a legislative branch of \nGovernment have an obligation to make independent decisions separate \nand apart from the administration. I do not feel I have any obligation \nto follow what the bureaucrats say we should appropriate.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I came to the Congress together. I have \nthe greatest admiration for him, not only for what he has done in his \nprofessional life as a Member of Congress but, of course, what he did \nbefore he came here.\n  So it has nothing to do with how I feel about the Senator from \nArizona. It has to do with the basic difference in what I feel is an \nobligation a Member of Congress has. It is a legitimate difference. It \nhas nothing to do on a personal basis, and I will continue to work as \nhard as I can with the Senator on campaign finance reform and also to \nfund projects for the State of Arizona as a member of this \nsubcommittee, as long as I am ranking member, in a fair and impartial \nway, getting direction from the bureaucrats but not following \nnecessarily what they have to say.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say I appreciate the words of the Senator from \nNebraska--Nevada. I appreciate any from Nebraska, too. But I appreciate \nthe words of the Senator from Nevada. He and I have been friends now \nsince 1982 when we came to the House together. We have worked together \non a variety of issues, including native American and many others. Our \ndifference, as he states, is a philosophical one. I don't believe there \nis an orderly process that judges these projects on merit, and that is \njust a difference that we have had for many, many years.\n  I admire his adherence to what he believes is best not only for \nNevada but for the country. I respect that, and I know that my words in \ncriticism of this procedure have nothing to do with the enormous \nrespect and affection that I have for him and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7459-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman and my good friend, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Reid for giving me this opportunity to \naddress what I consider to be the acts of a courageous individual and \nthe fact that the House today acted in a bipartisan manner, unanimously \npassing S. 768, a bill to give to Christopher Meili the opportunity to \nlive in this country, and to say once again that America understands \nthe courage exhibited by Christopher Meili in his extraordinary action \nin reporting and making public the destruction of documents in \nSwitzerland at great peril to himself and to his family. He was \nostracized for this act. He was threatened with death. His family, his \ntwo children, can no longer live in their own country. Once again, \nAmerica has opened its heart and its doors.\n  The House, in an extraordinary act, has given him the opportunity to \nlive here, to work here, to raise his family. Christopher Meili is a \nnoble man whose actions ennobled all of us, and he has suffered greatly \nfor his courage in exposing the truth. Now he simply desires to live in \nfreedom here in America with his family, and now he can.\n  I spoke to Christopher earlier today and told him that the House of \nRepresentatives had completed action and that it had passed the \nlegislation, and now it awaits the President's signature. I am certain \nthat the President will continue the process of making possible \nChristopher's staying here in this country and giving to him the \nfreedom that he yearns for himself and his family.\n  Mr. President, I commend those of my colleagues who, by way of their \naction in passing this legislation, have given Christopher an \nopportunity to live here in this country, and we once again demonstrate \nthat we understand the extraordinary sacrifices that this young man \nmade in the cause of freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7485-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATION BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during the debate on S. 1005, the defense \nappropriations bill this morning, I expressed several concerns about \nsection 8097 of that bill. While I appreciate Senator Inouye amending \nsection 8097 to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the construction \nof the new cruise ships that would result from this pilot project. I \nstill have serious concerns about the provision that would grant a 25-\nyear monopoly in the Hawaii cruise ship market for the only cruise ship \noperator in Hawaii.\n  This legislative restriction on commerce is unprecedented and must \nnot be granted. The existing U.S.-flag cruise ship operator in Hawaii \nis already protected from foreign competition by U.S. coastwise trade \nlaws. That company has operated without statutory protection from \ndomestic competition for more than a decade. There is no compelling \nreason to provide such protection now. I'm sure that many businesses \nwould like to reduce their cost of capital to replace their \ninfrastructure by convincing their lenders that their company is \nprotected from any competition in its market. However, the Congress has \nnot provided such protection in the past and we should not do so now.\n  I would also note that the provision provides a special waiver to the \ncoastwise trade laws, which is somewhat extraordinary and should be \nexamined for its fairness and appropriateness. While I am not a member \nof the Appropriations Committee I intend to vigorously pursue the \nmodification of section 8097 to eliminate this egregious provision \nduring the conference on S. 1005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7485-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7485-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on July 15, 1997, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has passed the following bill, without \namendment:\n\n       S. 768.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, S. 1017, a proposed bill to establish a presumption \nof total disability for certain individuals for purposes of nonservice-\nconnected disability pension. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nsubmitted this legislation to the President of the Senate by letter \ndated June 16, 1997.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter which \naccompanied it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       That that portion of subsection (a) of section 1502 of \n     title 38, United States Code, preceding paragraph (1) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) For purposes of this chapter, a person shall be \n     considered to be permanently and totally disabled if such \n     person is 65 years of age or older and is a patient in a \n     nursing home or, regardless of age, is unemployable as a \n     result of a disability reasonably certain to continue \n     throughout the life of the disabled person, or is suffering \n     from--''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                        Washington, June 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Transmitted herewith is a draft bill to \n     amend section 1502(a) of title 38, United States Code, to \n     establish a presumption of total disability for certain \n     individuals for purposes of the nonservice-connected \n     disability pension program. I request that this draft bill be \n     referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       The draft bill would amend section 1502(a) of title 38, \n     United States Code, to establish a presumption of total \n     disability in the case of a person who is age 65 or older and \n     who is a patient in a nursing home, for purposes of \n     establishing basic eligibility under the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs' (VA) nonservice-connected disability \n     pension program.\n       For many years, former section 502(a) (redesignated as \n     section 1502(a)) of title 38, United States Code, provided \n     that a person was presumed to be permanently and totally \n     disabled at age 65 for the purpose of establishing basic \n     pension eligibility. However, in 1990 Congress amended this \n     provision via the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 \n     (Pub. L. No. 101-508, Sec. 8002) to eliminate the presumption \n     of total disability at age 65 for claims filed after October \n     31, 1990. Consequently, it is now necessary that a rating \n     decision be rendered on the issue of permanent and total \n     disability before pension can be paid to any person, \n     regardless of age or circumstances.\n       Under current law, an incongruous situation arises in the \n     case of a pension claimant who is a patient in a nursing \n     home. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(b), such a person would \n     be considered to be in need of regular aid and attendance (a \n     level of disability which assumes the existence of permanent \n     and total disability) and, therefore, entitled to pension at \n     a higher rate. Nonetheless, the person could not establish \n     eligibility for any pension until a determination is made \n     through a rating activity that the person is permanently and \n     totally disabled. Consequently, under current law, if an 85-\n     year old veteran in a nursing home were to file an \n     original pension claim, it would still be necessary to \n     prepare a rating decision on the issue of permanent and \n     total disability to establish the veterans' basic pension \n     eligibility under section 1502(a), although the veteran \n     would, once determined to be eligible, be considered under \n     section 1502(b) to be eligible for a higher payment of \n     pension based on the need for regular aid and attendance.\n       Enactment of the proposed amendment to section 1502(a) \n     would be advantageous to VA and to claimants for pension and \n     other benefits administered by VA. Processing times for \n     original and reopened pension claims would be reduced because \n     development of medical evidence of a nursing home patient's \n     level of disability would no longer be necessary. This \n     improvement in efficiency would have a salutary effect on the \n     processing of other types of claims because rating \n     specialists and development personnel would have more time to \n     devote to other activities, including adjudication of \n     service-connected disability compensation claims.\n       The proposed amendment would not threaten the integrity of \n     the pension program. An individual age 65 years or older who \n     is a patient in a nursing home would almost certainly qualify \n     as being permanently and totally disabled under 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1502(a) as it is currently worded. The likelihood that \n     such an individual would eventually leave the nursing home is \n     slim. However, procedures are already in place for \n     reevaluating aid and attendance entitlement when a notice of \n     discharge from a nursing home is received in the case of a \n     veteran whose aid and attendance benefit is based on nursing-\n     home-patient status. These procedures will be adapted to \n     require a rating decision upon a person's discharge from a \n     nursing home if the basic eligibility determination was \n     premised on the person's status as a patient in a nursing \n     home.\n       Enactment of this proposal would merely speed the \n     processing of claims of persons who would otherwise qualify \n     for pension.\n       This draft bill would affect direct spending; therefore, it \n     is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management \n     and Budget (OMB) estimates that the pay-as-you-go effect of \n     this proposal is zero.\n       OMB advises that there is no objection from the standpoint \n     of the Administration's program to the submission of this \n     proposal to Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 1018. A bill to amend provisions of law governing benefits for \ncertain children of Vietnam veterans who are born with spina bifida, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                         Veterans' Legislation\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am pleased to transmit the enclosed \n     draft bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ``amend \n     provisions of law governing benefits for certain children of \n     Vietnam veterans who are born with spina bifida, and for \n     other purposes.'' I request that this draft bill be referred \n     to the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n       Section 2 of the draft bill would amend new section 1801 of \n     title 38, United States Code (as added by section 421(b)(1) \n     of Pub. L. No. 104-204, effective October 1, 1997). Section \n     1801 sets forth definitions of certain terms for purposes of \n     new chapter 18 of that title, which authorizes benefits for \n     children of Vietnam veterans who are born with spina bifida. \n     The definitions of ``child'' and ``Vietnam veteran'' would be \n     amended by section 2 of the draft bill.\n       Pursuant to section 1801(1) as added by Pub. L. No. 104-\n     204, the term ``child'' is defined for purposes of new \n     chapter 18 to mean ``a natural child of the Vietnam veteran . \n     . . who was conceived after the date on which the veteran \n     first entered the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam \n     era.'' (Emphasis added.) At the time of enactment of that \n     statute, the term ``Vietnam era'' was defined in 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 101(29) as the period beginning August 5, 1964, and \n     ending on May 7, 1975. Subsequently, however, section 505(a) \n     of Pub. L. No. 104-275 (effective January 1, 1997) amended \n     the definition of that term to mean either the period \n     beginning on February 28, 1961, and ending on May 7, 1975, in \n     the case of a veteran who served in the Republic of Vietnam \n     during that period, or the period beginning on August 5, \n     1964, and ending on May 7, 1975, in all other cases. In \n     addition, section 505(b) ob Pub. L. No. 104-275 amended 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1116(a) by striking out references to the \n     ``Vietnam era'' and substituting references to ``the period \n     beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975,'' \n     for the purposes of a statutory presumption of service \n     connection for certain disabilities based on exposure to \n     herbicide agents in the case of a veteran who served in the \n     Republic of Vietnam during that period. January 9, 1962, is \n     the earliest date herbicide agents were known to have been \n     used in the Republic of Vietnam in connection with the \n     armed conflict.\n       Since the purpose of new chapter 18 is to address \n     disabilities resulting from the birth defect spina bifida \n     which may be associated with a parent's exposure to herbicide \n     agents while serving in the Republic of Vietnam, we believe \n     it would be appropriate for references to the applicable time \n     period in section 1801 to be consistent with the time period \n     now set forth in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1116(a). Accordingly, the \n     term ``child'' with respect to a Vietnam veteran would be \n     defined to mean a natural child of a Vietnam veteran, \n     regardless of age or marital status, who was conceived after \n     the date on which the Vietnam veteran first entered the \n     Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, \n     1962, and ending on May 7, 1975. A similar conforming change \n     would be made to the definition of ``Vietnam veteran'' in \n     section 1801(2), which currently uses the term ``Vietnam \n     era''.\n       Section 1801(2) of title 38, United States Code, as added \n     by Pub. L. No. 104-204, defines the term ``Vietnam veteran'' \n     as a ``veteran'' who performed active service in the Republic \n     of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. We believe use of the term \n     ``veteran'' in the definition of the term ``Vietnam veteran'' \n     may precipitate, in a small number of cases, an unnecessary \n     eligibility determination, relating not to the child, but to \n     the parent, in that 38 U.S.C. Sec. 101(2) defines the term \n     ``veteran,'' mean ``a person who served in the active \n     military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or \n     released therefrom under conditions other than \n     dishonorable.'' (Emphasis added.) As a result of the \n     character-of-discharge component in the definition of \n     ``veteran,'' there may be some instances in which a parent \n     may fail to attain veteran status based on character of \n     discharge, thus precluding his or her child's eligibility for \n     benefits under chapter 18. Authorization of benefits and \n     services for children of Vietnam veterans who suffer from \n     spina bifida, pursuant to Pub. L. No. 104-204, represents the \n     first instance in which the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) will be authorized to provide benefits to a child of a \n     veteran based on a direct injury to the child rather than the \n     parent. We do not believe that a child's eligibility for \n     benefits and services under chapter 18 for a physical injury \n     suffered by the child should be premised on a parent's \n     eligibility for veteran's benefits. Therefore, we propose to \n     clarify the definition of the term ``Vietnam veteran'' to \n     indicate that the relevant factor for consideration is the \n     physical presence of the child's parent in the Republic of \n     Vietnam on military service during a period of time when use \n     of herbicide agents was documented, not the character of that \n     parent's military service. Accordingly, the term ``Vietnam \n     veteran'' would be defined to mean an individual who \n     performed active military, naval, or air service in the \n     Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January \n     9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to the \n     character of such individual's service.\n       Section 3 of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1806 \n     to provide for the applicability to the provision of benefits \n     under chapter 18 of certain existing administrative \n     provisions which are applicable to the service-connected \n     disability compensation program. Section 1806, as amended by \n     this section, would make applicable, for purposes of the \n     administration of benefits under chapter 18, references to \n     the following sections of title 38, United States Code: \n     5101(c) (regarding the furnishing of Social Security \n     numbers); 5110(a) (regarding the general effective-date rule \n     for an original benefit award); 5510(b)(2) (regarding the \n     effective date of an award of increased benefits); 5110(g) \n     regarding effective dates of awards based on Acts or \n     administrative issues); 5110(i) (regarding allowance of a \n     reopened claim based on the correction of military records); \n     5111 (regarding the commencement of the period of payment of \n     benefits); and 5112(a), 5112(b)(1), 5112(b)(6), 5112(b)(9), \n     and 5112(b)(10) (regarding the effective date of a reduction \n     or discontinuance of benefits on certain bases). We believe \n     the applicability of these sections to new chapter 18 is \n     necessary to assure equitable and consistent administration \n     of benefits under that chapter in a manner similar to the \n     administration of the compensation program.\n       Section 4 of the draft bill would make no changes \n     concerning vocational training and rehabilitation benefits \n     for children of Vietnam veterans who are born with spina \n     bifida. First, subsection (a) of this section would amend 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1804(c)(1)(B) by replacing the term ``institution \n     of higher education'' with the term ``institution of higher \n     learning''. The latter is a term of art defined in 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3452(f), as meaning, generally, a college, university, \n     or similar institution, including a technical or business \n     school, offering postsecondary level academic instruction \n     that leads to an associate or higher degree if the school is \n     empowered by state law to grant an associate or higher degree \n     or otherwise is accredited for degree programs by a \n     recognized accrediting agency. The term,\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\n     which also includes a hospital offering educational programs \n     at the postsecondary level, has a long history of usage by VA \n     in its administration of the various GI Bill and other \n     educational assistance programs for eligible veterans and \n     dependents, as well as the chapter 31 vocational \n     rehabilitation program for certain service disabled veterans \n     with employment handicaps. By contract, the term \n     ``institution of higher education'' is not found in title 38 \n     and has no accepted meaning with regard to administration of \n     veterans' benefits under that title. In view of this, and \n     since we know of no substantive basis for use of different \n     terminology for purposes of section 1804, we believe this \n     proposed change will promote ease of understanding and \n     administration of section 1804.\n       Subsection (b) of section 4 would amend section 1804(d) to \n     add a new provision to specify that an eligible child may \n     enter a vocational training program under that section as of \n     the child's eighteenth birthday or on completion of secondary \n     schooling, whichever first occurs. The Secretary could grant \n     an exception that would permit entry into the program before \n     age 18 when in the best interest of a child above the age of \n     compulsory school attendance. This change addresses an \n     omission in the statute by putting a reasonable floor on the \n     age when a child can be evaluated for the feasibility of \n     achieving a vocational goal and can commence training toward \n     that objective. Vocational training normally is initiated \n     upon completion of secondary or high school education, and \n     this change recognizes that fact. It also would encourage a \n     child's completion of secondary education where feasible, \n     while allowing for exceptions where completion is not \n     feasible. In this regard, it may be noted that this proposal \n     is patterned after a provision applicable to commencement of \n     educational assistance for an eligible child under chapter 35 \n     of title 38, the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational \n     Assistance program. Fixing the beginning of eligibility for \n     commencement of a program in this manner is similarly \n     appropriate for children afforded assistance under section \n     1804.\n       Section 5 is intended to eliminate apparent inconsistencies \n     between the respective January 1, 1997, and October 1, 1996, \n     effective dates set forth in sections 421(d) and 422(b)(1) of \n     Pub. L. No. 104-204 and an overriding October 1, 1997, \n     effective date provision in section 422(c) of that law. \n     Enactment of this section would not result in a substantive \n     change in the operative October 1, 1997, effective date, but \n     will eliminate the potential for confusion regarding the \n     various effective dates and insure that each of the subject \n     amendments will become effective simultaneously.\n       Pursuant to section 422(c) of Pub. L. No. 104-204, \n     notwithstanding sections 421(d) or 422(b)(1) of that law, the \n     effective date for the amendments made by section 421(b) \n     (which adds new chapter 18) and section 422(a) (which amends \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 1151), is October 1, 1997. Section 421(d) \n     otherwise would have established a January 1, 1997, effective \n     date for new chapter 18, and section 422(b)(1) would have \n     established October 1, 1996, as the effective date for the \n     amendments to section 1151. Section 5(a) would amend section \n     421(d) of Pub. L. No. 104-204 by striking out ``January 1, \n     1997'' and substituting ``October 1, 1997'' in its place. In \n     addition, section 5(b) would amend section 422(b)(1) of \n     that public law to specify an effective date of October 1, \n     1997, for the amendments made by section 422(a) to 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1151, in place of October 1, 1996. Finally, \n     section 5(c) would repeal section 422(c) of Pub. L. No. \n     104-204, as that section would no longer be needed.\n       In addition to simplifying the effective date provisions \n     applicable to sections 421 and 422 of Pub. L. No. 104-204, \n     this change would avoid an anomaly in the application of the \n     amendment to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1151 made by section 422(a). In \n     part to assure that any benefit costs associated with new \n     chapter 18 would be fully offset by cost savings, section \n     422(a) amended section 1151 to provide, in general, that \n     compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation on the \n     basis of disability or death as a result of VA medical \n     treatment would be payable only where disability or death was \n     due to fault on the part of VA or an event not reasonably \n     foreseeable. Although section 422(c) currently provides that \n     section 422 shall not take effect until October 1, 1997, \n     section 422(b)(2) states that the amended section 1151 shall \n     govern determinations of eligibility ``made with respect to \n     claims filed on or after the effective date set forth in \n     paragraph (1)'' of section 422(b), i.e., October 1, 1996. \n     This suggests that, although the amendments to section 1151 \n     made by section 422 do not take effect until October 1, 1997, \n     when they do, any claims filed between October 1, 1996, and \n     October 1, 1997, but not yet decided by October 1, 1997, \n     would be subject to the more narrow provisions of amended \n     section 1151. The criteria applicable to eligibility \n     determinations should not be dependent on how long it takes \n     VA to adjudicate a particular section-1151 claim. The \n     amendments proposed in section 5 of the draft bill would \n     avoid this result by clarifying that the changes to section \n     1151 apply only with respect to claims filed on or after \n     October 1, 1997, as we believe was intended.\n       Section 6 of the draft bill would provide that the \n     effective date for the amendments made by the draft bill \n     shall be October 1, 1997. This provision is necessary to \n     assure that the amendments proposed in this draft bill will \n     have the same effective date as the amendments to title 38, \n     United States Code, applicable to children of Vietnam \n     veterans who are born with spina bifida enacted as part of \n     Pub. L. No. 104-204.\n       This proposal would affect direct spending; therefore it is \n     subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management \n     and Budget (OMB) estimates that the pay-as-you-go effect of \n     this proposal would be zero.\n       OMB advises that there is no objection from the standpoint \n     of the Administration's program to the submission of this \n     proposal to the Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 1020. A bill to amend the National Foundation on the Arts and \nHumanities Act of 1965 and the Art and Artifacts Indemnity Act to \nimprove and extend the acts, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               the arts and humanities amendments of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Arts and \nHumanities Amendments of 1997 along with my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy and my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Chafee. This legislation provides an authorization for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts [NEA] and the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities [NEH]--agencies which I believe contribute a great deal \nto the wealth and richness of our Nation.\n  The bill that we are introducing today is based closely on the bill \nthat was passed out of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee \nlast Congress by a solid bipartisan vote of 12 to 4. The legislation \nreflected ideas and consideration from Senators on both sides of the \naisle. The result of that collaboration was a strong bill, which makes \nsubstantial and needed changes to the agencies while allowing the \nagencies to continue what they do best--provide support for the arts \nand humanities in communities throughout this Nation.\n  We began the reauthorization process this Congress in May with a \nhearing which focused on education programs in the arts and humanities. \nIt was clear to me from that hearing that arts education programs and \neducation programs in the humanities make a real difference in the \nlives of individuals of all ages and from all corners of the country.\n  As a result of what I learned at the hearing, the bill that I am \nintroducing today directs the NEA to use any funds appropriated above \nthe fiscal year 1997 level for arts education programs, especially \nthose innovative programs that integrate the arts in the teaching of \nother core academic subjects. The arts are important to ensuring the \nfuture academic success of our Nation's students. In fact, according to \ncollege board figures, students of the arts outperform their nonarts \npeers on the SAT. In 1995, those who had studied the arts for 4 or more \nyears scored 59 points higher in the verbal and 44 points higher in the \nmath portions of the SAT compared with students with no course work or \nexperience in the arts.\n  I have only to look in my backyard to understand the importance and \nvalue of the NEA and NEH. The benefits of NEA and NEH funding in \nVermont are significant and far reaching. Thanks in part to a $30,000 \ngrant from the NEA, folks in 26 Vermont communities will be able to \nhear the magnificent music of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra. The \nVermont Symphony will perform for 12,000 school children as part of a \nschool partnership program, opening their worlds to the magic and \nwonder of music, many for the first time. Our Vermont Arts Council, \nthrough the funds it receives from NEA will support a wide range of \narts programs benefiting all Vermonters. The NEH makes a significant \nand positive difference in the State of Vermont, too. The Vermont \nCouncil on the Humanities is a national leader in creating literacy \nprograms which reach individuals of all reading levels and all ages as \na result of the funding provided by the NEH. The University of Vermont \nreceived a grant from the NEH to catalogue and preserve our State's \nlocal newspapers. This grant is part of a national initiative \nspearheaded by the NEH to ensure that the local papers which chronicle \nthe history of our State and the Nation are available to future \ngenerations.\n  This bill makes substantial improvement to the way these agencies do\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nbusiness. In addition, the legislation makes it clear that these \nagencies are meant to serve the American public, especially those who \nwould not otherwise have the arts and humanities available to them.\n  This bill proposes significant changes to current law. The changes \nare far reaching and go the fundamental operations of both the NEA and \nNEH. It is our hope that these changes will provide guidance and set \npriorities for funding for projects in an effort to increase access to \nprograms and projects which are of the highest caliber.\n  The legislation imposes a new structure on the NEA and NEH, and \nincreases the percentage of funds made available to State councils. It \nplaces greater emphasis on ensuring Endowment programs reach \nunderserved communities.\n  The bill calls for a merging of many of the administrative functions \nof the Endowments with the intent of eliminating costly and unnecessary \nduplication. Administrative funds are capped on a sliding scale. In an \neffort to further streamline the agencies and cut bureaucracy, the \nnumber of members on the National Councils have been decreased. A \nprovision has been included which empowers the NEA and NEH to recapture \nfunds from grants that have gone on to commercial and financial \nsuccess. Both Endowments are explicitly prohibited from using funds for \npurposes of lobbying or general membership services.\n  Some changes apply only to the NEA. The legislation prohibits the NEA \nfrom making nonspecific seasonal support grants. It eliminates \nsubgranting--only States, regional groups, and local arts agencies \nwhich are agencies of local government would have the authority to \nsubgrant under this legislation. it restricts grants to individuals to \nthe categories of literature, National Heritage, and Jazz Master \nfellowships. Non-Federal matching requirements are increased in the \nNational Significance grant category to 3:1 and in some cases, 5:1. We \nhave increased turnover in the panel system and increased lay person \nparticipation to ensure greater community involvement and input. In \naddition, panels are prohibited from recommending specific amounts of \ngrants and will be required to recommend more grants than funding \navailable. The Council, too, will have to recommend approval for more \napplications than there are funds available. These provision give the \nchair greater decisionmaking responsibility and make the chair more \naccountable for grants the agency makes.\n  Lastly, but in my opinion one of the most important changes to this \nbill is the expansion of the Arts and Artifact Indemnity Act. This \nchange will enable extraordinary domestic exhibitions to be eligible \nfor Federal indemnification and afford more Americans access to the \ngreat artistic treasures of this Nation.\n  Many of my colleagues in the House do not feel that there is a \nFederal role for the arts, but I do not agree with that position. The \nrole of the States in distributing NEA funds is very important, and for \nthat reasons, this legislation does increase the percentage of funds \navailable to State arts and agencies and State humanities \norganizations. Still, in my view, there is an important national role \nthat must be preserved. The New York-based Chamber Music America \nreceived an NEA grant of $145,000 for a residency program which \nbenefited rural communities in Arkansas, California, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Kentucky, Maine, and Oregon. The NEA made a grant to the YMCA in \nChicago, IL, for its National Readings Tour of the National Writer's \nVoice project which established literary arts centers in YMCA's in New \nMexico, South Dakota, New Jersey, California, North Carolina, New \nHampshire, and Florida. Both these grants benefited people far beyond \nthe boundary of the State that received the grant. They are just two \nexamples of extraordinary arts programs that would not longer be \navailable to people in my State or any other State if all NEA funds \nwere block granted.\n  In setting clear priorities for the NEA and NEH, and striking a \nbalance between leadership at the State level and leadership at the \nnational level, I am confident that both agencies will be even better \nable to serve their constituency--all the people of this country. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be included as part of \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is an honor to be a sponsor of this 5-\nyear reauthorization of the National Endowments for the Arts and \nHumanities. I commend Chairman Jeffords for his leadership in support \nof these two important Endowments. We intend to do all we can to \nsupport them and keep them active because of their well-known success \nin enhancing the cultural life of the Nation.\n  The arts and humanities have, and deserve to have, a central role in \nthe life of America. The National Endowments for the Arts and \nHumanities have contributed immensely to that role. They encourage the \ngrowth and development of the arts and humanities in communities across \nthe Nation, giving new emphasis and vitality to American creativity and \nscholarship, and to the cultural diversity that is one of America's \ngreatest strengths.\n  Americans have a great deal to celebrate--and also to learn--about \nour extraordinary cultural traditions, our complex modern society, and \nour country's many possibilities for the future. The arts and \nhumanities are essential parts of this experience. If we shortchange \nthe arts and humanities, we shortchange America itself.\n  There are critics who continue to seek the elimination of the \nEndowments--despite the fact that the American people themselves want \nthe arts to be an active and significant part of their lives, and \ndespite the recognized need for greater support to enable people from \nall walks of life to have realistic opportunities to enjoy America's \nartistic and scholarly traditions and innovations.\n  Unfortunately, the critics gained undeserved strength with the \nRepublican takeover of Congress in 1994. The Arts Endowment is \ncurrently under intense ideological attack by Republican leaders in the \nHouse of Representatives who are bent on eliminating the agency.\n  One of the few gratifying aspects of the current debate is the \noutrage the House assault has created in communities across the \ncountry. As last week's 217 to 216 vote demonstrated, the House \nRepublican leadership was forced into an embarrassing public display of \narm-twisting to salvage its untenable position. The reason is obvious. \nAngry citizens are contacting Congress. Editorials and opinion pieces \nsupporting the Endowment are proliferating in newspapers large and \nsmall across the country, labeling this threat for what it is--a \nfrontal assault on the arts in America.\n  These citizens and these communities understand the importance and \nthe success of the Arts Endowment. As a result of its leadership over \nthe past three decades, the country now has double the number of \ncommunity orchestras, 11 times the number of community dance companies, \nand 50 times the number of community arts agencies. Clearly, the crass \nRepublican attempt to mug the Arts Endowment is doomed to fail. I am \nconfident that sanity will return to the House of Representatives \nbefore the debate is ultimately over. There is simply too much at \nstake.\n  The arts and humanities are vital and essential parts of our national \nexperience, and Congress has an obligation to ensure that they are more \naccessible, not less accessible, to all Americans in every community.\n  The current legislation which we introduce today to reauthorize the \nEndowments is well designed to increase access to arts programs and \ncultural programs in underserved communities and areas that do not yet \nhave such access on a regular or widespread basis, but that would be \ngreatly enriched by these programs.\n  In addition, under the legislation, arts education grants will \nprovide funds to make the arts more accessible in schools, where they \nare increasingly becoming an effective way to strengthen education. \nYoung people deserve to have music, theater, dance, poetry, and the \nother arts as basic parts of their school years. These investments in \nstudents and schools will bring major long-term benefits to the nation.\n  Students receive short-term benefits too. According to a recent \nstudy, high school students who took an arts course in each year of \nhigh school scored 59 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT \nand 44 points higher on the math portion than students with no courses \nin the arts.\n  Unfortunately, in spite of these obvious and very tangible benefits, \nthe arts and humanities must now exist in an environment where there \nare fewer public dollars and greater competition for private support. \nAdequate Federal funding for the Endowments is more important than \never. Our bill, therefore, authorizes $175 million for the Arts \nEndowment and $175 million for the Humanities Endowment for the next \nfiscal year, compared to appropriations of $99.5 million for the Arts \nEndowment and $110 million for the Humanities Endowment in the current \nfiscal year. Authorizations for the following 4 fiscal years are open-\nended; our bill specifies ``such sums as may be necessary.''\n  President Kennedy understood the importance of the arts in our daily \nlives. As he said in 1963:\n\n       I look forward to an America which will reward achievement \n     in the arts as we reward achievement in business or \n     statecraft. I look forward to an American which will steadily \n     raise the standard of artistic accomplishment and which will \n     steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all of our \n     citizens. And I look forward to an America which commands \n     respect throughout the world not only for its strength but \n     also for its civilization as well.\n\n  Preserving and supporting the Arts and Humanities Endowments are \namong one of the most important and effective ways that Congress can \nhelp to make this vision a reality.\n  Throughout history, governments have recognized their responsibility \nto support and encourage the arts and humanities. In times of rapid \nchange, it is particularly important for us to find effective ways to \ncelebrate our common American community and our shared cultural \nheritage and values.\n  Again, I commend Chairman Jeffords for his commitment to the \nEndowments. This legislation deserves broad bipartisan support in \nCongress, and I look forward to its enactment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with the chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nSenators Jeffords and Kennedy, in introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities. Later this month, we will vote on funding \nfor the Endowments, and it is my sincere hope that the Senate will show \nits determination to continue Federal support for the arts, as it has \nin years past.\n  Although other countries have long histories of government support \nfor cultural activities, Federal support for artists in the United \nStates began during the Great Depression, when the WPA hired scores of \nwriters, musicians, painters, sculptors, and other artists to work on \npublic art projects. But that support was short lived. It wasn't until \n1964 that the National Endowment for the Arts first was created. The \nNEA saw profound growth during the Nixon and Ford administrations.\n  Regrettably, its funding has been reduced by about 40 percent over \nthe past few years primarily because of a few grants that were deemed \nto have been obscene and inappropriate. With regard to this issue of \nobscene art, I believe that any such debate should be framed in terms \nof the overall record of the NEA, not in terms of a few grants that may \nhave escaped appropriate scrutiny. Of the more than 100,000 grants\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\nprovided by the NEA in its almost 30-year history, only a handful have \nbeen the subject of controversy. That is an excellent track record, and \nI do not believe that those few grants should be used as the yardstick \nby which the Endowment is judged.\n  Mr President, the public's support for the NEA and NEH is very \nstrong. In Rhode Island, we have a vigorous and growing arts community. \nThe Rhode Island School of Design is among the most prestigious fine \narts and design schools in the Nation. It attracts the most talented \nstudents and teachers who often make Rhode Island their permanent home. \nMany Rhode Islanders, and people in the city of Providence in \nparticular, are enormously enthusiastic about the arts community, which \nhas contributed greatly to our economic redevelopment efforts.\n  The NEA and NEH support a wide array of artists, writers, actors, \nmusicians, and other artists. During the past several weeks, I have \nheard from a number of Rhode Island artists. I would like to share an \nexcerpt from a Rhode Island musician with you. Rebecca Truitt, a \ncellist in the Rhode Island Philharmonic, wrote to me on March 8. This \nis what she said:\n\n       The declining state of public support for the arts in \n     America is of great concern to me. . . . Equally critical is \n     the possibility that our cultural agencies may fail to \n     receive authorization for Fiscal Year 1998. Should that \n     happen, it would be an embarrassing day for the United \n     States, making us unique among cultured nations by \n     eliminating the arts from our priorities. Whether all \n     orchestras, including my orchestra, the Rhode Island \n     Philharmonic Orchestra, receive funding or not, one thing is \n     clear, the NEA has helped raise the standard of all \n     professional performing groups in the U.S., catapulting \n     American music and musicians to the forefront of the \n     international music scene. Moreover, the NEA has helped to \n     promote and sustain American jobs.\n\n  Throughout my years in the Senate, I have supported funding for both \nthe National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. Once again, I am delighted to introduce this \nreauthorization bill with Senators Jeffords and Kennedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7486-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 28\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n[Mr. Bond] was added as a cosponsor of S. 28, a bill to amend title 17, \nUnited States Code, with respect to certain exemptions from copyright, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 535\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nBennett], the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], the Senator from \nKansas [Mr. Brownback], and the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 535, a bill to amend the Public Health \nService Act to provide for the establishment of a program for research \nand training with respect to Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n                                 S. 766\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. \nWyden] was added as a cosponsor of S. 766, a bill to require equitable \ncoverage of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, and \ncontraceptive services under health plans.\n\n\n                                 S. 865\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 865, a bill to provide for \nimproved coordination, communications, and enforcement related to \nhealth care fraud, waste, and abuse, to create a point of order against \nlegislation which diverts savings achieved through medicare waste, \nfraud, and abuse enforcement activities for purposes other than \nimproving the solvency of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund \nunder title XVIII of the Social Security Act, to ensure the integrity \nof such trust fund, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 932\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux] was added as a cosponsor of S. 932, a bill to amend the \nNational Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of \n1977 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a National \nAdvisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control, \nManagement, and Eradication and, in conjunction with the Board, to \nprovide grants for research or demonstration projects related to the \ncontrol, management, and possible eradication of imported fire ants, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 963\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Lieberman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 963, a bill \nto establish a transportation credit assistance pilot program, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 985\n\n  At the request of Mr. Torricelli, the name of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] was added as a cosponsor of S. 985, a bill to designate \nthe post office located at 194 Ward Street in Paterson, New Jersy, as \nthe ``Larry Coby Post Office''.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 32\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hutchinson, the name of the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 32, a concurrent resolution recognizing and commending \nAmerican airmen held as political prisoners at the Buchenwald \nconcentration camp during World War II for their service, bravery, and, \nfortitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7503-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7503-S7504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 39--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXPAND AND SIMPLIFY ITS REPARATIONS \n                     SYSTEMS TO HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Dodd) \nsubmitted the following resolution which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 39\n\n       Whereas the annihilation of 6,000,000 European Jews during \n     the Holocaust and the murder of millions of others by the \n     Nazi German state constitutes one of the most tragic episodes \n     in the history of man's inhumanity to man;\n       Whereas there are more than 125,000 Holocaust survivors \n     living in the United States and approximately 500,000 living \n     around the world;\n       Whereas aging Holocaust survivors throughout the world are \n     still suffering from permanent injuries suffered at the hands \n     of the Nazis, and many are unable to afford critically needed \n     medical care;\n       Whereas, while the German Government has attempted to \n     address the needs of Holocaust survivors, many are excluded \n     from reparations because of onerous eligibility requirements \n     imposed by the German Government;\n       Whereas the German Government often rejects Holocaust \n     survivors' claims on the grounds that the survivor did not \n     present the claim correctly or in a timely manner, that the \n     survivor cannot demonstrate to the Government's satisfaction \n     that a particular illness or medical condition is the direct \n     consequence of persecution in a Nazi-created ghetto or \n     concentration camp, or that the survivor is not considered \n     sufficiently destitute;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors in the \n     former Soviet Union and other formerly Communist countries in \n     Eastern and Central Europe have never received reparations \n     from Germany and a smaller number has received a token \n     amount;\n       Whereas, after more than 50 years, hundreds of thousands of \n     Holocaust survivors continue to be denied justice and \n     compensation from the German Government;\n       Whereas the German Government pays generous disability \n     pensions to veterans of the Nazi armed forces, including non-\n     German veterans of the Waffen-SS;\n       Whereas in 1996 the German Government paid $7,700,000,000 \n     in such pensions to 1,100,000 veterans, including 3,000 \n     veterans and their dependents now living in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas such pensions are a veteran's benefit provided over \n     and above the full health coverage that all German citizens, \n     including veterans of the Waffen-SS, receive from their \n     government; and\n       Whereas it is abhorrent that Holocaust survivors should \n     live out their remaining years in conditions worse than those \n     enjoyed by the surviving former Nazis who persecuted them: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the German Government should expand and simplify its \n     system of reparations so that all Holocaust survivors can \n     receive reparations, regardless of their nationality, length \n     or place of internment, or current financial situation;\n       (2) the German Government should provide reparations to \n     Holocaust survivors in the\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\n     former Soviet Union and other former Communist countries in \n     Eastern and Central Europe;\n       (3) the German Government should fulfill its \n     responsibilities to victims of the Holocaust and immediately \n     set up a comprehensive medical fund to cover the medical \n     expenses of all Holocaust survivors worldwide; and\n       (4) the German Government should help restore the dignity \n     of Holocaust survivors by paying them sufficient reparations \n     to ensure that no Holocaust survivor be forced by poverty to \n     live in conditions worse than those generally enjoyed by the \n     surviving former Nazis who persecuted them.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is now over half a century since the \nend of the Second World War. Millions of us who served in that war \nreturned home to resume our lives and enjoy the blessings of peace. To \nall of us the end of the war was a relief. To the survivors of the Nazi \nconcentration camps it was the difference between certain death and a \nchance to continue life after years of unspeakable deprivation and \nhorror.\n  Much has been written and said about the 6 million European Jews who \nwere slaughtered during the Holocaust. A magnificent museum not far \nfrom this building pays moving and appropriate tribute to them, and to \nthe millions of non-Jewish victims of Nazi Germany, as well. Much has \nbeen said about the dead. But far too little has been said about, or \ndone for, the survivors. Almost half a million of them are still alive, \nincluding over 125,000 in this country and about the same number in \nEastern and Central Europe and Israel. The youngest among them are now \nin their sixties; most of them are in their seventies and eighties and \nin increasingly frail health, complicated in many cases by the \nsuffering they endured over half a century ago.\n  The German Government has long recognized its moral obligation to \nassist the survivors of the Holocaust. The landmark reparations \nagreements of the early 1950's between the West German Government and \nJewish groups were predicated on this simple premise. Yet, as years go \nby, it has become increasingly apparent that a large number of \nsurvivors, particularly those living in Eastern and Central Europe, \nwere excluded from these agreements and are now being denied assistance \non the flimsiest of technical grounds. In addition, tens of thousands \nof Holocaust survivors in North America and Israel have been similarly \nrefused reparations for a variety of reasons that all pale when \ncontrasted to Germany's half-century of generous pensions to German and \nnon-German veterans of the notorious Waffen-SS. It is only fair and \nlogical that the survivors of the Holocaust be treated in their old age \nwith at least the same measure of support being afforded their \ntorturers and prison guards. It is also only fair and logical that \nthese aging survivors, as well as those who already receive \nreparations, be assisted in meeting their increasing medical expenses.\n  It is for this purpose that I join Senators Graham, Hatch, and Dodd \nin submitting this resolution which speaks to the simple proposition \nthat it is the sense of Congress that the German Government should \nexpand and simplify its reparations system, provide reparations to \nHolocaust survivors in Eastern and Central Europe, and set up a fund to \nhelp cover the medical expenses of Holocaust survivors.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Moynihan and my \nother colleagues to submit a resolution that will allow Holocaust \nsurvivors to receive the reparations they so rightly deserve.\n  There are over 125,000 Holocaust survivors living in the United \nStates. My State of Florida houses the second largest population in the \nUnited States Approximately 500,000 survivors worldwide are living out \ntheir final days. Many still suffer from the injuries they received \nduring the Nazi occupation. While the German Government has acted in \ngood faith in attempting to take responsibility for the horrible \nactions of the Nazi regime, many survivors have been prevented from \nreceiving reparations due to burdensome eligibility requirements.\n  We recognize that since 1952, Germany has contributed to the \ncompensation of those that survived the Holocaust. However, after 50 \nyears, hundreds of thousands of elderly Holocaust survivors are still \nunable to afford critically needed medical care, and many of their \nmedical problems are a direct result of their years in Nazi \nconcentration camps.\n  In May, it was acknowledged that, in addition to the regular pensions \nand medical insurance the German Government provides, war disability \npensions are still being paid to veterans of the Nazi armed forces and \nthe non-German Waffen-SS, Hitler's special death squads. According to \nthe Wiesenthal Center, the SS disability pensions alone are three times \nthe reparations paid to the Holocaust survivors.\n  This resolution calls for the German Government to expand and \nsimplify its system of reparations so that a medical fund may be \nestablished to cover medical expenses for Holocaust survivors \nthroughout the world. Regardless of nationality or the length or place \nof internment, Holocaust survivors will be guaranteed the opportunity \nto live the remainder of their lives with the knowledge that they will \nalways be able to receive the medical care they need.\n  Holocaust survivors have lived enough of their life in suffering. We \nmust now insure that they live the rest of their lives in dignity. We \nhope the German Government will continue to accept responsibility and \nset up a fund to help the victims of Nazi terror. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7503-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7504-S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HUTCHISON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 849\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mrs. Hutchison for herself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. McCain, Mr. Warner, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Levin) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1005, making appropriations for \nthe Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n1998, and for other purposes, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) International efforts to bring indicted war criminals \n     to justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina consistent with the 1995 \n     Dayton Accords should be supported as an important element in \n     creating a self-sustaining peace in the region;\n       (2) The Administration should consult closely with the \n     Congress on all efforts to bring indicted war criminals to \n     justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina consistent with the 1995 \n     Dayton Accords; and\n       (3) The Administration should consult closely and in a \n     timely manner with the Congress on the NATO-led Stabilization \n     Force's mission concerning the apprehension of indicted war \n     criminals, including any changes in the mission which could \n     affect American forces.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 850\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mr. Dorgan) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1005, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  .

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Barrington, NH. On July 20, 1997, the people of \nBarrington will gather in celebration of the 275th anniversary of the \ntown's charter.\n  On May 10, 1722 Gov. Samuel Shute signed Barrington's charter on \nbehalf of King George I, encouraging the settlement of a new plantation \nof 50 dwelling houses, a meeting house for public worship, a parsonage, \nand a school. However, when Barrington's first settlers crossed the 20 \nmiles between the harbor town of Portsmouth and their new plots of \nwhite pine forest land, they found the terrain wrought with the tough, \nplow-bending granite which has come to make New Hampshire famous. Early \naccounts depict fields overrun with rattle snakes and forests brimming \nwith less-than-hospitable native tribes.\n  Nevertheless, in quintessential Yankee fashion, the people of \nBarrington cut out a tiny foothold for themselves. Together, they \nburned back the brush, felled the towering hardwoods, and quarried the \ngranite using crude hand-held drills and chisels. By 1742, granite \nboulders had been hewn into foundations and apple orchards had been \nplanted. By 1750, Barrington's lumber mills were providing the timber \nfor ships' masts in England, posts and beams for homes in surrounding \ntowns, and chord wood for firing the seacoast's early ironworks.\n  Mr. President, on Sunday I will join with the people of Barrington on \nthe steps of its landmark Calef's Country Store to commemorate this \nhistoric birthday. Since its rudimentary beginnings the town of \nBarrington has grown into a prosperous township of 6,600 people. \nJoining me on Sunday will be members of Barrington's volunteer fire \ndepartment, Barrington's volunteer emergency medical service and \nBarrington's volunteer youth association. I am pleased to report the \nunwavering dedication to community is alive and well in Barrington \nafter 275 years.\n  Happy birthday, Barrington. Live Free or Die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7507-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7507-S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE 1997 GRADUATES OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH \n             PLANS' MINORITY MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate 14 \nindividuals who recently completed the American Association of Health \nPlans [AAHP] Minority Management Development Program [MMDP]. This \nintensive year-long fellowship program prepares minority managers for \nmiddle management positions in network-based health plans.\n  The 1997 graduates are: Cheryl Bitoun, M.H.A.; Michelle Browne, \nM.P.A., M.S.W.; Kendrick Carpenter; Janice Cartera; Bernadette Cooper, \nM.H.A.; Lisa Lawrence Eggleston, R.N., M.H.A.; Juli Harkins, M.S.H.A.; \nLisa Little Axe; Elizabeth Mendoza, M.B.A., M.H.A.; and Erik Thorne, \nM.P.H.\n  The Minority Management Development Program was created in 1994 when \nAAHP and the health plan community recognized the need to develop \ndiverse management teams--especially in light of the growing number of \nminorities joining health plans. Since the MMDP's inception in 1992, 42 \nfellows of diverse ethnic backgrounds have participated in this \ninnovative management training program and have distinguished \nthemselves as leaders throughout the health care community. The MMDP is \na comprehensive program designed to provide managerial training, work \nexperience, and knowledge of health plans through focused didactic and \npractical interactive training opportunities. The program's varied \ncurriculum is focused on key health care related management tools, \nincluding quality management and accreditation, marketing, delivery \nsystems, financial management, and operations.\n  Fellows in the 1997 class trained at health plans in Washington, DC, \nand in several neighboring counties in Maryland. This year's training \nsites were Kaiser Foundation Health Plan/Mid-Atlantic States, \nRockville, MD; NYLCare\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\nHealth Plans, Greenbelt, MD; Blue Cross & Blue Shield of the National \nCapital Area and Chartered Health Plan in Washington, DC, and Total \nHealth Care, Inc. and Prudential Health Care Plan in Baltimore, MD. \nNext year, the program will expand to provide training at additional \nsites in four southwestern States: Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and \nCalifornia.\n  AAHP is the national association representing health maintenance \norganizations [HMO's], preferred provider organizations [PPO's], and \nother similar health plans. Together, these health plans provide care \nfor more than 140 million Americans.\n  I hope that this Congress will recognize that programs such as the \nMinority Management Development Program are of vital importance and \nthat they meet a critical need in the education and training of \nAmerica's health professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7507-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES BOWSE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJames Bowse. Jim died unexpectedly on Tuesday, June 17. As president/\nchief executive officer at the Rutland Regional Medical Center since \n1989, Jim was considered to be one of the most progressive and \neffective leaders in the field of health care.\n  Jim understood the challenges facing community hospitals, but never \nlost sight of the human element in medicine. During his tenure at the \nRutland facility Jim was instrumental in creating the first State-owned \nhealth maintenance organization [HMO]. He established a Rutland-based \nsystem of physicians to provide high quality service while \nsimultaneously containing costs.\n  Jim strove to develop a community approach in medicine. To that end, \nhe maintained reserves to cover the costs associated with patients that \ncould not afford the treatment they required. Jim was able to freeze \npatient fees since 1991, while doubling annual revenues to $100 \nbillion. In addition, he played a vital role in the establishment of an \northopedic clinic and the expansion of outpatient services as well as \npreventative health projects.\n  Jim had a great sense of humor and an uncanny ability to make the \nmost complex issues seem simple. His dedication to the people of \nVermont is in the State's finest tradition. Through his efforts, Jim \nmade a lasting impression upon the community which will be slow to \nfade. I extend my condolences to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7508-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPLEASANT HILL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL--A 1997 NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL OF \n                               EXCELLENCE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \nto recognize a worthy school in my State.\n  The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program annually identifies \nelementary and middle schools which attain high academic standards, \nfoster an educational community, productive communication and strong \nleadership, and indicate a hopeful future. These schools are \nacknowledged for their achievements and held up publicly as models for \nother schools.\n  In testament to West Virginia's strong commitment to education, I am \nproud that my State contains more blue ribbon schools this year than \nmost others--7 schools out of the 263 honored across the country. Of \nthese, I wish to highlight the achievement of one today: Pleasant Hill \nElementary School in Grantsville, WV.\n  Pleasant Hill's two-story brick building is tucked among the forests \nof Calhoun County, far from any city or even a fast-food restaurant. It \nis a place where West Virginians face many financial challenges, yet \nthose at Pleasant Hill have struggled and succeeded in the face of \nthese obstacles. They see that education is the way to a better future.\n  For 8 years, under a community vision that every child must first \nmaster a backbone of basic skills, the school has steadily improved its \nstanding. When teachers were not satisfied with math scores, they \nexamined their teaching methods and implemented a new approach which \nemphasized practicing skills after they were learned. Now Pleasant Hill \nstudents placed in the 91 percentile in math. With this strategy, \ndirecting attention to one needy area at a time, the whole school has \nraised itself to a level which deserves notice.\n  But the whole community--not just the teachers--has also changed the \natmosphere at Pleasant Hill. Under the leadership of administrators \nlike Principal Lawrence Stinn, the faculty and parents see themselves \nas members of the same team aspiring together to teach the children. \nWhen a school community is so united, perhaps the most important aspect \nof education is already achieved: a sense of optimism. And the Pleasant \nHill community certainly has reason to see a bright future.\n  During a time when our public schools face innumerable obstacles, it \nis comforting to see places like Pleasant Hill. They reassure us that, \nwith a little determination, all schools in America can improve. Thus I \nam pleased to congratulate the accomplishments and continuing efforts \nof the people of Grantsville. I am proud they are from West Virginia \nand know that they will continue to represent the best that our State \nhas to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7508-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MILDRED SOSH\n\n    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an \nextraordinary woman for her lifelong dedication to service and charity. \nNinety-two-year-old Mildred Sosh volunteers at the Wayside Christian \nMission in Louisville one morning every week where she showers needy \ninfants with loving care.\n  Mrs. Sosh never had children of her own, so she loves the children at \nWayside with all her heart. Mrs. Sosh also taught first grade for 44 \nyears. This remarkable woman has volunteered at Wayside Christian \nMission for 28 years where she first worked with the Mission's \nauxiliary mending clothes and making homemade gravy. She later \nvolunteered in the day care where she remains today. Mrs. Sosh also \nvolunteers at Salem United Church of Christ where she is a member. Mrs. \nSosh was deservedly honored this spring at the J.C. Penney Golden Rule \nAwards Banquet for her dedication to helping the homeless.\n  Despite her dependence on a cane to walk, Mrs. Sosh arrives at \nWayside every Tuesday morning to rock the babies. She recruited a \nfriend about 4 years ago to volunteer also so that she would always \nhave a ride to the mission. Although not everyone can volunteer as \nextensively as Mildred Sosh, we can all take inspiration from her \nselfless sacrifice for the sake of others.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me in honoring Mildred \nSosh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/15/senate-section/article/S7508-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 16, 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
