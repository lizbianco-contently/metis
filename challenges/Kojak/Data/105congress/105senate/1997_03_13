Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume consideration \nof Senate Joint Resolution 18, the Hollings resolution on a \nconstitutional amendment on campaign expenditures. It is my hope the \nminority leader and I can reach an agreement as to when the Senate will \ncomplete action on this resolution. I have discussed this with the \nSenator from South Carolina. I still think maybe there is a possibility \nwe can get an agreement and get a vote on it tonight, but if not \ntonight, we will converse with the sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution \n18 and see when we could get a vote on it. If not tonight, it could \nactually not occur until Tuesday morning. But we will discuss that and \nmake an announcement later on today.\n  Rollcall votes are possible throughout today's session. It is also \npossible that prior to completing our business this week, the Senate \nmay be asked to consider the independent counsel resolution. The \nJudiciary Committee is scheduled to meet today. Hopefully, they can \ntake some action in this area, hopefully in a bipartisan way. That \nwould be helpful.\n  In addition, it is my hope we will be able to reach a time agreement \nfor consideration of the nomination of Merrick Garland to be the U.S. \ncircuit judge for the District Circuit. I am thinking about the \nprobability of that occurring on Tuesday, maybe Tuesday morning, with a \ntime agreement. We had been thinking perhaps 3 hours equally divided \nwould be sufficient, but we will need to get a final arrangement on \nthat. We do have some Senators who want to speak on this nomination.\n\n  I think a lot of the concern on this one is not so much with the \nnominee as with the circuit. The D.C. circuit actually has one of the \nlowest caseloads in the country, and it is declining. It has declined \npretty perceptively, even in the last year or so. There is a question \nabout how much need there is for additional judges on that circuit. So \nthere will be some discussion about that.\n  Again, I hope that rollcall vote can occur on Tuesday morning. We \nmaybe could have done it today or Friday, but because of the \nconstitutional amendment and other issues pending, we felt Tuesday \nmorning would give us time to work it out. I expect the Senate to \nconvene on Monday, but this time I do not anticipate any rollcall votes \nduring Monday's session. I would like to note that, again, for the \nDemocratic leader, that while we may be in session, I don't foresee at \nthis time the need to have a recorded vote during the day on Monday. I \ndo know there are Senators who have commitments who necessarily have to \nbe away from the city, but we will want to have votes as soon as we can \non Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I have no further comments at this time. I will be \nglad to yield the floor to the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority \nleader for his announcements regarding the schedule. I agree completely \nwith his assessment of the need to define a time agreement for Merrick \nGarland. I hope 3 hours can be sufficient. I can't imagine that we \nwould need more than that amount of time. Obviously, there are issues \nunrelated to Mr. Garland that need to be addressed.\n  I was interested in the Judicial Conference statement just this week, \nthe 27-judge group, chaired by Chief Rehnquist, actually called upon \nCongress to create more judges. The group\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nagreed to seek the authorization for 12 new appellate judgeships, 26 \ntrial court judgeships, and 18 bankruptcy court judgeships, over and \nabove the 93 vacancies that exist today. This is going to become an \nincreasingly important matter for the Senate.\n  I intend to work closely with the majority leader to see if we can't \nresolve the question of nominations and confirmations relating to \njudges. I appreciate very much his leadership and cooperation that he \nhas demonstrated in working through the Cabinet-level appointments that \nwe have been able to address so far this year.\n  Mr. President, I will also say, in talking with a number of my \ncolleagues who want the opportunity to express themselves on the \nconstitutional amendment, I am not sure that our side will be prepared \nto agree to a time certain for a vote today, but I will certainly work \nwith the distinguished majority leader to see if we can't find a \nmutually convenient time with which to begin bringing this debate to a \nclose.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if we need additional time, we can have time \ntomorrow and could even have some time on Monday for debate. I am not \ntrying to push it to an early conclusion. I just want to make sure \nMembers are aware that when everybody feels like they have had their \nsay, we will be prepared to set the vote, whether it is this afternoon \nor Tuesday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can regain the floor for a moment to \nsay, given the accommodation of the majority leader, I think it is \nimperative that we use this time. I was pleased yesterday. I don't \nthink there was a quorum call, and I think it was indicative of the \nkind of interest there is on the issue and the kind of debate that it \ngenerated. I hope we don't see quorum calls today. I hope we can \nmaximize the use of the time. I think we all know the outcome of this \ndebate, so it isn't necessarily the outcome that is driving the \ninterest as much as just the philosophical approach we take to a very \nimportant issue.\n  But, nonetheless, I appreciate very much the majority leader's \ninterest in accommodating Senators to allow for the debate and we \nmaximize the use of the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to voice \nsupport for FBI Director Louis Freeh, who has been subject to some \ncriticism in a variety of quarters, including on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I do so as someone who is thoroughly familiar with the work of \nFBI Director Freeh and of his organization. I have worked with the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation for many, many years, going back to my \ndays as an assistant district attorney of Philadelphia, when I \nprosecuted the Local 107 Teamsters and got the first conviction of \nteamsters resulting from the McClellan committee investigation. I \nworked with the FBI as an assistant counsel on the Warren Commission. I \nhave seen a great deal of the FBI's work since being in the Senate and \nworking as a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I think the FBI does a good job--not a perfect job, not a job without \nsubstantial problems, and not a job where, on some occasions, they \ndon't make mistakes, but a good job. I have seen Director Freeh's work \nin some detail, specifically, on the oversight hearings that the Senate \nSubcommittee on Terrorism conducted on Ruby Ridge, where I served as \nchairman.\n  Ruby Ridge was a national tragedy. Randy Weaver did some things he \nshould not have done, but he didn't deserve the armada of law \nenforcement that descended on his mountain in Idaho. That was a sad \nstory, because the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms unit had \nmisrepresented Weaver's record. They said he had a prior record of \nconvictions, which was false. They said he was a suspect in a bank \nrobbery case, which was false. That brought the hostage rescue team \nfrom the FBI and the killing of a U.S. Marshal, William Deacon, the \nkilling of Mrs. Randy Weaver and their son, Sam Weaver, age 14.\n  To the credit of FBI Director Freeh, he was willing to concede the \nerrors. He changed the rules of engagement, he changed the FBI \nstandards on use of deadly force, and he changed the use of the hostage \nrescue team. This was in stark contrast to what the Alcohol, Tobacco, \nand Firearms did. They would not concede their errors. The Department \nof the Treasury, which managed Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, stood by \ntheir conduct, even though it was palpably wrong, as disclosed in the \nextensive hearings the subcommittee had over the course of 2 months, 16 \nhearings, and a long report in excess of 150 pages.\n  I have seen what Director Freeh has done in combating domestic \nviolence in the Oklahoma City bombing, and I have seen what the FBI has \ndone in the Unabomber case. Where the FBI has made mistakes, Director \nFreeh has come forward and conceded that. Where there was unwarranted \npublicity on the Atlanta Olympics pipe bomb case, for example, when \nsomeone unfairly leaked information, Director Freeh conceded that a \nmistake was made.\n  While I applaud his concessions on the unfair publicity, I have \nproblems with our inability to properly conduct oversight on that \nAtlanta pipe bombing case. We have not been able to move that ahead. So \nthat when I evaluate Director Freeh, I do so in the context of someone \nwho sees problems and has been critical, as well as someone who praises \nthe Bureau's overall performance.\n  Director Freeh has been criticized on the so-called VANPAC case, \nwhich involved the murder of a Federal judge and a civil rights leader. \nDirector Freeh prosecuted this case--he has had a very remarkable \ncareer as an assistant U.S. Attorney, a Federal judge, and he left the \nFederal bench to become Director of the FBI. He was recently criticized \nbecause there were alleged errors made by the FBI laboratory in \nconnection with the VANPAC case. The FBI laboratory has admittedly had \nserious problems. That was one of the aspects that was investigated by \nthe Senate subcommittee on Ruby Ridge, because there were problems with \ntheir work there, as well.\n\n  As the prosecuting attorney in that criminal prosecution, Director \nFreeh relied on evidence from the FBI laboratory, some of which may \nhave been faulty. But when Director Freeh found out that that was an \narea of concern in September of 1995, he recused himself from the \ninvestigation of the FBI laboratory. That means he took himself out of \nthe case and did not pass judgment on it.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\n  The inspector general, who is about as independent as you can be \nwithin the Federal branch--has been looking into the FBI laboratory. We \nhave these inspector generals in a variety of departments. My \nlegislation brought the inspector general to the CIA, the only reform \nlegislation coming out of the Iran-Contra affair. Inspectors general \nare not perfect because it is hard to be totally independent. But to \nthe extent you can have independence, the IGs are independent. They \nreport directly to Congress. They are as good a mechanism as you can \nhave for that sort of an investigation, unless you have congressional \noversight. There ought to be more of that.\n  But, at any rate, Director Freeh did what was possible by recusing \nhimself and referring the matter to the inspector general, who brought \nin five independent scientists. He has been out of the case, and he is \nprepared to make whatever changes are necessary within the FBI \nlaboratory.\n  The FBI is currently conducting a very sensitive investigation on \ncampaign irregularities, which may go to the highest levels of \nGovernment. Not a great deal can be said about that investigation at \nthis time. But from what I have observed Director Freeh has been \nindependent, has been forthright, and has done his job in a \nprofessional way. In that kind of an investigation there are inevitable \npressures, either express or implicit. I have some familiarity with \nwhat the Bureau is doing and what the Director is doing. I have \nconfidence in him. I do so with some understanding of investigative \nwork on grand juries and criminal matters and the kind of sensitivity \nwhich is involved. There are matters on which I consult with him with \nsome frequency in terms of oversight.\n\n  As of this moment, I am not yet satisfied with what has been done on \nRuby Ridge. The Department of Justice has conducted an investigation on \na number of the FBI agents, one of whom was the former Deputy Director, \nLarry Potts. It may well be as I said, in those hearings, that Director \nFreeh did not exercise the best judgment with respect to Deputy \nDirector Potts. But at the same time I have said publicly that Deputy \nDirector Potts and others are entitled to have the matter resolved, and \nthat the Department of Justice has been investigating that since the \nfall of 1995--some 18-month lapse--which is unwarranted. I know that \ncase thoroughly because of the hearings we had. I know investigative \npractice. That matter should have been concluded. That is not a matter \nunder Director Freeh's purview. It is in the Department of Justice.\n  I recently wrote to the Attorney General complaining about the delays \nand got an unresponsive response saying that the investigation will \ntake several more months due to the complicated nature of this matter. \nIt is not all that complicated. We have the Atlanta pipe bomber case \nwhere I have been trying to get an oversight hearing since October-\nNovember. I am not delighted with what the FBI has done on that in \nterms of not being as responsive as I think they might be. They have \ninternal investigations which are really very difficult and which delay \ncongressional oversight. But overall my view is that Director Freeh has \ndone a good job. And when you pick up some of these matters on the FBI \nlaboratory, I think he has provided appropriate management and \nappropriate oversight.\n  Mr. President, I think my time has probably lapsed. But in the \nabsence of any other Senator on the floor, I ask unanimous consent for \nan additional 10 minutes to proceed as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2222-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2223-S2225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HEALTHY CHILDREN'S PILOT PROGRAM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \ndirected at providing health coverage to children who lack health \ninsurance in America.\n  This issue has been recognized as one of the leading--if not the \nleading--problems on incremental health coverage in America today. I am \nglad that President Clinton's health care plan proposed in 1993 was not \nadopted. That was a matter that was fought out on the Senate floor in \nsome great detail in 1994. I participated in that debate. When I read \nPresident Clinton's health plan, I was amazed by the number of \nagencies, boards, and commissions, and asked an assistant to make a \nlist of all of them. My assistant made a chart instead of a list. I had \nthat chart on this floor and many other places, and I shall spare you \nthe chart today. Bob Woodward of the Washington Post said that chart \nwas the key factor in defeating the Clinton health care plan because it \nshowed on one page in red more than 100 new agencies, boards, and \ncommissions, and in green about 50 existing bureaus giving new jobs. \nThen we proceeded, I think wisely, with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill on \nincremental health coverage. Now I think we need to go ahead and \nprovide for coverage for children in America.\n  Very briefly, let me summarize my proposal before going into \nspecifics. It is said that there are 10 million children who lack \nhealth insurance. My analysis shows that there is a critical group, \nperhaps the most critical group, of some 4 million children which my \nbill addresses in an incremental way; 3 million other children are \neligible for Medicaid coverage but not enrolled, and 3 million other \nchildren are in families which would not be eligible for health \ninsurance under my plan because their family income levels are too \nhigh. My legislation will provide a pilot program which would provide \nvouchers to States for families which earn up to 235 percent of the \npoverty level to purchase health insurance in the marketplace.\n  Later today I am going to have a news conference with the Brandt \nfamily from Pennsylvania, because they are illustrative of this issue. \nI would now like to discuss the key elements of my proposal and why I \nhave asked the Brandts to travel to Washington today.\n  Mr. President, it is no less true for being a commonplace that \nnothing could be more important to our Nation than our children. I am \nintroducing today legislation aimed at beginning to fill an enormous \nand unacceptable gap in our country's support for the health and well-\nbeing of our children.\n  Mr. President, as President Clinton discussed during the State of the \nUnion Address last month, there are today approximately 10 million \nAmerican children who have no health insurance coverage from any \nsource--private or public--and who therefore lack access to the kinds \nof preventive and primary care services which can be the difference \nbetween staying healthy and getting sick or between minor illness and \nserious, disabling or even mortal illness.\n  Now, let me say at the outset that this is not a Republican or \nDemocrat issue. Our two parties do have different approaches to the \nroles and the cost of our Federal Government but there is not one party \nthat cares about kids and one party indifferent to our childrens' \nhealth. Let us work constructively on this and actually address the \nproblem rather than just trying to wrack up political points.\n  As with most statistics conjured up for social policy debates, the \nPresident's figure of 10 million uninsured children needs further \ndiscussion to get to the heart of the matter. Of these 10 million \nuninsured, approximately 3 million children live in families with \nincomes which make them eligible for Medicaid. I support outreach \nefforts by the States to enroll these children in Medicaid but, because \ncoverage is accessible to these families if they avail themselves of \nit, this problem is not the gaping hole in our health care system of \nwhich I spoke a moment ago.\n  Likewise, of the 10 million uninsured children, another approximately \n3 million live in families with incomes greater than the median \nhousehold income. There are even uninsured children in more than a few \nhigh income families.\n  Those numbers are deeply disturbing, but I see them as a clarion call \nfor greater parental responsibility, rather than for legislative or \ngovernmental action. I know it is easy for those of us with substantial \nincomes and employer-paid health benefits--such as we here in the \nSenate--to preach to families without these protections, but I cannot \nimagine any higher priority for a family with any more than just enough \nincome to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads than\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\nto provide health insurance for their kids. And I see it as clearly \ninappropriate--despite some proposals on the other side of the aisle to \ndo so--to spend tax dollars to subsidize health insurance for higher \nincome families. The cutoff level I propose in this bill, approximately \n$38,000 for a family of four is already a bit higher than median \nhousehold income in the United States--$34,076--$34,524 in my own State \nof Pennsylvania. In other words, taken together, Medicaid and the new \ninitiative I am proposing would allow eligibility by income for more \nthan half of the households in our country. To go beyond that is to do \nwhat too many Government programs already do--tax those who have less \nfor the benefit of those who have more, Robin Hood in reverse.\n  This leaves approximately 4 million children, ineligible for Medicaid \nbut living in families without the resources to obtain coverage on \ntheir own. This is an American tragedy--the tragedy of the working \npoor. Mom, Dad, or both going to work every day, often more than 5 days \nper week, but being paid low wages, without health benefits. These are \nhonest taxpaying citizens, but their kids' futures are in jeopardy. \nThey are falling through a crack in our health care system which must \nbe sealed off.\n  Some States, including my own State of Pennsylvania, are attempting \nto address this problem. In Pennsylvania, a public/private partnership, \ncombining a publicly funded program called BlueCHIP, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, on which Governor Ridge will spend $39 \nmillion this year, and a private initiative called the Caring Program \nfor Children are reaching 60,000 out of the estimated 300,000 uninsured \nPennsylvania children who are not eligible for Medicaid.\n  But, as this statistic indicates, even generous State and private \nresources are wholly inadequate to meet the need. And this need, this \nhole in our health care system, is not a statistic. It is real.\n  I would like to speak to you today about some Pennsylvanians whose \nstories demonstrate both the real need for action on the matter of \nuninsured children and the effectiveness of a program, such as the one \nI am proposing today, in helping real people face life's storms. These \ngood people have been helped by Pennsylvania's existing efforts to \nprovide health coverage to children and their story is the best \nargument which can be made for a national effort to solve this problem.\n  Here with me today is the Brandt family, from Tarentum, PA, in \nAllegheny County: mother, Scarlett; father, Richard; daughter, Lindsay, \nage 11; and son Chad, age 7.\n  First, I would like to thank the Brandts very deeply for their \nwillingness to be here today, not only because it involves a precious \nday off from work for both Scarlett and Richard, a day out of school \nfor both Lindsay and Chad and a long car ride to Washington and back, \nbut even more so because it involves a family decision to put pride \naside and to be willing to face the press as symbols for a policy \ndebate. This is not an easy position for people to put themselves in--\nand even less so their children--but the Brandts believe in the need to \ntell America about this too long ignored problem of uninsured children \nand about the way life brightens with just a little help to fill this \nbasic need. I am very grateful to them for putting their desire to help \nothers ahead of their own privacy.\n  Scarlett and Richard both have full time jobs; Scarlett is a \nhairdresser and Richard is a truck driver. But neither of \ntheir employers offer health benefits and this hard working, taxpaying \nfamily simply doesn't earn enough money to go out and purchase private \nhealth insurance on their own. Before the Pennsylvania programs began \nhelping the Brandts in 1993, Lindsay had lived the first 7 years of her \nlife without any health insurance coverage and her little brother Chad \nhad gone without coverage from birth until he was 3 years old.\n\n  Here, then, are counter examples for the think tank commentators who \nargue against Federal action on children's health insurance by pointing \nto examples of children who are only uninsured for transitional periods \nof months as their parents change jobs. Here, in Lindsay and Chad, are \nexamples of the heart of this problem--the long-term uninsured children \nof the working poor.\n  How did Scarlett and Richard make due without health insurance for \ntheir kids? They scrounged what services they could from community \nhealth clinics and they used emergency rooms in ways that, when \nmultiplied by all those who act similarly, damage and drain our entire \nhealth care system. They also restricted the activities of their \nchildren--and recent studies indicate this is a common coping strategy \nfor parents in their shoes--cracking down on sports and even bike \nriding to try to avoid injuries. When Chad became ill as a toddler, \nwith recurring ear infections, the family had to rotate payments to \ntheir creditors--some months skipping a utility bill, some months \ncutting back on groceries--just to be able to afford the prescription \nmedicines for their little boy.\n  Even with all of these ways of dealing with their situation, the \nBrandts lived every day under a cloud of fear about their children's \nhealth and their family's future and Lindsay and Chad lived with unmet \nhealth care needs--for physician care, for vision care, and for dental \ncare.\n  In 1993 the Brandt family got help from the programs operated by \nWestern Pennsylvania's Caring Foundation for Children. It turned out \nthat this assistance proved even more necessary than they knew at the \ntime.\n  In April 1996, Lindsay Brandt was diagnosed with hemiplegic \nmigraines. This condition causes stroke-like symptoms. When an incident \noccurs, Lindsay suffers paralysis on the side of her body opposite from \nthe headache, her speech slurs, her vision is blurred, and she becomes \nconfused. Although she has needed five ambulance trips to the hospital \nsince developing this condition, Lindsay is now on medication to \nprevent further episodes.\n  Obviously, all of this care has been expensive. Obviously, the sort \nof problem the Brandts feared in their uninsured years came to pass. It \nmight well have destroyed this family had it happened before they got \nhealth insurance coverage for their kids. Thank God, it did not.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is a measured response to this \nmajor problem. We must react with both compassion and consideration.\n  Here is my proposal:\n  A 5-year pilot program funded with discretionary dollars--rather than \na permanent entitlement--to provide block grants to the States in \nsupport of health insurance for uninsured children who are not eligible \nfor Medicaid or for employer-based private health insurance and whose \nfamilies have incomes up to 235 percent of the poverty level, $37,718 \nfor a family of four.\n  States which are already providing health insurance coverage to \nchildren eligible under this bill, such as under their own Medicaid \nplans, would be required to maintain their efforts but would, in \neffect, receive credit from the Federal Government in the form of \ndollars equal to the costs of the coverage they are providing to \nchildren in families up to the bill's cutoff level of 235 percent of \npoverty.\n  My bill would offer full vouchers, with the level determined by the \nSecretary of HHS based on costs for an insurance policy covering \npreventive, primary, and acute care services for a child, for families \nearning up to approximately $29,700 per year for a family of four and \npartial subsidies from that income level until phased out at \napproximately $38,000 for a family of four.\n  By limiting eligibility to children who do not have access to \nemployer-based private health insurance, we avoid creating a \ndisincentive to private coverage. We should all applaud the employers \nwho are covering their employees, including lower wage employees, with \nfamily health insurance. Indeed, there are approximately 10 million \nAmerican children in families earning between the poverty line and 235 \npercent of poverty who do receive private health insurance coverage, \ncompared to the 4 million who do not. This is another example of the \noverall effectiveness of our market-based health care system even as it \nis also the most striking example of a particular case of market \nfailure.\n  By making this a 5-year pilot program, we admit the complexity of the \nhealth care system and the task of health care reform. This approach,\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nwith block grants and vouchers, may well prove to be the best way to \ncover kids who need health insurance, but we all know about the \nunintended consequences of social policy initiatives and we all know \nhow hard it is to reform an entitlement, even if it has truly perverse \neffects, and so I am proposing a 5-year demonstration of this approach \nin the appropriately humble spirit of ``trial and correction'' which I \nhave many times before said on this floor should inform our entire \nproject of health reform.\n  By making this program subject to appropriations, we ensure that we \nundertake this important effort in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  Specifically, to provide sufficient funds to properly test this \napproach to children's health coverage in a way that does not bust the \nbudget, my bill establishes the ``Healthy Kids Trust Fund,'' on budget, \nfunded through the sale of available broadcast and nonbroadcast \nspectrum assets. I am not wedded to this offset but offer it to make \nclear my intention to see this program paid for with hard dollars, not \nconfederate money.\n\n  Furthermore, my proposal provides that:\n  The first year of the program, fiscal year 1998, would be devoted to \nHHS and State planning, with the new insurance coverage commencing on \nor about October 1, 1998.\n  Coverage would be phased in, beginning with children 0-5 years old in \nfiscal year 1999 and expanding in subsequent years to cover children 6-\n9, 10-12, and 13-17.\n  In the 104th Congress, I was pleased to cosponsor the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, better known as \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028). There is no question that \nKassebaum-Kennedy made significant steps forward in addressing \ntroubling issues in health care. The bill's incremental approach to \nhealth care reform is what allowed it to generate consensus support in \nthe Senate; we knew that it did not address every single problem in the \nhealth care delivery system, but it would make life better for millions \nof American men, women, and children.\n  In retrospect, I urge my colleagues to note a most important fact--\nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was enacted only after some Democrats \nabandoned their hopes for passing a nationalized, big government health \ncare scheme, and some Republicans abandoned their position that access \nto health care is really not a major problem in the United States \ndemanding Federal action.\n  Although we succeeded in enacting incremental insurance market \nreforms, there is still much we need to do to improve our health care \nsystem. Additional reforms must be enacted if we are serious about our \ncommitment to meet the needs of the American people. I am hopeful that \nmy colleagues understand how important it is to our constituents that \nwe continue to reform the health care system. Just look at the Brandt \nchildren and multiply their need by millions. Looking back at our \nsuccess with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, I am equally hopeful that my \ncolleagues have come to realize that if we are to continue to be \nsuccessful in meeting our constituents' needs, the solutions to our \nNation's health care problems must come from the political center, not \nfrom the extremes.\n  Mr. President, I hope the legislation I am introducing today can be \nthe basis for taking this next, crucial step in our process of \nbipartisan, incremental health reform. My proposal seeks to achieve \nincremental expansion of health care through a conservative means--a \nfully funded program with carefully crafted eligibility rules for a \nlimited period of time, a program based on State administration and \npersonal choice and responsibility. Let us take this step. Let us make \nthis test. Let us see to it that the anguish and Russian roulette \nendured by all those situated similarly to the Brandt family are \nstopped and millions more of our Nation's greatest assets are given a \nbasic ingredient for decent and productive lives.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on the additional \ntime which I sought independent of Senator Domenici's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 10 seconds \nremaining. The Senator from New Mexico has 39 minutes remaining in \nregard to the previous order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2223-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2225-S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MAMMOGRAMS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the final subject I wish to address \nbriefly involves the problem of mammograms for women age 40 to 49.\n  Mr. President, this subject came into sharp focus when a National \nInstitutes of Health panel on January 23 issued a report that \nmammograms were not warranted for women in the 40 to 49 category. That \nwas immediately met with very widespread criticism, including criticism \nfrom Dr. Richard Klausner, the Director of the National Cancer \nInstitute, who said that he was shocked by that conclusion. As the \nfacts later developed, a press release was inadvertently disclosed. \nSome of the members of the panel had held that mammograms were not \nwarranted. But, as I understand it, that had not been thoroughly \nanalyzed and agreed upon by the panel. But once this press release came \nout they stood by the release. And there has been enormous confusion in \nAmerica on this issue of women 40 to 49.\n  The subcommittee, which I chair and which has jurisdiction over the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, had a hearing on February 5 at \nwhich Dr. Klausner restated his shock about the matter. He thought that \nthe advantages of mammograms for women 40 to 49 had not been \nappropriately emphasized, and the disadvantages had been emphasized too \nheavily. He also said that he was going to await a meeting of the \nNational Cancer Institute later in February--on February 24 and 25. It \nwas my understanding that the matter would be resolved at that time. \nBut, in fact, it was not.\n  When the Secretary of Health and Human Services testified before our \nsubcommittee on March 4 she said that there would be a 2-month delay, \nwhich I said in those hearings was unacceptable. I have since pressed \nDr. Klausner as to why there would be such a delay.\n  I wrote to him on March 5, 1997. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of that letter be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I was dissatisfied with his \nresponse, I wrote to Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, the overall supervisor, on March 6, 1997 asking \nthat there be some acceleration of this determination because no \nfurther tests were necessary but only a judgment was needed. What I \nfound was that the matter was being referred to a 7-person subcommittee \nwhich was going to deliberate on the issue and then take it up by an \n18-person full committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Dr. Varmus and a subsequent \nletter to Dr. Klausner be included in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am concerned that the delays in mammograms could \nconstitute a health hazard for women 40 to 49. And, beyond that, that \nthere is much confusion in America on that subject. The upshot of it \nhas been that there now appears that the subcommittee will render its \nreport to the full committee on this Friday, and there will be a final \nreport rendered next Tuesday which will eliminate the need for \naccelerated hearings in our subcommittee to try to come to a conclusion \non this important matter.\n  I emphasize that I appreciate the need for an independent medical \njudgment on this important subject.\n  It seems to me that where all the tests have been performed and it is \na matter of issuing guidelines, coming to closure and judgment on this \nshould not require such a lengthy period of time. I believe that there \nis not a sufficient sense of urgency generally, and in Government \nspecifically, as this issue has been addressed. My views are expressed \nmore fully in these letters, and I shall not take a greater period of \ntime to elaborate upon them here.\n  In coming to my own judgment that mammograms are warranted for women \n40 to 49, the subcommittee held hearings in Pittsburgh, in Hershey, and \nin Philadelphia, where we heard from a long array of witnesses. A \nreport has\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\nbeen prepared by my able staff member, Betty Lou Taylor, and also by \nCraig Higgins. I ask unanimous consent that this statement be printed \nin the Record following my oral statement. It sets forth the findings \nof prominent doctors in Pennsylvania and quite a number of women in the \n40-to-49 category who give firsthand testimony about the importance of \nmammograms for them and the importance of mammograms generally for \nwomen in the 40-to-49 category.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is my hope, Mr. President, that we will have a \ndefinitive statement, as I say, next Tuesday. We need the definitive \nstatement so that we come to closure on the issue, and then it is a \nmatter for scientists acting on their independent judgment. It is my \nhope and expectation that the abundance of scientific tests which are \nalready available will show that mammograms are important for women 40 \nto 49.\n  When I talk about medical tests, I speak from some personal \nexperience, having had an MRI which disclosed a very serious problem. \nOn these medical examinations, the earlier the better, so I hope we \nmove ahead as promptly as we can.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.\n     Richard D. Klausner, M.D.,\n     Director, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Doctor Klausner: I was very distressed to hear \n     Secretary Shalala's testimony yesterday that there will be \n     another two-month delay on having the National Cancer \n     Institute reach a conclusion on whether mammograms are \n     warranted for women aged 40 to 49.\n       As disclosed in our previous hearing, the NIH consensus \n     development conference panel press statement of January 23, \n     1997, was probably inadvertently released. That resulted in a \n     lot of anxiety for women in the 40 to 49 age category and \n     beyond. When you testified before the Subcommittee on \n     February 5, 1997, the expectation was that the matter would \n     be resolved by further NCI proceedings on February 25, 1997. \n     Now we hear that there will not be a definitive statement \n     until early May.\n       During the intervening 60 days, thousands of women in the \n     40 to 49 age category might be screened which could result in \n     the saving of many lives.\n       I would appreciate your immediate response as to why the \n     National Cancer Institute cannot make a prompt decision, or \n     in the alternative, give our Subcommittee an earlier date.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.\n     Dr. Harold Varmus,\n     Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Doctor Varmus: With this letter, I am sending you a \n     copy of a letter I sent to Dr. Klausner yesterday.\n       Earlier today Dr. Klausner and I had a conversation which I \n     considered totally unsatisfactory. Dr. Klausner had set a \n     time limit of 60 days for the subcommittee to report back to \n     him; and when I said I thought that was unreasonably long, he \n     said they would do it as soon as possible. When I asked him \n     how long that would be, he said he didn't know and referred \n     me to Dr. Barbara Rimer.\n       When my Chief of Staff, Craig Snyder, called Dr. Rimer, she \n     advised that 60 days was the outside period with the hope \n     that her subcommittee could act more promptly. Dr. Rimer then \n     outlined a procedure where she had drafted a proposed \n     statement for her subcommittee of 7 members which was \n     circulated today with the response time a week from today. \n     After that, Dr. Rimer expected to have a conference call \n     among 18 members of the full committee to resolve the issue \n     with the hope that all of that could be concluded within 10 \n     days.\n       In my opinion, this is an extraordinarily unwieldy \n     procedure and judgments could really be made at the National \n     Cancer Institute since no additional research is necessary.\n       If the procedure outlined by Dr. Rimer is followed, I urge \n     you to escalate the pace by having the comments of the 7 \n     subcommittee members returnable next Monday with the \n     conference call of the full 18 members of the National Cancer \n     Advisory Board to be completed promptly thereafter so that \n     the final comments can be completed by the end of next week.\n       Again, in my opinion, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, NIH and NCI do not have an appropriate sense of \n     urgency on this matter. I do not have to tell you how many \n     lives could be saved with prompt screening of women 40 to 49 \n     without the kind of delay occasioned since the first release \n     of January 23.\n       I would appreciate your immediate response on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1997.\n     Richard D. Klausner, M.D.,\n     Director, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Doctor Klausner: I had asked my staff yesterday to set \n     the hearing for the National Institutes of Health including \n     the National Cancer Institute for March 18 because of my \n     concern about the prospective 60-day delay on the issue of \n     mammograms for women 40 to 49.\n       When I heard you were going to be out of the country from \n     March 14 to March 21, I sought to schedule the hearing for \n     this week, on March 13, because the Senate will be out of \n     session from March 24 through April 6 and I did not want to \n     wait so long on this mammogram issue.\n       I have since been advised that the NIH subcommittee will \n     circulate its decision to the full committee this Friday and \n     the full NIH committee will act on March 18. While I really \n     believe there has been too much delay up to now on the \n     resolution of this issue, at this point I suppose that's \n     about as expeditious a decision as can be made.\n       As I think you understand, my point all along has been that \n     the matter ought to be resolved one way or another. I \n     appreciate and understand the importance of independent \n     medical judgment but the time delays for the NIH subcommittee \n     and full committee frankly puzzle me. When you had expressed \n     your own ``shock'' on the NIH panel finding back on January \n     23, and the bulk of the evidence supports mammograms for \n     women 40 to 49, I had thought the matter to be pretty much \n     resolved since there were no further tests to be conducted \n     but only a judgment to be made. It was my thinking that 60 \n     more days from the testimony of Secretary Shalala on March 4 \n     was unacceptable.\n       In any event we will await the final guidelines on March 18 \n     and we will defer the NIH/NCI hearing until April at which \n     time we will take up the procedures which you have employed \n     on the issue as well as the other substantive matters \n     affecting the National Institutes of Health including the \n     National Cancer Institute.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n       Mr. President, in recent weeks, I have been holding \n     hearings here in Washington and around my home state of \n     Pennsylvania on the recommendation made on January 23, 1997 \n     by the NIH Consensus Development Conference Concerning Breast \n     Cancer Screening for Women Between the Ages of 40 and 49. The \n     panel concluded, ``that the available data did not warrant a \n     single recommendation for mammography for all women in their \n     forties.'' Instead, the panel reiterated the 1993 \n     recommendations of the NCI that each women between the ages \n     of 40 and 49 should decide for herself whether to undergo \n     mammography.\n       On January 23, 1997 after the press release was issued by \n     the Consensus Panel, Dr. Richard Klausner stated that his own \n     reading of the studies and information presented to the \n     conference, in contrast to past years, was that we now have \n     available more convincing evidence. The evidence is primarily \n     from Swedish population screening studies that there is a \n     statistically significant benefit in terms of reduced death \n     from breast cancer for women who begin screening in their \n     forties. Women in that age group who decide to begin \n     screening should be aware of the increased evidence of \n     benefit and of any potential risk. A women's decision to be \n     screened or not screened should be made on the basis of \n     knowledge.\n       Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death \n     in American women and according to the American Cancer \n     Society, nearly 44,000 women will die from the disease this \n     year, and 10,000 of these women will be in their forties, \n     making breast cancer the number one cause of death in this \n     age group. It seems to me that those numbers alone should \n     signal an alarm that women in this age bracket are at great \n     risk. And while mammography is not perfect, it is the best \n     tool currently available.\n\n\n                    FEBRUARY 5, 1997, WASHINGTON, DC\n\n       On February 5, 1997, at a hearing here in Washington, I \n     discussed this issue with a panel of distinguished \n     scientists, including Dr. Richard Klausner, the Director of \n     the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Susan J. Blumenthal, \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health, Dr. David \n     Hoel, a Member of the NIH Consensus Development Conference, \n     Dr. Marilyn Leitch, Associate Professor of Surgery at the \n     University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, \n     Texas, and Dr. Barbara Monsees, Associate Professor of \n     Radiology and Chief of the Breast Imaging Section of the \n     Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington School of \n     Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri.\n       Dr. Klausner expressed concern that the balance and tone of \n     the Panel's draft report overly minimized the benefits and \n     overly emphasized the risks for women in their 40s. Dr. \n     Klausner also stated the National Cancer Advisory Board would \n     discuss the screening issue at their next meeting. That \n     meeting took place on February 25, and resulted in the \n     formation of a special subcommittee to\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\n     develop clear recommendations to the NCI on screening \n     mammography. Dr. Klausner told the subcommittee that the \n     Board intends to complete the process in two months.\n       Dr. Blumenthal discussed the Department's efforts to \n     improve breast cancer detection and diagnosis to ensure that \n     today's mammography techniques are of the highest quality. \n     She also stated that breast cancer is perhaps the most \n     dreaded and feared disease in women and that it has become an \n     epidemic in our country: the number of women affected by this \n     disease has increased from 1 in 20 over a time in the 1950s \n     to 1 in 8 today.\n       Dr. Blumenthal spoke of the new frontiers in breast imaging \n     such as ultrasound, digital mammography, breast MRI and \n     Positron Emission Tomography as ways to improve early breast \n     cancer detection. She also described the ``Missiles to \n     Mammograms'' initiative to adapt advanced defense, space, and \n     intelligence imaging technologies from the DOD, CIA and NASA, \n     to more accurately detect breast cancer.\n       Next, the Subcommittee heard testimony from David G. Hoel, \n     Ph.D., who is Professor and Chairman of the Department of \n     Biometry and Epidemiology at the Medical University of South \n     Carolina. Dr. Hoel, who is a member of the NIH Consensus \n     Panel briefly outlined the process by which the Panel \n     reviewed available research on the subject and derived its \n     conclusions. Dr. Hoel also detailed the specific questions \n     the panel was charged with answering and further noted that \n     the Panel was restricted to providing answers to specific \n     questions. The Panel is currently involved in completing its \n     work and stated that the Panel's final conclusions would \n     accurately represent the consensus view of its members.\n       We then heard from a panel of expert witnesses representing \n     the American Cancer Society, the Breast Cancer Foundation, \n     and the National Breast Cancer Coalition.\n       Speaking on behalf of the American Cancer Society was \n     Marilyn Leitch, M.D., who is Associate Professor of Surgery \n     at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at \n     Dallas. She reaffirmed the American Cancer Society's position \n     that the conclusions reached by the Consensus Panel are at \n     variance with the data presented by both European and U.S. \n     scientists, and therefore did not offer women and their \n     physicians the best guidance possible. She noted that the \n     National Cancer Institute and eleven other organizations in \n     1989 concluded that women in their forties should have \n     regular mammograms. That position was reaffirmed in 1992 \n     after a subsequent review of the scientific evidence.\n       In 1993, however, NCI withdrew its recommendation on the \n     grounds that randomized clinical trials had not shown a \n     statistically significant reduction in mortality among women \n     under age 50. Since that time, however, two Swedish studies \n     and a statistical compilation of eight clinical studies have \n     been released showing solid epidemiological and clinical \n     evidence that routine screening is effective in reducing \n     breast cancer mortality. The Swedish studies showed \n     statistically significant reductions in mortality of 36 \n     percent and 44 percent, respectively, for groups invited to \n     be screened.\n       Dr. Leitch conveyed the American Cancer Society's \n     disappointment that the Consensus Panel placed undue emphasis \n     on two issues: the risk of radiation-induced cancer and the \n     issue of false positives and false negatives. She noted that \n     the Society currently recommend that women in their forties \n     be screened every one to two years. Later this month, the \n     Society will convene its own expert panel, however, to \n     determine if, based on new evidence, the mortality benefit \n     might be even greater if women are screened annually.\n       The Subcommittee then heard from Ms. Susan Braun and Ms. \n     Diane Rowden, both representing the Susan G. Komen Breast \n     Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports \n     research on breast cancer.\n       Ms. Braun noted that when breast cancer is found in its \n     earliest stages, the likelihood of 5-year survival is over 95 \n     percent, but when found after it has metastasized, that \n     survival rate drops precipitously--to 20 percent. Clearly, \n     early detection is a key to longevity. And while she points \n     out that mammography is far from a perfect tool, it has \n     proven to save lives. Ms. Braum contends that the benefits of \n     early screening outweigh the risks, and that is why the Komen \n     Foundation guidelines recommend screening every one to two \n     years, beginning at age 40. Ms. Rowden reaffirmed that \n     position. She cited data estimating that in 1996, women in \n     their forties would account for 18.1 percent of newly \n     diagnosed invasive breast cancers, compared with 16.8 percent \n     for women in their fifties.\n       We next heard from Frances M. Visco, Esquire, the first \n     President of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and a \n     member of its Board of Directors. Ms. Visco told the \n     Subcommittee that her breast cancer was diagnosed through a \n     mammogram when she was 39 years old. She stated that we \n     cannot act as though the issue whether to recommend screening \n     for women age 40 to 49 is the most important question \n     surrounding breast cancer and that our outrage should be \n     saved for the fact that we do not know how to prevent the \n     disease, how to cure it, how to detect it at an early stage, \n     or what to do for a women once we do find it.\n       Ms. Visco went on to ask what is the goal? A simple message \n     that is less confusing? She stated that in this situation, \n     the simple message is wrong. She further stated that we want \n     mammography to work for all women. It does not. We want to \n     reduce breast cancer to a sound byte. It cannot be. We should \n     be devoting our resources to designing mechanisms to get the \n     message out to women; to get them to understand the risks, \n     the benefits, the pros, the cons, so they can make their own \n     decision.\n       Ms. Visco also told the Subcommittee in her view $590 \n     million should be devoted at the NIH to research on breast \n     cancer and $150 should be spent for research purposes at the \n     Department of Defense.\n       Ms. Visco concluded that women cannot continue to be given \n     false hope. If women in their 40s are told to get a mammogram \n     every year, we are saying ignorance is bliss. What we need to \n     tell them is that there are pros and cons, there are risks \n     and benefits. That is the information they need to get. Then \n     let them decide the course of their own care.\n       Our last witness was Barbara Monsees, M.D., who is Chief of \n     the Breast Imaging Section at Mallinckrodt Institute of \n     Radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in \n     St. Louis. She shared her unique perspectives as both a \n     medical professional and as a woman who survived early breast \n     cancer detected by a mammogram.\n       Dr. Monsees confirmed the fact that there appears to be \n     clear scientific evidence that early screening can \n     substantially reduce the death rate from breast cancer. She, \n     too, cited the findings from five major population-based \n     screening programs in Sweden. Two of the trials showed \n     mortality reductions of 44 percent and 35 percent, \n     respectively, while an overview study of all five indicated a \n     23 percent mortality reduction.\n       Unfortunately, according to Dr. Monsees, the NIH Consensus \n     Panel chose to ignore this most recent data, resulting in \n     ``an unbalanced presentation of the facts . . .'' Dr. Monsees \n     raised some provocative questions, such as ``Could this issue \n     have taxed the NIH consensus development model beyond its \n     intended purpose?'' And ``Were the panelists given adequate \n     time, information and instruction regarding the rules of \n     evidence in order to formulate their report?'' In conclusion, \n     she voiced hope that the National Cancer Advisory Board will \n     re-examine all the evidence in an unbiased fashion, and \n     conclude that screening women in their forties does save \n     lives.\n\n\n             FEBRUARY 20, 1997, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n       On February 20th, 1997, I reconvened the Subcommittee for \n     our hearing in Philadelphia.\n       I opened the hearing with a report on a promising \n     opportunity I learned of last year, whereby certain defense \n     imaging technology may prove useful in more accurately \n     detecting breast cancer in its early stages. I saw to it that \n     this project received the necessary funding, and I look \n     forward to seeing the results.\n       Once again, we heard from a very distinguished group of \n     witnesses, led off by Dina F. Caroline, M.D., Chief of the \n     Division of Gastrointestinal Radiology and Mammography at \n     Temple University Hospital.\n       Dr. Caroline began by tracing the history of mammographic \n     screening for women in their forties, beginning in 1977, when \n     the National Cancer Institute and the American College of \n     Surgeons recommended it for women with first degree relatives \n     with breast cancer. Where the controversy came to a head was \n     in 1993, when NCI reversed its stance, stating that experts \n     do not agree on the value of routine screening for women in \n     their forties.\n       In subsequent testimony, Dr. Caroline noted the concerns of \n     the NIH Consensus Panel with respect to false positive \n     results. But as she points out, until technology improves, we \n     must expect false positive readings simply because the whole \n     purpose of screening is not to miss any opportunity to \n     identify breast cancer. False negatives are also a problem. \n     But with new techniques in development, hopefully these will \n     begin to diminish in number.\n       In conclusion, Dr. Caroline finds the available data \n     sufficient enough to advocate screening for women in their \n     forties.\n       Our next witness was Stephen Feig, M.D., Director of Breast \n     Imaging and Professor of Radiology at Jefferson Medical \n     College. Like other witnesses, Dr. Feig cited the latest \n     clinical studies which found that current mammographic \n     techniques should be able to reduce breast cancer deaths by \n     at least 40 percent. He went on to point out that 20 percent \n     of all breast cancer deaths and 33 percent of all years of \n     life expectancy lost to breast cancer are due to cancer found \n     in women in their forties. Not to advise screening in this \n     age group, he contends, is unconscionable.\n       The Subcommittee then heard from Daniel C. Sullivan, M.D., \n     the Chief of Breast Imaging at the Hospital of the University \n     of Pennsylvania, and a member of the NIH Consensus Panel. Dr. \n     Sullivan was careful to point out that the Panel's statement \n     that has raised so much controversy is only a draft version. \n     More importantly perhaps, Dr. Sullivan advocates annual \n     mammography for women in their forties and emphasized his \n     hope that the Panel's final statement will reflect that \n     position. He went on to underscore the need for more \n     research, as well as improved access to mammography through \n     more consistent insurance coverage.\n       Bonita Falkner, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and \n     Pediatrics at the MCP Hahnemann School of Medicine at the \n     Allegheny University of the Health Sciences and Acting \n     Director of the Institute for Women's Health\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n     noted in her testimony that the controversy over the \n     scientific merit of mammography in younger women should not \n     confuse the facts for women 50 and above. She also stated \n     that all women in their 40s should have access to a \n     physicians counseling on mammography, and she found it \n     particularly troubling that the Panel's failure to endorse \n     screening has the potential to lead to a failure on the part \n     of insurers to pay for the procedure. Dr. Falkner stated with \n     the increased mortality rate among minority and disadvantaged \n     women, particular efforts must be made to provide access to \n     physician counseling and breast screening for these women at \n     all ages.\n       The Committee then heard from Robert C. Young, M.D. Dr. \n     Young is the President of the Fox Chase Cancer Center and in \n     his testimony, Dr. Young maintains that for women under age \n     40, without other risk factors, the risk of breast cancer is \n     quite low and there is no convincing argument for mammography \n     screening at all. Where the gray zone occurs, he notes, is in \n     women between the ages of 40 and 50, where there is generally \n     a lower incidence of breast cancer, difficulty in detecting \n     the disease, and differences in the biology of the tumors \n     themselves. Because of these complications, small or short-\n     term studies fail to yield clear results. In order to arrive \n     at more definitive results, larger, long-term trials are \n     required. And as he points out, trials such as those done in \n     Sweden have shown small but definite improvement in survival \n     rates.\n       Moreover, Dr. Young made an important point in his \n     testimony: That guidelines are just that--guidelines. And in \n     the case of mammography screening for women in their forties, \n     even though the benefit may be small, the risk is minuscule. \n     He contends that ultimately the solutions will be found \n     through research that addresses the more fundamental \n     questions and leads to new ways to prevent or eliminate this \n     horrible disease.\n       The next witness to appear before the Subcommittee was Ms. \n     Barbara De Luca, the Executive Director of the Linda Creed \n     Breast Cancer Foundation. Ms. De Luca highlighted the \n     Consensus Panel's conclusion that there is no clear \n     indication that yearly mammograms for women in their forties \n     save lives. She contends that the Panel's conclusion was \n     based on economic reasons, that mammograms cost money. She \n     went on to report on a small sampling of her Foundation's \n     members. The women she surveyed were diagnosed with breast \n     cancer in their forties. While mammograms had failed to \n     discover their cancer, each of those surveyed felt strongly \n     that women in their forties, nevertheless, should be \n     encouraged to undergo screening every year.\n       Ms. De Luca reported that a mammogram done seven years ago \n     had failed to identify her breast cancer, but that since that \n     time new modes of detection have been developed, including \n     the MRI and digital mammography. She recommended that tools \n     like MRI should be made more accessible and less expensive. \n     She urged more research be directed to finding a blood \n     test or other methods to turn off cancer cells and arrest \n     the disease. This, coupled with early detection, can mean \n     finding an effective cure for breast cancer.\n       Ms. Lu Ann Cahn, a reporter for WCAU-TV testified that her \n     experience was similar to Ms. De Luca, in that her mammogram \n     failed to detect the cancer. And also like Ms. De Luca, she \n     was appalled by the Consensus Panel's failure to recommend \n     annual mammograms for women in their forties. She noted that \n     this year 6,000 women in their forties will die of breast \n     cancer, while the NIH is relaying a confused message that \n     many women will take to mean they need not worry.\n       In a very compelling fashion, Ms. Cahn concludes that the \n     recommendation of the consensus panel has given every woman \n     who wants to avoid mammograms an excuse to do so.\n       The Subcommittee once again heard from Ms. Frances M. \n     Visco, Esq., the President of the National Breast Cancer \n     Coalition and a breast cancer survivor. Ms. Visco spoke out \n     in support of the consensus panel's findings. But more \n     importantly she urged that we devote our resources to \n     empowering women to understand the available information and \n     discuss it with their physician. She issued a call to arms of \n     sorts, urging us to focus more of our resources and energy on \n     convincing more women in their fifties to be screened and to \n     support a greater investment in research to find a cure, \n     effective treatment, and more accurate ways to detect breast \n     cancer. And she called for a greater commitment to \n     guaranteeing access to quality health care for all women and \n     their families.\n       Ms. Visco once again told the Committee, as she did in \n     Washington, DC on February 5, 1997, that the National Breast \n     Cancer Coalition is recommending $590 million in research \n     dollars at the NIH and $150 million for the Department of \n     Defense Breast Cancer Research Program. Ms. Visco stated that \n     these figures were based on the percentage of proposals that \n     are scientifically valid, but are not funded because of the \n     lack of resources.\n       We then heard from Barbara Mallory, M.S.N., R.N., who \n     represented the Nurses of Pennsylvania, an advocacy group for \n     nurses and patients. Her contention is that every health \n     professional she knows suspects that far too much \n     consideration was given to the financial rather than the \n     human costs associated with mammograms.\n       Her organization has been very active in this field, \n     drafting legislation ending so-called drive-through \n     mastectomies. In her position as a nurse she has encountered \n     many women, some as young as 33, who have had breast cancer \n     diagnosed as a result of self-examinations and mammograms.\n       Ms. Mallory went on to cite statistics about Ductal \n     Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), where, since the mid-1980s, there \n     has been a 200 percent increase in the number of lesions \n     detected by mammography. About one-half of these lesions have \n     been found in women under age 50. Up to 25 percent will lead \n     to invasive cancers. While mammography techniques need to be \n     improved, she argues that ambiguous messages and too much \n     attention to the financial bottom-line do a great disservice \n     to the women of this Country.\n       Our last witness for the day was Lawrence Robinson, M.D., \n     M.P.H., the Deputy Commissioner of the Philadelphia \n     Department of Public Health.\n       Dr. Robinson told of his strong support for mammography \n     screening for women between the ages of 40-49 and stressed \n     this particularly for African American and Hispanic women. \n     Dr. Robinson reported on a study done at a health event \n     sponsored by the Philadelphia Health Department, the \n     Pennsylvania National Guard and the Fox Chase Cancer Center \n     where a mobile mammography unit performed 43 mammograms. Many \n     of the women screened were under 50. The screening found 6 \n     abnormal readings or 15% of those screened. This result \n     points out the need to do screening particularly in \n     underserved areas.\n\n\n              FEBRUARY 24, 1997, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n       The third in a series of special hearings was convened on \n     February 24th in Pittsburgh. I opened the hearing by telling \n     the witnesses that the more I hear about this subject, the \n     stronger I feel that the National Cancer Institute should \n     take whatever steps are necessary to resolve this issue in \n     favor of recommending regular mammograms for women in their \n     forties.\n       At this hearing, we heard from two panels of distinguished \n     witnesses, led off by Thomas S. Chang, M.D., who is Assistant \n     Professor of Radiology at the University of Pittsburgh School \n     of Medicine and staff radiologist at Magee-Women's Hospital.\n\n       Dr. Chang specializes in women's imaging, with a \n     significant portion of his practice devoted to breast \n     imaging. As an expert in this field, he reported being \n     disappointed by the Consensus Panel's inconclusiveness on \n     this issue, noting that the Panel did nothing to clear the \n     confusion that now exists. While the panel may have concluded \n     that insurers should pay for mammograms for women who want \n     one, he is concerned that companies will interpret the \n     Panel's overall conclusions as not requiring them to \n     reimburse the cost of this procedure. In short, many women--\n     especially those who are economically disadvantaged--will \n     have their minds made up for them as a result of financial \n     constraints.\n       Dr. Chang went on to report that breast cancer is far more \n     common in women in their forties than some have implied. In \n     1996, in fact, there were more breast cancers diagnosed in \n     women in their forties (33,400) than women in their \n     fifties (30,900).\n       Dr. Chang is convinced that mammography saves lives and is \n     a medically effective screening test for women in their \n     forties. He advises his patients to have regular mammograms \n     once a year, and encouraged the NIH to make the same \n     recommendation.\n       Dr. Howard A. Zaren, Director of the Mercy Breast Center \n     for the Pittsburgh Mercy Health Systems told the Subcommittee \n     that in 1997, 11,000 new cases and 2,700 deaths from breast \n     cancer will occur in Pennsylvania. These figures place \n     Pennsylvania within the top five states for highest incidence \n     and mortality from breast cancer. He further stated that \n     almost 20 percent of all breast cancer deaths, and 34 percent \n     of all years of life expectancy lost, result from cancers \n     that are found among women younger than the age of 50 years.\n       Dr. Zaren also stated that epidemiologic studies show a \n     shift towards diagnosing breast cancer at earlier stages in \n     women 40-49, and this is regarded as indirect evidence of a \n     possible benefit from screening these women. He also cited \n     the statistics of Dr. Stephen A. Feig, from Thomas Jefferson \n     University, who had testified before the Subcommittee in \n     Pittsburgh, that a mortality reduction of up to 35 percent \n     can be expected if annual screening mammograms are performed \n     in the 40-49 age group with current mammographic techniques \n     and two-views per breast.\n       Our next witness was Dr. Victor G. Vogel, Professor of \n     Medicine and Epidemiology and Director of the Comprehensive \n     Breast Cancer Program at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer \n     Institute and Magee-Women's Hospital. Dr. Vogel told the \n     committee that mammographic screening holds the promise of \n     early detection of breast cancer in a curable stage. He also \n     commented on the eight randomized studies on which the \n     consensus panel based their recommendation. He stated that \n     the studies show unequivocally that for women ages 50 to 59 \n     years, mammography reduced the chance of dying from breast \n     cancer by approximately 30 percent. However, only one study \n     was designed specifically to investigate screening in women \n     40 to 49 and that study was seriously flawed. However, meta-\n     analysis from screening studies demonstrates a 24% reduction \n     in breast cancer mortality attributed to screening when women \n     in their 40s are compared with women of the same age who are \n     not screened.\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n       Dr. Vogel also cited some very interesting statistics \n     stating that in Pennsylvania there are nearly 1 million women \n     between the ages of 40 and 49, and nearly 2,000 will be \n     diagnosed with breast cancer this year. Tragically, as many \n     as 1,000 of these women may die. In his opinion, that number \n     could be reduced by approximately 250 deaths if women between \n     the ages of 40 and 49 were screened annually with \n     mammography.\n       Our next witnesses was D. Lawrence Wickerham, M.D. \n     Associate Chairman and Director of Operations for the \n     National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. Dr. \n     Wickerham stated that his greatest concern is that the \n     consensus statement not be used by insurance carriers as a \n     reason to deny coverage for mammograms. He further stated \n     that he did not disagree with the consensus statement which \n     directs women to decide for themselves whether to undergo \n     mammography. He felt that in order to make an informed \n     choice, women and their health care providers need to have \n     the best possible educational materials to aid them in these \n     decisions. He felt that there is likely to be a sliding scale \n     of benefit for women in their 40's and that potential \n     benefits can be assessed by a woman in consultation with her \n     health care provider and based on her individual \n     circumstances.\n       Diane F. Clayton testified she is a breast cancer survivor \n     mainly due to early detection. The ductile carcinoma in-situ \n     was found during a routine mammogram--she was 46 years old.\n       Ms. Clayton questions the NIH consensus panel's motives. \n     Was it money driving their direction? Was it ignorance? Was \n     it politics? Who could be against preserving extending the \n     lives of mom, sis, Aunt Mary and grandma? Her hope was the \n     recommendation was an honest effort that just went bad. She \n     felt that if it was a mistake then we should admit it and go \n     forward by doing the right thing; advice and counsel women in \n     their forties to have routine mammograms.\n       The Subcommittee then heard from Ms. Judy Pottgen, a 47 \n     year old woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer when she \n     was 43. Ms. Pottgen found her breast cancer by self breast \n     exam. She is passionate about educating women about self \n     breast exam. She described a program called ``check it out'', \n     a Pittsburgh program sponsored by the American Cancer \n     Society, Hadassah, and the Allegheny County Board of Health. \n     The program teaches junior and senior high school girls the \n     proper way to do self breast exam.\n       Ms. Pottgen summed up her testimony by telling the \n     Subcommittee that preventive medicine is a lot cheaper than \n     therapeutic medicine and that a mammogram is a lot cheaper \n     than major surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. \n     She cited the NIH recommendation, many years ago, that yearly \n     Pap smears were unnecessary and wondered how many women \n     missed the opportunity to have their cervical cancer \n     diagnosed at an early stage. She wondered if it would be the \n     same with mammograms, and questioned how many women will lose \n     their breasts or be disfigured or die from this dreaded \n     disease before NIH realizes the tremendous diagnostic benefit \n     of mammograms.\n       The next witness was Ms. Yvonne D. Durham, an African \n     American breast cancer survivor who found her cancer through \n     self breast exam. She was 46 years old. She stated that she \n     was deeply troubled by the Consensus Panel's decision not to \n     recommend regular mammogram screening for women beginning at \n     age 40 and told the Subcommittee that the recommendation \n     sends a confusing message to the public.\n       Ms. Durham cited statistics based on data from 1987, that \n     African American women, age 35-44, had a breast cancer \n     mortality rate 2 times that of white women at the same age. \n     Yet African Americans, as well as Hispanic Americans, have \n     some of the lowest mammogram screening rates in the United \n     States.\n       Ms. Durham concluded her testimony by stating that the \n     benefit of mammography far outweighs any risks associated \n     with this screening test. She also urged continued support \n     for research efforts that may offer a clearer understanding \n     of how breast cancer disease affects minority populations.\n       The last witness of the day was Ms. Laurie S. Moser, the \n     Executive Director of the Pittsburgh Susan G. Komen Breast \n     Cancer Foundation Race for the Cure. Ms. Moser was diagnosed \n     with ductal carcinoma in-situ in 1987 at the age of 40.\n       She stated that the Komen Foundation strongly disagrees \n     with the latest decision from the NIH Consensus Development \n     Conference on Breast Cancer Screening for Women Ages 40-49. \n     She also told the Subcommittee that an estimated 16.5 percent \n     of new breast cancer cases were women in their 40s. The \n     position of the Foundation is that the Panel's position \n     overstated potential risks and understated the benefits of \n     mammography. The fact is that many consumers look to the \n     opinion of a body of experts to interpret data and provide \n     recommendations which they can weigh as they make decisions. \n     The current Panel statement does nothing more than confuse \n     the public about an extremely important issue.\n       Ms. Moser stated that when the Race for the Cure began in \n     Pittsburgh in 1993, a woman died every 11 minutes from breast \n     cancer. Today, a woman dies every 12 minutes. Over 2,000 \n     additional lives are saved each year with early detection. \n     The goal should be to add a minute each year in the hope that \n     more and more women will survive breast cancer.\n       Ms. Moser concluded that she hoped Dr. Klausner and his \n     colleagues at the cancer institute take a closer look at the \n     conference recommendation and see to it that women are given \n     the highest degree of encouragement to get screening earlier, \n     rather than later.\n\n\n                  MARCH 3, 1997, HERSHEY, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n       On March 3, I convened a hearing at the Hershey Medical \n     Center.\n       The Subcommittee's first panel consisted of a distinguished \n     group of physicians from the local medical centers. Our first \n     witness was James F. Evans, M.D., Director, of Surgical \n     Oncology and Assistant director of General Surgery from the \n     Geisinger Clinic.\n       Dr. Evans, expressing his personal opinions, stated that he \n     had studied the clinical trial data and if he were to write \n     his own consensus statement, it would say that the available \n     data specifically does not warrant a single guideline \n     recommendation for women between the ages of 40 and 70 years, \n     namely annual screening. However, guidelines are not \n     recommendations for individual women. He further stated that \n     we would all like to have enough data to make specific \n     recommendations for each individual based on personal \n     profiles and highly specific reliable research data. But that \n     data does not exist. The best data we have comes from trials \n     and that data supports a guideline recommendation for annual \n     screening beginning at age 40. Clinicians and women \n     themselves should then use additional but less reliable data \n     that we have to make decisions for individuals.\n       Our next panelist was Mary Simmonds, M.D., Chief of the \n     Division of Medical Oncology for Pinnacle Health Systems in \n     Harrisburg. Dr. Simmonds stated that she supported the \n     American Cancer Society recommendations that women in their \n     40s should undergo screening mammography every one to two \n     years.\n       Dr. Simmonds also shared with the Committee a copy of \n     Recommendations for a Statewide Plan for the Early Detection \n     of Breast Cancer formulated as a result of deliberations of a \n     Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Awareness Consensus Conference. \n     The recommendations from this conference were that (1) \n     mammography saves lives; (2) women should have a mammogram \n     even if you don't have any symptoms; (3) women should ask \n     their doctor for information about mammography and for access \n     to mammography (4) follow the American Cancer Society \n     guidelines for the frequency of mammography and physical \n     examination of the breast as well as the performance of \n     breast self examination.\n       Testifying on behalf of the Hershey Medical Center was \n     David M. Van Hook M.D., and Assistant Professor of Radiology \n     and Chief of Mammography at the medical center. Dr. Van Hook \n     told the Subcommittee that although an analysis of the \n     combined data from the seven population-based randomized-\n     controlled trials, which included over 170,000 women in their \n     40s, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in \n     reducing mortality from breast cancer, and data from several \n     other studies also support a benefit to women 40-49. But, the \n     problem seems to be that thus far there has been no single \n     randomized-controlled trial which has showed statistically-\n     significant proof of benefit from mammography screening for \n     women ages 40-49. Dr. Van Hook further stated that much more \n     is at stake here than just dollars spent to save lives and \n     that the decisions regarding health care intervention which \n     affects our society should perhaps, involve not only science, \n     but should also take into account the willingness of those \n     most affected by those decisions. To accept some degree of \n     uncertainly, especially when there is controversy or less \n     than scientific proof of benefit. Dr. Van Hook concluded by \n     saying that the beneficiaries of breast cancer screening, \n     those who stand to gain or lose the most from it, our \n     mothers, wives, and daughters are willing to do just that.\n       The Committee then turned to Lois A. Anderson, Co-\n     Facilitator and Founder of A surviving Breast Cancer Support \n     group and Co-Captain of York County Pennsylvania Breast \n     Cancer Coalition. Ms. Anderson expressed her outrage by the \n     NIH Consensus Conference's decision on mammography screening \n     for women 40 to 49.\n       Ms. Anderson described her own experience with breast \n     cancer. She was diagnosed when she was 40 years old. Her \n     mammogram failed to detect the disease and after some \n     suspicious bruising, Ms. Anderson found a lump while doing a \n     self breast exam. A mastectomy was performed one month later \n     and 5 of 11 lymph nodes were found to be cancerous. These \n     findings made her a stage III breast cancer patient with less \n     than a 40 percent chance of surviving 5 years.\n       Ms. Anderson said that the incidence of breast cancer in \n     younger women is increasing and the NIHs decision to NOT \n     recommend mammograms for women below 50 years of age will \n     certainly cause an increase in the death rate from breast \n     cancer.\n       Ms. Anderson presented the Subcommittee with letters from \n     over 226 women under the age of 50 who have been diagnosed \n     with Brest cancer through the use of a mammogram.\n       Ms. Anderson told the Committee that while breast cancer is \n     not perfect, it is the best tool we have for detecting breast \n     cancer early and that deadly confusion over screening \n     mammography will result from the NIH's decision if these \n     guidelines are not changed.\n       Next the Subcommittee heard from Ms. Lorene Knight, a \n     volunteer with the American Cancer Society and a member of \n     the\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n     Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition. Ms. Knight is a 54 year \n     old African American women, and a 7-year breast cancer \n     survivor. Ms. Knight told the Subcommittee that her first \n     mammogram was performed at the age of 36 because of the \n     presence of fibrocystic tissue and a family history of breast \n     cancer. Her sister lost her life to the disease at the age of \n     43 and her mother is a 5 year breast cancer survivor.\n       Ms. Knight stated that she was most disturbed by the \n     findings of the NIH Consensus Development Conference \n     statement and felt that their statement would lure entirely \n     too many women of all races, and in their 40s, into a false \n     sense of security about the odds that breast cancer will not \n     likely happen to them during this decade of their lives.\n       Citing recent statistics from 4 hospitals in Lancaster \n     County, Ms. Knight stated that one hospital, during the 95-96 \n     fiscal year, 105 women underwent breast cancer surgery and \n     nearly 36% of them were under the age of 50. At a second \n     hospital, 21 women underwent breast cancer surgery and 8 of \n     the 21 women were under the age of 50. She also told the \n     Subcommittee that as a volunteer with the American Cancer \n     Society's Reach to Recovery program, she has yet to visit one \n     recovering breast cancer patient that is African American. \n     She believes that this is because not enough African American \n     women are having early detection procedures. The breast \n     cancer mortality rate for African American women increased by \n     2.6% at a time when the mortality rate in white women \n     declined by 5.5%.\n       Ms. Knight concluded that every women, of every race, in \n     every community should have access to mammography at age 40 \n     if that is what she determines to be necessary for her, \n     dictated by family history, her physician and her personal \n     health factors.\n       Our last witness of the day was Representative Katie True, \n     who represents the 37th legislative district in Pennsylvania. \n     Ms. True told the Subcommittee that one of the weapons that \n     she has chosen to fight breast cancer is House Bill 134. This \n     bill which has already passed the House, would provide for a \n     state income tax checkoff for breast cancer research. The \n     donation is deducted from the tax refund and does not \n     constitute a change against the income tax revenue's to the \n     State.\n       Representative True also stated that the second weapon used \n     to battle breast cancer is education. She stated that self \n     breast exams combined with mammograms can save many lives. \n     Women still hesitate to look after themselves first, usually \n     putting others needs before their own.\n       Representative True concluded that the recommendation of \n     the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Breast Cancer \n     Screening is irresponsible, and she questioned the motives \n     behind such a recommendation--plain and simple--their message \n     is wrong and deadly.\n\n\n                     MARCH 4, 1997--WASHINGTON, DC\n\n       On March 4, 1997, Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     Donna Shalala appeared before the Subcommittee on Labor, \n     Health and Human Services and Education to discuss the fiscal \n     year 1998 budget.\n       At that hearing, I took the opportunity to discuss the NIH \n     Consensus Development Conference recommendations with the \n     Secretary and asked her to take immediate steps towards \n     encouraging women ages 40-49 to undergo mammogram screening. \n     I told the Secretary that the panel finding that mammograms \n     were not warranted for women in the age bracket 40 to 49 has \n     caused quite a stir. And that my own view is that the \n     evidence is substantial, if not overwhelming, that mammograms \n     are very helpful for women of this age group, they do save \n     lives, and that there ought to be a prompt conclusion by HHS \n     to that effect. When there is a public determination that \n     mammograms are not warranted for women 40-49, many women are \n     reading that to mean that a mammogram is not necessary. I \n     also told the Secretary that I felt that there is not a \n     sufficient sense of urgency in the approach that the \n     Department is taking with regard to this issue in allowing \n     another 60 days to pass before a final judgment is made on \n     this issue. I further stated that when it's a matter of \n     dollars and cents, and there is no clear scientific evidence \n     to the contrary, I think the word ought to come from the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services that, notwithstanding \n     the cost, we're going to make sure that mammograms are made \n     available to women ages 40-49.\n\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, one of the subjects that dominates \nthe landscape these days, of course, is the budget. How we are going to \nfunction as a society, what are the priorities, how will we finance \nthese priorities and at the same time reach an objective that all of us \ncare about, and of course that is getting a balanced budget by the year \n2002. Of course, that is getting a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n\n  The President has presented a budget to achieve that objective. There \nare disputes about how we reach that objective, where do we cut \nfurther, what is the revenue stream. I, therefore, Madam President, use \nthis opportunity to comment on what I see as the lack of a budget \nproposal from the Republican side, from the majority side.\n  The President has put down a budget. We have talked about it in the \nBudget Committee. I am the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. We \nhave had numerous hearings as we explored various avenues, various \nparts of the equation with proponents and some opponents trying to \ndissuade us from proceeding with the President's budget.\n  On the other hand, we have not seen anything yet from the Republican \nside, the majority side, I point out, Madam President. They have \nproduced one piece of budget legislation this year, but it is not a \nbalanced budget. It is the notion that we ought to be giving a big tax \nbreak, primarily devoted to the wealthy in our country. The Republican \ntax break will blow a huge hole in the deficit, even as we struggle to \nget down to a zero budget deficit by the year 2002.\n  In the first 5 years, the Republican plan would cost $200 billion. In \nthe next 5 years, these costs would increase 60 percent to $325 billion \nfor a total of $526 billion over the 10-year period. This chart will \nhelp explain exactly where it is we are going.\n  It causes a ballooning of the deficit. We see it from 1997, which is \non the chart projected at $120 billion and expected to be less by the \ntime we reach the end of the fiscal year, September 30. It continues to \nexpand. In the year 2002, when we are striving to have a zero budget \ndeficit, we are at $239 billion, unless some way is found to pay for \nthese tax breaks. They are not free. If we adopt the Republican tax \nscheme, we would have to make deeper cuts someplace. I guess that would \nhave to come from Medicare, Medicaid, education, transportation, \ncrimefighting, and environmental protection.\n  These tax breaks are also backloaded. Their costs explode, as we can \nsee by the expansion of the deficit, after the year 2002. And, believe \nit or not, these tax breaks are bigger than those that were originally \nin the Contract With America, larger than the tax breaks that were \nproposed last year.\n  This chart is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is now at $200 \nbillion, expanded to $525 billion. These are the tax cuts as planned, \nto $525 billion. That would be a terrible consequence. That is in the \nyear 2007.\n  Finally, the Republican tax breaks are overwhelmingly tilted toward \nthe very wealthy. According to one analysis, on average, the Republican \ntax scheme would give a tax break each year of $21,000 for those who \nmake $645,000 a year, the top 1 percent of the income earners in our \ncountry. But if you are in the middle 20 percent of our wage earners \nand you make $27,000 a year, you would get $186 worth of tax relief, 50 \ncents a day--50 cents a day--for the average hard-working family.\n  It borders on insulting to suggest that someone who makes $645,000 is \nentitled to a tax break of $21,000--I hardly think that those people \nneed any help--and if you make $27,000, which is the per capita income \nof the middle 20\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\npercent, $186 for the year. It is hard to comprehend how that is going \nto help our society or help hard-working families make ends meet, plan \nfor their child's education, plan for a roof over their heads, plan for \nhealth care, plan for helping their parents, the elderly, achieve the \ntranquility and the peace that they need in their older age. Madam \nPresident, this is not a good way to do business.\n  We have been down this road before. The Reagan administration gave us \na tax break for the wealthy, and what was the result? The deficit \nexploded. It is time to get down to serious budgeting. It is time to \nbalance the budget.\n  I urge the Republican leadership, the good friends that I have on the \nRepublican side of the aisle who are concerned about balancing a \nbudget, to produce a budget that does the job. If the Republican \nleadership is committed to their tax scheme, they ought to put up a \nbudget that reflects it. Show us how they would pay for it. But we \ncan't continuously engage in this dialog without, at some point, having \nto put up a budget that reflects how they intend to get us to where \nthey say they would like to be: Tax breaks for the wealthy, purportedly \ninvestments in our society to produce jobs, et cetera, while someone \nmaking $27,000 a year is going to get a $186 tax reduction.\n  It is not fair, it is not just, it is not acceptable. The American \npeople won't accept it, even though we could be bowled over by a \nmajority vote. It is an outrageous scheme for doing things, the \nconstant refusal to produce any kind of a response to a Democratic \nbudget. We in the Democratic Party are not in charge. The Republicans \nare in charge, and if they are in charge, they ought to take the \nresponsibilities of leadership. Produce a budget, show us exactly what \nyou mean. Enough of this nonsense where they talk about a tax cut and \nno one willing to say where it is going to come from. If we have a $200 \nbillion extra cost for our society, where are we going to get the \nmoney?\n  People are worried about their future; they are anxious about their \njobs. Yes, there has been good growth in our economy, but the anxiety \nfactor has continued to expand because people do not believe that they \nhave the security they need for the years ahead.\n  So, Madam President, I hope that we will be able to soon get on with \nour business, have the budget produced by the Republican majority, and \ntell us how they are going to pay for it.\n  Let us have an honest debate about it. Let the American people know \nwhat is going on here and not hide behind a smokescreen that says, \nwell, we want to give this huge tax cut but we are not going to tell \nyou how we are going to pay for it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I come here to echo the words that I caught of my \npredecessor in speaking, and that is Senator Frank Lautenberg from New \nJersey, who is the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee.\n  I, too, am frustrated. I mean, there are lots of things to be \nfrustrated about this year. The pace has been slow. There are things we \nshould have been doing. There are distractions hither and yon.\n  One thing we should be doing is the budget. The budget is the \nstatement of priorities of the Congress, representing to the American \npeople what needs to be done in this Nation. The budget, although it \ncomes in a very thick book and has a very sterile appearance, in fact \nis a powerful and humane document about what our priorities are. It is \nthe ultimate statement of what you believe in.\n  I do not want to see a Government furlough, and I do not want to see \na shutdown. I know the Presiding Officer does not want to see that. The \nAmerican people certainly do not. In fact, it had a rather devastating \nconsequence, far beyond what I thought would be the case, in States not \nonly close to Washington, DC, but around the country.\n  There is another reason I worry, and that is what we do know about \nthe Republican budget, which to this point basically is tax cuts. It is \nnot just a question of tax cuts, but the fact that the tax cuts are not \npaid for. There is no statement or sense or hint of where the money \nwill come from.\n  So, first, there is not a budget, and, second, to the extent there is \na budget, it only relates to tax cuts. The Republican tax cuts add up \nto $526 billion over a 10-year period. They backloaded it so that, to \nthe public, the more reasonable approach to a tax cut would be the \nfirst part, and then at the end the tax cut really bulges and the \nbeneficiaries of that really benefit.\n  What is interesting is that we have been through this exercise. The \nAmerican people, and I thought the Republicans themselves, had rejected \nthe idea that we could do the kinds of tax cuts that we were talking \nabout and that we are now talking about, and that is tax cuts that \nfavor the rich, tax cuts that do not favor working American families, \nthe American middle class. Yet here they are back again.\n  That is frustrating to me. I do not understand that. I am not being \npartisan in saying this. I am genuinely perplexed by it. I am more than \nperplexed, I am annoyed by that. But, first of all, I am perplexed.\n  Why this statement of $526 billion? Incidentally, $526 billion--in \nthe last 4 years of the 10 years, 325 billion of those dollars flow \ninto the back pockets of those who benefit. So, therefore, those who \nbenefit and those who do not is obviously very important. And I will \nget to that in a moment.\n  There is a child tax credit the Republicans have put forward and a \nchild tax credit the Democrats have put forward. That is something I \nfeel very, very positively about, both in terms of Republicans and \nDemocrats--with one exception.\n  There was a policy that I helped advance, along with at that time \nGov. Bill Clinton, on something called the National Commission on \nChildren and Families, which I chaired for 4 years. We put forward the \nidea of the $1,000 child tax credit. It is put forward really by both \nparties to the extent of $500, but there is a difference.\n  The Democrats adjust theirs, change theirs, with inflation. It is \nvery expensive to bring up a child in this country. People do not think \nof it that way. You know, they do not quantify so much per child. But \nit costs about $7,000 a year on average to bring up an individual child \nin this country. If you have four, then it costs $28,000 a year. That \nis averaging in from the time that you are buying Pampers to the time \nyou are paying college tuition. Obviously, it is an average, but it is \na very expensive average. So it is a very good proposition, the idea of \na tax credit, but it ought to be indexed to inflation. The Democratic \ntax cut is. The Republican tax cut is not.\n  So, if my colleagues would just listen for a moment about what the \nexperts found out about the Republican tax cut proposals and who gains \nand who does not, more than 75 percent of the Republican tax cuts would \ngo to the top 20 percent of taxpayers. Well, that does not ring right. \nAnd it should not ring right.\n  I mean, this is a country which is constantly--we have all watched, \nhopefully, the public broadcasting thing on Thomas Jefferson who wrote \nthe Declaration of Independence. In that he talked about life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness. There was a sense of equality. People \nwere created to be equal, to have equal opportunity.\n\n  Well, that does not mean that all people work as hard as others. But \ndoes it mean that if you are in the middle class and you are a working \nfamily, much less a two-parent working family, and you are working \nvery, very hard and you are working at a job that pays a lot less \nmoney, then should you be treated substantially differently than \nsomebody who works hard but makes a whole lot of money or somebody who \ndoes not work hard and who makes a whole lot of money through unearned \nincome? The fact of the matter is that only 8.6 percent of the benefit \nof the $526 billion in Republican tax cuts would go to the bottom 60 \npercent of the American people. Let us call it 9 percent. Nine percent \nof the benefit of $526 billion would go to 60 percent of the American \npeople who happen to be at the bottom of the economic scale, that is, \nto the extent that you are within the 60 percent. It ranges, obviously.\n  This means that middle-income Americans with an average income of \n$26,900, which is high cotton in West Virginia, would get a $186 tax \ncut from\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\nthe Republican tax package. That is just the fact. But the top 1 \npercent of Americans, myself included, I suppose, and people whose \nincomes average $645,000, would get $21,000--actually $21,306 in tax \ncuts.\n  That is not the American way. That is not why we are what we are as a \ncountry. I understand that some people do better than others in life. \nAnd I understand that some people are propelled, through good fortune \nor through exceptional brain power, to be in a position to make more \nmoney. Often that is a circumstance of birth and often that is a \ncircumstance of education, often that is simply a circumstance of life. \nAnd sometimes it is simply a matter that you really did it and you \ndeserve it.\n  But you cannot take something called the working middle class, people \nwho work in steel mills, who work in factories, who work in grocery \nstores but who work all the time and work every day and pay taxes, and \nfor whom every $10 or $100 is important, and say to them, ``You don't \ncount.'' You do not do that in a budget. We do not do that, at least in \na Democratic budget.\n  So, Madam President, I appreciate your courtesy in listening to these \nshort pronouncements on my part. But I think the budget process should \nbegin. I think we should take the crazy idea of trying to cut $526 \nbillion of taxes, much less figure out how to pay for it, take it and \nsort of lay it outside the door and let it rest there for time \nimmemorial. In the meantime, let us do a budget.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2230-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2232-S2234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LITHUANIA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak this morning on an issue \nof great importance to American foreign policy and to the future of \nEurope.\n  This week, on March 11, Lithuanians and Lithuanian-Americans \ncelebrated the seventh anniversary of the restoration of independence \nfrom Russia. Lithuania, for those who are not familiar, is a country of \nfewer than 4 million people. It is smaller than the State of South \nCarolina, and it is located between Belarus and the Baltic Sea. \nHistorically, it has been the neighbor, sometimes friendly and \nsometimes not, of Russia and the Soviet Union. It is a nation that has \nhad to struggle time and again for its freedom. Today, it is struggling \nto recover from the devastation of a half-century of Soviet occupation.\n  The history of this little country is very interesting. During the \nmiddle ages, it was one of Europe's most powerful countries. In the \n15th century, it was combined with Poland to create a new kingdom. In \nthe late 18th century, when Poland was partitioned, Lithuania was \ndivided between Russia and Prussia. The czars tried to Russify \nLithuania during the 19th century, but their attempts to destroy \nLithuanian culture gave rise to a Lithuanian nationalist movement \nsupported by the Catholic Church. Ironically, it was this effort by the \nczars to Russify Lithuania which resulted in my being on the floor of \nthe Senate today, because these efforts by the Russians led my mother's \nfamily to pick her up as a small girl and emigrate from Lithuania to \nthe United States. They came here to preserve their Lithuanian culture, \ntheir Roman Catholic religion, and, of course, for the economic \nopportunity that the United States offered.\n  In February 1918, Lithuania finally declared its independence from \nRussia. But, of course, World War II took its toll.\n  In 1940, as a result of the Hitler-Stalin nonaggression pact, known \nas the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement, Lithuania was taken over by the \nSoviet Union. In 1941, Hitler invaded Lithuania. After World War II, \nStalin resumed his brutal repression and Sovietization of Lithuania, \nforbidding democratic institutions and subjugating the church. \nCountless thousands of Lithuanians gave their lives during the war and \nwere then subjected to the Stalinist regime and deportation to Siberia.\n  But the Lithuanian national movement would not die, and it rose again \nas the Soviet Union crumbled. Of the many things which I have been \nfortunate enough to witness in my lifetime, one of the most memorable \nwas the restoration of Lithuania's independence. On February 24, 1990, \nwhile still occupied by the Soviet Union, Lithuania held free elections \nto the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet. I was there on the day of the \nelection, as part of a delegation sent by the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives. The best efforts of the Soviets to keep us out of the \ncountry were not successful. The Lithuanian Reform Movement, called \nSajudis, won the elections. Keep in mind, this tiny country was still \nconsidered by the Soviets to be part of the Soviet Union.\n  On March 11, 1990, Lithuania declared the restoration of complete \nindependence from the Soviet Union. In January, 1991, the Soviets \nstruck back. A Soviet coup was attempted in Lithuania, leaving 13 \nLithuanian civilians dead.\n  After the failed August coup in Moscow, the United States recognized \nthe Lithuanian Government on September 2, 1991.\n  Since the restoration of independence, Lithuania and the other \nindependent Baltic countries, Latvia and Estonia, have held numerous \nfree elections. In Lithuania's case, there have been three--in October \n1992, February 1993, and October 1996.\n  If you look at the relationship between Lithuania and the United \nStates, it is one of mutual cooperation and support. The United States \nrecognized Lithuania as an independent country in 1922 and never \nrecognized the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union as a result \nof the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement.\n\n  During the years of the Soviet occupation of Eastern and Central \nEurope, the Senate and the House continued to pass resolutions and \nproclamations commemorating Captive Nations Week, and asking Americans \nacross the country to join us in recognizing the fundamental freedom \nand independence of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.\n  In 1991, the United States recognized the Lithuanian Government, free \nof Soviet domination. And the United States continued to play a very \nimportant role because, even after Lithuania had restored its \nindependence, there were 70,000 Soviet troops still on Lithuanian soil. \nPresident Clinton deserves credit for working very hard, through \ndiplomatic channels, for the removal of those troops. When the troops \nfinally left in August 1993, due to the President's good efforts, once \nand for all, the Lithuanians were free of occupation troops.\n  Today, however, we are debating the next chapter, and an important \none in the history of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and modern Europe. We \nare debating the enlargement of NATO, and the question of how much of a \nsay Russia should have in this process. This summer, in Madrid, Spain, \nthe members of the NATO alliance will gather together to consider \nwhether new members will be allowed to join the alliance.\n  All of us are aware of the important role that NATO played after \nWorld War II. NATO was the bulwark of Western democracy against the \nexpansion of communism. The allies who came together in that alliance \nnot only were setting out to protect themselves but to establish \ncommonality in terms of values and culture--a commitment to democracy, \na commitment to free markets. The NATO alliance has been successful. \nThe Berlin Wall came down. The cold war came to an end.\n  Now we are talking about a new NATO alliance, and asking ourselves \nwhat this NATO alliance would bring to the world. Certainly more than \ndefense, because I do not think that is the paramount concern to \nEurope. It would be, in the words of Secretary Albright, an effort to \n``gain new allies who are eager and increasingly able to contribute to \nour common agenda for security, from fighting terrorism and weapons \nproliferation to ensuring stability.''\n  The reason I have come to the floor today is to speak about the \nsituation in Lithuania and the challenge we face on the question of \nNATO membership. It is said that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic are likely to be invited to join NATO. I fully support that. \nMy visit to Poland, I can tell you,\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\nwas dominated by discussion about the future of NATO and whether Poland \nwould be a part of it after all that Poland has suffered in the war and \nsince. It is only right that this great nation be brought into an \nalliance with NATO. I fully support that. Nor do I object at all to \nHungary and the Czech Republic being considered.\n  What gives me pause, though, is the fact that there has been little \nmention by the United States or NATO allies about including the Baltic \ncountries--Estonia, Latvia, and particularly Lithuania.\n  I hope those who are considering this issue will pause for a moment \nand reflect on the importance of NATO membership to these small \ncountries. I hope also that they will join me in asking this \nadministration to think anew about the issue of membership in NATO for \nthe Baltic countries.\n  The Baltic countries, meanwhile, wonder about our intentions, and \nthey worry that Russia will misinterpret our hesitation to include \ntheir countries in the NATO alliance as a signal that we still see the \nBaltics in some sort of ``gray zone.'' I can tell you this: the people \nin Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia do not consider themselves in a \n``gray zone.'' They want to be a part of modern Europe.\n  There are some who say that including the Baltic countries in NATO \nmight inflame the ultra-nationalists in Russia and destabilize the \nYeltsin government. I think we should listen to leaders of the Baltics \nwho have had some experience, in fact, more experience, close at hand, \nthan the United States in dealing with the Russians. They know that any \nambiguity in U.S. policy only emboldens the radicals in Russia. They \nknow that if we are firm and fair, Russia will accept NATO enlargement. \nWe should be mindful of Russian views but not fearful of their \nreaction.\n  The Baltics, you see, are very fragile. This map may not be easy to \nsee, but I would like to point out a few things of importance.\n  This tiny little yellow area here is still part of Russia. It is \nknown as Kaliningrad. The Russians have held on to it even though, as \nyou can see, it is detached from Russia. It is, of course, a port on \nthe Baltic Sea. But, even more importantly, it is a major military \ninstallation for the Russians. The Russians have 40,000 troops in \nKaliningrad today, and they frequently traverse Poland, Belarus, and \nLithuania with materials and troops going to and from Kaliningrad.\n  Then, next to Lithuania you will see this former Soviet Republic, now \nan independent state, Belarus. There are 60,000 troops in Belarus, \nbacked up by Russian troops.\n  So here on its west, directly south and west of Lithuania, there are \n40,000 Russian troops, and immediately to its east at least 60,000 \ntroops. While this is happening, Lithuania has a very tiny defense \nforce. It wouldn't even be characterized as an army by most modern \ndefinitions. Naturally, Lithuania is concerned about its own security.\n  The three Baltic States came together to talk about common defense. \nThey want to make certain that they maintain their independence \nregardless of the whims of history. They are not seeking to expand \ntheir territory. They are looking for peaceful development and only \ndefensive capacity. They are making reforms within their militaries and \nwithin their countries to be ready to join NATO. They have provided \ntroops for NATO-led operations in Bosnia.\n  Let me tell you one brief story that I think is illustrative of the \ncommitment of Lithuania to becoming a viable partner in NATO.\n  When President Clinton and the United States decided to move forward \nto stop the genocide that was occurring in Bosnia, we created what is \nknown as the IFOR group. These were armies from allied countries coming \ntogether to try to bring peace to the Balkans, a daunting task that has \nchallenged generations, if not centuries, of those who live in the \nregion. The tiny country of Lithuania, with 3.7 million people, which \nhas a very, very small army, made an IFOR commitment, sending a small \ngroup to be part of this effort. Sadly, one of the casualties in \nBosnia, as the result of a landmine, was a Lithuanian soldier who \nliterally gave his life as part of this peacekeeping effort in Europe. \nA curious thing happened after that tragedy, because the Lithuanian \nParliament then had to vote almost immediately on whether to send more \ntroops to IFOR.\n  Think about it for a moment. What would that have meant in the Senate \nof the United States or the House of Representatives if our country had \nlost proportionately as many as Lithuania had lost in this effort, and \nwe had to then debate whether to expand the force that we had sent in? \nIt would have been tough. Some would have said, ``Wait a minute; if it \nmeans loss of life and bloodshed, perhaps we should think it over.''\n  But the Lithuanian Parliament understood Lithuania's commitment and \nvoted, even after the loss of this soldier's life, to expand its \ncommitment to IFOR--to send even more troops into the area to cooperate \nwith the United States and all of the NATO allies as part of IFOR. I \nthink that says a lot about whether Lithuania wants to be a part of the \nfuture of the free world.\n  The Baltics have also welcomed the placement in their countries of \nwhat is called the Regional Airspace Initiative, which is going to \nincrease NATO's security and be located on Baltic soil. They want to \nmake sure that the Baltics are integrated, through this defense \ncapacity, into all of modern Europe. All three of the Baltic countries \nhave joined the Council of Europe, and all three formally have applied \nfor membership in the European Union, which is important for the \nprosperity of that region.\n  So now we come to the point where we have to ask the hard question \nabout whether or not Lithuania and the other Baltic countries should be \nmembers of NATO. I firmly believe they should be. I think the United \nStates should make a clear and unequivocal commitment to Lithuania, to \nLatvia and to Estonia that they will be part of NATO, and welcome them \ninto this new Europe, a Europe which brings together East and West \nfinally in a combined, peaceful strategy and alliance.\n  I am troubled by the fact that we have been at best ambivalent on \nthis issue. Our official spokesmen in the State Department, the \nDepartment of Defense and other channels have been careful not to \nmention the Baltic countries. One of our leaders in Government has said \nthat, ``Well, we don't want to make the Russians too nervous. You know \nthey are fearful of encirclement.''\n  If you visited Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania today, you would be \nhard pressed to suggest that any of these countries have any type of \nmotive to expand their territory or to in any way jeopardize the future \nof Russia. Yet a country like Lithuania, with 40,000 Russian troops in \nKaliningrad and 60,000 troops in Belarus, can very well feel threatened \nby the current situation.\n  During my visit to Lithuania and Poland a few weeks ago, I met with \nmany representatives of government from every political party. And I \ncan tell you, Madam President, that this issue cuts clearly across \nparty lines--conservatives, liberals, right and left and center. Those \nwho were formerly members of the Communist Party and now a part of \ndemocratic efforts in these countries all believe the same thing. NATO \nis the key to the future.\n  I think the United States can be proud of the fact that it stood with \nthe Baltic countries during those dark days after World War II, when \nthey were forced into the Soviet Union and became, unwittingly and \nunwillingly, republics that were part of the Soviet Union. We said in \nthe United States that we would never accept that. We viewed them as \nfreedom-loving people. I was proud of that, proud as a Lithuanian-\nAmerican whose mother was born in a small village in the southwest part \nof Lithuania, proud that we stood by them during 50 years of Soviet \noccupation. Then the moment came for their freedom, a moment that was \nmarked with bloodshed. I regretted the fact that the United States \nwasn't the first in line to recognize their independence. In fact, 32 \nother nations in the world came forward to recognize a free and \ndemocratic Lithuania before the United States did. I am sorry that we \nwere 33d, but I am glad that we did it. I am glad that we reaffirmed \nour commitment to the Baltic countries.\n\n  During the course of my visit to Vilnius, the Capital of Lithuania, I \nvisited a cemetery with a monument\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\nknown as the Pieta. It is a monument to those who gave their lives \nduring this recent struggle for independence in Lithuania. I was struck \nby the fact, as I walked along the gravestones of those martyrs to \nfreedom in Lithuania, how many of them were teenagers, or in their \nearly 20's, who lost their lives in the hope that Lithuania would be \nfree. Many of them in their lifetimes had never known anything but \nSoviet domination, Communist domination, a domination where the Soviets \ntried to Russify the Lithuanian language, take away Lithuanian culture \nand traditions, close down Catholic churches and literally close down \nthe press. They saw that.\n  I saw as well, when I visited, in Kaunas, the archbishop, His \nExcellency Sigitas Tamkevicius, who is considered a saint, having spent \nmany years in a Soviet prison for the audacity of publishing an \nunderground journal, how much this country has been through, how much \nit has suffered. It is not unreasonable for us as leaders of democracy \nand freedom in the world to understand why Lithuania, Latvia, and \nEstonia want to be part of our peace-loving and democratic alliance.\n  I sincerely hope that the United States, starting first with the \nmeeting between the President and President Yeltsin in Helsinki this \ncoming week, and then again in Madrid this coming summer, will really \ntry to show the initiative, to broach this discussion about Lithuania \nand the Baltic countries becoming part of the NATO alliance. I think it \nis important for us to say unequivocally that this will happen and we \nare committed to it, and to say as well, now let us discuss with these \ncountries and with Russia when this will occur and how this will occur.\n  It should be a transparent process. By that I mean we should say to \nthe Russians this is clearly defensive in nature. These tiny countries \nare only looking for the assurance that they will have freedom and \ngreat opportunity in the future.\n  I will close, Madam President, by saying that one of the more \nmemorable moments in my trip to Lithuania was on Independence Day, on \nFebruary 16, when on Sunday I stood in the square in front of the \nparliament in Vilnius and saw the people gathered singing the \nLithuanian national anthem and then went to the cathedral for a Mass \ncelebrated by the Cardinal of Lithuania. At the end of this Mass they \nonce again sang the Lithuanian national anthem, and then closed with a \nCatholic hymn entitled ``Maria, Maria.'' My brother and I were standing \nthere and looked around and saw men and women with tears rolling down \ntheir cheeks. This was the hymn that the Lithuanians turned to in their \nchurches many times in clandestine masses to give them hope that they \ncould survive the occupation by the Russians, the occupation by the \nNazis, the occupation by the Soviets. These men and women have suffered \nso much in the name of freedom and independence, and now they are \nasking us today as leaders in the free world to invite them into this \nfamily of freedom-loving and peace-loving nations.\n  I hope I can prevail on my colleagues in the Senate to join with me \nin encouraging the United States to include the Baltic countries, as \nwell as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and all the other \ncountries that are genuinely interested in becoming peace-loving \npartners in NATO. I think that will continue the great legacy that \nreally defines America.\n  We are not out to conquer territory. We have defied history by being \nthe conquerors in World War II and literally working as hard as we \ncould to rebuild the vanquished, and now we have again the chance to \nsay as we embark on this 21st century that this NATO alliance will \nguarantee that a new Europe, East and West together, will be a peaceful \nEurope for decades to come.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I was disappointed to note that the United \nStates, alone among its allies on the United Nations Security Council, \nvetoed a proposed resolution urging Israel to abandon its plans to \nbuild housing for Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem. This housing \ninitiative, which was reported last week to have been pushed by the \nright wing of Prime Minister Netanyahu's party, threw a cold towel on \nthe peace process that had been so painfully promoted through U.S. \nintermediation.\n  Indeed, the President and the Secretary of State, Ms. Albright, both \ncorrectly criticized Israel's position on this issue. It is unfortunate \nthat the President felt compelled to mix that clear signal of American \ndispleasure with an American veto of essentially the same policy \nposition, expressed in a United Nations Security Council resolution. \nAmerican policy on this very important matter needs more consistency if \nthe United States intends to maximize its influence and leadership on \nthe peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It is \nunfortunate that the message of displeasure has been diluted, because \nthat softening risks emboldening the hard-liners in Israel who act as \nif they do not want that process to succeed.\n  I believe that the policy of the administration rightly remains \nopposed to the recently announced settlement initiative by the Israeli \ngovernment, and I spoke out on the floor a few days ago in support of \nthat position. It does not seem logically consistent that a Security \nCouncil resolution essentially expressing the same disapproval could in \nany way itself ``jeopardize efforts to keep the peace process moving'', \nas was reported by the Washington Post on March 8, 1997. Strong \nleadership on this matter requires sustained consistency in all foras, \nboth national and international regarding American policy, and I hope \nthat there will be further opportunities to make our very correct \nposition in opposition to this new housing initiative abundantly clear.\n  The Israeli leader stands at a pivotal point in the Middle East. The \npeace process is clearly very fragile, and great efforts are needed on \na sustained basis by all the parties, not some of the parties, for it \nto succeed. The alarming exchange of letters between King Hussein and \nPrime Minister Netanyahu, released publicly yesterday reveals the \ndamage that the Israeli housing initiative is causing. Neither the \nU.S., not the Palestenians, nor the Israeli people should passively \nallow the Israeli right wing to sabotage this process anytime it \ndecides it has gone far enough for their taste. I congratulate the \nPresident for sending an American envoy to meet in Gaza with Mr. Arafat \non the overall situation.\n  I make an urgent plea to Prime Minister Netanyahu to look history in \nthe face and to take a bold step and reverse his decision on the \nhousing matter, regardless of the merits of the initiative in his mind \nfrom a narrow geographical perspective. This decision has become the \ncentral indicator of his government's commitment to peace in the Middle \nEast. It is clear that, regardless of any merits which may attach to \nthe housing decision, it is causing grave damage to the peace process \nwhich our governments have worked so painfully to engender. Therefore, \nI urge the Israeli Prime Minister to reverse that decision. This would \ncertainly require considerable personal courage and political \ndifficulty on his part, but it would mark him as a true leader at a \ntime when such leadership is desperately needed. He alone is in the \nposition to make a crucial change in the present explosive atmosphere. \nThe process of peace in the Middle East has reached a vital juncture, \nand its future is highly dependent on the action he takes now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the decision by the administration to \ncertify Mexico as an ally in the fight against narcotics raises a \nbroader issue. In my judgment, it is time to\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nreach several difficult but obvious conclusions about United States \npolicy toward Mexico and our bilateral relations. Indeed, perhaps, if \nthere was a contribution offered by the unfortunate decision to certify \nMexico in the war against narcotraffickers, it is the growing sense in \nthe United States of the need for a moment of honest reflection about \nMexican-American relations. In short, it is time to simply tell the \ntruth about Mexico.\n  Mexican-American policy in these years has been based, in my \njudgment, on three broad deceptions, deceptions not only of ourselves \nbut, perhaps more importantly, of the Mexican people themselves. \nDeceptions which I recognize have been made, sometimes, with the best \nof intentions. The United States has understood that some historic \ninjustices create particular sensitivities in Mexico. There is always \nthe need to account for nationalist pride and the obvious concern of \ninternal interference. But not telling the truth to our own people, or \nto the people of Mexico, allows the Mexican people to avoid dealing \nwith the realities of their own country. This conspiracy of silence \nabout the realities in Mexico prevents the United States from \nconstructing real policies to defend our own interests, and hampers our \nability to work with Mexico in protecting its own interests.\n  These three deceptions are, in my judgment, convincing the American \npeople that Mexico is, in fact, making the transition to a vibrant \ndemocracy; that Mexico has a genuinely free economy; and, finally, that \nMexico is, indeed, participating in waging a war on narcotics. I \nbelieve that an analysis of these assumptions will establish that none \nof them are true.\n  First is the question of the Mexican economy. In 1993, in an effort \nto support the North American Free-Trade Agreement, the American people \nwere told that if only Mexico had access to the American market, then \nMexico would complete its historic transition to a free and open \neconomy. I understood the reasons to support NAFTA. A free-trade \nagreement for North America makes sense. But a condition precedent of a \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement is that each of the participants \ngenuinely has a free and an open economy. Therefore, this Congress \ncould not have affirmatively accepted the treaty without being \nconvinced that Mexico, like Canada and the United States, would accept \nthe rules of a market economy.\n  The simple reality is that in 1997, despite assurances to the \ncontrary, Mexico retains strong elements of a centrally directed \neconomy, officially controlled and unofficially corrupt. The most \nimportant elements of the Mexican economy are either under state \nsponsorship or government control, including banking, finance, and \npetroleum. The result has been, predictably, anemic growth which \nstimulates increased migration and denys the Mexican people real \neconomic opportunity.\n  Last year, 1.2 million young Mexicans attempted to join the national \nwork force, only to find employment available for a fraction of those \nseeking work. Since the 1980's, irregular or low levels of growth in \nthe economy have been the exception in the region. Throughout that \ndecade, annual growth in Mexico, the GNP, averaged 1 percent. In some \nyears in the 1990's it grew, but the results were uneven for the people \nthemselves.\n  The reasons are clear. It is not enough for the national leadership \nto declare Mexico a free economy. Making pledges to the United States \nin order to get access to NAFTA accomplishes nothing if the \nfundamentals of a free economy are not established. Most obvious is the \nneed to allow the development of a free trade union movement. But, \nindeed, Mexico will conclude the 20th century as one of the last \nnations in our hemisphere to still not permit the development of \nindependent trade unions.\n  The results are declining real wages of a magnitude of 70 percent in \nthe last 20 years, a minimum wage which decreased by 13 percent in 1995 \nand fell by an additional 11 percent in 1996.\n  A free economy means a free market for labor. Real competition \nrequires that people can engage in collective bargaining. Similarly \nfrustrating to the development of a free economy in Mexico has been the \nfailure to privatize important sectors of the economy. In September of \n1995, the Mexican Government announced the sale of 61 petrochemical \nplants that would be open to the free economy and to foreign \ninvestment. It was an attractive response to the promise of NAFTA. On \nOctober 13, 1996, the Mexican Government reversed its policy and has \nmaintained Government control over this vital center of the Mexican \neconomy.\n  As a result of this failure to permit the free exchange of labor, \nforeign investment, and privatization, Mexico is one of the few \ncountries in the world where, because of declining wages, life \nexpectancy has leveled off and may actually be declining.\n  The Mexican peso, because of a failure to adequately control both \ndebts and the currency, literally collapsed in 1994, requiring $40 \nbillion of external financing from the United States and other \ninternational institutions. And in 1997, the international community \nfaces the same prospect, because the peso is, again, overvalued and, \nagain, facing downward pressure.\n  The first simple truth, therefore, is we need to be honest with \nourselves, investors, and the Mexican people. The promise of \nestablishing a free market in Mexico, the ending of state-sponsored \nindustries, has not been kept. Words do not suffice. The promises mean \nnothing. Mexico remains a state-controlled and directed economy where \nmarket forces are not allowed to operate. And for whatever price that \nmay hold for American investors, or Mexico's new trade partners in \nNAFTA, the price is principally borne by the Mexican people themselves, \nwho, despite their labors and their sacrifices and their desire to free \ntheir economy, are on a downward spiral of opportunity and living \nstandards.\n  The second truth concerns the promise of democracy in Mexico. For 7 \ndecades, the Mexican people have been victimized by a one-party \nauthoritarian state. It is self-perpetuating and it is not a democracy \nunder any contemporary definition. Successive Mexican administrations \nchoose the next government. Power has been maintained through \ncorruption and outright electoral theft. As recently as 1988, Mexico's \nruling PRI party had to resort to outright fraud to guarantee the \nelection of President Carlos Salinas. In 1994, the leading presidential \ncandidate was assassinated, with credible allegations that elements of \nhis own party conspired in the assassination because of his opposition \nto electoral reforms that might have fulfilled elements of the promise \nof democracy.\n  The level of corruption and denial of democratic freedoms has not \ninvolved simply the presidency, but almost every level of government. \nThis includes disputed state elections throughout the 1980's and during \nthis decade. In at least four recent gubernatorial elections the \nopposition PAN party ultimately took control or demonstrated a strong \npresence because of court challenges and public opposition.\n  In 1996, despite promises of electoral reform, the PRI majority in \nthe Mexican Congress placed restrictions on electoral procedures and \npublic financing that greatly restricted the ability of opposition \nparties to participate in, and have a chance of succeeding in, Mexican \nelections.\n  Promises of electoral reform in Mexico have simply not been realized. \nAccess to the media, public finance, and control of government \ninstitutions to the advantage of the ruling party have all gone without \nchange. Despite public protests and international challenges which have \nresulted in some successes in state gubernatorial elections, the simple \ntruth is the 20th century will end without Mexico having experienced \nthe peaceful transfer of power from the ruling party to the opposition. \nThat, Mr. President, is a contradiction of any claim that Mexico is \noperating under contemporary standards of democratic elections.\n\n  Mexico has not been alone in having difficulty making the transition \nfrom one-party government to a competitive pluralist system. What makes \nMexico different is that, unlike in Japan or Italy which had similar \nmonopolies on power in the postwar period, but whose governments bore \nAmerican encouragement and sometimes criticism, there has been a \nconspiracy of silence about the realities of Mexican politics and its \neconomy.\n  Those who remain silent or fail to inform our people or the Mexican \npeople of the truth of their national experience bear responsibility.\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\n  There are, indeed, many victims of the realities of Mexican politics. \nThe failure to democratize has caused just as much suffering as the \nloss of economic opportunity. Suffering which forces thousands of \nMexicans to migrate or live with the downward spiral of the Mexican \neconomy.\n  In 1996, Amnesty International's annual report accused Mexican \nsecurity forces of outright human rights abuses including the murder \nand torture of leftist rebels. They also uncovered the use of torture, \nand the many disappearances which have occurred throughout the areas of \nconflict. The Mexican media are no less a target. Journalists have been \nintimidated, abducted, and even killed, with cases as late as 1995 \nstill unresolved.\n\n  Public financing of the media, the corruption of journalists, and the \nmonopoly of government power still distorts the view of the Mexican \npeople about their own country and its problems, with predictable \nresults. The Mexican people are unable to express themselves equally \nthrough the media, and are unable to gain control of their own lives \nthrough the electoral system. They face a declining standard of living \nbecause of the monopoly of government power in the economy, and are \ntragically, but predictably, now involved in guerrilla operations in \nfully eight of Mexico's states.\n  Third and finally, Mr. President, is the truth about narcotrafficking \nin Mexico. Not only is it true that the Mexican people are paying an \nextraordinary price for the failure to develop a genuine market \neconomy, and democratic institutions, but they, together with the \nAmerican people, are paying an enormous price for the failure to \ncontrol or even cooperate in controlling illegal drugs.\n  The administration has been asked a simple question: Is, or is not \nMexico an ally in the fight against narcotrafficking? The \nadministration has answered by explaining that we have to consider the \npast difficulties in Mexican-American history. They have responded that \nMexico is an increasing source of American investment. Those, Mr. \nPresident, were not the questions.\n  The question is this: Is, or is not Mexico cooperating? The simple \ntruth is that the highest levels of the Mexican Government have been \ncorrupted and are, at a minimum, working at cross-purposes with the \nU.S. Government in controlling the flow of narcotics.\n  Indeed, the administration's own reports conclude that fully two-\nthirds of all of the cocaine entering the United States is being \ntransshipped through Mexico. The State Department has concluded that \nMexico is now the most important location in the Western Hemisphere for \nthe laundering of narcotics funds.\n  On March 1, we learned that General Gutierrez, the drug czar of \nMexico, was himself arrested for complicity and conspiracy with drug \ntraffickers.\n  Mr. President, the decision to certify Mexico as an ally in the war \nagainst narcotics was a decision to protect the Mexican Government from \ncriticism. It was the wrong decision. The simple truth is that every \nday, in every way, Mexican officials are permitting the transshipment \nof narcotics to our country. New laws to stop the laundering of funds \nin Mexican banks have not been enforced. Not a single Mexican bank has \nhad to alter its operations to comply with new legislation.\n  Of the 1,250 police officers dismissed for corruption because of \nnarcotics in Mexico, not a single officer has been prosecuted.\n  Despite 52 outstanding extradition requests to send corrupt officials \nto the United States, not one has been complied with. Indeed, not a \nsingle Mexican national has been extradited to the United States \nbecause of drug-related charges.\n  Most discouraging of all, the head of the DEA, Thomas Constantine, \nconcluded before this Congress:\n\n       There is not one single law enforcement institution in \n     Mexico with whom the DEA has an entirely trusting \n     relationship.\n\n  Mr. President, there were times during the cold war, indeed times \nduring moments of national peril when the United States needed to \ncompromise an honest look at the world because of issues of national \nsecurity. The end of the cold war has ended that time.\n  We need to honestly assess our relationship with Mexico. We need to \ntell the American people the truth about the state of Mexican \ndemocracy, its economy, and its fight against narco-trafficking. Change \nwill never come without the truth. Ending the certification process \nwill begin that national debate in this Chamber.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the administration's conclusion, which \ncannot be borne out by the facts. Let us tell the truth about Mexico.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2234-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2236-S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ELDERLY IMMIGRANTS AT RISK OF LOSING SSI\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have received early reports from the \nSocial Security Administration large numbers of of elderly legal \nimmigrants who will lose their SSI benefits under the new welfare law \nunless Congress acts to help them.\n  In Social Security field offices across the country, the same reports \nare being heard. Elderly immigrants come into the field offices after \nreceiving a notice that their SSI benefits will be terminated unless \nthe immigrants can prove U.S. citizenship. Many of these immigrants are \ncitizens, but they cannot remember where they stored their \nnaturalization certificate. Most are very old and often infirm. \nSometimes they are too infirm to remember whether they were naturalized \nor not.\n  For example, two elderly women, both over 90 years old, were senile, \nand confined to a convalescent home. They sought help from SSA after \nreceiving the notice that their SSI payments would be terminated. Both \nwomen say they were born in the United States, but they cannot prove \ntheir citizenship.\n  Another woman, born in Ireland over 80 years ago, came to the US when \nshe was 2. Her parents were naturalized, but she has no proof that she \nwas. She has never left the United States, and believes she is a \ncitizen, but she has no way to prove it.\n  The Social Security office in New York City reports that a woman's \n85-year-old daughter came to inquire about her 105-year-old mother's \ntermination notice. She stated that her mother was born in New York \nCity, but has no birth certificate. Her mother has been receiving SSI \nbenefits since 1976. The only way to find a record of her birth is to \nsearch the New York City birth records from 105 years ago. No one knows \nif the birth was even recorded.\n  These are just a few stories of the hundreds coming into Social \nSecurity offices since the termination notices were mailed a few weeks \nago. Several recent news articles have reported stories of legal \nimmigrants about to lose their benefits. I ask unanimous consent that \nthese stories may be placed in the Record following my statement. \nUnless Congress intervenes, the consequences of the welfare bill will \nbe too harsh.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, Mar. 3, 1997]\n\n                        Overwhelmed by Overhaul\n\n                          (By Shirley Salemy)\n\n       Israel and Faina Staroselsky are snared in the intricacies \n     of the new welfare overhaul law.\n       The couple, both 68, fled anti-Semitism in Ukraine five \n     years ago. They applied to become naturalized U.S. citizens \n     seven months ago. They're still waiting, they say.\n       And if they don't get citizenship soon, they'll lose their \n     Supplementary Security Income.\n       ``We got this letter,'' said Israel Staroselsky, pointing \n     to a memo from the Social Security Administration. ``If we \n     are not able to prove our American citizenship by May, we \n     will lose all sources of life.''\n       If the federal welfare overhaul is a gigantic jigsaw \n     puzzle, the pieces that shape assistance to poor, elderly and \n     disabled legal immigrants may be the most intricate--the ones \n     that remain on the card table the longest.\n       The rules are complicated, and people like the Staroselskys \n     aren't the only ones confused. Lawmakers are, too.\n\n\n                           a dramatic change\n\n       ``Generally, I think the Legislature is real confused'' \n     about the ins and outs of the law, said Sen. Maggie Tinsman, \n     R-Bettendorf and co-chairwoman of the joint human services \n     appropriations subcommittee.\n       ``It's always confusing when the law changes,'' Tinsman \n     said. ``This is a dramatic change. And people always think \n     the worst.''\n       Generally, the new law prohibits non-citizens who are not \n     new refugees, U.S. military veterans or have not worked and \n     paid taxes\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\n     in America for at least 10 years from getting most forms of \n     public assistance--that is, Supplemental Security Income, \n     food stamps, Medicaid and cash assistance for families.\n       It also bars new arrivals--immigrants who came to the \n     United States after Aug. 22, 1996, the day President Clinton \n     signed the bill--from receiving most public benefits during \n     the first five years in the country.\n       But the states have some options to provide more help. Iowa \n     officials say that's what they will try to do.\n       The Department of Human Services is proposing to continue \n     benefits for some of the immigrants who would be cut off. \n     State welfare officials are holding community forums around \n     the state to explain the new law.\n       For immigrants who were already here when Clinton signed \n     the law, DHS intends to continue providing cash assistance in \n     its core program, called the Family Investment Program, and \n     Medicaid.\n       ``We felt it was a humanitarian thing to do,'' said Ann \n     Wiebers, DHS welfare reform coordinator.\n\n\n                          appropriation needed\n\n       But it's up to the Iowa Legislature to appropriate money \n     for the program. Tinsman thinks lawmakers will concur with \n     the department's decision.\n       The department would need to use a pool of state funds to \n     help new arrivals in those programs. For the Family \n     Investment Program alone, the estimated cost over the next \n     two years would be an additional $702,237.\n       Tinsman said lawmakers are concerned about legal immigrants \n     who haven't become citizens.\n       ``We suspect most of them are elderly and in nursing \n     homes,'' she said. ``We have money in the budget to take care \n     of that.''\n       She said new arrivals must have sponsors to come to the \n     United States. Sponsors must now sign binding affidavits of \n     support--which means they're held financially liable for \n     immigrants who fall into distress.\n       ``I think they're going to be covered, just not by \n     government,'' she said.\n       Sen. Johnie Hammond, D-Ames, who also serves on the \n     subcommittee, said the panel hasn't talked about the way the \n     new law affects legal immigrants.\n       ``We need to look at who's falling through the cracks and \n     do we really want them to fall through the cracks,'' Hammond \n     said.\n\n\n                          effects aren't known\n\n       Advocates, meanwhile, say the way the new law will play out \n     in Iowa is still unclear.\n       ``The law is still so new,'' said Ta-Yu Yang, a Des Moines \n     attorney who specializes in immigration law. ``We are still \n     talking on the macro stage of what to do here in Iowa, \n     whether to continue some of the benefits or not.''\n       But Yang, who is president of both the Asian-American \n     Council and the Taiwanese Association, said: ``I don't think \n     there's any question that so much of the legislation is going \n     to have discriminatory impact. I don't know if they intended \n     it to be that way or not.''\n       Terry Meek, executive director of Proteus, a nonprofit \n     group that serves migrant and seasonal farm workers, said \n     such laborers will likely be affected by new food-stamp \n     rules. Now, legal immigrants must work and pay taxes for 10 \n     years before they're eligible.\n       But many farm workers are paid in cash or through crew \n     leaders, Meek said. She's not sure how those workers will \n     document their work history.\n       Sandra Soto, an immigrant-rights advocate at the American \n     Friends Service Committee, thinks that the new law asks \n     welfare workers to become specialists in immigration law and \n     that it's creating a lot of confusion at local welfare \n     offices.\n\n\n                           there's confusion\n\n       ``I'm not saying they're denying benefits for the sake of \n     it,'' Soto said. ``I'm saying there's confusion. Getting \n     involved in immigration is difficult, because there are huge \n     numbers of proofs of immigrant status.''\n       She, too, worries about immigrants who may not have \n     documents to prove their years of work.\n       She points to Blanca Vivas, 44, who came to this country \n     illegally in 1986 from Nicaragua. Vivas, speaking Spanish  \n     translated by Soto, said she first worked in the fields of \n     the Southwest, received amnesty and eventually came to \n     Iowa and worked in the meatpacking industry. She earned \n     money with a temporary work permit that was renewed last \n     year.\n       Debilitating pain in her shoulders and back from the heavy \n     lifting she did prevents her from working any more. She lacks \n     the documents to prove her years of work. And her work permit \n     is no longer valid.\n       She now lives in Des Moines with the support of her \n     boyfriend. She'd like to get food stamps and medical help but \n     knows she's not eligible.\n       ``I think ignorance has led us to many bad things,'' she \n     said. ``It's one of the major barriers. Even if we have good \n     work ethics, we are coming to a country where the culture, \n     the language and many other things are different.''\n\n\n                              New Citizens\n\n       Immigration and Naturalization Service officials \n     conservatively anticipate more than 2,000 immigrants will \n     naturalize during fiscal 1997.\n       The welfare law is playing a role in the boom, said Michael \n     Went, deputy director of the INS office in Omaha, which \n     oversees Iowa. But he also thinks people are simply taking \n     the final step in the immigration process.\n       The Staroselskys believe it's their only chance.\n       ``If we will not become citizens according to the new law, \n     we will lose all of this,'' Israel Staroselsky said, sitting \n     at a table in the couple's one-bedroom apartment.\n       They left Kiev as refugees. He was a cardiologist, she was \n     a pediatrician. They aren't certified to practice medicine in \n     the United States, so he worked for two years as a researcher \n     in Des Moines, then retired.\n       If they had known about these changes when they were still \n     in Ukraine, their decision to come might have been different.\n       ``We came five years before,'' Israel Staroselsky said. \n     ``If we had known about this law, it could be another \n     decision.''\n       Blanca Vivas, 44, is one of many workers hurt by new \n     requirements that legal immigrants must work and pay taxes 10 \n     years before they can get food stamps. She's worked in this \n     country since 1986 but lacks documents to prove it. Now she's \n     disabled, and her work permit is no longer valid.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         [From the Raleigh (NC) News & Observer, Mar. 2, 1997]\n\n                 Older Immigrants Face Welfare Dilemma\n\n       Charlotte--Immigrants in North Carolina face longer waits \n     for naturalization than most other states, making worries \n     about losing welfare benefits more realistic for newcomers \n     from overseas.\n       The Charlotte office of the U.S. Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service is ranked among the nation's slowest \n     processing offices, according to a report released Saturday \n     by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n       North Carolinians, who apply for naturalization at the \n     Charlotte INS office, can face between 21 and 28 months of \n     waiting before their citizenship records are processed.\n       The wait might mean disabled and elderly immigrants could \n     lose some federal benefits. Under the welfare reforms, \n     recipients of some benefits must become citizens to keep \n     them.\n       Those who aren't U.S. citizens and have lived here at least \n     five years are receiving letters saying food stamps and \n     Supplemental Security Income could be eliminated as soon as \n     May. The letter, from the Social Security Administration, \n     also says Medicaid could be eliminated by summer.\n       ``There was no exception made for them (in the new welfare \n     law), and that's one of our biggest sore spots,'' said \n     Marlene Myers, coordinator of the N.C. Refugee Office, one of \n     several groups that have met with INS officials to find a way \n     to help these immigrants. ``(The elderly or disabled) are \n     kind of caught in a crack.''\n       The Charlotte INS benefits staff processed 2,500 \n     naturalization applications two years ago. This year, they \n     expect to handle more than 7,000. Once the welfare law took \n     effect, the office was swamped with applicants.\n       ``No one likes to have people wait,'' said Donald Young, \n     officer in charge of the INS office in Charlotte. ``We go \n     along, day in, day out, trudging along. But again, that \n     slowdown is nationwide, not just Charlotte.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Christian Science Monitor, Mar. 4, 1997]\n\n            Amid Welfare Cuts, States Try to Aid Immigrants\n\n                           (By Skip Thurman)\n\n       An Iranian man living in Denver can't muster the courage to \n     tell his elderly mother--a legal immigrant who has lived in \n     America for almost 20 years--that her monthly checks from the \n     federal government are about to end. His best hope now is \n     that the state of Colorado will continue some of her \n     subsidies.\n       Legal immigrants across the US are beginning to see that \n     states as their last best hope to offset the imminent loss of \n     all federal benefits--a cutoff required by the new national \n     welfare-reform law.\n       State officials by and large seem to be sympathetic. Of 40 \n     states that have filed spending plans, 36 report they will \n     continue benefits to legal immigrants who fall off the \n     federal rolls.\n       ``In the small world of welfare, we are in pretty good \n     shape,'' says Dick Powers of the Massachusetts Department of \n     Transitional Assistance. The state has enough money to help \n     needy legal immigrants--at least for now--because it's \n     currently getting more money from Washington than it needs \n     for cash assistance to a dwindling welfare caseload.\n       But states with large numbers of immigrants may not have \n     the same luxury. New York Gov. George Pataki (R) anticipates \n     spending an estimated $240 million to cover legal immigrants \n     who will lose federal aid.\n       In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush (R) argues that changing the \n     rules for legal immigrants already in the US was unfair.\n       ``He has no concern about prospectively saying to future \n     immigrants, `You will no longer be eligible,''' says Bush \n     spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``But he is calling on the federal \n     government to provide funding for this part of the \n     population.''\n       The National Governors Association says many governors, \n     including Mr. Bush, are asking for extra help.\n       ``We aren't talking about reopening the welfare bill. We \n     are talking about amending a little thing on the edge of \n     it,'' says Nolan Jones at the NGA.\n       President Clinton has put forward a plan to restore many \n     benefits to 350,000 of the 500,000 immigrants most severely \n     affected by\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n     welfare reform. Benefits most at risk include Supplemental \n     Security Income (SSI), a monthly benefit (averaging $400 per \n     recipient) that augments the incomes of the aged or disabled; \n     Medicaid, which helps the same group pay medical bills; and \n     food stamps.\n       But many lawmakers say revising the law to soften its \n     impact on immigrants is unlikely.\n       ``It's just not going to happen,'' says Rep. Clay Shaw Jr. \n     (R) of Florida, who led the charge for welfare reform in the \n     last Congress.\n       For one, federal budgeteers would fight such a move. About \n     one-fourth of the savings expected from welfare cuts will \n     come from ending benefits to legal immigrants.\n       While Congressman Shaw expects to feel more pressure to \n     revise the law as welfare reform kicks into effect over the \n     next four months, he says. ``We've really got to believe in \n     what we are going to accomplish with this, because we are \n     going to be dogged all the way.'' He points out that 51 \n     percent of SSI benefits go to elderly noncitizens, something \n     he says was never intended by the authors of the original \n     legislation.\n       Shaw and other Republicans are open to one possible \n     compromise that would provide states with additional block-\n     grant money for programs like food stamps. Mr. Clinton has \n     sought to restore $10 billion in benefits. But Republicans on \n     Capitol Hill would approve no more than a total of $2 billion \n     for states.\n       The pending cut in benefits has prompted a large number of \n     legal immigrants to apply for US citizenship. Almost 2 \n     million are expected to apply this year, three times more \n     than applied in 1995.\n       But for elderly immigrants, the naturalization process can \n     be daunting. The US Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     reports that only 9 percent of immigrants older than 65 ever \n     naturalize. Such is the case for the elderly Iranian woman \n     now living in Denver. Her son, who asked not to be named, \n     explains that the entire family fled to the US after the \n     Khomeni government took power in the late 1970s.\n       ``She has gone through this before. She was a wealthy woman \n     and had everything taken from her.'' he says. Undergoing the \n     naturalization process, including the exams to become a \n     citizen, would be difficult. ``Her English is still not very \n     good,'' he says ``There is no way she could pass the test.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2236-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is time--long past time--for the \nSenate to end the embarrassing delay and ratify the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. The convention is the most significant nonproliferation \nagreement to come before the Senate since the 1968 Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. It is a major step toward eliminating this entire \nclass of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. ratification of the \nconvention, before it takes effect on April 29 of this year, is vital \nto our national security. U.S. support for the convention will \ndemonstrate our continued commitment to halting the spread of these \nweapons of mass destruction. This is far too important a subject for \nfurther delays. It is time to end the stalling and bring the convention \nto a vote. There is no justification for a handful of Senate opponents \nof the convention to bottle it up in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  This treaty is clearly bipartisan. It was negotiated under President \nReagan, concluded and signed by President Bush, and submitted to the \nSenate for advice and consent by President Clinton. It has broad \nbipartisan support in the Senate, and it should be voted on by the \nSenate, now.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention deserves this broad support, because \nit makes sense for America's national security. We have the opportunity \nnow to move forward and rid the world of these senseless weapons.\n  The United States initially led by example, by unilaterally \ndestroying our stockpile of chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons \nConvention will extend this requirement to all other nations that \napprove the convention.\n  The convention also provides for monitoring and controls to reduce \nthe proliferation of the chemicals and technology used to make such \nweapons. These restrictions will make it much more difficult for \nterrorists and rogue nations to develop these weapons of mass \ndestruction. The convention also contains provisions to investigate and \npunish violators, including short-notice inspections of chemical \nmanufacturing sites and other facilities.\n  Opponents of the convention argue that since it is not being ratified \nby all nations, it will not stop rogue countries from acquiring these \ndeadly weapons. But no international treaty starts with worldwide \nsupport. Countries suspected of chemical arms violations will be \nsubjected to broad economic and arms embargoes. In fact, the convention \nspecifically restricts the export or transfer of controlled chemicals \nto nonparticipating nations, a clear deterrent to rogue countries.\n  American leadership is essential to halt the proliferation of these \ndeadly weapons. It is already a serious international embarrassment \nthat the United States, the leading country in the development of the \nconvention, has taken over 4 years to ratify it. If not us, who? If not \nnow, when? As of today, 71 nations have ratified the treaty, including \nthe United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada. We stand with Iraq, \nNorth Korea, Libya, and Syria as nonsigners. The Senate needs to act \nnow to end the unconscionable delay in ratifying this urgently needed \nconvention. The longer we delay, the greater the danger of the \nproliferation of these devastating weapons.\n\n  Protecting our own soldiers and civilians from chemical attack is and \nwill continue to be a high priority. Without U.S. support for this \nconvention, rogue nations will have a greater incentive to acquire \nchemical weapons, and our military and civilian populations will face \ngreater risk of chemical attack. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, those \ndirectly responsible for the men and women who are most at risk from \nchemical attack, fully support this convention.\n  It is clearly in our national interest to ratify the convention \nbefore April 29, so that this country can be involved in the initial \nimplementation legislation, the budget negotiations, and the \nverification provisions for tracking chemical weapons worldwide.\n  Critics of the convention say that it will impose high costs on the \nU.S. chemical industry. But our industry and defense representatives \nhave been involved in the development of the convention from the \nbeginning. They helped draft the convention's language to ensure that \ntheir interests will not be compromised. The chemical industry supports \nratification, because they know that if the convention enters into \nforce without U.S. support, they will lose hundreds of millions of \ndollars in annual trade. This economic burden more than offsets the \nmarginal costs that compliance with the convention will impose on the \nindustry.\n  Opponents also argue that the convention will reveal U.S. trade \nsecrets to foreign inspectors. But the United States will always be the \ntarget of industrial espionage, with or without this agreement. Issues \nrelating to the confidentiality of product and processes received a \ngreat deal of attention\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nduring the negotiations, and they are addressed in detail in the \nconvention.\n  In addition, the Commerce Department's expertise in protecting the \nproprietary interests of U.S. companies will continue to assist our \nchemical industry. The strong support for the convention by the \nChemical Manufacturers Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers \nAssociation, and the National Federation of Independent Business is a \ntribute to the fact that the concerns of these industries are fully \nprotected.\n  Ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is vital to America's \nnational security. I commend all those who have done so much to make \nthis achievement possible. It represents arms control at its best, and \nI urge my colleagues to vote for ratification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2238-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 18) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relating to \n     contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today to oppose the proposed constitutional \namendment offered by the junior Senator from South Carolina and the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, first I would like to say a few words about the \nSenator from South Carolina. Our colleague, Senator Hollings, has been \ncalling for meaningful campaign finance reform for perhaps longer than \nany other Member of the U.S. Senate. I disagree with this particular \napproach. But I certainly do not question his sincerity or commitment \nto reform.\n  Mr. President, when the U.S. Senate last had an extended debate on \nthe issue of campaign finance reform back in 1993, the junior Senator \nfrom South Carolina offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to take up \na constitutional amendment very similar to the one that is before us \ntoday.\n  I remember we had a very short period of time before that vote came \nup, and I made a decision and I voted with the Senator from South \nCarolina on that day. I did so because I believed that other than \nbalancing the Federal budget, there was perhaps no more fundamental \nissue facing our country than the need to reform our election laws.\n  Such a serious topic I believed at the time merited at least a \nconsideration of a constitutional amendment. And I will confess to a \ncertain level of frustration at that time with the fact that the Senate \nand the other body had not yet acted to pass meaningful campaign \nfinance reform in that Congress.\n  But, Mr. President, to be candid, I immediately realized, even as I \nwas returning to my office, that that might not have been the best vote \nI ever cast. I started rethinking right away whether I really wanted \nthe U.S. Senate to seriously consider amending the first amendment to \naddress even this subject of which I and so many other Americans feel \npassionately about.\n  Then, 18 months later, my perspective on this question began to \nchange even more as I was presented with two new developments here in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  First, I was given the privilege of serving on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and, second, I would soon learn that the new 104th Congress \nwas to become the engine for a trainload of proposed amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had a very \ngood seat to witness first hand what was being attempted here with \nregard to the basic document of our country, the Constitution.\n  It started with a proposal right away for a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, and we were considering a term limits \nconstitutional amendment, and then a flag desecration constitutional \namendment, then a school prayer amendment, then a supermajority tax \nincrease amendment, and then a victims rights amendment. In all, Mr. \nPresident, 135 constitutional amendments were introduced in the last \nCongress.\n  As I saw legislator after legislator suggest that every social, \neconomic, and political problem we have in this country could be solved \nmerely with enactment of a constitutional amendment, I chose to \nstrongly oppose not only this constitutional amendment but others that \nalso sought to undermine our most treasured founding principle. I \nfirmly believe we must continue this reflective practice of attempting \nto cure each and every political and social ill of our Nation by \ntampering with the U.S. Constitution. Mr. President, the Constitution \nof this country was not a rough draft. We must stop treating it as \nsuch.\n  I want to say, because the Senator from South Carolina has just \narrived and I know that he is not one who has engaged in such an \nattitude toward the Constitution, I know very well he only makes a \nproposal like this with the most serious consideration and for the goal \nof trying to do something about campaign spending. What I am addressing \nhere, what I saw in the last Congress was a wholesale attempt to try to \namend what seemed to be almost virtually every part of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  We must also understand that even if this constitutional amendment \nwere to pass this body today, which it will not, but even if it did, it \nwould not take us one single, solitary step closer to campaign finance \nreform. It is not a silver bullet. This constitutional amendment merely \nempowers the Congress to set mandatory spending limits on congressional \ncandidates. Those are the same kind of mandatory limits that were \nstruck down in the landmark Buckley versus Valeo decision.\n  Here is the question I pose for supporters of this amendment: If this \nconstitutional amendment were to pass the Congress and be ratified by \nthe States, would campaign finance reformers have the necessary 51 \nvotes--or more likely what would be required would be 60 votes--to pass \nlegislation that included mandatory spending limits?\n  Mr. President, in January I joined the senior Senator from Arizona in \nintroducing the first bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal in \nover a decade. That proposal, unlike the law that was considered in \nBuckley versus Valeo, includes voluntary spending limits. That is to \nsay, Mr. President, we offer incentives in the form of free and \ndiscounted television time to encourage but not require candidates to \nlimit their campaign spending. When the Senator from Arizona and I \nbring that legislation to the floor of the Senate, I have no doubt that \nwe will be met with strong resistance from a number of Senators. So the \nnotion that this constitutional amendment will somehow magically pave \nthe way for legislation that includes mandatory spending limits simply \nignores the reality of the opposition that campaign finance reformers \nface here in the Senate and I think would face in the Senate at the \ntime of ratification of any such amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment certainly, if ratified, would remove \nthe obstacle of the Supreme Court. But it will not remove the obstacle \nof those Senators such as the junior Senator from Kentucky who believe \nthat we need more money, not less, in our political system.\n  Most disconcerting to me, Mr. President, is what this proposed \nconstitutional amendment would mean to the first amendment. I find \nnothing more sacred and treasured in our Nation's history than the \nfirst amendment. It is perhaps the one tenet of our Constitution that \nsets our country apart from every mold of government form and tested by \nmankind throughout history. No other country has a provision quite like \nthe first amendment.\n  The first amendment is the bedrock of the Bill of Rights. It has as \nits underpinnings the notion that each individual has a natural and \nfundamental right to disagree with their elected leaders. It says that \na newspaper has an unfettered right to publish expressions of political \nor moral thought. It says that the Government may not establish a \nState-based religion that would infringe on the rights of those\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nindividuals who seek to be freed from such a religious environment.\n  Last year I stood here on the floor of the Senate with a number of my \ncolleagues to oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would \nhave prohibited the desecration of the U.S. flag. I did so because that \namendment as proposed, for the first time in our history, would have \ntaken a chisel to the first amendment and said that individuals have a \nconstitutional right to express themselves unless they are expressing \nthemselves by burning a flag.\n  Now, Mr. President, I deplore as much as anyone in this body any \nindividual who would take a match to the flag of the United States. And \nI am firmly convinced that unrestrained spending on congressional \ncampaigns has eroded the confidence of the American people in their \nGovernment and their leaders. I believe we should speak out against \nthose who desecrate the flag. I believe we should take immediate steps \nto fundamentally overhaul our system of financing campaigns. Mr. \nPresident, I do not believe, as the supporters of this constitutional \namendment and other amendments believe, that we need to amend the U.S. \nConstitution to bring reform to our system of financing campaigns.\n  Mr. President, sometime in the next day or so, this constitutional \namendment will lose. That has been predetermined, or the supporters of \nthis amendment probably would not have been granted consideration here \non the floor of the Senate in this manner. This debate has some \ncharacteristics of a charade. Again, that is not because of the author, \nwho is sincerely advancing this provision because he believes in it and \nhe thinks it should become part of the Constitution. The ultimate \noutcome of the charade is everyone knows this will not pass. There are \nthose who want this to sort of be the campaign finance reform debate \nfor this Congress. Have a couple of days of talk, no amendments, have a \nvote, and be done with it. Be done with campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, believe me, I know the feeling. The Senator from \nArizona and I have been there. We were there last year, last summer. We \nwere allowed to bring our bipartisan campaign finance reform \nlegislation to the floor last June, but here was the deal: No \namendments, just 2 days of debate, and then we had to vote on cloture, \nwhether we will filibuster, just after 2 days. That was it. No chance \nto fix the bill up or make it appealing to other Members like we do in \nother things. That is very similar to what is going on here. We were \nonly allowed to do that after the votes had been counted and assurances \ngiven that our bill would suffer a quick and painless death. It was not \nentirely painless, but it was not unanticipated. We did get a majority \nof the votes in this body on the first try, 54 out of the required 60 \nvotes but, of course, when the process is set up like this, this simply \nwith these few options, we know the outcome and we know what will \nhappen here.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that things just look a little \ndifferent this year on the issue of campaign finance reform than they \ndid a year ago. A few things have happened. The McCain-Feingold bill \nhas not been placed on the Senate Calendar this time. It does not \nappear that the majority leader is terribly interested in bringing it \nup before the March recess, the Memorial Day recess, or possibly even \nbefore the turn of the century. We can speculate about the meaning of \nthat, but one thing is clear: This constitutional amendment will not \npass this body, and until this body makes a commitment to considering \nmeaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform, campaign spending in \nthis country will continue to go completely unrestrained.\n  Nothing in this constitutional amendment before the Senate today \nwould prevent what we witnessed in the last election--the allegation of \nillegality and improprieties, the accusations of abuse, and the selling \nof access to high-ranking Government officials would continue no matter \nwhat the outcome of the vote we had on this constitutional amendment. \nOnly the enactment of legislation, Mr. President, that bans soft money \ncontributions and that encourages candidates to voluntarily limit how \nmuch they spend on their campaigns will make a meaningful difference.\n  Mr. President, I see Members of the Senate as having, really, three \nchoices. First, they can vote for constitutional amendments and \npartisan reform proposals that basically have predetermined fates of \nnever becoming law. That allows you to say you voted for something and \nput the matter aside. Second, they can stand with the junior Senator \nfrom Kentucky and others who stood here on the Senate floor last June \nand told us all was well with our campaign finance system and we should \nall be thrilled that so much money was pouring into the campaign \ncoffers of candidates and parties. That is a second option that some \nfolks are still pursuing. A third option, Mr. President, Senators can \njoin with the Senator from Arizona and myself and others who have tried \nto approach this problem from a bipartisan perspective and have tried \nto craft a reform proposal that is fair to all.\n  We have said on countless occasions that our proposal is open to \nnegotiation. We simply have two goals: To encourage Senate candidates \nto spend less on their campaign and to give challengers an opportunity \nto run a fair and competitive campaign against well-entrenched \nincumbents. If you share those goals, we can work together to produce a \nmeaningful reform proposal.\n  Let me say our proposal is picking up steam. We seem to be adding new \ncosponsors a couple of times a week.\n  Three days ago, I was challenged on the floor by a stated opponent of \nour bill as to why I was unwilling to address, he said, a particular \naspect of our campaign finance system. Now, this surprised me very much \nbecause, in the 18 months since this legislation was originally \nintroduced, this Senator had not approached me one single time to ask \nif I would be willing to address that issue. I told this Senator the \nother night, and I say to all my other colleagues, if you share those \ntwo basic goals of reducing campaign spending and leveling the playing \nfield with the Senator from Arizona and I, we are willing to work with \nyou to address those concerns.\n  Let's do this in the context of a real effort, a real debate, not a \ncharade. That real debate will begin when a comprehensive bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform bill is brought to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. After this amendment fails, and as the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee proceeds with the investigation into illegal and improper \nconduct by Presidential and congressional candidates in the last \nelection, it is my hope that there will be an opportunity for an open \nand full debate on the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, without meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform, \nthe American people will continue to perceive their elected leaders as \nbeing for sale. Unfortunately, they will continue to distrust and doubt \nthe integrity of their own Government.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the Members of the Senate to reject this \namendment, again, with the understanding that I greatly admire the \nsincerity and commitment that its author brings forward on this issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have tremendous respect for my \ncolleague from Wisconsin. I voted for McCain-Feingold. But in a breath, \nwhen the Senator says he wants meaningful campaign finance reform, he \nis asking that the only real meaningful campaign finance reform be \ntabled or rejected.\n  Let's look, for example, at the Senator's own initiative here. In \nMcCain-Feingold, it says that voluntary spending limits are set \naccording to a State's population. You get free broadcast time--30 \nminutes of prime time--and then you get half-price broadcast discounts \nand reduced postal rates. How much is that going to mean to the \nHuffington-type campaigns that we see, where they are ready to spend \n$30 million, or the Steve Forbes-type campaigner, who is ready to spend \n$35 million? That is not even going to give them a burp in their \ncampaign.\n  The candidate's individual contribution limits would be raised from \n$1,000 to $2,000, if the opponent does not agree to the voluntary \nlimits or declares an intent to spend $250,000 or more of their \npersonal funds. But that is just the interest on the money the amounts \nof money we are talking about, were it to be loaned. But they have it \navailable. So that really doesn't control the buying of the office. It \ndoesn't control the\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\nbuying of the office. It is not meaningful campaign finance reform.\n  The Senator wants to ban soft money. Now, here it is. With respect to \nthe Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee against the Federal \nElection Commission, the Federal Election Commission brought suit \ncharging that the Colorado party had violated the party expenditure \nprovision of law by buying radio advertisements attacking the \nDemocratic Party's likely candidate. This is the evil that you have in \nthese decisions. It went on, and the Colorado Republican Party won out. \nWhy? On account of a key little word: coordinated. You have to prove \naffirmatively that the candidate himself called up and suggested it or \ncoordinated it, as they say, even if it is proven he called up. It has \nto be coordinated.\n  Now, I want you all to know the reality of my particular comment. In \nnext year's campaign, newspapers have already run a poll where they \nhave shown that the former Governor of South Carolina, Carol Campbell, \nif we had the election this afternoon, would beat me. All I have to do \nis tell that friend there to tell that friend over there to get the \nthird friend to tell the Democratic Party of South Carolina to start \nrunning radio advertisements attacking the former Governor as a likely \ncandidate. He hasn't announced, but he is a likely candidate.\n\n  But they say everything is fair in love and war and in a political \ncampaign. This is the mischief. It is not just the money, it is the \nmischief that this nonsense promotes. You can't get to it, Mr. \nPresident, without a constitutional amendment. You can't get to it. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and I went through this yesterday \nafternoon. I read down the 20 to 25 campaign finance initiatives we \nhave had over the last 30 years, trying to get a grasp and a grab and a \nhandle on this evil, this corruption. We have tried every way in the \nworld, from having cloture after cloture vote, to arresting the Members \nand bringing them to the floor. We have tried everything. The best \noffer now, they say, is McCain-Feingold, but I have gone down it. It \nhas voluntarism. We know from the campaign in Massachusetts what \n``voluntary'' means in politics; it means temporary. When the two \ngentlemen that ran last year got down to the end of the campaign, they \nsaid of the public agreement they had agreed to--both of them are \naffluent--they said, ``Let's forget about this limit and let's get \naffluent.'' Then they started spending like gangbusters. There you go, \nvoluntary limits and everything else. We have to nail this buzzard with \na limit, a constitutional authority to limit.\n  I hasten to add that I don't prescribe the specific limit. It is \nstill up to Senator McConnell, if he has a majority, to prevail. \nUnfortunately, we see the machine. We see the orchestration. When I \nfirst presented this, we got many Republican cosponsors, and we had a \nmajority, bipartisan vote. Again, on two other occasions, we had a \nbipartisan vote and the support of a majority. But I can see right now \nthe orchestrated drumbeat of first amendment. And they go back to \nPatrick Henry and James Madison, and every other kind of fanciful \nposition, to try to get everybody's mind on ``let's not rip a hole in \nthe first amendment.'' And the very authority they are using that money \nis speech, or speech is money, is Buckley versus Valeo, which does \nwhat? It rips a hole in the first amendment. That is their very holy \ngrail that speaks of money. ``The first time in 200 years'' I don't \nknow how they have the unmitigated gall to come out and say ``the first \ntime in 200 years,'' when in the same breath they are saying, ``Buckley \nversus Valeo, speech is money.'' Buckley versus Valeo limited the \nfreedom of speech. It ``ripped a hole,'' as they phrase it, ``in the \nfirst amendment.'' We can read it.\n  I read from Buckley versus Valeo, the majority opinion:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the actual primary purpose \n     to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption, \n     resulting from large individual financial contributions, in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     a $1,000 contribution limitation . . .\n\n  I will read that again.\n\n       . . . resulting from large individual financial \n     contributions, in order to find a constitutionally sufficient \n     justification for a $1,000 contribution limitation on \n     political discourse.\n\n  They limited the freedom of speech of the contributor when they \nequated speech with money in this famous decision. Everybody knows it. \nBut they want to totally ignore; like this fellow from South Carolina \nis going to rip a hole for the first time in 200 years in the first \namendment. What a charade. They are hiding. They do not want to get \nserious. They don't want to limit expenditures. They don't want what \nthey overwhelmingly supported 20 years ago with the original Federal \nElection Campaign Practices Act that said you are not going to be able \nto buy the office. Now, with Buckley versus Valeo, and particularly \nwith the Colorado decision, you have to buy the office. And they show \nyou how to do it. Two years ahead of time you can see a potential \nopponent. Just let the party start savaging him on radio and TV. If the \ngentleman were disposed to announce, by the time he got ready to \nannounce he would announce for the State border trying to escape. They \nwould make him an outright rascal by that time with money.\n\n  That is not free and open discourse in the political arena. That is \ndiscourse in the financial arena. The financial marketplace is where we \nare allowing the decision to be made. And everybody in America knows \nit. That is why we had the investigating committee by unanimous vote of \nthis body day before yesterday saying we cannot countenance this \nconduct any longer, and we can't dance about on illegalities. We have \nto look at the improper as well as the illegal. So we unanimously voted \nit. But now we are trying to cover up on a party position.\n  Someone asked me, ``Senator, how many votes?'' I said, ``Well, I came \nyesterday with hope. But after I saw the particular activity among some \nof the finest Members that you will ever have in this body, and come \nalong giving me James Madison, Patrick Henry, and the Founding Fathers, \nthey didn't have to get in the horse and wagon and go out and collect \n$14,000 a week in order to get the office. They didn't have to go \naround with their national party asking to cut up the opponent before \nhe could even announce. They didn't ask him to spend an average of over \n$4 million.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, who just withdrew, said he would have to \nget $5 million. So that is more than $14,000 a week--not a day, a \nweek--each and every week between now and election time. Patrick Henry \nhad the freedom of speech and a strong democracy trying to counter--of \ncourse, what the distinguished Senator from Texas commented on, the \nGephardt remark. The truth of the matter is they had it in those days \nas I had it in my days of the beginning political arena. We went around \non the stump. You had to get there, or you were embarrassed. ``Why \nweren't you there?'' You had to answer the questions. It wasn't all of \nthat expense. It wasn't this third party activity in soft money.\n  So don't come now on the floor joining the stonewalling on the other \nside of the aisle that we have an advantage--that we have a financial \nadvantage in spite of all the shenanigans that President Clinton and \nVice President Gore engage in. ``We have $150 million more. Whatever \nthey did, we did better.'' You remember that song in the Broadway play. \nWhatever the Democrats did we can do better on money. And do not be \ntoying around. Get in there and support that Constitution, and read. \nAnd they come out and religiously read it. You can't pass any laws, or \ndo anything with the freedom of speech. And, in the next breath, they \nsay whoopee for Valeo. Money is speech in politics. And we have to \nprotect and limit the contributors. That in and of itself sets aside \ntheir thrust here today.\n  I can read on. Maybe, if we have the time, we will read on because I \nwould be prepared. Some of the colleagues said they would come. But I \ncan see that there is very little interest. I was wondering why the \nmajority leader allowed me to get this on an up-and-down vote. I know I \nhad the amendment on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nAnd the distinguished Senator said, ``Now, look. If you set this aside, \nwithdraw your amendment, we will give you an up-and-down vote and \nsufficient time.'' I can see after yesterday afternoon, Mr. President, \nthat I have had sufficient\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\ntime because whatever we say here, they are cast now in the sort of \nparty preference of spending, spending, spending. I hope we can expose \nit because that wasn't the real opinion over on the other side of the \naisle. I had Senator Kassebaum from Kansas. I had Senator Roth from \nDelaware. We still have, I am pretty sure, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania because he had a personal experience. When he comes \nto the floor you ought to listen very carefully because you can see in \nreality what this bifurcation finding that contributions are \ncorruptive, or gives rather the appearance of corruption, whereas the \nexplosive expenditures in campaigns, ``Oh, that particularly has to be \nallowed to reign free because we have the free public discourse in \npolitics.'' You can see the ``free.'' None of this is free when it says \nhere--``bought'' radio advertisements. You can bet your boots the word \n``bought'' b-o-u-g-h-t--``bought'' radio advertising; the word \n``free.'' Basically every one knows we are not talking about free \nspeech.\n\n  We have to go along with the Supreme Court in our discourse for the \npresent time. But if we can come now with this proposed constitutional \namendment which is stated is needed by a majority of the Senate now \nthree times, by the law professors, by the State attorneys general. And \nthe gentleman here says he has--that was interesting. He has the \nWashington Post and the New York Times.\n  Let's see now. I heard just a minute ago from the Senator from \nWisconsin. So let's see what the Wisconsin State Journal has to say.\n  Our former colleague stood there as sort of the one man on S. 2--that \nsupersonic plane that we can all spend billions on, and now the market \nhas barely supported it financially. The Europeans with subsidies have \nto support it. But the entire Pentagon with all of their minions over \nhere and big budget and everything else, one little Senator, Senator \nProxmire of Wisconsin, stood there time and time again with a staff. \nAnd he finally conquered not just the Pentagon but the consciences of \nall of Senators, and we voted along with him.\n  Now let's see, on Monday, March 10, the Wisconsin State Journal, and \nI quote:\n\n       Part of the American dream is that any child can grow up to \n     be President. Our Government is of, by and for the people, \n     and ordinary citizens should have the opportunity to attain \n     office by virtue of their ideas, their talent and their \n     integrity.\n       Unfortunately, the ideal of self-government has succumbed \n     to rampant special interest money in elections that only an \n     amendment to the U.S. Constitution can restore. Our elections \n     are now auctions, with the average price for a seat in \n     Congress costing more than $500,000.\n\n  In the Senate, the average cost of a seat exceeds $4 million. As \nformer Senator Proxmire said:\n\n       Few Americans have the desire or ability to raise that sort \n     of money.\n\n  It is not only the time devoted to fundraising that we take away from \nthe people's business, but also the fact that really good candidates \nare deterred from running for public office because they see the \nfinancial obstacles raised against them. For example, as was the case \nrecently in Colorado, the party trying to defend an incumbent can come \nin and start savaging the likely opponent without any announcement and \nwithout any controls over their spending because there is no way to \nprove coordination. As a result of this flood of money, the regular, \naverage, sane and prudent man or woman is deterred from running for \noffice and democracy itself is corrupted.\n  It is just not family concerns that causes candidates to bow out. It \nis the fact that if candidates get serious, they will get savaged. \nOften I run into friends of fairly good affluence who say, look, I \ncan't expose my family to all this complete disclosure.\n  People do not want to expose themselves to such public notoriety. If \nyou want a free genealogical study of your family, Mr. President, all \nyou have to do is announce for public office. Opposition researchers \nwill dig up the place you were born, find out what kind of house you \nhad, where you bought a washing machine on credit, automobiles, how \nmuch you contribute to the church, what is in your doctor's records and \neverything else you can think of. Most of it has little to do with \none's qualifications for public office, but that is the nature of the \nbeast--not the issues, not the ideas, not the candidate's integrity, \nbut insinuations that can be distorted and used against an individual \nin the court of public opinion.\n  But the real corruption is in the amount of money necessary in this \nday and age to run a modern political campaign.\n  Let me go back to the quote of our former colleague, former Senator \nProxmire from Wisconsin.\n\n       The latest headlines focus on Democratic donors buying \n     coffee at the White House and on the Republicans $250,000-a-\n     person ``season tickets'' designed to give the largest donors \n     more access to the elected officials. But the problem is not \n     that interested people have given money and in return \n     received access--politicians will always grant audiences to \n     their donors. The problem is that few Americans can play in \n     this big money game. Majority rule takes on a whole new \n     meaning when the majority of campaign cash comes from just \n     one quarter of 1 percent of Americans.\n       Well-heeled interests have largely usurped power from the \n     people. Big money determines who runs for public office and \n     who wins elections. Last November, the House candidates who \n     spent the most won their races 96 percent of the time. In \n     Wisconsin, this held true in all but two races.\n       We know the solution is to limit what anyone can spend on \n     elections, whether they are running for office themselves or \n     giving money to a candidate, party or independent advocacy \n     campaign. But here we run into the problem of the foxes \n     guarding the chicken coop--incumbents have little incentive \n     to change a system they have mastered.\n       However, even incumbents can act when public pressure is \n     high.\n  Let me say that again. ``Even incumbents can act when public pressure \nis high.'' We saw a perfect example of that the day before yesterday. \nThe Republicans they had it greased; they had a majority in that Rules \nCommittee. The leader came out and said this is the scope of the \nhearings that we are going to have, like it or not. We are only going \nto examine alleged illegalities and not the broader question of \nimproper campaign financing. But, as they say, public pressure will \nchange that, and public pressure did.\n  As a result, we had 99 Senators vote on the day before yesterday for \nbroader investigation into improper as well as illegal actions.\n  After Watergate, Congress took bold steps and set limits on campaign \ncash. But in the now infamous 1976 case, Buckley versus Valeo, the \nSupreme Court struck down most of the law, ruling that unlimited \nspending on campaigns deserves protection as free speech. Again, \nquoting Senator Proxmire:\n\n       When we equate spending money with speech, then speech is \n     no longer free.\n\n  I must read that again, because it is so basic.\n\n       When we equate spending money with speech, then speech is \n     no longer free.\n       Moneyed interests can pay the price and the rest of us are \n     free to be silent. The Buckley ruling is simply wrong. \n     Twenty-four State attorneys general have recently called for \n     Buckley to be reversed, as have a host of constitutional \n     scholars. But the current court appears unlikely to do so.\n       As in the past democratic struggles to end slavery and give \n     women the vote, the only certain recourse is to amend the \n     Constitution and overturn the Court. We must clearly \n     authorize Congress and the States to limit campaign \n     contributions and expenditures.\n       A majority of the Senate has voted to support such an \n     amendment in the past but a two-thirds vote is required. \n     Another vote is likely soon. Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wis., \n     has voted for the constitutional amendment in the past but \n     now says he is against it. Senator Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., also \n     has a mixed voting record. He has voted once for and once \n     against a similar amendment. Let's hope that this time they \n     read the headlines about fundraising scandals and decide to \n     change them by voting for the amendment.\n\n  We must take down the For Sale sign on Capitol Hill by authorizing \nlimits on campaign cash with a constitutional amendment. Let us not be \ndaunted by how difficult such a task may appear, for the price of \ninaction is far too great.\n  Mr. President, I thought that we might be daunted by how difficult \nthe task would appear. That argument has been made previously by our \ngood friend Lloyd Cutler. He said it would take 4 to 20 years to get a \nconstitutional amendment enacted, and therefore we were wasting our \ntime. But it has been 20 years since the Buckley decision. Let us not \ntalk about wasting time. That is what we have been doing since Buckley.\n  How are you going to stop doing that? A constitutional amendment. The \narguments were, ``It would take\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\ntoo long,'' or, ``I don't believe in a constitutional amendment; leave \nit as it is.''\n  Now, we know the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, engaged in their \nlittle sweetheart exchange on the floor yesterday. They both believe in \namending the Constitution. They both voted to amend the Constitution in \norder to prevent the desecration of the American flag. In fairness to \nSenator McConnell, he said it was a mistake. Fine business. The Court \nmade a mistake when they outlawed the Federal income tax. So, what did \nthe body politic do? The Congress passed a joint resolution and the \npeople of the United States ratified the 16th amendment. Let us read \nhow you can correct a mistake. Amendment 16:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes \n     on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment \n     among the several States, and without regard to any census or \n     enumeration.\n\n  That is not what they are talking about now, because we know mistakes \nare corrected; mistakes with respect to elections have been corrected. \nThe 21st, 22d, 23d, 24th, and 25th amendments to the Constitution, all \nexcept the last one, have dealt with elections. So we corrected those \nmistakes. One important mistake, perhaps most significant, was the poll \ntax. The people said, ``Wait a minute, disqualifying people from voting \nthrough a poll tax--we are not going to allow it.'' So we adopted that \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Now we want to disqualify candidates, parties, and everyone else from \nrunning for office by allowing the explosive spending of money; \nthousands of dollars, $200,000 for this, $500,000 for that. It is just \noutrageous. Yet, they do not want to recognize it. They want to give me \nPatrick Henry and go back to the first amendment and read it to mean \nthat any restriction ``rips a hole'' in our freedom of speech. But it \nis not so when for the safety of people, we prohibit shouting ``fire'' \nin a theater; not when for national security reasons, we prohibit \ndisclosure of classified documents; not so in the matter of obscenity \nand false and deceptive advertising. Just the other day, concerning a \nbuffer zone around an abortion clinic--the Supreme Court said, oh, no, \nyou don't have a freedom of speech in that buffer zone. That \nrestriction is constitutional.\n  The contention was made that unless people were given the right to be \nheard in that particular area, you were ripping a hole in the first \namendment. The Supreme Court said no. Get out. Don't get into this \nbuffer zone.\n  So we have example after example, but none better than the Senate \nitself that says you cannot have unlimited debate here in this body; we \ncan get a 60-vote majority and hush you. Over on the House side, they \nhave to follow the 3-minute rule; the 5-minute rule. In committees, we \nregularly agree and conform to a 5-minute rule for all the members. We \nknow the value of limiting speech. Don't come here with this sanctimony \nabout the first amendment and Patrick Henry and talking about ripping a \nhole in the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. Buckley \nversus Valeo--the very basic authority that you use when you come to \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate saying speech is money, or money is \nspeech--ripped a hole in the first amendment. That is the exact finding \nof Buckley versus Valeo.\n  So, that will not wash.\n  Mr. President, I have not only the Wisconsin State Journal, I have \nthe Cleveland Plain Dealer. I ask unanimous consent to have that \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Plain Dealer, Mar. 12, 1997]\n\n        Only a Constitutional Amendment can Limit Campaign Cash\n\n                     (By Seth Taft and Amy Simpson)\n\n       Part of the American dream is that any child can grow up to \n     be president. Our government is to be of, by and for the \n     people, and ordinary citizens should be elected to office by \n     virtue of their ideas, talent and integrity.\n       Unfortunately, the ideal of self-government has succumbed \n     to special-interest money in elections and only an amendment \n     to the Constitution will restore it. The average cost of a \n     congressional campaign exceeds $500,000. Few Americans have \n     the desire or ability to raise that sort of money.\n       The latest headlines focus on Democratic donors buying \n     coffee at the White House and on the Republicans' $250,000 a-\n     person ``season tickets'' designed to give the largest donors \n     more face-to-face time with elected officials.\n       But the problem is not that interested people have given \n     money and in return received access; politicians will always \n     grant audiences to their donors.\n       The problem is that an extremely small number of Americans \n     can play in this big-money game. Majority rule takes on a \n     whole new meaning when the majority of campaign cash comes \n     from just one quarter of 1 percent (0.25 percent) of \n     Americans.\n       Big contributions frequently determine who runs for public \n     office and who wins elections. In Ohio's congressional races \n     last year, the candidates who spent the most succeeded in \n     capturing the House seat 84 percent of the time.\n       We know the solution is to limit what anyone can spend on \n     elections, whether he is running for office or giving money \n     to a candidate, a party or an independent advocacy campaign. \n     But current incumbents have little incentive to change a \n     system they have mastered.\n       However, even incumbents can act when public pressure is \n     high. After Watergate, Congress took bold steps and set \n     limits on campaign cash. But, in the now infamous 1976 \n     decision in Buckley vs. Valeo, the Supreme Court struck down \n     most of the law, ruling that unlimited spending on campaigns \n     deserved protection as free speech.\n       Since 1994, voters in five states have passed initiatives \n     to set low contribution limits, $100 in most races, for state \n     elections. These initiatives have been overturned in two \n     states by courts that thought themselves better able than the \n     public to set ``reasonable'' limits. Proposals that would \n     require candidates to raise their funds from within their \n     districts face a similar fate.\n       When we equate spending money with speech, then speech is \n     no longer free. Wealthy interests can pay the price, and the \n     rest of us are free to be silent. The Buckley ruling is \n     simply wrong. Twenty-four state attorneys general recently \n     called for its reversal, as have a host of constitutional \n     scholars. But the current court appears unlikely to do so.\n       As in the democratic struggles to end slavery and give \n     women the vote, the only certain recourse is to amend the \n     Constitution and overturn the court. We must clearly \n     authorize Congress and the states to limit campaign \n     contributions and expenditures.\n       A majority of the U.S. Senate has voted to support such an \n     amendment in the past, but a two-thirds vote is required. \n     Another vote is likely within the next week.\n       In the past, Sen. Mike DeWine has voted against and Sen. \n     John Glenn has voted for such an amendment. Let's hope that \n     this time, they read the headlines about fund-raising \n     scandals and decide to change them by voting for the \n     amendment.\n       We don't like using the Constitution for this purpose, but \n     the Buckley-Valeo decision makes it necessary. Campaign \n     spending limits that do not apply to independent committees \n     and individuals become meaningless.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. These liberal eastern papers, the Washington Post and \nthe New York Times make the argument of free speech. I hope you \nmidwesterners do not get bitten by that. I want to see you stay in the \nU.S. Senate. I want to see you all continue to serve. The best way is \nnot to get wrapped around and go back to the Midwest and say that the \nACLU is a wonderful authority. I know how to lose an election. I have \nlost before. I don't know any quicker way to lose one than to run \naround in my backyard or your backyard, Mr. President, quoting the \nACLU. You folks have to be embarrassed with this kind of argument about \nfirst amendment and the ACLU. And even more embarrassing is the \nanecdotal nonsense they put up relative to what could happen. The \nSenator from Utah even said Congress might decide not to let anyone \noppose them.\n  He got into a wonderful discourse with the Senator from Kentucky. He \nsaid if this amendment passed, Congress could put such low limits that \nthe opponent's name would never become known and that Congress might \ndecide not to let anyone oppose them.\n  Of course, in the next breath they say it is vague, because the \nlanguage says ``reasonable,'' ``reasonable limits.''\n\n  The courts said they are going to decide what is reasonable. But they \nput up all kinds of examples about how newspapers might write an \neditorial against someone. And they said that could be a contribution \nfor or a contribution against.\n  Right now the newspapers do write editorials for and do write \neditorials against. We have the free press. No one has the gall to \ncontend that is a contribution in the context of being a violation. No \none is going to contend that now, and they are not going to contend it \nlater on.\n  But these are all straw men, because they do not have the argument. \nBut they have the frontal assault of Patrick Henry and the first \namendment.\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\nAnd trying to say, as the Senator from Texas said, the simple question \nis ``Do you believe in free speech or not?'' He says if he can answer \nthis question, then he is home free. All 100 of us believe in that. \nThat is not what we are voting on. The question is, Do you believe in \nlimiting spending or not? They know it. And they do not want to hear of \nit. So they bring out the volume and repetition of numerous Senators \ntalking about 200 years and the first amendment and Patrick Henry. If \nyou pass this, you can go back to what we voted for in 1974 and have \ncomplete disclosure, rules against bundling, rules against soft money, \nrules against individual wealth buying elections. It would free up the \nspeech of the poor. Buckley really freed up the speech of the rich, but \nit has taken away freedom of speech from the poor. That is the actual \neffect of the decision, and we are suffering from it.\n  We have lost the confidence of the people in the political \ninstitutions up here because we do not want to deal with it. We tried \nand tried and tried over a 30-year period without success and now we \nare using the octopus approach. We want to sneak off in the dark ink of \na charade about Patrick Henry, the first amendment, and what may \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, let us go back to better times. Let us go back to \nbetter times.\n  What happened was, in better times, we had the orderly process of \nseveral hearings before the Judiciary Committee. We had several \nwitnesses. And I come to the distinguished Mr. Lloyd Cutler, who served \nas Counsel for the President.\n  But he says now on the House side:\n\n       An amendment would take too long to adopt, 4 to 10 years.\n\n  He did not testify on behalf of the Commission for the Constitutional \nSystem heretofore, but he says now that it would take too long. We know \nthat is totally wrong. The last five amendments preceding the most \nrecent one, which took 200 years, took an average of 20 months to \nratify.\n  The gentleman, I think, is suffering from battle fatigue because he \nsaid: This could be a camel's-nose-under-the-tent aspect. He did not \nsee a camel's-nose-under-the-tent aspect when he was representing the \nCommission for the Constitutional System. He says that the Hollings \nresolution in the Senate authorizes ``reasonable regulation of \nexpenditures. Only the Supreme Court can draw the line between \nreasonable and unreasonable.''\n  The courts are always directing the jurors in determining if they \nhave gotten a reasonable decision, the ``reasonable, sane and prudent \nman,'' in law talk, is the test. We did not have ``reasonable'' when we \nfirst drafted it, but we put it in there so the amendment will not look \ncategorical and result in a legal contest. The Supreme Court is \ncertainly going to decide if it is unreasonable, as they have decided \nthat the matter of contributions is constitutional, if limited to that \nspeech, but unconstitutional if you limit the speech of those who spend \nit.\n  Let me read parts of the hearing here that we had before the \nJudiciary Committee some 10 years ago. We had already been on this a \ndog-chasing-its-tail solution for 10 years.\n\n       My name is Lloyd N. Cutler. Along with Senator Nancy \n     Kassebaum of Kansas and Mr. Douglas Dillon, I am a Co-\n     Chairman of the Committee on the Constitutional System, a \n     group of several hundred present and former legislators, \n     executive branch officials, political party officials, \n     professors and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing \n     and correcting some of the weaknesses that have developed in \n     our political system.\n       One of the most glaring weaknesses, of course, is the \n     rapidly escalating cost of political campaigns, and the \n     growing dependence of incumbents and candidates on money from \n     interest groups who expect the recipient to vote in favor of \n     their particular interests. Incumbents and candidates must \n     devote large portions of their time to begging for money; \n     they are often tempted to vote the conflicting interests of \n     their contributors and to create a hodgepodge of conflicting \n     and indefensible policies; and in turn public frustration \n     with these policies creates cynicism and contempt for the \n     entire political process.\n       A serious attempt to deal with the campaign financing \n     problem was made in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 \n     and the 1976 amendments, which set maximum limits on the \n     amounts of individual contributions and on the aggregate \n     expenditures of candidates and so-called independent \n     committees supporting such candidates. The constitutionality \n     of these provisions was challenged in the famous case of \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, in which I had the honor of \n     sharing the argument in support of the statute with Professor \n     Archibald Cox. While the Supreme Court sustained the \n     constitutionality of the limits on contributions, it struck \n     down the provision limiting expenditures for candidates and \n     independent committees supporting such candidates. It found \n     an inseparable connection between an expenditure limit and \n     the extent of a candidate's or committee's political speech, \n     which did not exist in the case of a limit on the size of \n     each contribution by a non-speaker unaccompanied by any limit \n     on the aggregate amount a candidate could raise. It also \n     found little if any proven connection between corruption and \n     the size of a candidate's aggregate expenditures, as \n     distinguished from the size of individual contributions to a \n     candidate.\n       The Court did, however, approve the Presidential Campaign \n     Financing Fund created by the 1976 amendments, including the \n     condition it imposed barring any presidential nominee who \n     accepted the public funds from spending more than a specified \n     limit. However, it remains unconstitutional for Congress to \n     place any limits on expenditures by independent committees on \n     behalf of a candidate. In recent presidential elections these \n     independent expenditures on behalf of one candidate exceeded \n     the amount of federal funding he accepted. Moreover, so long \n     as the Congress remains deadlocked on proposed legislation \n     for the public financing of Congressional campaigns, it is \n     not possible to use the public financing device as a means of \n     limiting Congressional campaign expenditures.\n\n  Mind you, Mr. President, as I cover this particular testimony, it is \n10 years ago. They are talking about the dilemma, the problem, and how \nit was exacerbating at that particular time. You can tell the \nfrustration from the wording of this testimony.\n  I go to the quote of Mr. Cutler:\n\n       Accordingly, the Committee on the Constitutional System has \n     come to the conclusion that the only effective way to limit \n     the explosive growth of campaign financing is to adopt a \n     constitutional amendment.\n\n  Now, my colleague from Kentucky says you do not have any authority \nand there is no constituency. The fact of the matter is that this \nparticular committee is a group of several hundred present and former \nlegislators, executive branch officials, political party officials, \nprofessors, and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing and \ncorrecting some of the weaknesses that have developed in our political \nsystem.\n  Not the ACLU. I do not rely on the ACLU for my case. I want to win \nthis thing. I do not want to be spreading the dark ink of the ACLU in \nthe Washington Post. Go down to the Washington Post and ask them for \nfree speech. Say, ``I want a little free speech. Not a whole page, a \nhalf, maybe a quarter of a page.'' They will not give you a little \ntidbit of a column free.\n  Going back to the testimony before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       The amendment would be a very simple one consisting of only \n     46 words. It would state merely that ``Congress shall have \n     power to set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures by or \n     in support of any candidate in the primary or general \n     election for federal office. The States shall have the same \n     power with respect to campaign expenditures in elections for \n     state and local offices.''\n\n  This was 10 years ago, Mr. President, and those who have been working \non this particular problem copied the language, adopted the suggestion. \nIt was a reasonable thing because here are the best of minds, without a \nparticular Republican bent or Democratic bent or interest, who said \nhere is the way to do it not only constitutionally but in a \nconstitutionally sound manner so that the court could properly \ninterpret it.\n  Let me go back to the testimony of Mr. Cutler:\n\n       Our proposed amendment would enable Congress to set limits \n     not only on direct expenditures by candidates and their own \n     committees, but also on expenditures by so-called independent \n     committees in support of such a candidate. The details of the \n     actual limits would be contained in future legislation and \n     could be changed from time to time as Congress in its \n     judgment sees fit.\n       It may of course be argued that the proposed amendment, by \n     authorizing reasonable limits on expenditures, would \n     necessarily set limits on the quantity of speech on behalf of \n     a candidate and that any limits, no matter how ample, is \n     undesirable. But in our view the evidence is overwhelming by \n     now that unlimited campaign expenditures will eventually grow \n     to the point where they consume so much of our political \n     energies and so fracture our political consensus that they \n     will make the political process incapable of governing \n     effectively.\n\n  Mr. President, I divert here to emphasize just exactly that concern \nthat our political consensus will be so fractured that it will make \n``the political process incapable of governing effectively.'' Put that \non as a test to this\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\nparticular Congress. If you think we have governed effectively, I have \ngrave misgivings with that opinion. I think that is exactly where we \nare, and exactly was the concern 10 years ago.\n  And I continue to quote the testimony of Mr. Cutler:\n\n       Even Congress has found that unlimited speech can destroy \n     the power to govern; that is why the House of Representatives \n     has imposed time limits on Members' speeches for decades and \n     why the Senator has adopted a rule permitting 60 Senators to \n     end a filibuster. One might fairly paraphrase Lord Acton's \n     famous aphorism about power by saying, ``All political money \n     corrupts; unlimited political money corrupts absolutely.''\n\n  There is no question in this Senator's mind. Quoting further:\n\n       Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would not be discouraged from \n     taking the amendment route by any feeling that constitutional \n     amendments take too long to get ratified.\n\n  You see, Cutler has come over from the other side earlier this year \nand he said it would take too long. He was not worried then, some 10 \nyears ago, because he knew exactly that. The last five amendments at \nthat particular time were all ratified within the 20-month period. Now \nhe has misgivings.\n\n  Let me quote further:\n\n       The fact is that the great majority of amendments submitted \n     by Congress to the States during the last 50 years have been \n     ratified within 20 months after they were submitted. All \n     polls show that the public strongly supports limits on \n     campaign expenditures. The principal delay will be in getting \n     the amendment through Congress. Since that is going to be a \n     difficult task, we ought to start immediately. Unlimited \n     campaign expenditures and the political diseases they cause \n     are going to increase at least as rapidly as new cases of \n     AIDS, and it is high time to start getting serious about the \n     problem.\n       Mr. Chairman, on three past occasions we the people have \n     amended the Constitution to correct weaknesses in that \n     rightly revered document as interpreted by the Supreme Court. \n     On at least two of these occasions--the Dred Scott decision \n     and the decision striking down federal income taxes, history \n     has subsequently confirmed that the amendments were essential \n     to our development as a healthy, just and powerful society. A \n     third such challenge is now before us. The time has come to \n     meet it.\n\n  That was in March 1988.\n  Now, Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleagues on the Senate \nfloor. At this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, are we operating on a time \nagreement now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say that it is not often on \nmatters such as this one that I am on the floor in opposition to \nsomething that Senator Hollings favors. We normally are here on either \neconomic matters or budget matters or the like. I want to say right up \nfront while I totally disagree that we should adopt this constitutional \namendment and send it out to the States for ratification, I believe it \nis fair to say that among the Senators who have been talking about \nlimiting or dramatically changing the campaign laws of this land, of \nlimiting of the amount of money that can be spent, at least this \namendment is honest.\n  It faces the reality right between the eyes, and the Supreme Court of \nthe United States has said that you can't do that because you are \nlimiting freedom of speech. And the distinguished Senator has said, OK, \nif that is the case, I want to change the Constitution, so we can do \nit. At least that is a straightforward position, instead of coming here \nand trying to get around the Supreme Court decisions and around the \nclause in the U.S. Constitution that protects freedom of speech.\n  Having said that, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk with the \nSenate about my views and version of why we should not adopt this \namendment. First of all, I believe that I should lead off by saying, \nyesterday afternoon, I was in my office when some speeches were being \ndelivered on the floor of the Senate. I don't think I am much different \nfrom most Senators. Normally, if you have your set on and somebody is \nspeaking on the floor, even though we all love them dearly and they are \ngreat speakers and they have great things to say, we don't listen very \noften--at least, if we are busy in the office, and we do other things.\n  But I took time out to listen to Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and I \ntried to tell him this personally so it would precede me saying it on \nthe floor, I thought his remarks yesterday afternoon were very \neloquent. They expressed a very good picture of the history of our \nConstitution and, in particular, of that part of our Constitution that \nwe so glibly say is freedom of speech, protected by that wonderful \ndocument and the Bill of Rights.\n  Having said that, I was not prepared to argue that this amendment is \nbroad enough to perhaps some day affect the editorial policy of the \nnewspapers. I didn't come here particularly prepared to argue that \npoint. But over the evening I read it again and read my remarks. I am \nprepared to say that I believe the Congress of the United States, if \nthis amendment ever became law, will clearly then be able to determine \nhow we can change freedom of speech in the manner described, and to \nwhat extent and when and who will be affected by our changes. I think \nwhere this amendment says that the amount of expenditures that may be \nmade by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate for nomination \nfor election to a Federal office, and where it is said that you are \nable to put limitations on the amount of contributions that may be \naccepted, I believe it is entirely possible that some time out in the \nfuture, if this were in fact the law of the land, Congress could decide \nthat a newspaper could only write one editorial a week on behalf of its \nfavorite U.S. Senate candidate because they might equate that with an \nexpenditure. In fact, they might be able to ask, what's the newspaper \ncharging for advertising? And then they might say, when you write \nsomething in that paper about a candidate expressing your views, we are \ngoing to assume that it is worth at least the advertising costs of the \npaper.\n  Now, frankly, I am giving you kind of a shirt-sleeve lawyer's \nopinion. But I can see out there in the future where, under the right \ncircumstances, with a Congress that is being beaten up by newspapers, \nor perhaps the majority party being beaten up by newspapers or \neditorials on television, they might indeed decide that they are going \nto determine the expenditures that can be made and attempt to change \nour most protected basic right.\n  Now, having said that I believe the first amendment guaranteeing free \nspeech is the matrix of every other freedom we have, and the most \nfundamental and urgent application of free speech is to conduct \ncampaigns for political office. Elections and campaigns that lead up to \nthose elections are how the democratic process works. Therefore, I \nrepeat, the amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech is the matrix of \nevery other freedom because it is through the democratic process, the \nselection of candidates, perhaps even the selection of the philosophy \nor the ideology of candidates and parties, that decisions are made \nabout our lives and are made about our future. And, therefore, freedom \nof speech, if controlled, can control that which affects our lives in a \nmost profound way.\n  I regret to say that while I am not one who comes to the floor very \noften and chooses to become popular at home by beating up on Congress--\nin fact, I don't think I have done that very often in my life--I \nbelieve it is a mistake to put this power in the hands of a partisan \nCongress, with the potential for a President of the same party with a \nhuge majority in the Congress, this absolute power to abridge freedom \nof speech and decide just how much can be spent by whom, what \norganizations can spend how much on which candidates. The power to \ndetermine how much a right-to-life organization can spend on behalf of \nits candidates or party, or its opposition organization in America, how \nmuch they can spend, and a myriad of other organizations that are out \nthere trying to affect Government and how Government works and how we \nvote--for Congress to be able to regulate that means we are placing in \nthe hands of Congress and a President of the party in control the \nabsolute and unequivocal future destiny of the election process. They \nwill determine it either directly or indirectly, just as certain as you \nwrite in black ink on white paper so that it will be most legible.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since independent expenditures and so-called \nlegislative\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\nadvocacy ads, which have been so widely condemned by the reformers, are \nconstitutionally protected speech, doesn't the Senator think it is \nentirely possible that the Congress, given the power to control that \nspeech by those outside groups, might decide to shut it off entirely, \nconclude there is nothing reasonable about any of those kinds of \nexpressions, if this amendment were to be passed?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think, given the right circumstances, that is \nentirely possible. I can dream up a scenario in my mind where it would \nprobably be constitutional under this amendment. You could have a \nsituation in the country where Congress would make a finding, which may \nbe backed up by what's going out in society. Those kinds of \nexpenditures could cause harm in America, at least to some major group \nthat thought the unlimited use of propaganda --this is they would call \nit--has been harmful to the country, so they will say that we will have \nnone of it.\n  Let me say, that is one issue, it is clear to me, that in and of \nitself ought to cause us to say no to this amendment. I think there is \neven a more serious one. I guess I will choose to say, as my point No. \n2, that it's hard enough to win a fight with someone who buys paper by \nthe ton and ink by the barrel. That leads me to ask, who uses freedom \nof speech most in the United States? Who does? The media of America. \nThe media of America, be it the newspapers, radio, television, or \nwhatever other media we have. That is the principal use of freedom of \nspeech in the United States. They, combined, are the big makers of \nnews. They are the ones who write the news, who talk the news, who \npresent the issues on TV. Frankly, the media sets the agenda. They have \neven been called the ``fourth estate,'' meaning that we have three \nbranches of government, and they are also a branch of government. Well, \nwe say: Protect them.\n  As a matter of fact, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a very historic case, \nNew York Times versus Sullivan, a 1964 case, has even held that for a \npublic personage to have a cause of action against the media, which has \nthe right to freedom of speech, to have the right to sue because they \ntold an untruth, you can't sustain a cause of action unless it is made \nwith actual malice, with knowledge that the statement was false or with \nreckless disregard of whether it is false or not. That is how important \nwe think that right is.\n\n  Should it surprise anyone that those who use freedom of the speech in \nthe press of America--that they have their prejudices? Should it \nsurprise anyone that they pick and choose candidates? Should it \nsurprise anyone that they have a philosophy? Should it surprise anyone, \neven though they are my good friends, that they are predominantly \nliberal and predominantly Democrats in terms of party affiliation? That \njust happens to be true. If they were without opinion and used no \ndiscretion, what good would they be as the fourth estate in America? \nFor they would be dullsville, and nobody would care what they said. So \nthey are not that. And they can really influence a candidate or an \nelected officer's future. They can even do it by neglect, if they \nchoose. They can fail to cover what somebody does in their elected \noffice because they, either directly or in some other way, are \nprejudiced by what Senator Jones from Kansas says, and so it doesn't \nappear in the newspapers in the State of Kansas. Or, at least in one \nchain perhaps, or at least, if that is too far-fetched, a certain \nreporter won't write about Senator Jones, and he is the reporter that \nwrites the front page story all of the time. That is kind of the benign \nneglect of the media.\n  What we know is happening in America is that we have moved away from \neditorial writing only appearing on the editorial pages of the paper. \nIt now also is appearing in the stories in the media. TV has gone from \njust reporting news to interpreting the news and interpreting \nsituations in America. News shows which do that abound. Should it \nsurprise anyone that sometimes the media take a position in opposition \nto a President, in opposition to a Senator, in opposition to a party, \nin opposition to a philosophy of government?\n  Mr. President, if that is the case, where is the candidate or elected \nofficeholder going to get the resources to tell his side of the story? \nI know where they are getting that kind of resource today. They are \ngetting it because people contribute to their campaign, and they run \nads, or they buy time, or they put out brochures, or they get on a \nradio show and pay for the time. And they say, ``If the media and my \nopponent can get on and get free time, I want to get on and pay for \nit.'' Whatever the media puts on is their choice, and they are free to \ndo as much as they want.\n  I am not going to stand here and be critical of that. In fact, I am \nsuggesting that they are important in this society. It leads me to the \nconclusion that they have a right to try to be effective in trying to \nchange public opinion. When they do that and exercise that prerogative, \nthey create a situation which in the combat over political ideas \nrequires that, if you are going to respond and have a chance of being \nheard, you must compete either in ink, or in paper, or in voice over \nthe radio network, or in your picture and voice on television. Or else, \nhow can you get the message across?\n  Having said that, I am absolutely convinced that while I stand here \nand give credence to the United States Congress having great authority, \nand I would even say that over history, I trust its collective wisdom, \nI can already in my time in the U.S. Senate find many occasions when I \nthink we weren't very wise and we passed laws that weren't the very \nbest. But even if I were to say over time that we perhaps come out on \nthe wise side more times than not, I am not prepared to give the United \nStates Congress the authority to control the destiny and the lives of \npolitical figures today or in the future when it comes to how much of \ntheir resources, or resources that others want to give to them, that \nthey can use to make their case.\n  I believe it is a greater and more frightening evil to control the \nopportunity for candidates to make their case through the exercise of \nfree speech. That is a far more serious problem for America than the \nconcern over too much campaign spending.\n  We can pass reasonable rules and regulations regarding campaign \ncontributions. Clearly we already have. We have limited PAC \ncontributions. We have individual contributions limited. But when it \ncomes to those things that the U.S. Supreme Court has already said are \nprotected because they are political speech, isn't it interesting? Some \npeople, including this Senator, had trouble understanding what they \nwere talking about when they said that spending is equal to free \nspeech. If you want to spend your money on a campaign, the use of that \nmoney is speech, they said. Well, I understand it now. I hope I have \nexpressed it today. It is precisely what I have been talking about. For \nwhat other way than through the use of resources can you get your \nspeech heard and exercise that freedom I speak of? How can you get your \nmessage out to the public if you are limited as to how much, or when, \nor which organization can spend how much in behalf of your candidacy, \nyour position, or your ideology?\n\n  So from my standpoint the issue is really very, very clear and very \nsimple. We should not change the Constitution of the United States when \nit comes to that part of this protected speech that has to do with \ncandidates and political parties getting their message across through \nthe use of resources. Nothing, in my opinion, will suffice other than \nto leave the decision of what is needed and how it will be used in the \nhands of the person claiming the freedom. To place it in the hands of \nsomebody else to determine for that person claiming that freedom will, \nin my opinion, render the freedom useless. For the more you try to tell \nsomebody how to exercise their right to free speech and when they can \nexercise it, the more the freedom becomes a nonfreedom. It becomes \ncontrol rather than opportunity to enter into combat in a way that is \nequal and able to meet any circumstance. I am fully aware that there \nare many other approaches that we can take to modifying our campaign \nlaws. And some of those being discussed will be constitutional without \nthis change.\n  But I for one want to close today saying to the U.S. Senate, and to \nthe people of the United States, do you really want Congress to be the \none that manages by statute the use of this freedom, political freedom, \nthe freedom of political parties and people running for office to use \nresources in a way that they\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\nthink is best to get their message out, their cause, and to exercise \ntheir rights?\n  Mr. President, I want to make 5 points about this resolution and to \nmake them clearly, strongly and simply.\n  Point one: This is an attempt to make the unconstitutional \nconstitutional.\n  The first amendment guaranteeing free speech is the matrix of every \nother freedom we have.\n  The most fundamental and urgent application of free speech is to \nconduct campaigns for political office.\n  Elections and the campaigns leading up to those elections, after all, \nare how the democratic process works.\n  Point two: It's hard enough to win a fight with someone who buys \npaper by the ton and ink by the barrel. This amendment would make it \nimpossible to win that fight.\n  The liberal news media exercises its free speech rights more than any \nother individual or entity in the United States. They are the Big \nOpinion Makers. They compose the editorials, write the news, talk the \nnews, present the issues on TV. Frankly, they set the agenda.\n  The media are the ones who exercise freedom of speech as it pertains \nto politics. They are on the airwaves every day. It used to be that \nthere was political speech on the news at 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. In 1997, \nthere is news at 6 a.m., 7 a.m., noon, 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 10 p.m., \nand 11 p.m. on the regular channels. We also have numerous 24-hour news \nchannels.\n  No one would tolerate a suggestion that reporting and editorializing \nshould be censored or otherwise limited or that there should be--to use \nthe language of the proposed amendment --``reasonable limits.''\n  All of the political speech contained on the news is protected. In \nNew York Times versus Sullivan (1964) the Supreme Court held that \npublic officials could maintain defamation actions only upon proof that \nthe media's statement was made with ``actual malice'' defined by the \nCourt as made ``with knowledge that it [the statement] was false or \nwith reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.'' As a result, \nthe ``comfort zone of protection'' given to a political figure or \ncandidate for public office under the defamation actions for libel and \nslander is very small. Public figures are given little protection.\n  Defamation stands virtually alone in the 20th century tort law. Every \nother major substantive area has expanded a plaintiff's right to \nrecover, while in defamation the balance has shifted, and quite \ndramatically, in favor of the media defendant.\n  Point three: Government rationing of political speech by candidates \nwill increase the power of the media, which has an unlimited free \nspeech right.\n  The makers of the Constitution, influenced not only by their own \nexperience but also by theorists such as Montesquieu, consciously \nprovided for allocation of national authority among the executive, the \nlegislative and the judicial branches. By insisting upon separation of \npowers, the Framers sought to protect against tyranny. Over the years, \nthe media has emerged as the fourth branch of Government. Creating an \nelite of those with unlimited free speech will dangerously upset the \nbalance of power and make the Fourth Estate the most powerful. This \nruns contrary to our fundamental notions of freedom and effective \ndemocracy.\n  The members of the fourth estate are mere mortals and they have \nstrong biases.\n  Reporters are opinionated. Arguably, they are the most politically \nhomogenous and biased group in American politics today. Most studies of \nmedia voting behavior show 9 out of 10 reporters and editors voting for \nliberal Democratic candidates. And the media coverage mimics the \nmedia's voting pattern.\n  A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan \nWashington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly \nfavored President Clinton this past election season.\n  In September, Clinton received 54 percent positive coverage on the \nnetworks' evening news programs, compared with only 30 percent for Bob \nDole. The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81 percent of the \ntime, his social policies 78 percent of the time; and his conduct as a \ncandidate 81 percent of the time. Yet, voters view the media as \nbalanced.\n  We have TV commentators who criticize ideology, personalities, and \nlifestyle. Yet, the quantity, quality, and content of the media \nprograms and articles are totally protected and unrestricted.\n  A paper could editorialize every day of the week, every week of the \nyear against a candidate. If an elected official or candidate wants to \nrespond, he has to buy an ad. He has to make an expenditure.\n  At the other extreme, a Senator could toil tirelessly day in and day \nout in meetings, in committee, on the Senate floor. An unfriendly paper \ncould ignore his efforts during his entire term. If that Senator wants \nto let voters know of his accomplishments he has to buy an ad. He has \nto make an expenditure to compensate for the medias' benign neglect of \nhis efforts. The Supreme Court is correct, free speech is a fundamental \nright essential to getting reelected. The Constitution is right to \nprotect this fundamental right.\n  My question to Senators is: Do you really think it is wise to \nexclusively vest the power of unlimited speech in the fourth branch? If \nthe Founding Fathers were wise enough to resist tyranny by requiring a \nbalance of power among the branches that existed when they wrote the \nConstitution, we should recognize this amendment as a bald-faced \nattempt to shift the balance of power from the candidates involved in \nthe legislative and executive branches, over to the media. In practical \nterms this reserves to the media the control of freedom itself.\n  The ACLU has called this proposal a recipe for disaster. This \namendment makes mincemeat out of the first amendment. Mincemeat belongs \non a menu, not in the Constitution.\n  Point four: Being an incumbent is a formidable advantage and this \namendment would make this advantage insurmountable.\n  Spending is the way challengers combat the inherent advantages of \nincumbency, such as name recognition, access to media, and franked \nmail.\n  Besides, the most important and plentiful money spent for political \npurposes is call the Federal budget--$1.6 trillion and rising.\n  Federal spending--along with the myriad regulations and subsidizing \nactivities such as protectionist measures--often amounts to vote-\nbuying.\n  Write a tax bill and wealth is redistributed.\n  This amendment will allow incumbents to write limits on campaign \nspending. These limits, when coupled with the inherent advantages of \nincumbency, will make it more difficult for challengers to compete.\n  History gave us 40 years of House control by Democrats. If this \namendment had been law, the ``reasonable'' limits would have been \nwritten decade after decade in a self-preserving fashion to favor the \nruling party. Is there any doubt that the spending limits would give \nany challenger a fighting chance?\n  Point five: When amending the constitution, err on the side of \ncaution--you better be very careful.\n  Mr. President, today truly is a remarkable day. In the name of \n``campaign finance reform,'' some of our distinguished colleagues have \ncome to the floor to offer a resolution which strikes at the very heart \nof one of the fundamental freedoms the Founding Fathers of this great \nNation sought to protect. While I agree that our campaign finance laws \nare in need of change, amending the first amendment to allow the \nGovernment to restrict political speech simply is not the way to reform \nthe system.\n  The authors of the first amendment were very straightforward: \n``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech.''\n  Mr. President, surely none of us here today agrees with all of the \n``speech'' people in this county make, especially in this town. I don't \nlike the fact that pornography exists. I don't like violence on TV But \nregardless of what I like, the first amendment protects this type of \nspeech. While the protections of the first amendment are not absolute \nin all circumstances--we all know that the amendment does not protect \none's right to yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater--the right to free \nspeech is nearly\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\nabsolute when that speech is directed toward the political process.\n  Throughout its jurisprudence, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed this \nnotion time and time again. In recounting the history of the first \namendment, the Court in the past has observed that: ``there is \npractically universal agreement that a major purpose of the first \namendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs * \n* * of course including discussions of candidates.'' The Court also has \nnoted that: ``It can hardly be doubted that the constitutional \nguarantee [of the right to free speech] has its fullest and most urgent \napplication precisely to the conduct for campaigns for political \noffice.''\n  The Court extended these principles to campaign spending in the \nBuckley case and held that restrictions on campaign expenditures are \nimproper under the first amendment. The Court's decision can be summed \nup very simply: restrictions on the resources needed to make political \nspeech heard are restrictions on political speech itself. As the Court \nhas said, ``the distribution of the humblest handbill'' costs money and \nthe Court consistently and properly has refused to make a distinction \nbetween the humble handbill and other forms of political speech. They \nall deserve first amendment protection.\n  The authors of this proposal are not so straightforward. It will \nregulate who may speak, when, where, for how long, and for what \npurpose.\n  For some, this debate will be about the wisdom of the Supreme Court's \ndecision in the Buckley case and those decisions which followed it. \nSupporters of this amendment believe that, if spending equals speech, \nthen only those with a lot of money will be able to participate in the \npolitical process.\n  I look at the problem from a different perspective: is it at all \nproper to amend the organic law of this land to allow the Government to \nbegin regulating the political speech of individuals and groups? It \nruns contrary to the spirit of the entire Constitution to answer that \nquestion in the affirmative.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote that ``there are rights which it is \nuseless to surrender to the government, and which governments yet have \nalways sought to invade. Among these are the rights of thinking and \npublishing our thoughts by speaking and writing.'' This amendment would \nbe the first step toward surrender, the first step toward putting the \nFederal Government in control of all political speech in America.\n  Let us take a look at the language of the proposed amendment, because \nthere are two areas which I believe need to be mentioned.\n  First, the resolution gives Congress the power to set reasonable \nlimits on campaign contributions and expenditures. Proponents of this \namendment and campaign finance reform bills like McCain-Feingold claim \nthat the current system favors wealthy candidates and protects \nincumbents able to raise large amounts of money because of their name \nrecognition, seniority or membership on important committees.\n  Yet--under this amendment--who would be responsible for making the \ninitial determination of what is ``reasonable''? Incumbents. Members of \nCongress. Setting aside whether it is at all wise to allow the \nGovernment to regulate political speech, I also wonder whether this \namendment would accomplish the goals many of its supporters would hope \nfor. Government micromanagement of political speech, particularly by \nthose already entrenched in government, to me seems like a recipe for \nmore of the same problems we currently face.\n\n  The proposed amendment also allows Congress to regulate contributions \nand expenditures ``made by, in support of, or in opposition to'' a \ncandidate. Under this language, Congress can regulate the political \nspeech of candidates, parties, individuals and groups. One group that \napparently remains unregulatable is the media. By limiting all \npolitical speech, except that by the media, the role and importance of \nthe media in the political process would grow exponentially. I have \nalready discussed that. Yet despite the power it would provide to the \npress, the Washington Post and New York Times oppose this amendment. I \nthink I know why.\n  The first amendment is at the heart of the basic freedoms all \nAmericans enjoy, including the freedom to promote one's political \nviews. If we amend the first amendment to limit the political speech of \ncandidates and parties, what is to stop us from amending the press's \nfree speech rights if we become unhappy with their role?\n  While we all have felt the sting of a harsh editorial on the pages of \na State or national newspaper, I do not believe that any of us feel \ncomfortable with the possibility that Congress could be in the business \nof regulating the content of newspapers. Yet that seems like the \nlogical next step if this amendment were to pass.\n  I understand my colleagues on the other side of this issue who seek \nto ``level the playing field'' or make the campaign finance system more \nequitable for all participants in the political process. We all would \nlike to see candidates unburdened by the ``money chase'' and campaigns \nfree of excessive negative ads. But this is not the way for us to get \nour house in order.\n  President Eisenhower once told Congress that ``freedom has been \ndefined as the opportunity for self-discipline * * * Should we \npersistently fail to discipline ourselves, eventually there will be \nincreasing pressure on government to redress the failure. By that \nprocess freedom will step by step disappear.'' I think that comment \nsums up where we are headed with this amendment.\n  As politicians, we have failed to bring discipline to the campaign \nprocess. Rather than give in to the pressure to redress our failure by \nrestricting the freedoms offered by the first amendment, I believe that \nwe should look to other, less onerous, means to achieve our goals. I \nsupport reasonable campaign finance reform legislation, and have done \nso in the past. But this proposal goes way beyond reform. It makes \nmincemeat of the first amendment.\n  If the concern is that money corrupts and a lot of money corrupts \nabsolutely, there are steps that can be taken that don't require \namending the Constitution. Full disclosure is a good way to provide \ngood government.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNew Mexico for an outstanding speech. I think he is right on the mark. \nThe issue here is who is going to control political discourse in this \ncountry. And the Supreme Court has said no one may do that. That is \nprotected first amendment speech.\n\n  I just wish to thank my good friend from New Mexico for his thoughts \non the first amendment and say I agree with him entirely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I alluded to a couple of organizations that are openly \nengaged in trying to get their points across with the electorate and \nwith those seeking election. Are there a number of groups that are \ninvolved in that kind of activity with the American people and with \ncandidates that have expressed their views on this amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There certainly are, I say to my friend from New \nMexico. There are periodic meetings in my office with a coalition in \ndefense of the first amendment that includes a set of groups that have \nnever met each other before. On the left, the American Civil Liberties \nUnion and the National Education Association; on the right, Right to \nLife, Christian Coalition, and all shades of philosophies in between, \nall of whom have one thing in common--they do not want Congress to push \nthem out, do not want them to push them off the playing field and keep \nthem from participating in American elections.\n  So this coalition is very active. You would think, listening to the \nbroadcast media and reading the Washington Post, that there was nobody \non the other side of this debate, that Common Cause was the only \nconscience out there pressing for these kinds of reforms. Ironically, \nCommon Cause is against the Hollings constitutional amendment as well. \nBut there is a broad coalition, I would say to my friend from New \nMexico. They are very active, very involved, and do not intend to be \ntaken off the playing field.\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator have any idea why they would be \nopposed to it? Can the Senator express what they said to him?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What they say is they believe the Supreme Court was \ncorrect when it said they had a right to support or oppose whomever \nthey choose in the American political system. They know that if \nCongress is given the power, either through a constitutional amendment \nor through a measure such as McCain-Feingold, their voices will be \nquieted, their ability to participate will be capped, limited. They are \nquite concerned about that and feel that this is not a step in the \nright direction, that in fact it is the worst possible thing you can \ndo. If you look out at America, we are a seething cauldron of \ninterests. The Founding Fathers envisioned that. The Supreme Court has \nmade it clear that all those interests have an opportunity, a right, a \nconstitutional right to participate in the American political system, \nand these groups don't want to be pushed out. They think their causes \nare important. They want to be able to advocate them. They want to be \nable to support whomever they choose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So it seems to me that if the National Education \nAssociation opposes this amendment and the National Rifle Association \nopposes this amendment, then they must be saying that if this were the \nlaw of the land, that some Congress in the future could do violence to \none or the other of them in terms of their promoting their cause with \nthe American people and with candidates. In fact, they must be worried \nabout whether there might be some picking and choosing among those who \nmight have the right to promote or to participate in the process of \ntrying to influence candidates and elections. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is absolutely the case, I say to my friend from \nNew Mexico. They fear that a Congress, that a future Congress, will try \nto quiet their voices, to push them out of the process, to make it \nimpossible for them to support candidates of their choice. We know that \nthere are schemes around to do that. There is a bill that we will be \ndebating this year absolutely designed to put a limit on how many \npeople can participate. So their fear is well-founded, I say to my \nfriend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to continue for a couple \nmore minutes. I thought I was finished but I am prompted to say I am \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Am I recognized, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I am not here saying that Congress absolutely would do this, that \nthis would be something that we could just expect in ordinary times, \nbut I believe bad laws are made in unordinary times. I believe bad laws \nare made when things are not going well and somebody decides that they \nknow why they are not going well. That is why I am reluctant to say \nCongress, over the scheme of history, would not act in some almost \naberrational way to limit speech if things just were not going right \nand it was their decision there was just too much going on out there in \nthe political arena. Those kinds of things have happened in our \nhistory. They have happened and you look back and say, how could it \nhave happened? Historians say all of these different things came \ntogether at the same time and, of course, some people thought they knew \nprecisely why and they acted accordingly.\n  Now, I also commented about the media collectively as being the big \nuser of this freedom and, indeed, I think that is a fair statement. \nFrankly, I do not think anybody individually within that collective \nmedia would question this statement. They are not always right either. \nThey are not always right in their conclusions, individually and \ncollectively. Even if they are not disposed to be philosophically one \nway or another, they are frequently wrong. And yet their wrongness is \nprotected by the Constitution. The quantity of that is protected in \nthat if they have enough money and own enough papers, they can be as \nbig as they want. Or if they happen to be a personality that now gets \non the nightly news and has reached an esteemed position, then clearly \nthey can say what they like and it becomes kind of what people think, \nwhat people talk about the next day. And they might be wrong.\n  So it seems to me that when you put all that together, you do not \nwant to change that. That is a great part of America. We want to live \nwith that. Some of us do not think that Congress ought, with that being \nthe reality, to have the authority to say how much you can spend in a \ncampaign to tell your side of those same facts that others are pushing \non the public either through the exercise of their right or by \ncampaigning and being in the political arena.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \na very important contribution to this debate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island has been in the Chamber \nwaiting to be recognized, so I will just take a few moments and ask \nunanimous consent to insert in the Record the ``American Constitutional \nLaw Restatement on the Freedom of Speech,'' by Laurence Tribe, Ralph S. \nTyler, Jr. Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard University.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Excerpt From ``American Constitutional Law''\n\n(By Laurence H. Tribe)\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                      COMMUNICATION AND EXPRESSION\n\n     Sec. 12-2. The Two Ways in Which Government Might ``Abridge'' \n       Speech--And the Two Corresponding ``Tracks'' of First \n       Amendment Analysis\n\n       Government can ``abridge'' speech in either of two ways. \n     First, government can aim at ideas or information, in the \n     sense of singling out actions for government control or \n     penalty either (a) because the specific message or viewpoint \n     such actions express, or (b) because of the effects produced \n     by awareness of the information or ideas such actions impart. \n     Government punishment of publications critical of the state \n     would illustrate (a), as would government discharge of public \n     employees found in possession of ``subversive'' literature. \n     Government prohibition of any act making consumers aware of \n     the prices of over-the-counter drugs would illustrate (b), as \n     would a ban on the teaching of a foreign language or a \n     prohibition against discussing a political candidate on the \n     last day of an election. Second, without aiming at ideas or \n     information in either of the above senses, government can \n     constrict the flow of information and ideas while pursuing \n     other goals, either (a) by limiting an activity through which \n     information and ideas might be conveyed, or (b) by enforcing \n     rules compliance with which might discourage the \n     communication of ideas or information. Government \n     prohibitions against loudspeakers in residential areas would \n     illustrate (a). Governmental demands for testimony before \n     grand juries notwithstanding the desire of informants to \n     remain anonymous would illustrate (b), as would ceilings on \n     campaign contributions. The first form of abridgment may be \n     summarized as encompassing government actions aimed at \n     communicative impact; the second, as encompassing government \n     actions aimed at noncommunicative impact but nonetheless \n     having adverse effects on communicative opportunity.\n       Any adverse government action aimed at communicative impact \n     is presumptively at odds with the first amendment. For if the \n     constitutional guarantee means anything, it means that, \n     ordinarily at least, ``government has no power to restrict \n     expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject \n     matter, or its content * * *.'' And if the constitutional \n     guarantee is not to be trivialized, it must mean that \n     government cannot justify restrictions on free expression by \n     reference to the adverse consequences of allowing certain \n     ideas or information to enter the realm of discussion and \n     awareness. Whatever might in theory be said either way, the \n     choice between ``the dangers of suppressing information and \n     the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available'' is, \n     ultimately, a choice ``that the First Amendment makes for \n     us.''\n       A government action belonging to the second category is of \n     a different order altogether. If it is thought intolerable \n     for government to ban all distribution of handbills in order \n     to combat litter, for example, the objection must be that the \n     values of free expression are more important constitutionally \n     than those of clean streets at low cost; if a ban on noisy \n     picketing in a hospital zone is acceptable, the reason must \n     be that the harmful consequences of this particular\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\n     form of expressive behavior, quite apart from any ideas it \n     might convey, outweigh the good. Where government aims at the \n     noncommunicative impact of an act, the correct result in any \n     particular case thus reflects some ``balancing'' of the \n     competing interests; regulatory choices aimed at harms not \n     caused by ideas or information as such are acceptable so long \n     as they do not unduly constrict the flow of information and \n     ideas. In such cases, the first amendment does not make the \n     choice, but instead requires a ``thumb'' on the scale to \n     assure that the balance struck in any particular situation \n     properly reflects the central position of free expression in \n     the constitutional scheme.\n       The Supreme Court has evolved two distinct approaches to \n     the resolution of first amendment claims; the two correspond \n     to the two ways in which government may ``abridge'' speech. \n     If a government regulation is aimed at the communicative \n     impact of an act, analysis should proceed along what we will \n     call track one. On that track, a regulation is \n     unconstitutional unless government shows that the message \n     being suppressed poses a ``clear and present danger,'' \n     constitutes a defamatory falsehood, or otherwise falls on the \n     unprotected side of one of the lines the Court has drawn \n     to distinguish those expressive acts privileged by the \n     first amendment from those open to government regulation \n     with only minimal due process scrutiny. If a government \n     regulation is aimed at the noncommunicative impact of an \n     act, its analysis proceeds on what we will call track two. \n     On that track, a regulation is constitutional, even as \n     applied to expressive conduct, so long as it does not \n     unduly constrict the flow of information and ideas. On \n     track two, the ``balance'' between the values of freedom \n     of expression and the government's regulatory interests is \n     struck on a case-by-case basis, guided by whatever \n     unifying principles may be articulated.\n       A recurring debate in first amendment jurisprudence has \n     been whether first amendment rights are ``absolute'' in the \n     sense that government may not ``abridge'' them at all, or \n     whether the first amendment requires the ``balancing'' of \n     competing interests in the sense that free speech values and \n     the government's competing justifications must be isolated \n     and weighed in each case. The two poles of this debate are \n     best understood as corresponding to the two approaches, track \n     one and track two; on the first, the absolutists essentially \n     prevail; on the second, the balancers are by and large \n     victorious. While the ``absolutes''--``balancing'' \n     controversy may have been ``unfortunate, misleading and \n     unnecessary,'' it has generated several important \n     observations. First, the ``balancers'' are right in \n     concluding that it is impossible to escape the task of \n     weighing the competing considerations. Although only the \n     case-by-case approach of track two takes the form of an \n     explicit evaluation of the importance of the governmental \n     interests said to justify each challenged regulation, similar \n     judgments underlie the categorical definitions on track one. \n     Any exclusion of a class of activities from first amendment \n     safeguards represents an implicit conclusion that the \n     governmental interests in regulating those activities are \n     such as to justify whatever limitation is thereby placed on \n     the free expression of ideas. Thus, determinations of the \n     reach of first amendment protections on either track \n     presuppose some form of ``balancing'' whether or not they \n     appear to do so. The question is whether the ``balance'' \n     should be struck for all cases in the process of framing \n     particular categorical definitions, or whether the \n     ``balance'' should be calibrated anew on a case-by-case \n     basis.\n       The ``absolutists'' may well have been right in believing \n     that their approach was better calculated to protect freedoms \n     of expression, especially in times of crisis. If the judicial \n     branch is to protect dissenters from a majority's tyranny, it \n     cannot be satisfied with a process of review that requires a \n     court to assess after each incident a myriad of facts, to \n     guess at the risks created by expressive conduct, and to \n     assign a specific value to the hard-to-measure worth of \n     particular instances of free expression. The results of any \n     such process of review will be some ``famous victories'' for \n     the cause of free expression, but will leave no one very sure \n     that any particular expressive act will find a constitutional \n     shield. When the Supreme Court draws categorical lines, \n     creating rules of privilege defined in terms of a few factors \n     largely independent of context, judicial authority speaks \n     directly to the legislature by means of a facial examination \n     of laws without regard to the context in which they are \n     applied. And categorical rules, by drawing clear lines, are \n     usually less open to manipulation because they leave less \n     room for the prejudices of the factfinder to insinuate \n     themselves into a decision. The jury after all is a \n     majoritarian institution, and judges historically have been \n     drawn from more conservative groups. Categorical rules thus \n     tend to protect the system of free expression better because \n     they are more likely to work in spite of the defects in the \n     human machinery on which we must rely to preserve fundamental \n     liberties. The balancing approach is contrastingly a slippery \n     slope; once an issue is seen as a matter of degree, first \n     amendment protections become especially reliant on the \n     sympathetic administration of the law.\n       On track two, when government does not seek to suppress any \n     idea or message as such, there seems little escape from this \n     quagmire of ad hoc judgment, although a few categorical rules \n     are possible. But on track one, when the government's concern \n     is with message content, it has proven both possible and \n     necessary to proceed categorically.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this explains the subjects outside our \nfirst amendment protections. It mentions the Sullivan case, New York \nTimes, and others.\n  One. We are not talking here about free speech. We are talking about \npaid speech. My amendment reads ``expenditures.'' It has nothing to do \nwith the free press. The very horrors that are mentioned could happen \ntoday, and in fact, happened to this particular Senator in his race for \nreelection back in 1992 with the Wall Street Journal.\n  I will get into that in depth, but I am delighted at this time, Mr. \nPresident, to yield, and I hope the Senator from Rhode Island can be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nHollings amendment which I think is a wonderful first step to begin to \nreform our campaign finance system. As many of my distinguished \ncolleagues have mentioned in the course of this debate, at any time \nwhen you attempt to amend the Constitution of the United States, you do \nso with trepidation. This is the fundamental organic document of our \nGovernment. It deserves great respect and reverence, and we do not do \nthis lightly.\n  But today we are facing a crisis of public confidence in the \ndemocratic order in the United States with respect to campaign finance \nreform. If the Constitution and the Court had remained silent on this \nissue, we would not be here today. But the Court has spoken, first in \nthe case of Buckley versus Valeo, several years ago, and in its \nprogeny. Their voice has concluded, and some would argue not correctly, \nbut concluded that the first amendment prevents Congress from imposing \nlimits on campaign expenditures.\n  If the Court refuses to reassess its ruling, we have no choice but to \npropose to the people of the United States that in their wisdom they \nconsider an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and \nthat is why we are here today. We are not doing this in a vacuum. We \nare doing this because of a crisis in confidence by the public.\n  To be kind, the public is disenchanted with the American political \nsystem, particularly the American political campaign finance system. \nThey see far too much money going to campaigns. They are concerned that \nthis money is extracting special interest favors. All of this \nundermines a sense of democracy, a sense of participation, a sense of \nwhat it is to be a citizen in this great country. Last year's election \nsaw record fundraising and record expenditures. An unprecedented $2.7 \nbillion was spent in Federal elections last year, three times the \namount that was spent the year the Buckley versus Valeo case was \ndecided. As this money is poured in, the public is becoming \nincreasingly disenchanted and increasingly disenfranchised from the \nprocess.\n  In a 1992 poll, 84 percent of the electorate stated that Congress was \nowned by special interests, a direct reflection, I think, of the \nperception of how the campaign finance system may work. For the first \ntime in decades, last year's Presidential elections saw less than half \nof the eligible voters going to the polls to register their votes. The \nAmerican public sees a great problem. Months ago, in the Washington \nPost, 80 percent of those surveyed indicated there was too much money \nin campaigns and favored the adoption of campaign spending limits.\n  For the well-being of our democracy, for the confidence we must have \nof its citizens, as we go about doing our work, I feel this amendment \nis in order and indeed must be enacted.\n  As I mentioned before, the great stumbling block to effective limits \non campaign expenditures is the Supreme Court decision in Buckley \nversus Valeo. At the core of that 1976 decision, there is this \nlanguage:\n\n       The first amendment denies Government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained \n     by our Constitution, it is not the Government but the people, \n     individually as citizens and candidates, and collectively as \n     associations and political committees, who must retain \n     control over the quantity and range of debate on public \n     issues in a political campaign.\n\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\n\n  That seems to be the core sense of why the Court decided it. But I \nsuggest the notion that citizens and even candidates are controlling \nthe system today has been overwhelmed by events, overwhelmed by an \navalanche of money coming into political campaigns. In fact, the system \nthat was created under Buckley versus Valeo has collapsed, in effect, \ninundated by independent expenditures, special interest expenditures, \nmoney by the torrent coming into campaigns. It is not surprising, then, \nthat the Washington Post detailed that the special interests coming \ninto a campaign in Pennsylvania's 21st Congressional District outspent \neither one of the candidates. In effect, the candidates control neither \nthe dialog nor the issues; it was outside forces, some of them \nanonymous or at least ambiguous.\n\n  All of this contributed not to what we think an election should be \nabout, two candidates or several candidates presenting their ideas, \narguing eloquently, reaching out to people. In effect, the candidates \nbecame a sideshow. It was the battle between special interests. That is \nnot what the American people want to see in their elections, and if we \nare to control that and constrain that, we must have, in this \nparticular moment, a constitutional amendment to do so.\n  The issue about the Buckley versus Valeo decision is one that \nconstrained our thought about campaign financing for many, many years. \nMy colleagues in this body have offered many proposals, legislatively, \nto correct it. There is the Feingold-McCain bill. There is other \nlegislation. Leader Daschle has introduced legislation. I support all \nof these. But my fear is if we adopt any one of them, and I hope we do \nadopt campaign finance reform legislatively, the ingenuity and \ncreativity of lawyers and consultants will find ways around it, simply \nbecause ultimately we cannot control the amount of money going into \ncampaigns. This amendment will give us that authority.\n  The concept, also, that unlimited spending is good, I think, has to \nbe looked at very skeptically. Unlimited spending can drown out free \nspeech, can squelch someone who does not have the resources to compete. \nIt may not, in fact, always advance the concept of a free exchange of \nideas in an electoral campaign.\n  Many of our leading constitutional scholars, in fact, have reached \nthis conclusion. Paul Freund, the distinguished professor at Harvard \nLaw School wrote:\n\n       Campaign contributors are operating vicariously through the \n     power of their purse, rather than through the power of their \n     ideas. I would scale that relatively lower in the hierarchy \n     of First Amendment values. We are dealing here not so much \n     with the right of personal expression or even association, \n     but with dollars and decibels, and just as the volume of \n     sounds may be limited by law, so may the volume of dollars, \n     without violating the First Amendment.\n\n  Judge Skelly Wright, one of our most distinguished jurists wrote:\n\n       Nothing in the First Amendment commits us to the dogma that \n     money is speech. Far from stifling First Amendment values, \n     campaign limits actually promote them. In place of unlimited \n     spending, limits encourage all to emphasize less expensive, \n     face-to-face communications, exactly the kind of activities \n     that promote real dialogue and leave much less room for \n     manipulation and avoidance of the issues.\n\n  In the words of a distinguished New York School of Law professor, \nRonald Dworkin:\n\n       The Buckley decision was a mistake, unsupported by \n     precedent and contrary to the best understanding of prior \n     first amendment jurisprudence. It misunderstood not only what \n     free speech really is, but what it really means for free \n     people to govern themselves.\n\n  All these experts would conclude that Buckley versus Valeo in effect \nis wrong. But Buckley versus Valeo as it stands today is the law and, \nrecognizing that, we are attempting to give the people of this country \na chance, through the amendment process, to change that decision, that \nposition of the Court.\n  If you look at Buckley versus Valeo, though, perhaps the best \nargument I found against it was contained within the very confines of \nthe decision. It was the dissenting opinion of Justice White. I do not \nthink anyone has to vouch for Justice White's fidelity to the first \namendment and the values that it holds that are dear to us all. First \nof all, time has proven Justice White to be very perceptive, indeed \nprophetic. Because he wrote:\n\n       Without limits on total expenditures, campaign costs will \n     inevitably and endlessly escalate, pressure to raise funds \n     will constantly build, and with it the temptation to resort \n     to those sources of large sums, who, history shows, are \n     sufficiently confident of not being caught to risk flouting \n     contribution limits.\n\n  This is in 1976. Again, recall, since he wrote those words, campaign \nspending has tripled.\n  He also went on to add:\n\n       I have little doubt that limiting the total that can be \n     spent will ease the candidate's understandable obsession with \n     fundraising and so free him and his staff to communicate in \n     more places and ways unconnected with the fundraising \n     function. I regret that, by rejecting a limit, the Court has \n     returned them all to the treadmill.\n\n  I would argue there is no one here in this body who would suggest \nthat that treadmill is not still there.\n  I have heard in the debate notions about how this would infringe on \ntreasured values of the first amendment. But Justice White, in his \nopinion, pointed out that this is not a unique issue, that the limiting \nof the quantity of speech is done routinely.\n  As he said:\n\n       Compulsory bargaining and the right to strike, both \n     provided for or protected by Federal law, inevitably have \n     increased the labor costs of those who publish newspapers. \n     Federal and State taxation directly removes from company \n     coffers large amounts of money that might be spent on larger \n     and better newspapers. But it has not been suggested, nor \n     could it be successfully, that these laws, and many others, \n     are invalid because they siphon off or prevent the \n     accumulation of large sums that would otherwise be available \n     for communicative activities.\n\n  We do on a routine basis require newspapers, the great champions of \nthe first amendment, the most vociferous defenders of the first \namendment, to comply with laws that effectively limit the quantity of \nspeech that they can put out. So this notion that what we are doing \ntoday trods on the sacred core of the first amendment, I do not think \nis right.\n  Indeed, I think we would be better off to have the Court reassess its \nopinion of Buckley and find that these limits are appropriate under the \nfirst amendment. But today, we are left with presenting to the American \npeople the opportunity to make that judgment. I hope that, as I said, \nBuckley could be reviewed and indeed be recognized by the Court to be \ninappropriate based on the facts today. They have the authority to do \nthat.\n  We have the authority to present to the American public this \nconstitutional amendment. I urge that we do so.\n  I want to commend the sponsor, Senator Hollings, for his leadership, \nfor his perception of the issue, and for his unflinching commitment to \ndevelop a campaign finance system that is fair to all.\n  One last point. I have also heard in this debate the notion that this \nCongress would impose irresponsible and reckless limits. In reality, \nany limits we impose we would all have to recognize and work within. \nThey would be the same as applied to Republican candidates or \nDemocratic candidates. They would limit the amount of money that right-\nwing, special-interest groups could put in or left-wing, special-\ninterest groups could put in.\n  They would, in effect, return our elections to the democratic process \nthat our citizens believe we should have, a process by which they can \nlisten to the voices of the candidates, they can communicate their \nviews, they can, in effect, not be drowned out by an avalanche of money \nand 30-second sound bites. In fact, an election can be a dialog about \ndemocracy and not about who raises how much money. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Again, I commend the Senator for his great leadership.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will yield in a second to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.

Thank you.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolution 18 almost \ncertainly represents the most serious and fundamental attack on first \namendment rights of free speech in the 210-year history of that first \namendment.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 18 is not aimed at the entire ambit of free \nspeech rights. It in no way grants Congress authority over obscenity, \nover beer advertising, over fine arts. It is focused solely on allowing \nthe Congress sweeping authority over the freedom of political speech, \nnot just of politicians but of all citizens and of the news media that \nserve those citizens.\n\n  The first Congress of the United States responded to the most serious \nobjection to the ratification of our Constitution that was presented \nduring those ratification debates--the absence of a bill of rights and, \nmost particularly, the absence of a constitutional guarantee of free \nspeech.\n  When James Madison and his colleagues drafted the first amendment and \nworked on its protection of free speech, they were not concerned, Mr. \nPresident, about defending obscenity. They were not concerned with \nlimitations on beer advertising. They were not concerned with \nplaywrights. They were concerned with debate over the political future \nof the people of the United States of America.\n  They believed, as did almost all of the citizens who worried about a \nnew Constitution, that the new Government might, like its British \npredecessors, attempt to gag newspapers and individuals in their \npursuit of a free and open debate over matters political. So they wrote \na first amendment that was unconditional in that respect. They wrote a \nfirst amendment that said, ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging \nthe freedom of speech . . .'' They did not write, as this resolution \nwould, in paraphrase, ``Congress shall make no law abridging the \nfreedom of speech except such restrictions as Congress may deem \nreasonable.''\n  Mr. President, you and I and all the other Members of this body and \nevery American who has ever run for office recognizes that, other than \nthat vitally important meeting of people as individuals on a one-to-one \nbasis, doorbelling, canvassing, and the like, important even to those \nof us who run for the U.S. Senate but obviously an impossible tactic \nwhen one represents hundreds of thousands or millions of voters, that \nthere are fundamentally four ways in which we can communicate political \nideas in the course of the campaign to the people who are constituents \nor whom we seek to represent.\n  The first of those, Mr. President, is through our own campaign \ncommittees. ``Gorton '94,'' ``McConnell '96,'' ``Hollings '98,'' \nformally organized and set up, receiving campaign contributions, \nwriting advertisements, scheduling the candidates, doing so in a fairly \ntransparent fashion. That is the first one.\n  The second way which our ideas can be communicated to those whom we \nseek to represent is through the party organizations with which we are \naffiliated. All candidates for Federal office are members of organized \npolitical parties. Most candidates for State office and many for local \noffice are as well. In fact, in almost every State the only identifier \non the ballot in addition to the name of the candidate is the political \nparty that candidate identifies with. So the Republican Party and the \nDemocratic Party, and the Socialist Worker Party also, involves itself \nin campaigns communicating en mass in the ways that they consider to be \nmost effective with the voters.\n  The third way of communicating political ideas, Mr. President, is by \nthe independent activity of individuals or organizations who are not, \nunder most circumstances, directly connected with either the candidate \nor with any political party but who have a vital interest, on behalf of \nthemselves as individuals or as members of organizations in which they \nare a part in the political future of the country, in who is elected to \nparticular offices.\n  As I say, they may be individuals, they may be very wealthy \nindividuals, they may be organizations from one end of the political \nspectrum to another, but they communicate quite freely and without any \ncensorship from Congress their ideas about political elections, their \nsupport for candidates, their opposition to candidates.\n  Finally, the fourth way in which political ideas about elections get \nto the voters is through our mass media--through radio, television and \nthe newspapers--many of which are vitally interested in these ideas, \nmany of which literally editorialize and endorse, but even when they \ndon't, they communicate such ideas as they deem relevant in explaining \nthe positions of the various candidates.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 18 is, I must say, philosophically consistent \nand intellectually honest in that it permits Congress to regulate all \nfour of those activities. It allows Congress to put reasonable limits \non contributions or expenditures by, in support of, or in opposition to \ncandidates for Federal office. That covers the candidates' committees, \nthat covers the political parties, that covers the totally independent \nindividuals and groups, and that covers the newspapers and television \nstations and radio stations that participate in these political \ncampaigns.\n  I say, Mr. President, that this proposal is philosophically \nconsistent and logical and principled in making no real distinction \namong those four methods of contribution, because, of course, the \npresent campaign law does not. The law under which we operate today \nputs very real limits on candidates' campaign organizations, limits \nwhich, by the operation of inflation, have grown smaller in each \nsuccessive election cycle on contributions from organizations or from \nindividuals to those candidates, significant disclosure requirements on \nthe source of those contributions, so significant that on many \noccasions, it would seem that our newspapers spend more time and more \ncolumn inches reporting contributions than they do on reporting ideas.\n  The 1974 law imposes some, but vaguer, restrictions on contributions \nto and expenditures by political parties. It was unable, as a matter of \nconstitutional law, to impose any significant restrictions on \nindependent expenditures, and it made no attempt to impose any \nrestrictions on the news media, recognizing even then the \nunconstitutionality of doing so.\n  What has been the net impact of the set of restrictions that we have \ntoday? In almost direct ratio to the restrictions on the amount of \nmoney that individuals and organizations can contribute to candidates, \nit has caused those individuals and organizations, when they feel \npassionately about a candidate, either for or against, to funnel their \ncontributions to the political parties whom they know would support \nthose candidates. And so we have the challenge of soft money today, \nlargely because those who contribute soft money to political parties \ncannot contribute that money in hard form to the candidates themselves.\n  This, all by itself, has made political campaigns less satisfactory \nand candidates less responsible. Each of us as a candidate is \nresponsible directly for the way in which he or she conducts his or her \ncampaign. When our name is on the disclaimer of a television ad, we \ncannot disown it. When we have reported a contribution from an \nindividual or a group, we cannot disown it. But even when that \nadvertisement or that political activity comes from our political \nparty, we can, to a certain extent, disassociate ourselves from the \nideas or the messages involved. We may very well, we hope, benefit from \nit when they support us, but we cannot guarantee that we will gain such \na benefit.\n  Now we have waiting in the wings, subject to validation only, I \nbelieve, if we adopt this constitutional amendment, a set of similar \nrestrictions on political parties. If we adopt such a system of \nrestrictions on political parties, Mr. President, it seems to me we \nknow clearly what will happen, because it is already happening. Those \nsame groups, those same individuals who feel passionately about Federal \nelections today and who are barred from providing the support they want \nto provide to the candidate directly, are barred from providing that \nsupport to the candidate's political party, will simply do it on their \nown.\n  Last Sunday's Washington Post had an interesting article about the \n1996\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\ncampaigns, the headline of which is: ``For Their Targets, Mystery \nGroups' Ads Hit Like Attacks From Nowhere.'' The airwaves were filled \nwith this kind of activity at the end of 1996--organizations with \nfictional names engaged mostly in negative advertising against \nparticular candidates, the source of support for which was unknown and, \ntherefore, the responsibility for the content of which was unknown. But \nas long as we have a Congress that impinges on every aspect of our \nsocial and individual and economic lives, we will have individuals who \nwish to participate and will participate in that fashion if they are \nnot allowed to participate more directly and more openly.\n  So Senate Joint Resolution 18 very clearly will allow Congress to put \nlimits on that kind of political participation. So it will say, in the \nultimate analysis, we can do whatever we think is reasonable to shut \npeople up when it comes to political debates.\n  Now, that still leaves the fourth element of communication: the \nradio, television stations, and the newspapers of this country. Very \nlikely, the first bill that went through Congress after this \nconstitutional amendment passed would not affect them, but they would \nsure be in clover, Mr. President, because then, with the candidate and \nthe candidate's supporters and the candidate's proponents all muzzled, \nthe only source of information would be the mass news media.\n  But now this passionately devoted and wealthy individual or this \npassionately devoted organization would soon find the answer to that \nquestion: Buy a newspaper; buy a television station. Then you are \nentirely free to spend all the money you want on political \ncommunication, totally divorced from any responsibility on the part of \nthe candidate at all.\n  So the next law, Mr. President, will limit what the newspapers and \nthe television stations and radio stations can do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is a bill we will be discussing later this year \ncalled McCain-Feingold, which seeks, in this Senator's judgment, to \nessentially shut down legislative-advocacy-type independent expressions \nand to make almost impossible the ability of outside groups to engage \nin independent expenditures.\n  My question to my friend from Washington is, given the fact that we \nhave bills that go that far now, given this authority under this \nconstitutional amendment to set ``reasonable limits,'' is it not \npossible that Congress might decide such expenditures should be shut \ndown entirely, that there is nothing reasonable about them, and that \nthose voices should be quieted altogether?\n  Mr. GORTON. Congress, if this should be part of the Constitution, \nmight well make just such a decision on the relatively rational grounds \nthat all political speech they want to be directly attributable to \ncandidates and not to permit anyone to engage in a partisan political \ndebate except through the candidate's committees.\n  Now, I must say to my friend from Kentucky, I doubt that would happen \nin the Congress immediately after the adoption of a constitutional \namendment like this. The sponsors of this constitutional amendment are \nall supporters of the McCain-Feingold proposal, and my inclination is \nthat they would be content with the passage of that legislation with \nthis constitutional provision in effect.\n  They know, or at least the most thoughtful and principled of them \nknow, that McCain-Feingold is blatantly unconstitutional under the \nfirst amendment as the first amendment exists today. I rather imagine \nthey would be satisfied with this reform as their predecessors were \nsatisfied with the 1974 reforms. As soon as this reform showed itself \nto be as ineffective as 1974 has, as soon as it had pushed \ncommunication into another channel, they would be back to close off \nthat channel.\n  At the present time, their frustration stems almost entirely from the \nfact that they are only permitted to dam one channel of the river, and \nall the water just goes around the other side of the island and flows \ninto the political system to the same extent or to a greater extent \nthan it does at the present time. This constitutional amendment allows \nthem to dam the whole river for good and permanently.\n  It is for exactly that reason that I say, Mr. President, this is \ncertainly the most fundamental attack on the most fundamental of \nAmerican freedoms that has taken place in this body in the 14-plus \nyears during which I have served and, I think, probably in the 210 \nyears since the first amendment was adopted by the first Congress.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since the Congress composed entirely of incumbents has \nthe power to determine what is a reasonable limit directly on \ncampaigns, would it not be entirely conceivable, I ask my friend from \nWashington, in the very near future, if not in the very same Congress, \nafter this became part of the Constitution, that these incumbents might \nseek to limit spending in campaigns directly by the candidates \nthemselves standing for reelection and a challenger, quite \ndramatically?\n  Most incumbents start out with a pretty substantial lead unless they \nare running against a famous athlete, a movie star, or sitting \nGovernor. It has often been described as the incumbent looking at it as \na football field, and the incumbent at the beginning of the campaign is \nat the 40-yard line and sprinting toward the goalline; the challenger \nis back on the 5-yard line with 95 yards to go. Might not this Congress \ncomposed entirely of incumbents decide to set a spending limit of, say, \n$50,000 per House of Representatives race and declare that reasonable?\n  Mr. GORTON. Congress would certainly have the authority to pass just \nsuch a law, I say, Mr. President, to my friend from Kentucky. I think \nas a former State attorney general, he has argued a number of cases in \nthe Supreme Court. I would probably be willing to take that challenge \non a reasonable basis to the Supreme Court of the United States, and I \nmight well win at that $50,000 figure.\n\n  But the vice of this constitutional amendment is that I would have to \ndo that in the first place, and there would be an argument that that \nwas a reasonable limitation. When we start down this road, we put the \nright of free speech and political matters of the people of the United \nStates into the hands of Congress.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico said earlier, each of us believes \nsufficiently in this system to hold the opinion that most of the time \nwe do the right thing and that almost all of the time we try to do the \nright thing. We are probably least likely to do the right thing when it \naffects our own individual fates and our own individual careers. Even \nwhen we are, we sometimes, at least, can make mistakes. That, I must \nsay, is obviously the reason that Madison and the first Congress wrote \nthe first amendment in unequivocal terms with a primary focus on \npolitical speech. They simply did not wish to give this authority to \nCongress, and they were right.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in dealing with the 1974 law \nin Buckley versus Valeo, I think put the issue in the simplest and \nclearest fashion when it says,\n\n       In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not \n     the Government, but the people individually as citizens and \n     candidates, and collectively as associations and political \n     committees, who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  That is the central issue here. Is this a matter that is up to the \njudgment of the people as individuals and as members of organizations? \nOr is it up to the Government--in this case a self-interested \nGovernment--to say what is reasonable? You and I, Mr. President, and \nthe Senator from Kentucky and I believe that this is a matter for \npeople as individuals and as members of voluntary associations. The \nproponents of this constitutional amendment believe this is a matter \nfor the Government. Between us, there is a great gulf fixed which \ncannot be bridged. We stand on the Constitution as it was written by \nthe Founding Fathers. We stand on a faith in the people, and we reject \nthe interference of the Federal Government on this question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Washington for his eloquent\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\ndefense of the first amendment. He certainly encapsulated, better than \nI could ever, exactly what the heart of this debate is. I thank him \nvery much for his support and contribution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, daily we are learning of new allegations \nand revelations regarding how last year's elections were financed. Just \nyesterday, we learned that the Chinese Government created a $1.8 \nmillion fund with which it sought to influence up to 30 Members of \nCongress with campaign contributions.\n  The Congress now faces a monumental task. How can the system be \neffectively and fairly changed? The answer is both simple and daunting: \nby passing comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform. Some \nopenly oppose campaign finance reform. One of the leaders, if not the \nleader, my friend, Senator McConnell, is there. I admire him and \nrespect the fact that he is a standup guy. He does not hide that fact. \nOthers have said to me, ``I am for campaign finance reform, just not \nyours.'' I challenge my colleagues and say that every aspect of Senator \nFeingold's and my bill is open for debate. Everyone is welcome at the \ntable. I believe there is no excuse for inaction.\n  Real reform must do two things. It must limit the influence of money \nin campaigns, and it must level the playing field between challengers \nand incumbents. I believe those two principles cannot be compromised, \nbut the rest is up for negotiation.\n  I find that there are fewer and fewer Americans--in fact, recent \npolls show that 9 out of 10 Americans believe that we must repair this \nsystem and that it is out of control. I just heard my colleagues \ntalking about how in 1974 it didn't work, and if we passed further \ncampaign finance reform, somehow that would be bad, as it was bad in \n1974.\n  Now, Mr. President, I wasn't in Congress in 1974, but I am very aware \nthat, in 1972, there were people walking around this town with valises \nfull of hundred dollar bills. The stories I have heard concerned people \nbeing asked to contribute 1 or 2 percent of their gross income. Somehow \nto allege that the changes made in 1974 didn't help reform the system I \nthink, frankly, flies in the face of facts. The facts are that, as a \nresult of the 1974 reforms, we did fix the system for quite a while. \nMr. President, when I was elected to Congress in 1982, there was a far \ndifferent environment than exists today in fundraising. The fact is, it \nworked for quite a while, and then loopholes were exploited, Supreme \nCourt decisions gave additional avenues for the funneling of so-called \n``soft money'' into campaigns, and it is out of control again.\n  Mr. President, in 1986, we reformed the tax system in this country--\nsupported overwhelmingly here in Congress--and closed some tax \nloopholes. We took several million people off the tax rolls, and it was \ngenerally applauded. We fixed the system to a significant degree. We \nall know now, in 1997, we need to fix the tax system again. I say to \nyou, in 1974, much needed reforms were enacted by an overwhelming \nmajority of Congress. They did some good things. It did clean up the \nsystem dramatically.\n  Now circumstances and times have changed. We all know the problems, \nMr. President. We all know the problems. They are made abundantly clear \nby picking up any newspaper today. The pursuit of funds and money has \nbecome a full-time occupation, and the average citizen no longer has \nthe same voice in Washington, DC, that they did years ago.\n  Earlier this week, a man who I have not only grown to respect and \nadmire enormously, but I have also become a good friend with over the \nmany years I have been here and worked very closely with, is Senator \nFord from the other side of the aisle. I think many would describe \nSenator Ford, with admiration, as a partisan member of his party. I \nalso know that there are many others of us who have had the opportunity \nof working with him for many, many years. If you want to reach a \nlegislative result and you want to reach it in a nonpartisan and, if \nnecessary, bipartisan fashion, you sit down with Wendell Ford, along \nwith, by the way, my friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. \nExample: At the end of last year, we were able to pass legislation \nwhich was the most massive change in aviation, how we fund and \nstructure it, since 1978 when we deregulated the airline industry. \nWendell Ford, acting in a bipartisan fashion, made that legislation \npossible. I intend, as is appropriate, when the time comes, to \nelaborate on my feelings of affection and respect for Senator Ford.\n\n  One of the things Senator Ford mentioned as the reason why he was not \ngoing to seek reelection was because he was going to have to raise \n$100,000 a week between now and election day. He also added, in his own \ninimitable style, that his wife would not allow him to rent out the \nspare bedroom. But the fact is, Mr. President, that every time one of \nour Members leaves this body, they cite the money chase. They cite the \nproblem that money has become the overriding factor in the \ndetermination of candidacy and outcome. That should not be, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Ask anyone who is considering running for public office. They come \nhere to Washington, DC, because they need the support of the party \npeople and the money and the PAC's and the interest groups, and they \nwill tell you they are only asked one question when they announce they \nare going to seek election, and one question only. It's not, ``How do \nyou stand on taxes?'' or ``on the role of Government,'' or ``how do you \nfeel about national defense?'' There is only one question they are \nasked, Mr. President: ``Where are you going to get the money?''\n  When we get into a full-blown debate on this issue--which I hope we \nwill because I still hold the fervent hope and belief that we will \naddress campaign finance reform on this floor in one way or another \nbefore this year is out, and I don't know when that will be--I suggest \nthat it will only be done in a meaningful fashion when there is \nsufficient anger and outrage on the part of the American people who \ndemand that we fix this broken system, and not until.\n  I don't think we really ought to debate this until we are ready to \nachieve a legislative result. I don't know when that will be, Mr. \nPresident. But I can tell you, we are a heck of a lot closer to that \npoint than we were, say, 6 months ago. I believe 3 months from now, or \n2 months from now--after the hearings Senator Thompson is going to be \nholding--there will be a much greater impetus and desire on the part of \nthe American people that we more thoroughly and completely address this \nissue and try to fix the broken system. I believe that we can and \nshould and will. It used to be that we waged a battle of ideas between \ncandidates. The battle was well fought and hard won on the election \nbattlefield. Now it is the battle of the bucks.\n\n  Again, at an appropriate time, I will talk about the well-known \npublic facts and how much campaign costs have risen, how much it costs \nto run a Senate race, how much it costs in order to buy television, and \nhow much soft money has grown in exponential numbers to the point \nwhere, according to the Washington Post not long ago, the cost of \nFederal campaigns was well over $2 billion, whether they be small \nStates or large States.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that the constitutional amendment is \nthe answer. We can enact campaign finance reform without a \nconstitutional amendment. S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill, is fully \nconsistent with the law. I can point out many more constitutional \nscholars, including a former chief counsel of the ACLU, as to \nconstitutionality because it is based primarily on voluntary spending \nlimits.\n  The Supreme Court has ruled that we cannot stop someone who is \nwilling to spend an unlimited amount of money to campaign for a Federal \noffice from doing so.\n  This bill provides strong incentives for candidates to voluntarily \ncomply with spending limits regardless of personal wealth. Candidates \nwho choose to spend unlimited amounts of their own money receive none \nof the benefits under our legislation.\n  Mr. President, there is an argument that is being bandied about that \nsomehow we cannot place a limit on soft money, that it would be \nunconstitutional to do so. I find that curious. I find that curious \nbecause the courts\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nhave clearly allowed the Congress to place limits on contributions to \ncampaigns. We have placed an individual limit of $2,000. We placed a \nPAC limit of $10,000. We do not allow a corporation or a union to \nprovide any direct contributions. Yet somehow people on this floor are \nsaying somehow it would be unconstitutional to place limits on soft \nmoney. There is no rational constitutional argument there in my view. \nThere is no justifiable need for soft money. All contributions made to \nthe party should be done using hard, fully traceable, fully disclosed \ndollars. There is no constitutional right to soft money. The courts \nhave stated that any contribution can be limited.\n  I will submit for the Record those court decisions that have stated \nthat any contribution can be limited.\n  As you know, Mr. President, my good friend Paul Taylor has worked \ntirelessly to promote the idea of free broadcast time. Broadcasters use \nspectrum that is owned by the American people. As such, the Congress \nand the courts have agreed that when the Government gives out licenses \nto the broadcasters--enabling them to operate--that such licenses may \nbe conditioned on certain activities deemed to be in the public \ninterest.\n  When each broadcaster receives a license, they sign on that license \nthat they agree to act in the public interest.\n  Some of the opponents of the McCain-Feingold legislation complain \nincorrectly that the bill will limit individuals free speech. As I have \njust explained, the bill is compatible with the Constitution. But there \nis even a greater question that must be asked. If spending is akin to \nfree speech, then how much speech does an individual without means \nhave? If money is free speech, how much free speech does a person \nwithout money have?\n  On March 2, on CNN a woman from Bartlesville, OK, called in, and, \nsaid, ``I have a question for you. I'm a Republican, supposedly. I'm \nmore Independent than anything else. But I want to ask you something. \nAt $735 a month, how much freedom of speech do I have? I cannot \ncontribute to these big campaigns.''\n  Mr. President, men and women all over America ask in response to the \nequation of money and free speech about how much freedom of speech they \nhave if they are a moderate- or low-income American. Where is her \nvoice? Where is the voice of the woman from Bartlesville, OK? What can \nbe done to ensure that her voice is not overwhelmed by the voices of \nmonied special interests?\n  Spending limits will do more to both level the playing field between \nchallengers and incumbents and give a voice to individuals who either \ngive little or can afford to give nothing at all.\n  The most money tends to win elections. And this is the incumbent \nprotection system. The reality is that the current, perverse system \nunder which the richest takes all has resulted in entrenched \nincumbents.\n  The Congressional Research Service has compiled an analysis of \ncongressional races in recent years, and the conclusion of that study \nis that the candidate who raises and spends the most money, even if \nthat money is his or her own, usually wins the elections. As I have \nsaid before, elections should be about message and ideas. I do not \nbelieve it was an accident that in the last election we had the lowest \nvoter turnout in any time in the history of Presidential elections in \nthis century.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from Common Cause. I quote:\n\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this \n     week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide \n     Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on \n     campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme \n     Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo.\n       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because \n     it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent \n     Congress from passing campaign reform this year. We believe \n     that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in order to \n     achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.\n       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in \n     the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and \n     constitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not \n     and should not start a reform process that will take years to \n     complete by pursuing campaign finance reform through a \n     constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus \n     its efforts on enacting S. 25, comprehensive bipartisan \n     legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced, \n     fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful \n     reform of the way congressional elections are financed.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be made part \nof the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this \n     week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide \n     Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on \n     campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme \n     Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo.\n       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because \n     it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent \n     Congress from passing campaign finance reform this year. We \n     believe that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in \n     order to achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.\n       Under existing Supreme Court doctrine, Congress has \n     significant scope to enact tough and effective campaign \n     finance reform consistent with the Court's interpretation of \n     the First Amendment in Buckley.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill, S. 25, provides for significant \n     reform within the framework of the Buckley decision. The \n     legislation would: ban soft money; provide reduced postage \n     rates and free or reduced cost television time as incentives \n     for congressional candidates to agree to restrain their \n     spending; close loopholes related to independent expenditures \n     and campaign ads that masquerade as ``issue advocacy''; \n     reduce the influence of special-interest political action \n     committee (PAC) money; strengthen disclosure and enforcement.\n       A recent letter to Senators McCain and Feingold from \n     constitutional scholar Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of \n     the Brennan Center for Justice and a past National Legal \n     Director of the ACLU, sets forth the case that the McCain-\n     Feingold bill is constitutional. Professor Neuborne finds \n     that the key provisions of the bill are within the Court's \n     existing interpretation of the First Amendment, and he thus \n     demonstrates that a constitutional amendment is not necessary \n     to enact reform.\n       Professor Neuborne concludes that the voluntary spending \n     limits in the McCain-Feingold bill are consistent with the \n     Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley. He further concludes that \n     ``Congress possesses clear power to close the soft money \n     loophole by restricting the source and size of contributions \n     to political parties. . . .'' He also concludes that efforts \n     to close loopholes relating to independent expenditures and \n     so-called ``issue ads'' are also within Congress' existing \n     authority.\n       It is, therefore, not necessary to amend the Constitution \n     in order to enact meaningful campaign finance reform. \n     Congress has the power, consistent with the First Amendment, \n     to enact comprehensive reform by statute.\n       A constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform \n     should not be used as a way to delay reform legislation. \n     Typically, amending the Constitution takes years. After both \n     Houses of Congress adopt an amendment by a two-thirds vote, \n     it has to be approved by three-quarters of the state \n     legislatures. Even then, the Congress would still have to \n     take up enacting legislation. This is a lengthy and arduous \n     process.\n       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in \n     the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and \n     constitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not \n     and should not start a reform process that will take years to \n     complete by pursuing campaign finance reform through a \n     constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus \n     its efforts on enacting S. 25, comprehensive bipartisan \n     legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced, \n     fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful \n     reform of the way congressional elections are financed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ann McBride,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also would like at this time to have \nprinted in the Record by unanimous consent a letter that is by Mr. Burt \nNeuborne who is the Legal Director at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Brennan Center for Justice,\n\n                                      New York, NY, March 3, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Feingold. I am writing in response \n     to a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, dated February 20, \n     1997, from the American Civil Liberties Union, arguing that \n     critical provisions of S.25, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform \n     Act of 1997, are unconstitutional under existing Supreme \n     Court precedent. I am the John Norton Pomeroy Professor of \n     Law at New York University and Legal Director of the Brennan \n     Center for Justice. I served as National Legal Director of \n     the American Civil Liberties Union during the 1980's, and \n     remain active in defense of the First Amendment. I\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\n     continue to serve as an ACLU volunteer counsel. I believe, \n     however, that the ACLU letter on S.25 is simply wrong in a \n     number of assertions, despite the fact that it was written by \n     an able lawyer whom I respect and admire.\n       In assessing the ACLU's views on the constitutionality of \n     S.25, it is important to recall that the ACLU believes that \n     an restriction on campaign financing is unconstitutional, \n     even those restrictions upheld by the Supreme Court in \n     Buckley v. Valeo. The only Justice on the current Court who \n     accepts the ACLU's position is Justice Clarence Thomas. Thus, \n     the ACLU is quite right in predicting that Justice Thomas \n     would find S.25 unconstitutional--but quite wrong in claiming \n     that a majority of the Court would condemn critical parts of \n     the statue.\n\n\n     I. Efforts to Persuade Candidates to Limit Campaign Spending \n   Voluntarily By Providing Them With Valuable Inducements Like Free \n                   Television Time Are Constitutional\n\n       The ACLU argues that Title I of S.25, which asks candidates \n     to limit campaign spending in return for free or subsidized \n     broadcast time and subsidized mailing rates, is \n     unconstitutional. But, in Buckley, the Court approved \n     precisely such an approach when it upheld the offer of \n     campaign subsidies to Presidential candidates in return for a \n     promise to limit campaign spending.\n       The fact is that the ACLU still believes the Buckley Court \n     was wrong when it upheld Congress right to condition public \n     campaign subsidies on a promise to limit campaign spending. \n     But the ACLU lost that argument. It is, to say the least, \n     difficult for the ACLU to argue that a far lesser set of \n     inducements in S.25 would violate the First Amendment. In \n     effect, the ACLU argues that virtually any inducement offered \n     to a candidate to persuade her to limit campaign spending is \n     unconstitutional as a form of indirect ``coercion''. But the \n     Buckley Court clearly distinguished between inducements \n     designed to elicit a voluntary decision to limit spending, \n     and coercive mandates that impose involuntary spending \n     ceilings. If giving a Presidential candidate a $60,000,000 \n     subsidy is a constitutional inducement, surely providing free \n     television time and reduced postal rates falls into the same \n     category of acceptable inducement. Merely because a deal is \n     too good to pass up does not render it unconstitutionally \n     ``coercive''.\n\n\n        II. Ceilings on Contributions by PACS Are Constitutional\n\n       The ACLU argues that a $1,000 cap on contributions from \n     PACs, and a 20% limit on PAC contributions to a particular \n     candidate violate the First Amendment. Once again, the ACLU's \n     constitutional position is traceable to an issue that it lost \n     in Buckley, but continues to re-argue in Congress.\n       In Buckley, the ACLU challenged the $1,000 ceiling on \n     campaign contributions, arguing that campaign contributions \n     were entitled to the same level of free speech protection as \n     campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court rejected the ACLU's \n     argument, and upheld the ceiling on contributions. Indeed, in \n     the years since Buckley, the Supreme Court has upheld every \n     contribution limit that has come before it in an election \n     context. California Medical Ass'n v. FEC, 453 U.S. 182 \n     (1981); FEC v. National Right to Work Committee, 459 U.S. 197 \n     (1982). If Congress may limit contributions from individuals \n     to $1,000, surely the First Amendment does not require \n     preferential treatment of PACS. If individuals can be \n     restricted to $1,000, so can PACS.\n       Moreover, Congress may surely determine that the greatest \n     risk of corruption occurs in connection with campaign \n     contributions from self-interested, interest PACS. \n     Accordingly, placing a 20% ceiling on PAC contributions in \n     well within Congress' power to prevent corruption, or the \n     appearance, or the appearance of corruption, by placing \n     limits on overtly self-interested campaign contributions.\n\n\n  III. Limits on Enormous Campaign Contributions to Political Parties \n     from Corporations, Labor Unions, and Wealthy Contributors Are \n                             Constitutional\n\n       The ACLU argues that the First Amendment prevents Congress \n     from closing the notorious ``soft money'' loophole that \n     threatens to destroy the integrity of the Presidential \n     campaign process. In the most recent Presidential campaign, \n     donors poured more than $250 million through the soft money \n     loophole to political parties, ostensibly for use in building \n     local parties, registering voters, and increasing voter \n     turnout. The vast bulk of soft money contributions came from \n     corporations and labor unions, barred by law from \n     participating directly in federal campaigns, or from wealthy \n     individuals anxious to contribute in excess of existing \n     contribution ceilings.\n       The ACLU argues that the First Amendment prohibits Congress \n     from closing the loophole. But, once again, the ACLU's \n     constitutional position is simply a reprise of arguments it \n     has lost in the Supreme Court. In Buckley, the ACLU argued \n     that any effort to limit campaign contributions violated the \n     First Amendment, an argument the Court rejected. In later \n     cases, the Court also dismissed the argument that \n     corporations and labor unions have a right to use their money \n     to influence federal elections. See, e.g., Austin v. Michigan \n     Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990); FEC v. Nat'l Right \n     to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197 (1982).\n       In 1978, the FEC, reversing an earlier ruling, opened a \n     seemingly modest loophole in the contribution rules by \n     allowing corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals \n     to contribute funds directly to a political party free from \n     the usual restrictions on contributions, as long as the funds \n     were to be used in connection with local party building, \n     voter registration or other activity not directly connected \n     to a federal election. In the years since, the soft money \n     loophole has become a threat to the integrity of the \n     regulatory system. Hundreds of millions of dollars pour \n     through the loophole each year to both major political \n     parties from contributors who are barred from contributing \n     directly to a federal campaign. The funds are often solicited \n     by federal candidates and spent in ways designed to advance \n     their candidacies. More ominously, the forbidden donors, if \n     their contributions are large enough, are rewarded by both \n     parties with preferred access to public officials, creating \n     precisely the appearance of corruption that justifies \n     restricting large campaign contributions in the first place. \n     Thus, unless one accepts the ACLU's premise that \n     contributions can never be limited no matter what the size \n     and no matter what the source (and even Justice Thomas has \n     not gone that far), Congress possesses clear power to close \n     the soft money loophole by restricting the source and size of \n     contributions to political parties just as it does for \n     contributions to candidates.\n       The ACLU's suggestion that the recent Supreme Court \n     decision in Colorado Republican Party provides First \n     Amendment support for a soft money loophole is flatly wrong. \n     Colorado Republican Party was an ``expenditure'' case, not a \n     ``contribution'' case, and it involved hard money, not soft. \n     It held, merely, that when a political party makes an \n     expenditure attacking the candidate of another party six \n     months before selecting its own candidate, the expenditure \n     should be treated as an independent expenditure, as long as \n     the funds come in small amounts from donors who are eligible \n     to contribute to a federal campaign. The Court did not hold \n     that ineligible donors, like corporations, labor unions and \n     wealthy individuals, have a constitutional right to buy \n     preferred access to public officials by pouring unlimited \n     amounts of cash into a political party's coffers.\n       The most relevant Supreme Court decision is not Colorado \n     Republican Party, but Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, \n     where the Supreme Court held that corporations can be walled \n     off from the electoral process by forbidding both corporate \n     contributions and corporate independent expenditures because \n     they have the capacity to distort the democratic process. \n     Surely, the law cannot be that Congress has the power to \n     prevent corporations from giving money directly to a \n     candidate, or from expending money on behalf of a candidate, \n     but lacks the power to prevent the corporation from pouring \n     unlimited funds into the candidate's political party in order \n     to buy preferred access to him after the election.\n\n\nIV. The Narrow Limits on Coordinated Expenditures By Political Parties \n                  Imposed by S. 25 Are constitutional\n\n       Colorado Republican Party holds that political parties are \n     entitled to make truly independent expenditures on the same \n     terms and conditions as other entities. Since the expenditure \n     at issue in Colorado Republican Party was made six months \n     before the party's candidate was selected, there obviously \n     was no coordination between the party and the candidate. The \n     case says nothing, however, about coordinated expenditures. \n     Indeed, the critical swing Justices--Justices Breyer, Souter, \n     and O'Connor--explicitly refused to decide how to treat \n     coordinated expenditures, noting that if coordinated \n     expenditures were treated like independent expenditures, the \n     critical line between contribution and expenditure would be \n     destroyed, since every forbidden contribution could be \n     recycled as a coordinated expenditure.\n       S. 25 attempts to deal with coordinated expenditures by \n     providing that once a political party makes contributions, \n     and engages in coordinated activities with its candidate, it \n     can no longer be said to be making truly independent \n     expenditures. The provision is merely a common sense effort \n     to police the distinction between truly independent and \n     coordinated expenditures. Since the ACLU rejects the critical \n     distinction between expenditures and contributions put forth \n     in Buckley, it believes that any restriction on the party's \n     right to spend money, even a de facto contribution made in \n     the form of a coordinated expenditure, is absolutely \n     protected. But, if you accept the Supreme Court's ruling in \n     Buckley that contributions may be regulated, it becomes \n     critical to decide when an expenditure is truly independent, \n     and when it turns into a de facto contribution. Thus, once \n     again, the ACLU's opinion on the effort in S. 25 to draw a \n     careful line between truly independent expenditures and \n     coordinated contributions is an exercise in wishful \n     thinking, not an accurate description of existing law.\n\n\n     V. the effort in S. 25 to distinguish between an independent \n expenditure designed to affect the outcome of an election, and issue \n       advocacy designed to inform the public, is constitutional\n\n       Independent expenditures designed to affect the outcome of \n     a federal election are subject to one important restriction--\n     funds contributed to finance the expenditure must come from \n     sources that would be lawful if contributed directly to the \n     candidate and in limited amounts. Issue advocacy designed to\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\n     inform the public is, on the other hand, subject to no \n     restrictions, either as to funding or disclosure.\n       The last election was characterized by numerous groups \n     purporting to engage in public education outside the reach of \n     the campaign laws. For example, both major parties spent \n     substantial sums on so-called ``issue ads'', paid for by \n     donors who were barred from contributing directly to a \n     federal election campaign. Numerous private groups targeted \n     close races and poured funds into them in the guise of issue \n     education, even though the funds came from forbidden sources \n     and in amounts that could not be contributed. S. 25 attempts \n     to close that loophole by setting forth two tests to \n     differentiate between campaign speech and genuine issue \n     advocacy. Throughout most of an election cycle, the test is \n     whether the speaker's purpose and effect was to advocate the \n     election or defeat of an identified candidate. Within 60 days \n     of the election, however, the test dispenses with an \n     examination of the speaker's purpose and looks only to \n     whether, applying certain enumerated criteria, a reasonable \n     person would understand the ad to be advocating the election \n     or defeat of a named candidate.\n       It is, in my opinion, unclear whether the latter test is \n     sufficiently precise. I believe that the better approach \n     would be to apply throughout the election cycle a purpose-\n     and-effect test along the lines of the first one described \n     above, but perhaps slightly more demanding. Speech should be \n     viewed as campaign speech only if the speaker's predominant \n     intent was to affect the outcome of a specific election, and \n     the FEC should be required to establish the relevant intent \n     by clear and convincing evidence, or, even, beyond a \n     reasonable doubt before labeling speech as campaign-related. \n     Such an approach would prevent egregious evasion of the rules \n     governing campaign contributions, while providing ample space \n     for genuine public education.\n\n\n VI. the effort in S. 25 to enhance the enforcement capability of the \n                          FEC is long overdue\n\n       The FEC is currently powerless to cope with massive \n     violations of existing law. For example, the last campaign \n     saw both major parties accept illegal donations, and engage \n     in blatantly illegal spending activities, like running phony \n     ``issue ads'', or making phony ``independent'' expenditures \n     in order to evade contribution restrictions. The FEC stood by \n     like a helpless spectator while the law was turned into a \n     mockery. S. 25 provides needed authority to seek injunctive \n     relief against blatant violations. I would, however, tighten \n     the enforcement provisions to permit injunctive relief only \n     for clearly established violations. I would place a \n     significant burden on the FEC in order to permit action \n     against egregious violations, while preventing undue \n     intrusion into the electoral process.\n       Finally, I would break the FEC's monopoly on enforcing the \n     campaign funding laws. The FEC's current structure permits \n     either major party to veto the enforcement activities of the \n     FEC. The result has been an enforcement history that harasses \n     minor parties and independents, but rarely challenges the \n     questionable activities of the major parties. We will, I \n     predict, never see an FEC proceeding against either or both \n     major parties for their activities during the last campaign.\n       The solution is a private cause of action for violating the \n     FEC. Abuse of such a private right of action could be \n     minimized by provisions for attorneys fees and Rule 11 \n     sanctions for frivolous claims.\n       Reasonable people can disagree over the merits of S. 25. \n     Some believe that efforts to regulate campaign financing are \n     misguided and doomed to failure. But opposition to the wisdom \n     of S. 25 should not take the form of distorted descriptions \n     of existing constitutional law. The complexity of existing \n     campaign financing law in the Supreme Court makes it \n     impossible to state with certainty what path the future Court \n     will follow. But I believe that the best reading of existing \n     precedent renders the foregoing provisions of S. 25 \n     constitutionally defensible. Only Justice Thomas has embraced \n     the ACLU's absolutist refusal to permit any regulation of \n     campaign financing.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                    Burt Neuborne,\n                       Legal Director, Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the reason I asked that the letter be \nincluded in the Record is that he says:\n\n       I am writing in response to a letter to Senator Mitch \n     McConnell, dated February 20, 1997, from the American Civil \n     Liberties Union, arguing that critical provisions of S. 25, \n     the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997, are \n     unconstitutional under existing Supreme Court precedent. I am \n     the John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law at New York \n     University and Legal Director of the Brennan Center for \n     Justice. I served as National Legal Director of the American \n     Civil Liberties Union during the 1980's, and remain active in \n     defense of the First Amendment. I continue to serve as an \n     ACLU volunteer counsel. I believe, however, that the ACLU \n     letter on S. 25 is simply wrong in a number of assertions, \n     despite the fact that it was written by an able lawyer whom I \n     respect and admire.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is an interesting rebuttal to the position \nthat the ACLU has taken on S. 25.\n  I would also like to point out that I have great respect for the \nACLU. But there are very few occasions on which I have agreed with the \npositions that the ACLU has taken on a broad variety of issues.\n  We can argue the constitutionality of this issue, and, if we win, we \nwill get into the major debate. But I will have a very large body of \nconstitutional opinion--not just the ACLU--as to the constitutionality \nof the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I also suggest again that we have to clean up this system. It is \nbroken. It is out of control. Almost every American agrees with that. \nPoll after poll after poll is telling us that the American people are \ncynical about us, the way we are selected, and the system under which \nmoney seems to be the determinant factor in the selection of our public \nservants.\n  I will continue to seek support both inside the Halls of Congress and \noutside the beltway, and I and Senator Feingold fully intend to bring \nthis bill up this year. The ideal way that we would seek to do that \nwould be us all sitting down together and coming up with a package as \nwe did on the gift ban, as we did on lobbying reform, as we did on the \nline-item veto, as we have on a broad variety of reforms we have \nenacted by near unanimous if not total unanimous agreement.\n  My message to those who say I am now in favor of campaign finance \nreform is, as you know, so am I, so are many others, so are most \nAmericans. So let us sit down adhering to principles and recognize what \nthe problems are and sit down as mature individuals and move forward \nand reform this system for the benefit not only of those of us who have \nthe honor and opportunity to serve today but provide an opportunity for \ndedicated and outstanding young men and women to serve this Nation in \nthe future in elected office.\n  I intend to continue to conduct this debate with respect and \nappreciation for the views of my colleague from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, who disagrees with me, my colleague from the State of \nWashington, Senator Gorton, and others. I believe that we can strongly \ndisagree on this issue and respect each other's views, and I think the \nAmerican people deserve a debate that is conducted in an environment of \nmutual respect. I am happy to say that at least in my view we have \nconducted this debate on that level during this period of time, \nrecognizing that it is a very emotional issue on both sides. But I \nthink the American people will be far better off if we continue to \nconduct this debate on the Hollings bill today as well as our overall \ndebate on campaign finance reform in that vein in the future, and I \ncommit to my colleagues that I will conduct it in that fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to be here today with two \ngreat Senators who have been leading the discussion on a very important \nmatter to this country.\n  During my campaign last fall, I was involved in a campaign in which I \nhad two opponents spend over $1 million of their own money on a primary \nelection, two others spent over half a million dollars--$5 million was \nspent really against me in the primary, which I eventually won, and we \nhad a very contested race in the fall.\n  I know how difficult it is to raise money, how distasteful it is, how \nfrustrating it is to have to deal with that problem. I came here with \nan idea that I would be quite willing to consider whatever reforms we \ncould undertake to improve that system. I have given it thought. The \nresults of my thoughts are that I have concluded that we are at a point \nwhere we have to admit the primacy of the first amendment and free \nspeech and I have come down on that side.\n  We had in my general election campaign the trial lawyers association \nthat spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe over $1 million, \nopposing my candidacy. That frustrated me. Some of it was not properly \nreported. It was not required to be reported in a timely fashion to the \npublic. So it was difficult to know where that money was coming from, \nand I do not think that was correct.\n  I ask, after having given it a lot of thought, how can we say that a \ngroup\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\nof trial lawyers, a group of business people, a group of union people \ncannot get together and go on television and speak at the time of an \nelection about candidates or issues in which they believe deeply. This \nis so fundamental. Some say, well, you can talk about issues; you just \ncannot do it at the election cycle.\n  Well, when else do we want to talk about it? When is it \nmore important than when we are trying to decide the direction this \ncountry is going, when we are facing it during an election cycle. I do \nnot see how we can avoid that.\n\n  The amendment of the Senator from South Carolina I think is an honest \nattempt to deal with the problem because I do not believe under the \npresent constitutional structure we can make many of the changes that \nhave been suggested to date. So I respect him for that. But I consider \nthat it would be an astounding, a thunderous, a remarkable change of \npolicy for America to adopt this proposed amendment.\n  It says Congress shall have the power to limit expenditures made by a \ncandidate in an election. That is a remarkable thing to say, that a \nperson cannot go out and say to the people, through their own resources \nor the resources of others, why they ought to vote for them or against \ntheir opponent. I think that is a fundamental alteration of the great \ndemocratic trends or tendencies of this Nation.\n  I do not think it is a complicated case. We can have professors and \nscholars, and they can write briefs and all this stuff, but look at \nthis. This is a restriction on free debate in America. It is a \nfundamental issue that this country is dealing with, and I must say \nthat I do not believe we should support it. I think it would be one of \nthe most regressive actions, one of the greatest retreats from the \ndemocratic ideal that would have occurred in my lifetime, maybe in the \nhistory of this Nation.\n  I just wanted to take a few minutes to share those comments. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor, I \nwant to commend him for his statesmanship when he made the observation \nthat our first inclination after a campaign is to think, boy, I would \nsure like to have shut up those people who were out there trying to \nbeat me; wouldn't it have been easy if I could have just quieted those \nvoices who were against what I was trying to do?\n  But as the Senator from Alabama has pointed out so well, America is a \nseething cauldron of voices, either individually or in groups who take \nan interest in the future of this country and try to sway our free \nelections one way or the other.\n  That is exactly what the founders of this country envisioned. And so \nwhat the amendment before us seeks to do is to take a big hunk out of \nthe first amendment, which when it was passed over 200 years ago was \nalmost entirely about political speech, and say that the Government now \nhas the power to control how much not only we get to speak in our own \ncampaigns but the Senator from Alabama knows, because he was referring \nto this amendment, not just the campaign that we are conducting against \nour opponent but this says in addition Congress may set reasonable \nlimits on those in support of us or in opposition to us.\n  Given all the discussion that we have observed here in the last few \nmonths about the expressions of outside groups, whether it was through \nlegislative activity or independent expenditures, I would just ask my \nfriend from Alabama, does he not think it is conceivable that Congress \nmight decide that kind of speech is unreasonable and eliminate it \nentirely in this environment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is a very realistic possibility, and it is \nso incapable of enforcement or definition. Do you say that a private \ngroup that believes deeply in interests like pro-life or pro-choice \ncannot raise money and say don't vote for John Doe because he is \nopposed to our views? I think that is what America is all about. We \nhave to be able to take the heat and defend our positions as best we \ncan, and we should not turn that over just to the news media to do so.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Alabama, I agree with him; we \nshould not do that, but I think under this amendment we could do it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It troubles me greatly. I have read that language in \nthis proposed amendment. I consider it frightening. That is the reason \nI felt obligated to come and express my opinions today, not for any \nother reason. I think we should not amend the Constitution in this \nfashion, and I want to be on record opposing it.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Alabama.\n  The only other point I will make, now that he is an incumbent, like \nthe Senator from Kentucky, and since all of us incumbents would get to \ndecide what is reasonable, is it not, I ask my friend from Alabama, \nconceivable to think that Congress might decide it was reasonable to \nshut up all the outside groups and have such a low spending ceiling \nthat a challenger to us could never get off the ground? All in the name \nof getting that nasty money out of the system; we want to get rid of \nthat, want to control all that spending, stop the money chase. We could \nall stand up here in a chorus of 100 of us and say we are going to stop \nthe money chase. Each of us here are going to set the spending limit in \nour respective States exactly where we think it is reasonable.\n  The Senators from Alabama would set the spending limit in Alabama, \nthe Senators from Kentucky would set the spending limit in Kentucky, \nand the Senators from Idaho would set the spending limit in Idaho. I \nbet you we would all come up with just the right amount to make sure \nthat nobody had a shot at us. I mean nobody. We would make sure the \ngroups could not talk at all. We would make sure our opponent could not \ntalk much. And, of course, under this, you could tell somebody they \ncould not spend their own money to express themselves, the difficulty \nwith which the Senator from Alabama was confronted in the primary. We \ncould shut them all up under this. This in the name of healthy \ndemocracy?\n  The Democratic leader of the House--I just happened to have it \nposted. I do not want to detain the Senator from Alabama, but several \npeople have mentioned this. I just wanted those who might be viewing to \nsee it. The Democratic leader in the House, in support of an amendment \nlike this, said, with a straight face, apparently--apparently with a \nstraight face:\n\n       What we have is two important values in direct conflict: \n     Freedom of speech [on the one hand] and our desire for \n     healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You cannot have \n     both.\n\n  I am told he did not snicker when he said that. Everyone who heard it \nbroke out laughing. This is one of the most astonishing comments in the \nhistory of American politics, made in behalf of a constitutional \namendment, similar to the one before us today, to carve a niche out of \nthe first amendment and give the Government, us, the Congress, the \npower to shut everybody up. That is what is before us today. This is \nabout free speech. It is about political discourse in this country.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Alabama for a very important \ncontribution to this most important debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I agree with the \nSenator, the statement as printed behind him there on that chart is an \nastounding and very troubling statement. I think it reflects \naccurately, though, what thicket we get into when we attempt to pass \nlaws to regulate speech in the campaign. I do not see how we can get \nout of this.\n  I think we need to make sure people report what they give so the \npublic can know who is supporting whom. But I think this would be a \nhistoric retreat, the greatest retreat from free speech since the \nfounding of this Nation, if we were to adopt it. It is bad policy, and \nI must speak in opposition to it.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership in this effort.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\n  The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. I had hoped, when I see the \ndistinguished Senator, that he and others on the other side would have \nan open mind. I know there was a time when that occurred. But, \nobviously, you can see from their strategy here that they are taking \nthe party position. It is unfortunate when you do that and try to hide \nbehind free speech, which is not at issue. We are talking about paid \nspeech. But instead, they hide behind James Madison and Patrick Henry \nand do not want to recognize the truth.\n\n  I would be ready to vote this afternoon. I can see at a glance that \ntime and again we face a false charge. Time and again my opponents come \nup with the same false representation. And time and again we met with \nanecdotal ``could be's,'' and ``what would happen's.''\n  For example, the distinguished Senator from Alabama just said, ``This \nis remarkable. This goes to a fundamental issue. Congress should not be \namending the Constitution.''\n  And under my amendment, Congress is not. Instead, it will be up to \nthe people of America. This amendment simply is a joint resolution \ngiving authority to the Congress to limit expenditures, should the \nStates approve this. We have to get 34 States to approve of this joint \nresolution, and this joint resolution only gives to the people an \nopportunity to vote. I wrote the first version of this resolution 10 \nyears ago with, ``The Congress is hereby authorized to regulate or \ncontrol expenditures in Federal elections.'' The States and the \nGovernors and everyone else said, ``Include us.'' So we amended the \njoint resolution giving the people a chance to vote. So it is not \nCongress that is running around amending the Constitution.\n  Then the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, ``When we put the \nrights of free speech in the hands of Congress''--we have done it. But \nwe did it with respect to false and deceptive advertising. On \ntelevision and radio, we gave Congress the right to regulate free \nspeech when Congress acted in controlling obscenity. We told the \nFederal Communications Commission, as the administrative arm of the \nCongress, ``We want you to watch these programs and rule out \nobscenity.'' And then in Buckley, in a 5-to-4 decision by the Supreme \nCourt, they held--as the Senator from Washington says, if we put the \nrights of free speech in the hands of Congress, oh, that would be a \nterrible thing. But if we look closely at the Buckley decision, it has \nbeen put there and has been found constitutional by none other than the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  When the Congress acted in 1974 to control expenditures in Federal \nelections, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, to use the \nopposition's expression, took a big hunk out of the first amendment. \nAnd there are those who would, in political discourse, see their \nfreedom of speech to contribute as they choose limited. So don't come \naround here with the call of horrors--``this is fundamental''; ``this \nis so terrible''; or, ``this is remarkable.''\n  Their conduct in the treatment of this joint resolution is what is \nremarkable. They don't want to admit that what is involved here is \nlimiting spending, not freedom. There is nothing free here at all but \nour chance to limit expenditures in political campaigns. If you want to \nlimit spending, if you want to excise the cancer on the body politic \nthat has grown so now that we can't even do our business except in a \nparty fashion, so be it.\n  We have tried over the years in every way. I don't want to clutter \nthe Record with the entire article in Congressional Quarterly a few \nyears back discussing the need for campaign finance reform, but it I \nwill read part of it:\n\n       Most Democrats supported spending limits which would allow \n     challengers to spend on a level equal to incumbents. Under \n     the 1976 Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo, spending \n     limits had to be voluntary. The Court said that public \n     financing was a legitimate carrot to encourage compliance \n     with those voluntary limits, a concept some Democrats \n     supported anyway, calling public funding ``clean money.'' \n     Most Republicans, however, strenuously oppose taxpayer \n     financing of congressional campaigns which they liken to \n     welfare for politicians. Many Republicans also argued that \n     spending limits locked in incumbent advantages. They said \n     challengers needed the option to outspend incumbents to make \n     themselves equally viable to voters.\n\n  Then, Mr. President, going along:\n\n       In 1987, debate over these issues threw the Senate into a \n     virtually unprecedented procedural fit. Consideration of a \n     bill that included spending limits and Federal funding \n     stretched over 9 months and forced a record 8 cloture votes \n     in an effort to break a Republican filibuster, a 53-hour-24-\n     minute session and a Senator injured and dragged to the floor \n     under arrest highlighted the episode. In the end, the Senate \n     failed to overcome partisan divisions, and the bill succumbed \n     to the process.\n\n  The article goes on to talk about a bill in 1992. They wrote:\n\n       In the years that followed with a Republican in the White \n     House pledging to veto any bill approved by the Democratic \n     Congress, neither party showed much interest in restaging the \n     drama. Instead, when an ethics scandal broke, such as the \n     Keating Five affair in 1990 and 1991, in which five Senators \n     were accused of accepting favors from a savings and loan \n     magnet, campaign finance legislation was trotted out as a \n     symbol of reform. The two Chambers reached agreement on a \n     bill in 1992, after the House came under siege over the House \n     bank scandal. That bill stapled a plan House Democrats had \n     crafted for their campaigns to an entirely different plan \n     Senate Democrats had sanctioned. Both plans, however, \n     included spending limits and public finance and, as promised, \n     President Bush vetoed the bill.\n\n  I only mention this because it has been a long, hard road, and I \nhoped, as that article said, that we would have another fit here. I \nthought that we would get a fit of conscience here and really do away \nwith the partisanship stonewalling, because they know that is what is \ninvolved. They have the advantage, in spite of all that the White House \ndid in the last Presidential race. Just mark it down in Senator \nThompson's hearing that the Republicans got $150 million more. So \nwhatever the Democrats did, the Republicans did better. We all know it, \nand you can ask anybody in the public.\n  We have been in the game, we have watched it, we have read about it, \neverybody knows about it, and we have tried over the years to correct \nit. In 1966, Congress adopted public financing for Presidential \nelections, and then in 1967, they repealed public financing for \nPresidential elections.\n  In 1971, there was the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\n  In 1974, the amendments to that.\n  In 1976, a further amendment.\n  In 1979, another amendment.\n  By 1985, we had the Boren-Goldwater amendment--we had bipartisanship \nthen--to change the contribution limits and eliminate the PAC bundling, \nbut that was tabled.\n  Then, in 1986, the Boren-Goldwater amendment was adopted, but then it \ndidn't go far.\n  In 1988, Senator Byrd forced nine votes on the motion to instruct the \nSergeant at Arms and request the attendance while trying to get a vote \non S. 2. That is when they arrested a Senator, only the second time in \nhistory, dragging him in.\n  In 1988, we had the Hollings constitutional amendment to limit \ncampaign expenditures, and we got a 53 to 47 vote on cloture. Of \ncourse, we needed 60 votes at that particular time, and the majority \ndidn't control.\n  In 1989, S. 139, a comprehensive reform passed the Senate but never \nmade it out of the conference.\n  In 1991, of course, as I just mentioned, a comprehensive reform \npassed, which President Bush vetoed.\n  In 1993, we had a sense of the Senate by this Senator that Congress \nshould adopt a constitutional amendment limiting campaign expenditures \nwhich passed 52 to 43.\n  In 1993, we had a comprehensive reform pass the Senate but it never \nmade it out of conference.\n  In 1995, again the Hollings constitutional amendment to limit \ncampaign expenditures offered as amendment to the balanced budget \namendment. That was tabled by a vote of 52 to 45.\n  And, in 1995, the Senate passed the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to \naddress the campaign finance reform during the 104th Congress. Again, \nwe got a majority vote.\n  Then, in 1996, we had cloture on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform, and that cloture vote failed by a vote of 54 to 46.\n  So we keep hammering and hammering and trying every kind of which \nway. But we know that the intent in 1974 was to prevent individuals \nfrom buying their way into office. And now\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\nwe are continuing our fight in trying to overturn the Buckley decision \nthat held the office must be bought. We are trying to remove that \nrequirement, because the money in campaigns has gone up, up, and away. \nGood people are being withheld from public service, and the public is \nlosing confidence in the democratic process.\n  The only way to save this democracy is amend the Constitution. And \nrather than recognize this fact, the opposition simply raises strawman \nafter strawman.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, say, ``Might a Congress not come up and cut \noff speech entirely?'' The Senator from New Mexico says, ``I could \ndream up a scenario where that would be constitutional.'' He said he \ndid not think it was going to happen, but he could think of that later \non at a time when Congress would act in an inordinate fashion.\n  Then he turns to the Senator from Washington. He asks, ``Can't you \nthink of a Congress that may shut down entirely any opposition that \njust comes?'' Well, Senator Gorton, the Senator from Washington, said, \n``I doubt that that would happen, but it is the most fundamental attack \non the freedom of speech since the adoption of the Constitution.''\n  So they continue the same rhetoric about the freedom of speech. But \nif Buckley says that freedom of speech can be limited with respect to \nthose contributing in politics, then why not for those spending? They \ndo not want to answer that question.\n  Chief Justice Burger, in the better of the opinions in that case, \nsaid they are two sides of the same coin, contributions and \nexpenditures.\n  To quote exactly, he said, ``The Court's attempt to distinguish the \ncommunication inherent in political contributions from the speech \naspects of political expenditures simply will not wash.''\n  But, no, we come here with the Senator from Alabama, ``Congress \nshould not amend the Constitution.'' I agree with him. It cannot. But \ninstead, we let five Justices of the Supreme Court--over the opposition \nof four individuals--amend the Constitution whereby they limit freedom \nof speech as to contributions.\n  I put it word for word in this particular joint resolution. I wanted \nto show how we had come and aimed right down the barrel of the U.S. \nSupreme Court on the so-called freedom of speech. ``Congress shall have \npower to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may \nbe accepted by * * *.'' That is word for word the Buckley versus Valeo \ndecision. You can limit the amount of contributions.\n  That is what Congress did in the 1974 act. It is a frustrating thing \nthat is going on today because we try and try over a 30-year period. We \narrest people, get into a 9-month debate, and have cloture resolutions.\n  But now they ignore the need for action. They go in the back room and \nsay, we are going to vote as a party so do not worry about it. We let \nit go on over the weekend, discuss it maybe on Friday or Monday, and \nvote on Tuesday, because no one is going to listen. All that is \nrequired is for someone to come out from time to time, mention freedom \nof speech, and talk about how remarkable, how untoward, how drastic \nthis amendment is.\n  Then they have the Senator from Kentucky get up and say, ``Don't you \nthink the Congress could do all these horrible things?'' Well, it has \nalready occurred. Congress passed the 1974 act, and the Supreme Court \nhas held it binding. Our mistake was in figuring that conscience and \ncommon sense would say, as Chief Justice Burger said: two sides of the \nsame coin.\n  We say, ``Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on the \namount of contributions that may be accepted * * *.'' We have done it, \nand we are doing it. Then we add ``* * * and the amount of \nexpenditures''--which is what we try to get--``that may be made in \nthese campaigns.'' That is all it is. And it is said, let the people \nvote on it.\n\n  I wish I could get enough publicity to get the people focused on what \nis involved here and break down the stonewall thrown up by most on the \nother side of the aisle against limiting expenditures. We tried in a \nbipartisan way in 1974 to limit expenditures, and we said so much per \nour votes at that particular time.\n  After Watergate, Congress did not say, ``Heavens above, let's limit \nthe campaigns to $50,000,'' or any such thing. We had limits in a small \nState like South Carolina where we could spend $510,000, and inflate \nthat over the 20-year period. That is not $50,000. But no, they come up \nand say what Congress could do and how the U.S. Supreme Court, under \nthe mandate of being reasonable, would agree with them.\n  You know and I know that is a straw man. It should not even be \nconsidered seriously. But they come here with a very analytical \nargument about, ``The media sets the agenda, the fourth branch,'' and \ntry add to their parade of horribles as to what the media could do. \nWell, look at this particular joint resolution. It has nothing to do \nwith the freedom of the press, absolutely nothing to do with the \nfreedom of the press. And on the other hand, you have that freedom of \nthe press right now.\n  I related in the debate yesterday that I was running along with a \nnice little lead going into the election in 1992, and along comes the \nWall Street Journal and Paul Gigot. We had not heard of him before and \nwe have not heard of him since. But it was coordinated with the London \nEconomist and Robert Novak and others. Articles started being written \nabout the right to work. They know South Carolina is a right-to-work \nState. And they said, by cracky, I was opposed to it, but in fact I \nvoted for it as a member of the State legislature and have stuck with \nit throughout my political career. Organized labor knows that.\n  My opponents try to make the claim that I could say that the \neditorial was a contribution against me or a contribution for my \nopponent and therefore set it aside. Nonsense. They know that.\n  If you get a violent, caustic, scavenging editorial against you as a \npolitician, wake up, because you are in the game. As Harry says, you \nhave to take the heat or get out of the kitchen. If you are in the \nkitchen of politics, that is going to happen. There is no such thing as \nstopping it under our Constitution. Certainly not this amendment, which \nis to limit campaign expenditures, not the free press.\n  But they try to distort and stretch with this strawman exercise and \ncharade that we have been going through here all day today. Here and \nnow, and I have experienced it, that kind of activity has already \noccurred.\n  What we say here, and it is as simple as was testified before the \nJudiciary Committee in 1988, is 43 very simple, very clear-cut, words \nto limit expenditures in Federal, State, and local elections. That is \nall it is. Shall we do it? Shall we have the authority? It does not \naddress those questions. It does not say how you do it or that you must \ndo it.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, has been forthright. He \nsays we have not spent enough money on politics. He talks about how we \nspend way more money on cat food and dog food and Kibbles 'n Bits and \nyogurt. You would think that there would be some kind of dignity in the \nsilly things they put out as real arguments against this particular \nmission. But the Senator from Kentucky has come forward and said we are \nnot spending enough. Well, that is forthright. Maybe he can persuade \nothers, as he has persuaded the stonewalling opposition here today, and \nhe might get it increased. Then we can all get out and let the idle \nrich come in here and make the laws for the people of America, because \nwe will not have any regular folks that are willing to listen to the \npeople, who demand we get this money out of politics, that we limit \nthis thing, that we get this corruption out of politics.\n  Everybody admits to it and everybody says, ``I am for reform, reform, \nreform, campaign finance reform.'' But you cannot get reform unless you \nhave the authority. This has been proven over the last 30 years by all \nof these failed attempts. So if you want new authority, which does not \nsay whether or not to do it, does not try to limit newspapers, does not \nsay what it is expenditures, vote for this amendment. As a politician, \nyou are not going to get anything free from the free press. Go to them \nand ask them for a quarter- or half-page ad and they will laugh at\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\nyou. They just do not give free coverage. I have not ever heard of a \nnewspaper doing it yet.\n  The same with the radio and the TV advertisements. Go tell them how \nmuch you want to buy, and we are couched in a very sinister way into \nthese 30-second ads. You cannot discuss intelligently the issues before \nthe American people. That is the real burden on an incumbent. They say, \n``Well, Hollings, you voted in 1974 one way and now in 1994 you are \nvoting another way.'' Well, you come forward and try to explain that, \nbut you cannot explain that in a 20-second bite on TV. And try to buy 5 \nminutes. They will say, ``No, we are not selling that, and there is \nnothing you can do about it. Nothing you can do about it. We control \nthe prime time that you need to do it. We control that freedom of your \nspeech.''\n  It is already controlled here in the U.S. Senate with the filibuster \nrules, and over on the House side with the 1-minute, 2-minute, 5-minute \nrules, and in the committee with 5 minutes per Senator to examine the \nwitnesses. We all agree and understand and know the reason for the \nlimits, but then they bring on the dog and pony show, saying \n``remarkable, fundamental, never heard of it before.'' Who believes \nthat?\n  Mr. President, for 21 years Buckley versus Valeo has been on the \nbooks and we have abided by it, as the distinguished Senator from \nArizona says. We have the PAC limits and individual contribution \nlimits. But there is no limit on the individual candidate. That is what \nwe were after back in 1974. I was there. I voted. We said, ``Mr. Rich \nMan, you cannot buy this office.'' Now with this half a haircut \nsolution, what we have is the ones who contribute are totally limited, \nbut the ones with the wealth are totally unlimited. In reality, then, \nyou have taken away the speech of the poor. You have indirectly limited \nthe speech of the poor in spending.\n\n  The Supreme Court, five individuals against four, have amended that \nConstitution. You know it and I know it, but yet you come up here and \ntalk about what is remarkable and fundamental and ``the first time in \n200 years'' and on and on and on. Congress was given the authority to \nprohibit false and deceptive advertising and it has been upheld by the \nCourt. Congress has amended the right of free speech with respect to \nobscenity. It has been exercised, and in the decision of the U.S. \nSupreme Court upheld. In a sense, we now have the rights of free speech \nin the hands of Congress. They said that is fundamental, and do not \never do that. Like this is something new, putting the right of free \nspeech in the hands of Congress. But Congress has done it, and it has \nbeen upheld in Buckley versus Valeo. To use their expression, the Court \n``took a big hunk'' out of the first amendment, and found that among \nthose who want to exercise their free speech by contributing, free \nspeech is limited.\n  So we should get the real facts out about what we have here. We have \na bottom line. Do not come here congratulating on a misdescription by \nthe Senator from Texas as to whether or not you are for free speech. We \nsay expenditure. We do not say anything about ``free'' in this \namendment. It has nothing to do with free. It has to do with paid \nspeech, paid expression.\n  I was really moved by the Senator from Texas, who tried to change the \ndebate. That is what you have constantly with the stonewall against \nlimiting spending on the other side of the aisle. That is what we have. \nThey do not want to limit spending. They will say, ``Well, you have the \nadvantages of people. You have the AFL-CIO, the organization labor \nfellows, but we have the banks and we have the money and you expect us \nto give up our money.''\n  Well, well, well, I think that both sides have the cancer of money. \nThey ought to be able to recognize the reality that faces us after the \n30-year trying. They ought to give the people of America the right to \nvote and amend the Constitution.\n  When my Southern State and a lot of other Southern States had the \npoll test, we amended the Constitution. I told the story about the poor \nminority that presented himself to the polls in the early years and we \nhad the literacy test. They said to the poor minority, ``Boy, read that \npaper.'' They gave him a Chinese newspaper. What goes around comes \naround; we are back to China. And the poor individual just looked at it \nand he said, ``Yes, sir, I can read it.'' He said, ``You can? What does \nit say?'' ``It says, 'Ain't no poor minority fellow going to vote in \nSouth Carolina today.' '' Yes, he could get the message. There were all \nkinds of devices to prevent some from voting. However, we have amended \nthe Constitution to fix that.\n  If Madison, Patrick Henry, and Jefferson and all that crowd that the \nother side has been celebrating were so good, with their slaves, why \ndid we have to pass the 14th amendment? We didn't agree with what they \nfound, so we had the discrimination cases and the civil rights \nmovement. In my lifetime, we have had the poll test. We changed the \nConstitution to fix that.\n  We changed the Constitution when we made a mistake in Prohibition. We \nchanged the Constitution when we made a mistake with respect to the \nFederal income tax law.\n  Now, professors, all the studied minds, jurists, attorneys general, \nand the like have, said the Supreme Court made a mistake in Buckley \nversus Valeo, and the only way to correct it is with a forthright, \nrestricted, limited kind of constitutional amendment. An amendment that \nsays expenditures are limited in Federal, State, and local elections. \nIt is not free speech, it is paid speech. We are just as assiduous as \nany other Senator in the protection of the freedom of speech. We know \nits value, but we know it must have exceptions.\n  I put in the Record, Mr. President, a statement by Prof. Lawrence \nTribe of the freedom of speech and some of its exceptions that have \ndeveloped over the years. So don't come here on the floor of the Senate \nwith the act about fundamental, how remarkable this is. Egads, the U.S. \nSenate has voted for a constitutional amendment to grant Congress the \nauthority to limit campaign spending three times. We just voted 4 years \nago for a Sense of the Senate Resolution. Is there any sense of history \nand experience around here that we can finally come to grips with the \nfundamental--yes, it is a fundamental--money is a cancer on the body \npolitic.\n  If money corrupts in political campaigns, then unlimited money \ncorrupts absolutely in political campaigns. We know that, in warfare, \nhe who controls the air controls the battle. We know and understand and \nappreciate that, in campaigns, he who controls the airwaves controls \nthe campaign.\n  What you have here is the rich, as we saw 2 years ago in California, \nspending $30 million to be a Senator, and we think that is legitimate. \nIt is a disgrace. It is buying the office, and everybody knows it.\n  The rich who walk in and say, ``I am making so much money, but I need \nanother tax cut, a flat tax,'' and they sell it by controlling the \nairwaves with their millions of dollars in a Presidential race--they \nought to hang our heads in shame. That kind of activity is going on and \nis even covered by the free press. They ought to understand that \nfreedoms really are in jeopardy when we allow the rich to come along \nand buy the office.\n  My amendment says reasonable limits on expenditures, not on speech.\n  Mr. President, if others want to be heard, I will be glad to yield \nthe floor, but I have plenty here with respect to the authorities and \nthe witnesses that appeared before the Judiciary Committee. We have had \nhearings. The former Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, was on the \nother side. He withheld in that committee for a long time. I had to \nstruggle to get a majority vote. But we had the witnesses. They were \nheard, and a majority of the Judiciary Committee voted the amendment \nout and to the floor.\n\n  Please, my gracious, they reported it out. Once out, we didn't get it \npassed, but we got a sense of the Senate that it should be passed. \nSenators want to get that political credit. It's a pollster politician \nthat says, ``I am for reform and that is what we ought to do.'' ``Yes, \nsir, I believe we ought to limit this financial cancer.'' ``Yes, I \nvoted reform when it was only a Sense of the Senate.'' And then when \nthey get to real reform, they put on this big show here trying to quote \nMr. Gephardt and saying, ``You can't have a strong democracy and \nfreedom of speech.'' They know and I know, this democracy is strong \nbecause of free speech--none of us believe otherwise. I think it is a \ndistortion. I think it is a distortion perhaps\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\nof what the gentleman said, but be that as it may, no one ascribes to \nthat in this particular body.\n  Everybody knows how we got here. Incidentally, we all got here not \nthrough free speech--unless somebody was appointed, and I can't think \nof any appointments now that we have had the election--but every one of \nthe 100 have had to pay through the nose to be heard on the TV, to be \ncovered in the newspapers, to be heard on the radio, and seen on the \ntelevision, billboards, and yard signs. So we know all about the paid \nspeech.\n  That is what we are trying to do, put an ultimate limit on it \nbecause, once done, then we can get a handle on some of the real \nabuses. Then we control all of the monkeyshines that go on.\n  Once you get it limited and fully disclosed, like in the 1974 act \nwhere every dollar that I receive in a campaign is recorded in the \nsecretary of the senate's office in my State capital and with the \nSecretary of the Senate, then you get it under control. With that limit \nand disclosure, you can see from whence they come, and who has, if at \nall, tried to buy or has been subject to undue influence.\n  After all, it is the people who are the ultimate jury. They decide on \nelection day. You can refer to that public record and say, see, he is \nbought and paid for by such and such an industry or such and such an \ninterest, whatever it is that comes out in the campaign. That is what \nthe disclosure requires. You can't receive huge sums and have it \nobscured.\n  We ran it the right way back in 1974. But the justices who amended \nthe Constitution in that Buckley decision, they created the system we \nhave been tortured with now for the past 20 years. And every time we \nmake the good college try to fix it, they come out here, and I am \nsurprised, frankly, at this particular charade because they got a lot \nof good conscientious Members that have come to the Senate, and they \nsay we will not fix it.\n  Some of those Members have run on the proposition of trying to limit \nspending. Here is the one opportunity to ask the American people if \nthat is what they want to do. Hollings is not amending the \nConstitution. The Senate is not amending the Constitution. The Congress \nis not amending the Constitution. We simply, in a little closely worded \namendment, said the people will have a chance to vote on it in the \nseveral States.\n  The last amendment to the Constitution took 200 years to pass. That \nis the 27th amendment. ``No law varying the compensation for the \nservices of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect until an \nelection of Representatives shall have intervened.''\n  Congress submitted the text of the 27th amendment to the States as a \npart of the proposed Bill of Rights on September 25, 1789. The \namendment was not ratified with the first 10 amendments, which became \neffective on December 15, 1791. The 27th amendment was ratified on May \n7, 1992, by the vote of the State of Michigan.\n  Just like the 27th amendment, you can put this Hollings-Specter \namendment up and let the people decide. You don't have to talk about \nthis amendment being so remarkable. It is not remarkable to let the \npeople decide. Only the people will change our fundamental rights. \nDon't believe those who say it is going to guarantee incumbency or any \nother of those parade of horrors that they bring up. Just remember, we \nare just giving the people, the good, commonsense American people, the \nchance to vote.\n  When the people looked at the 27th amendment, it wasn't until 203 \nyears later, in 1992, that they finally got the State of Michigan to \nratify it and the people decided. So there you are. It is just a chance \nto give the people chance to clear up this Buckley versus Valeo \ndecision.\n  The distinguished Chief Justice said, ``The Court's result does \nviolence to the intent of Congress.'' There isn't any doubt about it. I \nwas there. Chief Justice Burger,\n\n       The Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress \n     in this comprehensive scheme of campaign finance. By \n     dissecting the act bit by bit and casting off vital parts, \n     the Court fails to recognize the whole of this act is greater \n     than the sum of its parts. Congress intended to regulate all \n     aspects of Federal campaign finances.\n\n  I read again Chief Justice Burger:\n\n       Congress intended to regulate all aspects of Federal \n     campaign finances. But what remains after today's holding \n     leaves no more than a shadow of what Congress contemplated.\n\n  This decision, a 5-to-4 decision, and they are talking about what \nCongress might do. Look at what those five individuals have done.\n  Look what Justice White said in dissent,\n\n       The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective \n     campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by \n     the act and that the communicative efforts of these campaigns \n     would not seriously suffer. In this posture of the case, \n     there is no sound basis for invalidating the expenditure \n     limitations so long as the purposes they serve are legitimate \n     and sufficiently substantial, which in my view they are.\n\n  So there is Justice White finding them ``substantial'' back 20 years \nago, long before any kind of Keating Five, long before the Lincoln \nBedroom, long before the soft money scourge with the Colorado decision. \nLong before all these things, there was ``substantial'' then, and they \nare more than ``substantial'' today. ``Expenditure ceilings reinforce \nthe contribution limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption.''\n  Justice Byron ``Whizzer'' White couldn't be more correct. He couldn't \nbe more on target. We know it. The American people outside this Chamber \nknow it. They have asked for a chance to correct it. Let me read \nfurther from Justice White.\n\n       I have little doubt, in addition, that limiting the total \n     that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable \n     obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff \n     to communicate in more places and ways unconnected with \n     the fundraising function. There is nothing objectionable, \n     indeed, it seems to me, of weighing the interest in favor \n     of the provision in the attempt to insulate the political \n     expression of Federal candidates from the influence \n     inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising \n     increasingly large sums of money. I regret that the Court \n     has returned them all to the treadmill.\n\n  Mr. President, when you talk of that treadmill, you can't ignore the \ndescription that was used by the distinguished writer some 15 years \nago, Elizabeth Drew, in the New Yorker when she described, if you \nplease, the same situation with respect to that treadmill in her \narticle ``Politics and Money.'' And I read:\n\n       Until the problem of money is dealt with, it is unrealistic \n     to expect the political process to improve in any other \n     respect. It is not relevant whether every candidate who \n     spends more than his proponent who wins--though in races that \n     are otherwise close, this tends to be the case. What matters \n     is what the chasing of money does to the candidate and to the \n     victor's subsequent behavior. The candidates' desperation for \n     money and the interests' desire to affect public policy \n     provide a mutual opportunity. The issue is not how much is \n     spent on elections but the way the money is obtained. The \n     point is what raising money, not simply spending it, does to \n     the political process. It is not just that the legislative \n     product is bent or stymied. It is not just that well-armed \n     interests have a head start over the rest of the citizenry--\n     or that often it is not even a contest . . .\n       It is not even relevant which interest happens to be \n     winning. What is relevant is what the whole thing is doing to \n     the democratic process. What is at stake is the idea of \n     representative Government, the soul of this country.\n\n  That was written in 1982, some 15 years ago. We were worried then \nabout Buckley versus Valeo. That was 6 years after everybody had looked \nat it and seen the treadmill, exactly as Justice White called it, and \nthe damage to the soul of the country as a result of this treadmill. It \nwas an injury to our democracy, according to Elizabeth Drew.\n  There is no question that this has to be dealt with. They might run, \nas Joe Louis said, but they can't hide. I am not going to let them hide \nbehind this freedom of speech babble. I have it in here word for word. \nMr. and Mrs. American people, you are given the authority to vote. You \nare not controlling it unless you vote yea, allowing Congress to have \nthe power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions.\n  That is already in place under the Buckley versus Valeo \nconstitutional decision. We have that limit on the freedom of speech \nwhich is so remarkable and so fundamental that they inaccurately \ncontinue to caterwaul about. Now, we are attempting to limit the amount \nof expenditures, not freedom of speech. It is limits on the amount of \ncontributions, limits on the amount of expenditures, nothing free. It \nis contributions and it is expenditures, and it is limits thereof, and \nit is\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\nwhether or not the American people shall have the right to vote on it \nafter this 30-year trial.\n  Otherwise, as Justice Thurgood Marshall in another one of the \ndistinguished dissenting opinions stated, and I quote:\n\n       It would appear to follow that the candidate with the \n     substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \n     significant head start. Of course, the wealthy candidate can \n     potentially overcome the disparity in resources through \n     contributions from others, but ability to generate \n     contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial \n     base for the campaign or some demonstration of preexisting \n     support, which in turn is facilitated by expenditures of \n     substantial personal sums. Thus, the wealthy candidate's \n     immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give \n     him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can \n     never overcome. And even if the advantage can be overcome, \n     the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not \n     only discourage potential candidates without significant \n     wealth from entering into the political arena but also \n     undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral \n     process.\n\n  There it is, that last phrase--``not only discourage potential \ncandidates without significant personal wealth, but also undermine \npublic confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.'' That is \nexactly what is occurring\n  That is the trouble. As Marshall said:\n\n       Large contributions are the less wealthy candidate's only \n     hope of countering the wealthy candidate's immediate access \n     to substantial sums of money. With that option removed, the \n     less wealthy candidate is without the means to match the \n     large initial expenditures of money of which the wealthy \n     candidate is capable. In short, the limitation on \n     contributions puts a premium on a candidate's personal \n     wealth.\n\n  Think about that. This is, as expressed, ``a big hunk of the first \namendment,'' as expressed by my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. \nWe are capable of limitation on contributions. And that is sustained \nhere by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Buckley case. That puts a premium \non a candidate's personal wealth because the only way that a less \nwealthy candidate can catch up is with large expenditures. But the \nCourt, has ``limited the freedom of speech for the first time in 200 \nyears.'' I will use their expression and see if anybody believes it. \nThis happened in 1976. It happened after many other times the Court has \nupheld limits, but let us use their expression if that is what \neverybody wants to believe. The Supreme Court, in Buckley versus Valeo, \nfor the first time in 200 years, limited a contributor, his expression, \nand his freedom of speech in politics and therefore has put a premium \non the candidate's personal wealth. He is penalized. The speech of the \nless affluent candidate is taken away because the less affluent \ncandidate can only make it up, if he has no personal wealth, by larger \ncontributions. But the Court, in limiting contributions, limited free \nspeech for the first time in 200 years.\n\n  Maybe that is the way they will understand it. I do not know how to \nget their attention and get them out from this stonewalling on limiting \nspending in political campaigns.\n  Everywhere we go, they all say, what about campaign finance reform, \nSenator? I say, ``Oh, yeah, I am for reform.'' And then one chance we \nget here this week to vote for it, we decide to put it off until next \nweek. We hope it does not appear on the Sunday programs or anything of \nthat kind so the people will never know we had that chance. And once we \nhave done that, then they will tell Senator Feingold and Senator \nMcCain, ``Well, you had your vote; you can see Congress does not want \nto limit it. We cannot spend a whole year on reform. You have had your \nchance, and the majority voted against that chance. You did not pass \nthe joint resolution of Hollings-Specter so let's go on to something \nelse.'' Thereby, the entire thing is supposed to be swept under the \nrug. Well, it was almost swept under the rug on Monday. On Monday, they \nhad it greased. They had a majority vote out of that Rules Committee, \nMr. President, to just look at the illegal and not look at the \nimproper, and they thought they had a majority vote along party lines. \nBut Senator Thompson of Tennessee won out. He said we had a fit of \nconscience of at least eight or nine on that side. They were going to \nhave egg on their faces. They were going to lose to a Democratic \namendment.\n\n  ``My gracious, we cannot ever let that happen. We are so bipartisan \naround here,'' they said. My Aunt Ida. Instead they said, ``we just \ncannot have a Democratic amendment prevail in this particular score. \nSo, we will just all join in, then, and vote the 99 votes and adopt \nit.'' They had a fit of conscience.\n  Maybe we will get a fit of conscience. Maybe not today, maybe not \ntomorrow or next week, but we will keep coming back. We have had it \nthree other times. We will get this the fourth time. We keep picking up \nsteam.\n  My difficulty over the years has been in trying to put up an \namendment again and again, because they tell me at the desk, that \naccording to parliamentary rules, you cannot amend a simple bill--three \nreadings in the House, three in the Senate, signed by the President--\nbecause this is a joint resolution. It is not to be signed by the \nPresident, but to go directly to the people for their ratification in \nthe several States.\n  So, if I bring it up on any and every bill--which I am prepared to \ndo, because I know the people are demanding it, and we will finally \nmake a breakthrough--I have to wait for a joint resolution. That is why \nI finally got it up on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, for the simple reason that last year Senator Dole would \nnot let me up. He just would not bring up a joint resolution on \nanything. When he got his unanimous consent to bring up the balanced \nbudget amendment, I told them that I had an amendment to offer. They \nsaid later on, ``Oh, that is not relevant and our agreement meant \nrelevant amendments on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.''\n  So I struggled all last year, 1996, and could not even get it up. I \nam going to look for any joint resolution that quietly comes by, and I \nwill draft my resolution so that it is separate and apart from the \nother resolution, so that it would not interrupt it, and we, maybe we \ncan get an up or down vote at that particular time again. But I can \ntell what the strategy is here, now. It is to get an arguable reason to \nstonewall McCain-Feingold. We can say, ``Well, we have had enough \ndebate. We debated it 3 or 4 days, and everything else. Everybody has \nconsidered it. They are not going to limit campaign expenditures, so \nwhy do McCain-Feingold? If you do this, you are going to limit it. If \nyou do that, we are going to limit it. We have already voted on limits \nin the Hollings amendment and that is it. Forget about it and let us \nall go home and say we all tried. We were all for reform.''\n  Oh, yes, we are all for limiting it any time it is in a sense of the \nSenate. It is kind of hard to hide behind that. Maybe that is what I \nwill continue to do, on every bill, get a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I think you have to get 25--we can get 25 Senators to \ncosponsor that right easily, and keep bringing it up until they get \nthat fit of conscience.\n  They do not have it now. They are not interested in the soul of \ndemocracy. They are not proud to be in public service. What they are \nproud to do is outmaneuver; what they are proud to do is avoid and \nevade; what they are proud to do is finesse, in a clever, parliamentary \nway. What they are proud of is parliamentary maneuver. So, then they \nall vote up or down on this. They smile at each other. And they will \ngive that praise to the Senator from South Carolina. They will say, \n``We know he is sincere, but he is so misdirected, the poor fellow. He \nhas tried hard. We respect him for trying so hard, but, bug off, son. \nYou are not going to pass anything here that has to do with limiting \nexpenditures in Federal elections.''\n  That is what we have considered, time and time and time again. And it \nis not freedom of speech--it is the protection of speech. But if they \nwant to say it is the freedom of speech, then we have drafted it after \nBuckley versus Valeo, which said that part of the speech is already \nlimited. Let us give a neat little other side. There are two sides to \nthe Buckley coin, as Justice Burger said. Let us take care of the \nexpenditures themselves and not dance around the mulberry bush with \nPatrick Henry and James Madison and anybody else from the time that \nthey believed in slavery.\n\n  That is the forefathers. I think we have come a long way. They did \nnot have to go down the road in the wagon and solicit $14,000 every \nweek. They did\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\nhave freedom of speech and free elections.\n  They did a pretty good job, though. We got a good Constitution, \ngenerally. But we have had to amend it because they did believe in \nslavery and we have outgrown that particular cancer. We are trying this \nafternoon to outgrow this particular cancer. We can get elections back \nto the issues and the confidence of the people back in their Congress \nand their democracy. And we can get participation. But why did less \nthan 50 percent come out to vote? The votes say, ``What is the reason? \nThe money controls the whole blooming thing.''\n  Look at what is in the headlines, that is all we have had--January, \nFebruary, down into March. There is another shoe that falls every day. \nThey begin to think this political contribution character is a \ncentipede. I have never seen so many shoes falling.\n  We go from Indonesia to China to all these different countries to \neverything else of that kind. It would be helpful to me if they all \nwould say: ``Look, we tried to compete. We stretched every law. We \nintentionally stretched every law. We asked Philadelphia lawyers, `Can \nyou do it?' And when the Philadelphia lawyers said, `You can do it,' \nthen we said, `We have to do it, because that Republican crowd is going \nto outraise us anyway you look at it.' '' And they did. They raised \nover $150 million more than the Democrats were able to raise.\n  So, why don't they admit to what exactly occurred and then let us \npass this amendment and give the people an opportunity to vote on what \nthey have been asking for 30 years now. I went down the litany of \nfailed reforms, Senator, from 1966 right on.\n  But when we get the distinguished former chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and now ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nto come to the floor, the Senator from South Carolina knows when to \nhush. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to apologize to my friend from South \nCarolina because, as usual, he has been carrying the heavy load here. \nHe has been carrying the water for all of us. I do apologize for not \nbeing here, to be more engaged in this debate. Frankly, I say to my \nfriend from South Carolina, everything else we talk about--all the \nother talk about what we are going to do about campaign financing and \ncampaign finance reform, and who has more money and who has less money, \nand how to avoid the stain and stink of money--ultimately, cannot make \na difference until, we do what you have been telling us we need to do \nfor the last decade or more.\n  We have a Supreme Court that has interpreted the first amendment in a \nbizarre way. This is not only with regard to the Buckley case. Take, \nfor example, all this talk about soft money. We would not be in the \nspot we are in with soft money in terms of both political parties had \nit not been for the Supreme Court decision last year. At least there \nused to be a couple of veils left in this dance of seven veils. Now, \nyou have major, major contributors who can come in and just change the \nwhole dynamic of Senate and House races.\n  I just came from a meeting on chemical weapons. This is sort of the \nbiological agent of politics that we are trying to eliminate here. Two \nyears ago, in the last cycle, if somebody wanted to come in and put up \n$100,000, $500,000, $1 million, $5 million--if they did it all by \nthemselves, did not coordinate it with a political party, put up \nbillboards and advertisements and did not collude with the one or the \nother political parties against a specific candidate, then they could \nspend all the money they wanted. But there was this little veil that \nsat there. It did not allow the multimillionaire to pick up the phone \nand call the chairman of the Democratic Party or Republican Party in \nDelaware and say, look, I want to defeat Biden or I want to defeat the \nother guy and I have a million bucks; how do you want me to spend it?\n  The Supreme Court came along--a fellow I voted for, a brilliant guy--\nand wrote an opinion and said in effect, ``Oh, no, there's no \ndistinction between you going out and spending it yourself, in first \namendment terms, and giving it to and coordinating with a political \nparty.''\n  What happened? We have a thousand dollar limit on individual \ncontributions. But what does that mean? In my campaign this last time \nout, all of a sudden I find--I assume in coordination with the \npolitical party; by the way, I am not saying Democrats would do the \nsame thing if they had the money--all of a sudden, I am finding all \nthese ads on the radio with our good friend Malcolm Wallop. He was a \ngood friend; he is a good man. He was heading up Americans for Freedom \nor some organization with a name like that.\n  He said, ``This is Americans for Freedom. Do you realize Senator Joe \nBiden is taking away your freedom?'' Another group came in and did \nspecific radio ads against me, coordinated by the Republicans.\n  All of a sudden, my opponent had money. When he had to go out and get \nlittle pieces at a time, he had a hard time convincing people to give \nhim the money. But, you get a couple of those big guys, they come \nalong, and here is 10, 20, 50, 70, 100,000 bucks.\n  The point I am making is, all that is legal now. So what are we going \nto do? We can pass all the laws. I support McCain-Feingold. I am going \nto vote for it. But, I am reminded of that person who once said, ``You \nknow, moderate reform is like moderate chastity.'' That is about what \nwe are getting here with legislation.\n  When I arrived here, one of the first things I did, to the best of my \nrecollection--it was Dick Clark and Joe Biden--was propose Federal \nfunding of elections, congressional elections, because I wanted to get \nthe private money out of this deal. I wanted to challenge incumbents, \nto let challengers have the same money incumbents had. I did not want \npublic officials to be beholden to anybody but the American taxpayer.\n  I will never forget, some Democratic Senators, God bless their souls, \nlike Warren Magnuson--``Maggie,'' as we used to call him--from \nWashington State, and some very prominent Republicans, looked at me and \nsaid, ``Kid, do you know what you're doing here? Do you understand \nthis?'' I am not joking about this. ``Do you understand this?''\n  One Senator I will not name but has long since passed, called me into \nthe Cloakroom, pulled me aside and said, ``Joe, come here.'' I was 30 \nyears old at the time. I walked in and said, ``Yes, sir?''\n  He said, ``Enough of this stuff now, all right?''\n  I said, ``Enough of what?''\n  He said, ``This thing about giving the other guy the same amount of \nmoney we get.'' He said, ``I worked too''--I won't quote him \nprecisely--``I worked too darn hard to get to the point where some \nlittle sniveling brat will get the same money I have to run against \nme.''\n  Well, that is why nobody in here wants to have it that way. I am not \ncrazy about the fact. I have been around longer now. I am a senior \nSenator, so I can raise more money than the other guy. But, the other \nguy should have as much money as me to run, and neither of us should \nhave to go around with our hats in hand saying, ``Will you help me?'' \nbecause it is a corrosive process, especially for a new guy and a new \nwoman.\n  The reason I am saying that is this. I believe the vast majority of \npeople who contribute to campaigns contribute to campaigns because \nthey, in fact, find a Senator who already has a position they agree \nwith. The problem I worry about is the young person who decides to run \nfor the first time.\n  I will repeat this story. I told it in a hearing once, and I paid for \nit. But I will repeat it again and probably will pay for it again.\n  Toward the end of my first campaign, when I was 29 years old, I had \nno money, didn't have a thing--no television money--and all of a \nsudden, the guy that couldn't possibly be beaten, I am within a point \nof him, the polls said.\n\n  About 10 days before the election, I get a phone call from a group of \nmen I never heard from before in an area of my State, I say to the \nPresiding Officer, where we used to only ride through and say, ``My \nGod, look at the size of those houses.'' I get a phone call. They were \ndecent men, by the way, decent, honorable men. They called me, and we \nwent out to this place they call ``the hunt country'' in my area. You \nknow it. You know some of the people. I was just so flattered they \ninvited me.\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\n  I was thinking, 10 days. My brother, who is 6 years younger than me, \nwas my campaign finance chairman. You can tell how effective we were. \nWe had no money. He was 24 years old. The Senator from South Carolina \nknows my brother. Jimmy says, while driving me out there, ``You know, \nJoe, we got a call from the radio stations. If tomorrow we don't have \nthe check for next week, we're off the air.'' Now, like anybody who is \nrunning for office, you pour your heart, your soul, everything into \nthis.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That's what they call free speech.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Right, free speech. You pour everything into it. So I was \nsitting there, and I was within a point, according to the polls, of \npulling off at that time, that year, what was viewed as the upset of \nthe year. I wasn't even old enough, Mr. President, to be sworn in the \nday I got elected.\n  So I was riding out there. I walked into this room with nice big \nleather couches. I get offered, like we do in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, a sherry. That is a kind of foreign relations thing, sherry. \nI get offered a sherry. I don't drink, so I politely said, ``No \nthanks.''\n  These guys are real nice guys, five or six of them, and most of them \nmade a living, God bless them--I don't begrudge them this--by clipping \ncoupons. They came from wealthy families with a lot of money, and they \nare decent guys. Two of them had already been helping me. They thought \nthis was a nice little revolution, this kid coming up doing this.\n  They sat there and looked at me. The one guy who was the older of \nthis group--I say I was 29, so they were probably between the ages of \n32 and 40. One guy looks at me and says, ``Joe, can you tell us your \nposition on capital gains?'' Now, Mr. President, I knew the right \nanswer for $30,000. I knew the right answer. Capital gains had not been \nan issue in the campaign. I had never spoken out on capital gains. No \none had talked about it, but I am not stupid.\n  I was sitting there--and this is the God's truth--I was sitting in \nthat room seeing what I worked for for 2 years about to go down the \ndrain because I don't have $20,000 to keep my radio ads on the air. \n$20,000 wouldn't get you anything these days, but it would have kept me \non the air for 10 more days with my radio ads, which were very \neffective, as it turned out.\n  I sat there, and I don't know why I did it--not because I am so \nhonorable and brave or anything--I just blurted out, ``I don't think we \nhave to change the capital gains structure.'' That was the end of the \nconversation. Everybody was very polite to me, said, ``Great idea,'' \nand talked about a few other things. They said, ``Joe, lots of luck in \nyour senior year.'' I got up and left. I didn't raise any money from \nthem.\n  I could have said, ``You know, gentlemen, I think the capital gains \nrate should be reduced.'' I knew that is how they all made their \nliving. By the way, there is a legitimate, serious argument that \ncapital gains should be reduced. It is not like it is something that is \nimmoral or bad. I just happen to disagree with it. The truth is, I had \nnot even thought that much about it, so it would not have been like I \nwas selling my soul had I changed a position. But, the contrariant \ninstinct got the better of me. I heard the words come out of my mouth \nand I thought, ``Oh, my God, what did I just say?''\n  Maybe I should not be so honest, but I have been around here too \nlong. I have been here 24 years. And, this story illustrates the \ncorrupting nature of the process. I have never known anybody I have \nworked with where a contributor says, ``Here, I got some money for you \nif you go ahead and take a certain position.'' That is not how it \nworks. That is not the corruption. The corruption is sort of an \ninsidious thing. It is insidious. But, in the public's mind, it is all \nbad now, even when we get support from people for positions we die for \npolitically--whether somebody contributed to us or not, we would hold \nthem dear, we would go down.\n  I always say to young people when they say they want to run for \noffice, answer one question: Is there something you are willing to lose \nover? If you are not willing to lose over something, you should not get \ninvolved in politics; you should go do something else.\n  And for all the women and men in the Senate, there are positions over \nwhich they are willing to give up their seats rather than yield on. \nSomebody who contributes to them, who happens to share their view on \nthat issue--now it is tainted in the public's mind. When we get support \nfrom people who are supporting us because we are of like mind, not \nbecause we changed our mind to get their support, we are viewed in a \nway that we must have done it because of the contribution. That is how \nbad it has gotten.\n  So what I do not understand, I say to my friend from South Carolina, \nis, you would think out of mere self-preservation and our own honor----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. You would think we would want to change the system. I \nwould say, to the best of my knowledge, all 100 Senators here are \nhonest and decent people. But the perception out there is that there \nmust be--must be--something wrong because all this money is in here.\n  So, it seems to me, I say to my friend from South Carolina--and I am \nnot being solicitous--as usual, you have cut to the quick of the \nmatter. Nothing can fundamentally change--fundamentally change--with \nregard to the way in which the process works until we have the ability \nunder the law to limit the amount of money we spend, to determine how \nwe can raise it, and to limit certain outside excesses that presently \nexist. If we did the things that we all would agree privately we have \nto do, the Supreme Court, I believe, would rule under their recent case \nlaw that it was a violation of the first amendment.\n  So what I am saying to my friend from South Carolina is, besides \nthank you, that you are dead, dead, dead right. I am going to vote for \nthings in addition to this amendment, but not because I think without \nthis amendment they are going to work, but because I think they are the \nonly things we can do. And, I hope that I am wrong in terms of my \nreading of the Court's assessment of the first amendment.\n  My colleagues sometimes kid me, Mr. President, because they know I \nteach constitutional law in law school now. I think it must send \nshutters through Justice Scalia and others that I have been teaching \nthe last 5 years a course on constitutional law and separation of \npowers issues. But you know what they say, if you want to learn a \nsubject, teach it. If you want to learn a subject, teach it.\n  I am an adjunct professor at Widener University Law School, and I \nhave taught a seminar on constitutional law for the past 5 years on \nSaturday mornings. I might add for the record, I do it without any \nconflicts to my job in the Senate. I do it Saturday mornings, on my \ntime. Nobody helps me with it.\n  I am telling you, Senator Hollings, you are right. Without changing \nthe Constitution and giving us the power to determine what parameters \nwe set or how we raise money for elections or how much we can spend, \nthen anything we do here is subject to significant change by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Twenty-one years ago the Supreme Court ruled that spending money was \nthe same thing as speech. The Court said that writing a check for a \ncandidate was speech, but writing a check to a candidate was not \nspeech.\n  The Supreme Court made a supremely bad and, I believe, supremely \nwrong decision. By saying that Congress shall make no law abridging the \nfreedom to write a check, the Court is saying that Congress cannot take \nthe responsible step of limiting how much money politicians can spend \nin trying to get elected. And we have to start putting limits on this \nbecause money is just permeating the system.\n  I am sure I am going to repeat a few things here that have been said \nby others, but I think they are worth being repeated.\n\n  In just the last 4 years, the total amount of money given to the \npolitical parties has increased 73 percent--73 percent. The total \namount of money spent on races for Congress has increased 600 percent \nin the last 20 years. These are in real dollars--600 percent.\n  I ask you, how do these young pages, some of whom hopefully have \ndreams and aspirations of standing where I am right now--hopefully, a \nnumber of you have that aspiration--how do they get started.\n  When I started to get involved in public office, I had to raise the \nawful\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nsum of $150,000 to make the race credible, $250,000 to be in the game, \nand $350,000 to win in little old Delaware.\n  Today, somebody who wants to beat an incumbent, me or Bill Roth, they \nbetter be able to raise a minimum of $2 million. But guess what? We \nonly have 700,000 people in my whole State. But you know why they need \nso much money in Delaware? The reason is, we are in the fourth most \nexpensive media market in the country. And as everybody knows, just to \nget to the point where 60 percent of the people in your State know \nenough about you to make a judgment whether they should vote for you or \nnot, costs a lot of money. Just to get to know you--nothing else, not \neven to get to the point where they have any idea what your views are. \nJust to get to the point you are known. You know what it costs, I say \nto my friends who are from States much bigger than mine but in places \nwhere it is a lot cheaper to buy television? You know what it costs to \nair one 30-second ad at a good time on Philadelphia television on one \nof the network stations? It is $30,000 for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You do not have a TV station.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not have a TV station. I believe we are the only \nState in the Nation that does not have its own commercial television \nstation. That is not because we are good, bad, or indifferent. It is \nbecause it would make no economic sense. I live within 22 miles of the \nantennae of every one of the major stations--every one of the major \nnetworks in America. They are located in Philadelphia. I live in \nDelaware.\n  And so what happens when I buy an ad or my opponent buys an ad on \ntelevision? For every 100 people who see the ad, 96 of them live in New \nJersey, Maryland, or Pennsylvania and are unable to vote for or against \nme. But I have to pay for them all. Now I am not complaining because I \nhave an advantage. I am an incumbent. It is an advantage and a \ndisadvantage. The disadvantage is that you are an incumbent. People do \nnot like incumbents. The advantage is that people know your name.\n  If you are an unknown person running, like I was the first time, how \ndo you get to the point where even enough people know your name--unless \nyou have a lot of money? And, my goodness, what it must be in the State \nof Michigan or Pennsylvania or South Carolina. Nevada is a little \nbigger now, but when I got here we were bigger than Nevada. Those \nStates are bigger in population than Delaware.\n  I can speak knowledgeably only about one of our colleagues who did \nnot run the last time. I will not mention his name. I know why he did \nnot run. He would have won, and most people say he would have won. The \nState he happened to represent required him to raise at least, he \nthought, $12 million. He did not want to do that anymore--did not want \nto do that.\n  Look, the way we can raise the money is we can raise it at $1,000 a \nshot. That is the most we can raise from an individual. How many phone \ncalls--from non-Federal property--do you make to be able to raise, in \n$1,000 increments, $12 million? That is a lot of money.\n  But guess what that does now? It means that you have to go from a \ncircle of people who you know--and you know you do not have to worry \nabout their backgrounds, their circumstances, where they came from, \nwhat their objectives were--to the universe. And, I want to tell you \nthere is not a single U.S. Senator, myself included, who, I believe, \ncould vouch for the character or motive or motivation of all the people \nwho contributed to them unless they have the FBI working for them. We \nwould have to spend more money than we raise to do background checks.\n\n  You know what I always think of, I say to my friend from South \nCarolina? I think of the guy who was probably more chaste than Caesar's \nwife, Jimmy Carter. I will never forget when he was running for \nPresident. He showed up at a fundraiser, and there was a guy named John \nGacy--remember him, the mass murderer? Seriously, I am not joking. This \nliterally happened. Gacy walks in and he contributes to Carter. And he \nis standing between Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy Carter. Then, later, we \nfind out that the guy is a mass murderer. I say that not just because \nit is kind of humorous and we all laugh about it. But, I say that \nbecause there is no way, no matter how thorough you are as a candidate, \nthat you can know about all your contributors. And I would have thought \nby now that we would all be worried about how it reflects on our \nreputation if a contributor turns out to be somebody that should not \nhave contributed.\n  For example, recently there was a name of somebody who was an \nunsavory contributor, as it turned out, in the newspaper. It was a \nChinese man. One of my guys said, ``My God, we have a man by that name \nthat contributed to you,'' and I said, Oh, my God, find out who this \nguy is. It is a name that is a relatively common Chinese name, I found \nout later, like Smith or Jones. Guess what? It turns out the guy with \nthat name who contributed to me was a librarian with the Library of \nCongress. I will never forget sitting in my seat going, Oh, thank God, \nthank God. Because, really and truly, what would have happened if it \nturned out to be the guy everybody was writing about? If I were up for \nelection I would have to spend $100,000 in television ads to prove I \ndid not know the guy.\n  Now, maybe we are counting on the people being so cynical that they \nwill not hold anybody accountable for this. But I just think for pure \nself-preservation--not self-preservation of our jobs, self-preservation \nof our reputations and our integrity--that we would very much like the \nsystem to change.\n  I might add, you know how they kid around here. We joke when we have \ncolleagues who announce they are not running again and they have been \nhere for some time. We always joke and say things like, Well, now you \nwill be able to tell them what you think. There was a guy that my \nfriend from South Carolina knows well, and I will never forget him. \nRemember Steve Young--Senator Young from Ohio? Senator Young had been \nout of office about 2 or 4 years, but he was a guy I think who was \nwidowed at that time, a man in his eighties, if I am not mistaken. And, \nhe hung around here. He did not lobby anybody but he hung around, in \nthe gym, in the dining room.\n  You may remember this story, Senator Hollings, and I apologize for \nbeing so personal. But, the reason I am telling these stories is I want \nto communicate to the American people who are listening in real \npersonal terms how this system works. I will never forget the effort of \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina who took me under his \nwing when my first wife was killed in an automobile accident. When I \ngot remarried and wanted to introduce my new wife, Jill, to the people, \nhe had a reception for me up in the famous caucus room and everyone \nfrom the Vice President, President, the Supreme Court, really laid it \nout to welcome my wife. And, I might add, as they say, a point of \npersonal privilege, I still appreciate that.\n  I will never forget there was a reception line and, Senator Hollings, \nyou introduced me to people. Later in the night the reception line was \nstill going on but you were having to entertain some of the people you \nbrought along. Old Steve Young came in the line, Senator Young was \nbeing nice, welcoming people who were coming in. This is a true story. \nAnd, a guy walked up to Senator Young--he was to my left--put out his \nhand, and said, ``Senator, I bet you don't know my name.'' I can't \nquote what Senator Young said exactly because I am on the Senate floor \nand it would be inappropriate, but Senator Young turned to me and said, \n``Joe, will you tell this horse's tail his name? He has forgotten it.''\n  All of us would like to say that once in a while. So we joke and we \nsay when someone leaves this place, Well, guess you will be able to \ntell them what you think now. The implication in that comment is that \nhow nice would it be if you were totally unfettered, even indirectly, \ntotally unfettered? I envy, and I mean this sincerely, the women and \nmen in here who have close to unlimited wealth, and I do not begrudge \nthat. I mean that sincerely. I would love nothing better than to be \nable to run for office and say I do not want anybody's money. I do not \nwant one single penny from anybody, thank you very much, because then I \nknow people would look at me and no one would be able to even think or \nimply that anything I did was because of anything anybody contributed \nto me.\n  I do not know why there is not a stronger instinct on this floor for \nthat\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nnotion of not having to be beholden to any contributors--and more \nsupport for public funding. We may never get to the point where we even \nget television time made available to challengers. We may never get to \nthe point, and I am a distinct minority, where we have public \nfinancing, so the taxpayers are deciding whether they in fact, support \na candidate. But, at least we could get to the point, if we have the \nSenator's amendment, where we could limit the amount of money in the \nprocess for everybody across the board, for everybody. Boy oh boy, do \nyou not think it would be nice not to have to go out and do all those \nfundraisers?\n\n  Let me say what our friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, says. The \ndanger in having this kind of discussion is that we imply that the 99 \npercent of the honorable people who contribute to us are somehow \nmotivated by a bad reason. The vast majority of people who contribute \nto both political parties are people who contribute because it is their \nway of participating in the system and they want to promote the person \nwhose ideas they agree with. That sounds naive to say after all these \nyears, but it is true. I understand why the public does not believe any \nof it. I understand why the public does not believe any of that.\n  I will conclude, Mr. President, because I see there are others here \nwho wish to speak. I will never forget thinking as a young man when I \narrived here that the best thing to do, and I still think it is, is to \nbring everything out in the cold light of day. That is why I have spent \ntime explaining how the system works. I am often reminded of that \nphrase, that saying, that comment attributed to Bismarck in Germany. \nBismarck allegedly said there are two things you should never watch \nbeing made. One is sausage and the other is legislation. I would amend \nthat slightly. Once the American people got a chance to see exactly how \nthis worked, with all the disclosures which I think are necessary and \ngood in the long run, I think the thing that suffered was our \ncollective integrity--our collective integrity.\n  To the average person like my dad, anybody who was able to contribute \n$1,000 to a public official for a campaign must be doing it for a \nreason, and maybe is not so altruistic.\n  So, what does it say now that they pick up the paper and realize that \nindividuals and corporations and unions and anybody else can contribute \n$20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000, $1 million? Why do we expect them \nto say, ``Well, it must be nobly motivated, it is not for selfish \nreasons.'' In many cases it probably is totally nobly motivated.\n  Mr. President, I think that the single most important thing that has \nto be done from a purely practical sense is to amend the Constitution \nand give us the right to limit the amount of money that candidates are \nable to spend. I lay you 8 to 5 that if you ask every Senator to stand \nup and say whether or not they thought too much money was being spent \nin public elections, 90 out of 100 would say yes. I bet that if you \nasked them, do you think we should limit the amount of money that is \nspent, at least 70 would say yes. But if you asked them, ``Will you or \nyour party lose political advantage if you do that?'' they may change \ntheir views. The truth is that it is not just the Republicans who don't \nwant this reform; it is some Democrats, too. And, the truth of the \nmatter is, if we do what you and I, Senator Hollings, talked about a \nlong time ago--essentially make it available for everybody to have the \nsame amount of money, either by establishing a limit so that everybody \nwould be able to be equal, or by providing public funding--every one of \nus would have a race every time. None of us like having those races.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I know others want to be recognized, and I am hopeful \nto hear from them. As usual, you are unfettered, and you don't wait \nuntil you get out of office to do that. You have been masterful, \nbecause in this exchange we have had, talking about charades, there is \nno charade in your presentation here this afternoon; it is right on \ntarget. I thank the Senator for yielding and for his talk today.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I must tell you that there is a piece \nof me that says keep the system the way it is, because it is awful hard \nto beat me the way the system is. There is a Senator we used to know \nwho was very powerful here. I would say, ``Senator, how in the Lord's \nname did you get that person to contribute to me?'' He said he told \nthem, ``It's not so much what Biden can do for you; it's what Biden can \ndo to you.''\n  The truth of the matter is, if you are here and you have gained \nseniority and you are in a good position--better in the majority than \nthe minority--it is a lot easier for you to stay if you are challenged. \nSo I have to admit to you that I know if I ever prevail in making sure \neverybody running has the same amount of money, or by practically \nmaking it low enough so everybody could raise the same amount of \nmoney--I might say, ``Oh, my God, what have I done?'' But it is the \nright thing to do. I don't have a lot of hope that we can do it.\n  I thought when I got here in the midst of Watergate that maybe that \nepisode would shock us into doing something serious--and we did it, \nuntil the Supreme Court overruled it. I hope we take advantage of the \ncurrent situation and have the courage to act at a time when the \nspotlight is going to be on not only potentially illegal, but clearly \nunseemly, aspects of how these funds are raised.\n  I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that I am any better \nor worse than anybody else in this body. I am merely suggesting that we \nshould change, for our own safety's sake and for our reputations, the \nway we do it now. I don't know how to really do it unless you first \nhave the authority under the Constitution to be able to do it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate \nthe opportunity to speak on this issue because I think it is so \nimportant. When we are talking about amending the Constitution, and \nespecially the first amendment to the Constitution, which is, in \neffect, what this would do, I suggest that we think very carefully \nabout the ramifications.\n  So what are we doing here? We are actually considering an amendment \nthat would open the door for restriction on first amendment political \nspeech and freedom of association of many kinds. It seems to me, if we \nare rating the amendments, the free speech amendment is one of if not \nthe most revered in our country. If we are going to dissect the freedom \nof speech that we have known for over 200 years in our country and \neffectively establish various levels of free speech, I think we must \nexamine the impact this would have. By allowing restrictions on \npolitical speech, as this amendment would do, but not other forms of \nspeech, we are opening the door to rendering political speech secondary \nto commercial advertising or even pornography. What could we be \nthinking? Of all of the rights we have, the ability to have freedom of \npolitical expression is perhaps the greatest, and must be preserved at \nleast as vigorously as other rights.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, I would suggest that this amendment \nmight also be called the Incumbency Protection Act of 1997. If we \nunduly restrict the ability of people to spend money to support the \ncandidate of their choice and to likewise have the ability to raise \nadequate funds to run against incumbents in political office, as this \namendment would allow, what we are doing is saying that, forever more, \nincumbents will have an advantage that challengers will not have. In \nfact, the reason we have the ability to have relatively free access to \ncampaign funds or free access to the news media by challengers is so \nour democracy will work. Our democracy will only work if everyone gets \na fair chance to do his or her very best to run against an incumbent or \nanyone else for political office. The idea that we would allow for \nalmost limitless restrictions on that fundamental right is unthinkable.\n\n  Mr. President, many of us believe that campaign reform is essential, \nthat we would look at our system and that we would make sure that there \nis accountability, openness, and transparency--that whoever contributes \nto campaigns would be known to the voting public. We need to make sure \nthat\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\nis the case. But to say that we would open the door to allowing \nrestrictions on free access to the media or that we would require the \nmedia to, in effect, give access to anyone who might decide that they \nare going to pay a filing fee is really an inhibition not only of free \nspeech but of the right of free press, which is also a crucial element \nof our first amendment. This resolution raises this as a real \npossibility and encroaches unacceptably on our hallowed Bill of \nRights--that document that has made our democracy work and has kept our \nGovernment in the hands of the people. Our democracy will simply not be \nas strong if we do not preserve the freedom to be able to go out into \nthe news media, or the sidewalk, or anyplace else and proclaim why we \nare running and what cause we care about for public office.\n  So I applaud Senator McConnell for standing up for the first \namendment, for making sure that we do not do something that would amend \nour Constitution without careful consideration.\n  I know that many in this body are frustrated. They are frustrated \nwith our campaign system. I am sure that Senator Hollings is frustrated \nand is clearly trying to fix a system that has problems. I would just \nsay to my colleague from South Carolina that I think we need to address \ncampaign reform, but this is not the vehicle. Amending the Constitution \nto provide for the ability for any State legislature or any Congress in \nthe future to limit access to the airwaves or freedom of speech or \nassociation or of any organization to lawfully contribute to a campaign \nis simply not the way to go.\n  Let us in Congress come together on real campaign finance reform so \nthat the people of America will be informed voters. But whatever we do, \nwe should never relegate political speech to second-class status. \nRather, we must work to ensure that the basic right to speak one's mind \nin the political marketplace of ideas remains the most protected of all \nof our rights.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nTexas for a very important contribution to this important debate. We \nhave finally gotten on to the real subject. The real subject is the \nfirst amendment, free speech, and protecting political discourse in \nthis country. I just wanted to congratulate the Senator from Texas for \nher contributions today.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntoday, and I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky managing this \namendment in opposition because we are exercising that free political \nspeech that we enjoy. I think the ability for us to disagree while not \nbeing disagreeable is very important in the process.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for leading the opposition.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by my \nfriend Senator Hollings. I respect his leadership on campaign finance \nreform, but it is a mistake to write it into the Constitution.\n  The current system of financing elections clearly needs reform. \nSomething must be done to curtail excessive spending on the campaign \ntrail. The billions of dollars spent by candidates and the massive \nexploitation of loopholes in current law have led to a growing cynicism \nand distrust of our system of government. We must act on reform, but \namending the Constitution is the wrong way to do it.\n  In the entire history of the Constitution, we have never amended the \nBill of Rights, and now is no time to start. It would be wrong to carve \nan exception in the first amendment. Campaign finance reform is a \nserious problem, but it does not require that we twist the meaning of \nthe Constitution.\n  Campaign finance reform is clearly possible without a constitutional \namendment. The Buckley decision does not make it impossible for \nCongress to pass legislation achieving far-reaching reform. In fact, a \nlarge number of experts believe that the Supreme Court's 1976 decision \nin Buckley versus Valeo went too far, and that the Court is likely to \nreconsider it in an appropriate case. Over 50 prominent lawyers have \nsaid that the Buckley decision is ``a mistake, unsupported by precedent \nand contrary to the best understanding of prior first amendment \njurisprudence.''\n  These lawyers and other constitutional scholars believe that Congress \nshould pass campaign finance reform legislation and give the Supreme \nCourt the opportunity to revise the Buckley decision.\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation provides us with that opportunity. As \nPresident Clinton commented during his State of the Union Address, \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold have reached across party lines to \ndevelop a solution to uncontrolled campaign spending. Contrary to what \nMajority Leader Lott believes, this legislation is not, ``food stamps \nfor politicians.'' It is a serious bipartisan effort to solve this \nproblem, and the Senate should make it a priority.\n  The constitutional amendment before us today--unlike statutory \nreform--will not make a difference. It merely empowers Congress to pass \nlegislation that would place mandatory limits on campaign spending in \nFederal elections. After the long ratification process, Congress would \nstill have to actually pass legislation setting those limits. Though \nwell-intended, this constitutional amendment is simply a distraction. \nWe should get on with the business of enacting reform, without waiting \nfor ratification of a constitutional amendment, and certainly without \ntampering with the Bill of Rights.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 18 at 11:30 a.m. on \nTuesday, March 18, and that there be 1 hour remaining for closing \nremarks to be equally divided between myself and Senator Hollings; that \nthe Senate then resume consideration of the resolution at 2:15 p.m. on \nTuesday for 30 minutes equally divided; and, finally, following that \ntime on Tuesday, the joint resolution be read for the third time and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of S.J. Res. 18 with no \nintervening action or debate with paragraph 4 of rule XII being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as a reminder to all Senators, this \nconsent agreement allows for a rollcall vote on the measure currently \nbefore us at approximately 2:45 on Tuesday, March 18.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am a sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution \n18. I am proud to be a sponsor of that resolution.\n  What we have to understand is that the present system must change. It \nis hard for me to comprehend that since I was first elected to Congress \nmore than 14 years ago the system is still the same as it was. It has \nnot gotten better. It has gotten worse. Ten years ago when I was \nelected to the Senate, I came to this floor, and one of the first \nspeeches I gave was about the need for campaign finance reform. It is \nhard for me to really believe that here it is 10 years later and it has \nnot gotten better. It has gotten worse. I thought it might stay the \nsame. In my most pessimistic thoughts I thought there was a possibility \nthat the system would remain the same. It has gotten worse.\n  What our friend from Delaware just talked about in this very \nremarkable good speech is what other abuses take place. Independent \nexpenditures--we didn't have independent expenditures when I was first \nelected to Congress. What is an independent expenditure? That is a good \nquestion. No one really knows. But they are legal. They are legal. They \nare not illegal. If a group gets together, they don't have to identify \nthemselves. They can make up a name. Senator Bryan, for example, was \nGovernor of the State Nevada, and he ran for the Senate. A group of \nindividuals got together and they represented the automobile industry. \nThey ran a bunch of ads, hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of \nads, tens of thousands. I don't know how much money. There is no way to \nknow. They do not have to list how much they spent against Senator \nBryan, using Social Security as their issue. It had nothing to do with \ntheir field of interest. But it was a way to embarrass my friend, the \nGovernor of the State of Nevada, who was running for the Senate. That \nis an independent expenditure.\n  In my race the last time I ran for the Senate, a wealthy person from \nLas\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nVegas ran ads against me dealing with something about the military on \nsubmarines and aircraft carriers because I didn't visit with one of his \ngrandchildren when they came to Washington. I was busy. I don't know \nwhat it was. I didn't visit with his grandchild when they came to \nWashington to visit me. He is a rich man who spent money trying to \ndefeat me. He doesn't have to list where the money comes from. That is \nan independent expenditure.\n  Early this century Congress outlawed corporate money in Federal \nelections. They are not illegal anymore. The Supreme Court ruled last \nyear that you can give unlimited amounts to State parties, and they can \nspend the money any way they want. That is what happened this election. \nThat is what all this campaign mess is about--State parties spending \nall of their money.\n  So things have gotten worse; they have not gotten better since I have \nbeen in the Congress. It is really too bad that the system has reached \na point where it is.\n  I have heard a lot of speeches here today about our Founding Fathers \nand about the first amendment. Well, the Founding Fathers who drew up \nthis little instrument, the Constitution of the United States, would \nturn over in their graves if they saw how money was being used in \ncampaigns. The first amendment wasn't meant to allow unlimited spending \nof money in campaigns. Should we wind up in this Congress with 535--it \ncan't just be a millionaire--multimillionaires? The answer is no, that \nisn't the way it should be.\n\n  When I first was elected to the House of Representatives, we had a \nplumber, a tradesman, who represented a congressional district from \nMissouri. He ran and he won. He could not win working on those wages \nanymore; he couldn't win.\n  We cannot let what has now become the status quo--which is worse than \nthe status quo of the election before--continue. Under the current \ncampaign finance laws, Government is restricted from regulating \ncampaign spending. This is a result, as we have heard here several \ntimes, of a U.S. Supreme Court in a 5 to 4 decision equating spending \nmoney in a campaign to free speech.\n  There are all of these speeches here about first amendment rights. If \nthe resolution of the Senator from South Carolina passes, there is \nnothing that will violate the first amendment. Every day that we come \non this floor to pass legislation we have to be aware of the first \namendment. We are not going to do anything to denigrate the first \namendment rights. The Supreme Court struck down the expenditure limits \nimposed by the Federal Campaign Practices Act of 1974 as an \nunconstitutional restriction on free speech. The intent of that \nlegislation which restricted campaign spending was to equalize the \nability to run for office between persons of differing wealth. The \nSupreme Court, through their decision, made the playing field not \nlevel.\n  What happens in a relatively small State like Nevada is, if someone \nwants to come in and spend, it will cost now $4 million to run in the \nState of Nevada, or more. What if somebody wants to come in and spend \n$10 million, a third as much as was spent in the California race an \nelection ago where a man came in and spent $30 million of his own \nmoney--$30 million. He could save $20 million if he decided to move to \nNevada.\n  I have to say, as popular as the present Governor is in the State of \nNevada, as popular as my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada is, $10 \nmillion would test their ability. The airwaves would be drowned with TV \nmessages, radio, and, of course, newspapers throughout the State. Is \nthat fair? I really do not think it is. I think that we need to be able \nto stop that. The playing field is not level.\n  Most Americans believe that the current system is flawed. Their \ncentral concern is special interest influence. It is ironic that the \nCourt equated free speech with money. Their decision has the opposite \neffect. It actually ensures that those with money can talk and those \nwithout money cannot talk.\n  I want to also spread across the record of this Senate my \nappreciation for the courage of the Senator from South Carolina for \ncontinuing on this issue. We are only here today as a result of the \npersistence of the Senator from South Carolina. We are here by virtue \nof a unanimous consent agreement that was entered into sometime ago \nsaying we are going to debate this issue or I am not going to let \nsomething else move forward on the Senate floor. That is what the \nSenator from South Carolina did. And it took someone with experience, \nprestige, and abilities to get us to the point where we can at least \ntalk about it.\n  I also say to my friend from South Carolina, I think we know we are \nnot going to get 67 votes. I am disappointed. And maybe a miracle will \nhappen. But that does not mean we are not right. That does not mean \nwhat the Senator from South Carolina is leading is not right. And we \nare going to win some day. It is only a question of when. I say thank \nyou from the people of the State of Nevada to the Senator from South \nCarolina for allowing us to have the opportunity to talk about this.\n  Campaign finance is a sore that is festering in the body politic of \nAmerica, and we have to do something to change it. We may not change it \nwith this resolution passing, but we are going to change it because we \nare going to keep talking about it, because what is going on now is \nwrong. It is wrong you have independent expenditures, somebody spending \nmoney against people because they refused to see their grandchild. And \nin the middle of the night they go to the TV station and run these ads \nbecause they are wealthy. Is that the way to conduct business in this \ncountry? I say no.\n  I say people can stand up and say, well, it is free speech; they can \ndo what they want. But they can play by the rules everybody else plays \nby. If somebody wants to contribute to my campaign under the Federal \nlaw that I thought existed when I came here--you have to list how much \nthey give and they cannot give more than $1,000 an election, their \noccupation, where they live--why shouldn't they have to do the same. \nYou do not know who these groups are that come in the middle of the \nnight. I did not learn until after the election someone was mad at me \nbecause I did not see their grandchild.\n  I repeat, the Supreme Court equated free speech with money. Their \ndecision has the opposite effect. It actually ensures that those with \nmoney can talk and those without money cannot talk.\n  Over the last decade we have seen an unsettling trend in American \npolitics. Most of our candidates for Federal office have money. There \nare some estimates which say $1.6 billion was spent on campaigns this \npast year. And campaigns have become more expensive with each election. \nYou can call it free speech; call it whatever you want. That is wrong. \nYou cannot make something wrong right by saying it is wrong enough \ntimes. It is wrong to have the ability to be elected depend on how much \nmoney you have.\n  Thomas Jefferson was a bad speaker. He could not be elected today. As \nmuch of a genius as Thomas Jefferson was, he could not be elected today \nunless we change these rules.\n  The skyrocketing costs are prohibitive and serve as a deterrent for \naverage Americans who want to participate in the political process. As \nlong as costs continue to rise, so will the need for more money. \nLimiting spending is the only way of keeping the cost of campaigns \ndown.\n  I wish we had a way of shortening the election cycle. The \nPresidential election just finished and people are already beginning to \nrun for President.\n  Over the past 10 years, Congress has tried to get around the Buckley \ndecision with at least 100 different proposals. There are numerous \nproposals now pending. But we are never going to slow the amount of \nmoney associated with campaigns until we address the Buckley decision \nhead on. That is what the Senator of South Carolina has done.\n  Congress must undo the Buckley decision and reinstate campaign \nspending limits. This legislation amends the Constitution to authorize \nCongress to cap campaign expenditures in Federal elections. I do not \ntake lightly amending the Constitution or our precious freedom of \nspeech, but it is the only way to undo the Buckley decision.\n  No one is in favor of free speech more than I am, and I think I have \nthe record to indicate that. I represented newspapers before I came \nhere. Some of my clients went to court on first amendment cases. But \nequating free speech with campaign spending simply\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\ncreates a constitutional protection for wealthy candidates to buy \nFederal elections.\n  An alternative to this amendment is to continue to spin our wheels, \nworking on hundreds of different initiatives designed to provide public \nfinancing, financial inducements in exchange for voluntary spending \nlimits or one of the other failed proposals we have debated over the \nyears.\n\n  I have been in the Senate 10 years, so I do not want to go back \nfurther than that, but let me read to my friend, the prime sponsor of \nthis resolution this year and the years gone by: During the years I \nhave been in the Senate, we have had 6,742 pages of hearings. We have \nhad 3,361 speeches, 62 now with this one, 1,063 pages of committee \nhearings, 113 Senate votes on campaign finance reform, and we even had \none bipartisan Federal commission which went nowhere. The vast majority \nof those votes, I would say 90 of the 113 votes were for cloture--stop \ndebate so we could get to vote on one of the issues.\n  Now, I am a cosponsor of McCain-Feingold, an imperfect piece of \nlegislation, but I say I do not know how we could make things worse \nthan what they now are. I support McCain-Feingold; I hope it passes, \nbut I think the chances of passing are pretty remote. I have to tell \nyou that. I hope it passes. I am a sponsor of it. But until we do what \nthe Senator from South Carolina suggests we do--and I am cosponsoring \nthe amendment, an original cosponsor--I think we are just going to add \nto this. We are going to have probably by the time this year is over \n7,500 pages of hearings, maybe 500 floor speeches, maybe 1,300 pages of \ncommittee reports, and probably 125 votes rather than 113, and \naccomplish nothing.\n  So I think we have to stop talking about limiting spending and look \nfor a way to hit Buckley head on. We cannot enact powerful campaign \nspending limitations as long as this is the law.\n  Overall funding for the Democratic and Republican Parties totaled \nalmost $1 billion last year, a 73 percent increase over the same period \nduring the 1992 cycle. We can get up and say all we want that this is \njust part of free speech. I do not buy that. I do not think we can be \nwhipsawed into cowering because the free speech argument is raised. I \nam not going to be. I am going to talk about this issue every chance I \nget.\n  I would like to be able to spend more of my time debating issues \ndealing with education, dealing with the trade deficit, dealing with \njuvenile crime, adult crime; I have some environmental things I would \nlike to come here and talk about. That is one of my prime \nresponsibilities on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I would \nlike to come here and talk about that. I would like to spend some time \ntalking about the ISTEA bill. But, frankly, a lot of us have to spend a \nlot of time making phone calls to raise money.\n  It is too bad, isn't it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, siree.\n  Mr. REID. The public believes that escalating cost of elections puts \na price tag on our democracy. So why is there this call for campaign \nfinance reform? Let us go over the issues.\n  No. 1, record-breaking spending. As I said, we hear all kinds of \nestimates, but just the parties spent over $1 billion; in overall \nspending, $1.6 billion at least.\n  No. 2, Americans feel shut out. Americans, more than ever, believe \nthat the emphasis on money in elections excludes them from meaningful \nparticipation. They believe that special interests who contribute large \nsums of money have more influence on elected officials and that \ncandidates are forced to spend too much time raising funds and too \nlittle time listening to voters' concerns.\n  No. 3, campaigns are too expensive. Campaigns have become more \nexpensive with each election. The skyrocketing costs are prohibitive \nand serve as a deterrent to the average American who wants to \nparticipate in the political process. As long as the costs continue to \nrise, so will the need for more money. Limiting spending is the only \nway of keeping these costs down.\n  My friend, the Senator from Delaware, talked about these pages. We \nhave serving in the U.S. Senate today a fine senior Senator from the \nState of Connecticut who was a page. I am sure, years ago, he sat where \nyou young people are sitting and heard speeches delivered by various \nSenators. I am almost embarrassed to stand here and talk to you four \nyoung people about this issue. It is embarrassing to me, to admit the \nsystem is failing. I don't like to talk about the system failing. I \nstarted last summer coming on this floor talking about how good \nGovernment was, that we should be proud of Government. And I do believe \nthat. There are many things we should be proud of: Our National Park \nSystem, how well FEMA reacts to crisis, our Consumer Safety Products \nCommission--many, many things we should be very proud and happy over. \nBut this is one thing I am not proud of. I am embarrassed to come here \nand admit a Government failure, and that is what this is. I hope you \nyoung people are not so turned off by the speeches that are relating to \nthis proposed constitutional amendment that you turn against \nGovernment, because you should not.\n  No. 4, comprehensive reform is the only lasting solution, and \ncomprehensive reform can only come about as a result of our amending \nthe Constitution to allow us to get around the 5-4 decision made by the \nSupreme Court.\n  We need bipartisan action. I say to my friend, the junior Senator \nfrom South Carolina, that we have a sponsor on this resolution, Mr. \nSpecter, who is second in line. The second sponsor of this amendment is \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \n[Mr. Specter]. I commend and applaud his courage for stepping out on \nthis issue. We need more bipartisanship. This is a bipartisan \nresolution. I wish we had a few more from the other side of the aisle, \nbut this is bipartisan and I, again, want to congratulate my friend \nfrom the State of Pennsylvania for having the guts to step forward and \nsay he also believes that this resolution should pass.\n  No one can say anything about his ability to analyze the law. I have \nheard him give hours of speeches here, with detailed legal analysis. I \nam sure he has spent time, recognizing we are not violating any free \nspeech. If there is no other reason that we should feel good about \nthis, it would be because we have bipartisan support from a Senator who \nhas joined us who has great qualifications as a legal scholar. So we \nneed bipartisan action and I think we need to move forward now and pass \nthis resolution.\n\n  I hope that I am wrong. I hope that over the weekend--we are going to \nvote on this early next week--I hope that people get the idea that this \nis the only way to go and that we are surprised and get 67 votes, \nenough to pass this constitutional amendment. I hope so.\n  The time to act is now. Over the next 2 years, Congress will deal \nwith changes in regulations and programs that affect virtually every \nAmerican, from clean air and water to education programs for our \nchildren and Medicare and Medicaid for our Nation's elderly. In order \nto address these concerns, Congress must first act to reform itself. \nThat is what we are talking about. We talk about reforming everybody \nelse, why don't we reform ourselves? Why don't we reform ourselves? \nBecause the present system is pretty comfortable. We, who have access, \nhave the ability to raise money and, unless you are independently \nwealthy, access is really, really important. Why don't we do something \nthat would level the playing field, like we tried to do in 1974?\n  So I close with the plea that we can reform the way we handle \ncampaigns in this country. The only way we can reform the way we handle \ncampaigns in this country is if we follow the admonition and the \ncourageous activities of the junior Senator from South Carolina, Ernest \nF. Hollings, who has worked so hard and so long on this issue. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Would the distinguished Senator yield? I know others \nwant to be recognized, so before you yield the floor, let me take this \nopportunity to thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada. He has \nreally given a very, very cogent analysis of the dilemma that we face, \nthe real-life experience, now, that we have all engaged in, and what we \nare trying, in the best of our ability, to reform, and reform \nourselves, as you so sincerely pointed out.\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n  So I cannot thank you enough for your presentation and joining with \nus. I have been delighted to work, over the many years that we have \nbeen here, together. This is one more time. I, again, admire the \nSenator from Nevada. He has sincerity and bipartisanship. I have seen \nhim work with the other side of the aisle so often. So he is looking at \ngetting something done and making headway rather than headlines. It is \nwith that knowledge, listening again this afternoon to your sincerity \nof purpose, that I truly thank you for your support and your \ncosponsorship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 438 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of the pending business, the constitutional amendment which \nwill authorize the Congress or State legislatures to control campaign \nfinance spending. I believe it is a matter of great urgency that the \nCongress of the United States deal with the subject of campaign finance \nreform.\n  Day after day we have seen disclosures about very serious violations \nof existing Federal law and disclosures of very substantial \nimproprieties which call for additional Federal legislation. \nRegrettably, the opportunities for Federal legislation are sharply \nrestricted by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States which \nhave limited Congress' ability to act on the stated grounds that such \naction would violate the first amendment relating to freedom of speech.\n  The case of Buckley versus Valeo, decided on January 30, 1976, \nequated speech with money in a very curious manner. It said that an \nindividual could spend as much of his or her money as he or she chose, \nbut upheld congressional limitations on what others could spend in \nsupport of a person's candidacy.\n  The Court also left an exception on what is called the independent \nexpenditure. That decision was a very forceful one for me personally, \nbecause at that time I was a candidate for the Republican nomination \nfor U.S. Senate. I was running against John Heinz, who later became a \ncolleague of mine in the U.S. Senate and a very, very close personal \nfriend. At that time, we were friends, too, but we were political \nopponents.\n  Senator Heinz at that time was a Congressman. I had been district \nattorney of Philadelphia, and we entered that race in April looking \nforward to the primary. The Federal election provided that someone \nrunning in a primary in Pennsylvania would be limited to spending \n$35,000, computed on a per capita basis for the size of the State. That \nwas about as much money as I had, having been in the practice of law \nfor a short time after having been district attorney of Philadelphia. \nSo it was an even playing field.\n  On January 30, the Supreme Court of the United States said that an \nindividual could spend as much of his money as he chose, and John Heinz \nchose to spend millions. I was limited to my own bank account which was \n$35,000. As a matter of fact, I spent that.\n  At that time, I had a brother who could have financed my campaign, \nalthough not on the size perhaps of some others. But my brother, Mort \nSpecter, was limited by law to contributing $1,000 to my campaign.\n  It struck me then, and strikes me now, as being curious. Mort \nSpecter's speech was limited to $1,000 in support of his brother, but \nJohn Heinz' speech was unlimited. There have been cases of others \nhaving come to this body after having spent into the millions of \ndollars and overwhelming their opponents. Last year, we saw a \nPresidential election where Steve Forbes came into the field and \ndeclined to be bound by Federal spending limits and spent in excess of \n$30 million, as the reports have demonstrated.\n  I believe that there ought to be authority in the Congress to \nregulate campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court in Buckley and a \nnumber of my colleagues here in the Senate have stated that limiting \ncampaign spending would violate first amendment protection of freedom \nof speech. I take second place to no one in defense of the first \namendment and the freedom of speech clause, as well as freedom of \nreligion, freedom of right to assembly, freedom of right to petition \nthe Government. But I believe, as someone who studied the Constitution \nin depth for some years, that the Buckley decision was wrong as a \nmatter of legal interpretation.\n  There are many who agree with that. In fact, on November 10, 1996 \nsome 26 scholars joined together to urge the Supreme Court to \nreconsider and reverse the decision in Buckley versus Valeo. Among them \nare some of the most prominent constitutional scholars in the United \nStates, including Pro. Bruce Ackerman of the Yale Law School, Pro. \nRonald Dworkin of the New York University Law School, Pro. Peter \nArenella of the University of California Law School, Pro. Robert \nAronson of the University of Washington Law School, and many, many \nothers.\n  Following the statement of the professors, the attorneys general of \n24 States called for the reversal of the Buckley decision in January \n1997.\n  The simple fact is that the Buckley decision makes no sense as a \nmatter of law. Why should an individual be able to spend an unlimited \namounted of money when an individual's brother is limited to $1,000 in \nspeech? If freedom of speech applies to a candidate, why does not the \nsame freedom of speech apply to a candidate's brother?\n  Freedom of speech has traditionally been limited by Supreme Court \ndecisions. It is not an unlimited, absolute right. You have the famous \ndecision by Oliver Wendell Holmes on clear and present danger. If there \nis a clear and present danger, speech may be limited.\n  The most famous example of limiting free speech is the rule that you \ncannot cry ``fire'' in a crowded theater. If you cry ``fire'' in a \ncrowded theater that endangers other people who would be injured in the \nstampede for the exits.\n  Likewise, you are not free to use a racial or religious slur against \nsomebody. There is a famous Supreme Court opinion on this issue by \nJustice Murphy. An individual had uttered a racial slur and the target \nof the slur punched the speaker in the nose. The speaker then sued the \nindividual who hit him for assault and battery. Justice Murphy ruled \nthat the person who had uttered the slur and was punched could not sue. \nHe held that racial slurs were fighting words, and you cannot utter \nfighting words even within the context of freedom of speech.\n  We know from very complex decisions by the Supreme Court that there \nis a limit as to what you can say in the way of obscenity. If material \nappeals to the prurient interest, if it is contrary to accepted moral \nstandards, it can be restricted.\n  In addition, this body has gotten involved in some very controversial \nissues in the effort to protect children's viewing on television. So \nthere are clearly limits to first amendment protection.\n  As I say, I take second place to no one in wishing to safeguard the \nfirst amendment. But I have heard a lot of talk in the U.S. Senate that \nthis amendment would be an invasion of cherished freedoms of speech. I \ndisagree. Money is not speech. Just on its face it is not speech. And \nto enable the wealthy to, in effect, buy elections is not sound public \npolicy. Congress ought to have the authority to make that change.\n  We have seen the most recent decision of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States on the subject in Colorado Republican Campaign Committee \nversus Federal Election Commission, a 1996 decision which defies logic, \ndefies reason, and defies reading to understand what this opinion \nmeans.\n  There is an opinion by Justice Kennedy concurring in the judgment and \ndissenting in part with Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Scalia \njoining.\n  There is an opinion by Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment and \ndissenting in part, in which Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia \njoined in part.\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\n  There is an opinion by Justice Stevens with a dissenting opinion, \nwith Justice Ginsburg joining.\n  There is another opinion by Justice Breyer joined by Justice O'Connor \nand Justice Souter.\n  All that to the viewing audience on C-SPAN sounds extraordinarily \ncomplicated, but you ``ain't heard nothing yet.'' It is a lot more \ncomplicated than that.\n\n  In order to have an opinion of the Supreme Court, you have to have \nfive Justices who state a judgment and then articulate an opinion so \nyou know what the ruling of the Court is. There is no opinion which \nfive Justices joined in. You have four Justices saying they have one \nconclusion, which leads them to the judgment that results, and other \nJustices saying they have different reasons leading to a judgment. In \nother words, you have a majority of the Justices agreeing on the \nconclusion but not agreeing on the reasons.\n  You hear the Supreme Court often criticize legislative intent, \ncriticize what the Congress of the United States does because it is not \nclear. Some Justices, Justice Scalia in particular, say they do not pay \nany attention to legislative intent because they cannot find it.\n  We spend a lot of time on the floor of this Senate seeking to clarify \nlegislative intent: stating what we are trying to accomplish and asking \nthe managers if they agree with that and expect that to be followed, \ntrying to give some guidance because we cannot anticipate every last \nconclusion and every last consequence when we have legislated. But our \nmuddled congressional activities and actions are clear as crystal \ncompared to what the Supreme Court does frequently as illustrated in \nthis Colorado case.\n  By the time you finish reading this case about what parties can do \nand about what soft money can do, there is absolutely no guidance. That \nguidance ought to be presented by the Congress of the United States. If \nwe had a constitutional amendment on campaign spending, all of the \nconfusion of the Buckley opinion and the Colorado opinion would be \neliminated.\n  You have an extraordinary situation where the President of the United \nStates is reported, in the book by his campaign director, Dick Morris, \nas sitting down and editing the campaign commercials paid for by \nmillions of dollars of soft money collected by the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n  Federal election law provides that soft money must be spent on \nindependent expenditures. But money is certainly not being spent \nindependently of President Clinton's campaign if President Clinton sits \nand edits the commercials. But that is precisely what President Clinton \ndid.\n  Some have argued that President Clinton did not violate the election \nlaw because the DNC spent soft money and the soft money was used for \nissue advocacy instead of express advocacy on behalf of a specific \ncandidate.\n  The general rule of what constitutes express advocacy for a specific \ncandidate is ``vote for Senator Bennett.'' That would be express \nadvocacy. Or ``vote against Senator Bennett.'' But if someone engages \nin issue advocacy and lists all the votes which Senator Bennett has \nmade which they claim are undesirable and mentions all of the good \nqualities of Senator Bennett's opponent, that is often considered issue \nadvocacy. That is often not controlled by the Federal election laws. \nLet's face it, the line between issue advocacy and express advocacy is \nimpossible to draw.\n  We are approaching the issue of campaign finance reform in the \nactivities of the Governmental Affairs Committee. This was the subject \nof heated discussion on this floor, though maybe not as heated as it \nwas in the Republican caucus. The distinguished Presiding Officer was \nthere. I might say, parenthetically, it is very troublesome to have our \ndeliberations among Republican Senators in the caucus reported to the \npress. I was called by the press. My standard answer is, ``I will tell \nyou what I said, but I won't tell you what anybody else said.'' Then \nthe reporter says, ``Well, do you mind confirming this?'' And they \nrepeat exactly what happened in the Republican caucus, which was \nlimited to Republican Senators. Very distressing. That really is a \nconfidential communication that ought to be respected.\n  But when we looked at that issue, we came to the conclusion that we \nhave to have a wider scope which includes not only illegal but improper \nactivities. That is because we want to correct what has gone on, and \nnot only with the use of these millions of dollars in soft money, but \nwhat has gone on in foreign expenditures. We have seen very substantial \nmoneys contributed illegally by foreigners. We know it is illegal \nbecause the Democratic National Committee has returned the money.\n\n  When I talk about the Democratic National Committee, I do not wish to \nbe unduly partisan. I favor an inquiry which would take in not only the \nDemocratic Presidential campaign, but the Republican Presidential \ncampaign, and not only the Presidential campaigns but congressional \ncampaigns, so that we would take a look across the board and not with a \nlimited scope.\n  But the foreign contributions as disclosed to the media have been \nreceived by the Democratic National Committee. And we know they are \nillegal because the Democratic National Committee has returned a great \nmany. We do not know if they returned them all. This is a matter that \nwe ought to look into.\n  Although contributions by foreigners, noncitizens, are illegal, maybe \nwe ought to extend our laws beyond the bounds which we have now. If we \nare to really be able to regulate campaign money, we are going to have \nto have the authority to do it without having the Supreme Court hand \ndown the Colorado case and without having loopholes virtually as broad \nas the planet.\n  These are issues of great importance. We have really seen our \ndemocracy, our Republic, on the line in terms of what has happened on \ncampaign irregularities. This is something that the Congress ought to \ntake up. The Congress cannot take it up realistically unless we have a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  I see my distinguished colleague, Senator Hollings, has come back to \nthe floor. I am happy to start again. I am not sure where he came in.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield, I came in at the very \nbeginning. I could not repeat it better than what the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada said when he congratulated the Senator from \nPennsylvania not just on the guts to be able to cosponsor this, because \nhe takes it from his side--there is no more erudite attorney and legal \nscholar within this body. I would not miss a word of it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am glad I know that Senator Hollings was here. \nOtherwise, he would not have made those flattering, complimentary \nstatements.\n  I know Senator Hollings has been here all day today and all day \nyesterday, because I came over to look for an opportunity to speak \nyesterday and the floor was taken, and earlier today I was looking for \na chance to speak, and I came out of hearings on the Agriculture \nSubcommittee where we have a major problem with dairy pricing in \nPennsylvania, which occupied me all afternoon.\n  As I was about to say, Senator Hollings has been the leader on this, \nand it has been the Hollings-Specter constitutional amendment for the \nbetter part of a decade. Senator Hollings asked me to join him in the \nnews conference Tuesday morning at 11:30 where we talked about this \namendment and campaign finance reform generally, and then questions \nfrom the media got into the issue of what the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee would be doing, more broadly than the constitutional \namendment. Some of that got on to the wires and stimulated some of the \ndiscussion we had later at the Republican caucus. It was synergistic \nand moved the issue right along.\n  It is very difficult to pass this amendment because it takes a two-\nthirds vote. There is no doubt about that. On May 27, 1993 the Senate \nadopted by a vote of 52-43 a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that this \namendment should be passed, and my sense is that one day this \nconstitutional amendment will pass. It will take a lot of effort. I am \nnot optimistic about its chances at the present time. I do not believe \nthere will be campaign finance reform until the Congress has to act.\n  We have in here a conflict of interest in passing campaign finance \nreform because it benefits incumbents. Some say that the absence of \ncampaign finance reform benefits the Republican Party. I disagree with \nthat. I believe the Republican Party would do just fine with\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\ncampaign finance reform. I think it would be tougher on incumbents, but \nwe are not going to get it until we do overturn Buckley versus Valeo.\n  The Supreme Court has often reversed itself when the Court was wrong, \nand there have been constitutional amendments when the Court was wrong. \nWe have an amendment process where two-thirds of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate, and three-fourths of the States, can \nchange the Constitution--because the U.S. Supreme Court is not the last \nword. They can be overturned.\n  There have been proposals to overturn Supreme Court decisions by a \ntwo-thirds vote of the Senate. I would hate to see that happen because \nwe muster two-thirds of the Senate sometimes on issues which may not \nreally reflect long-range interests of the United States. I think it is \nimportant to have a high barrier to have a constitutional amendment. I \nthink one day the public alarm, the public dismay, the repugnance of \nthe public will reach a level which will motivate the Congress to have \ncampaign finance reform and to have a constitutional amendment.\n  I think it is a solid constitutional principle that money ought not \nto be equated with speech, and we ought to overturn Buckley versus \nValeo and then Congress ought to have sensible legislation to ensure \nthat democracy is protected and our Republic is protected.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2239-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

We will have further debate on the issue?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Early Tuesday morning, just immediately after the party \ncaucuses.\n  Mr. LOTT. So all Members will understand there will be a vote on this \nissue, then, on Tuesday at 2:45.\n  We are about ready to propound a unanimous-consent request and/or \ntake other action if it is necessary. We have been communicating with \nthe Democratic leader about getting some agreements entered into that \ncould affect Monday and Tuesday and perhaps even Wednesday.\n  So that we can have a final opportunity to consult, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2273-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATIONS TO PROFS. ROBERT F. CURL AND RICHARD E. SMALLEY\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Profs. Robert \nF. Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in Houston for their \nwork in the field of molecular chemistry. Along with Prof. Harold Kroto \nof England, Professors Curl and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel \nPrize in chemistry for their discovery of the third molecular form of \ncarbon.\n  Professor Curl, a native Texan from Alice, and Professor Smalley are \ncodiscoverers of the carbon molecule called Buckminsterfullerene. It \nwas named after R. Buckminster Fuller, the architect famous for his \ngeodesic domes, because this new molecule closely resembles his \ndesigns. In fact, the term used to describe these molecules is \n``buckyballs.''\n  This breakthrough discovery by Professors Curl and Smalley promises \nto revolutionize the world we live in. This new carbon molecule will \nhave scientific and practical applications across a wide variety of \nfields, from electrical conduction to the delivery of medicine into the \nhuman body. These extremely stable molecules are impervious to \nradiation and chemical destruction, and can be joined to form carbon \nnanotubes which are 10,000 times smaller than a human hair, yet 100 \ntimes stronger than steel. Buckyballs will establish a whole new class \nof materials for the construction of many products, from airplane wings \nand automobile bodies to clothing and packaging material.\n  The work of Professors Curl and Smalley is just one example of the \nexcellent work being done at Rice University and at the many other fine \nresearch institutions in Texas. Rice University has long been a premier \nresearch center, and with the new Center for Nanoscale Science and \nTechnology, Rice is the first university in the United States to focus \non submicroscopic methods for fabricating new structures on the atomic \nand molecular scale. As Professor Smalley himself described it, ``This \nis the ultimate frontier in the game of building things.''\n  Given that nanoscale science and technology requires an \ninterdisciplinary approach, Rice University is the ideal setting for \nthis new center for nanoscale research. The collaborative scientific \napproach, which is common at Rice but less customary at larger research \ninstitutions, encourages the sort of scientific breakthroughs \nexemplified by the discovery of buckyballs. These discoveries are \nessential if we are to guarantee that America will remain the world \nleader in research. We must be sure we do all we can to support our \nNation's scientists, because our Nation's future depends upon the work \nof people like Professor Smalley and Professor Curl.\n  Once again, I congratulate Professor Robert Curl and Professor \nRichard Smalley, as well as Rice University, for earning the Nobel \nPrize in chemistry. Their contribution to the body of scientific \nknowledge has been invaluable and will touch the lives of millions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2273-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:59 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nappoints Ms. Jo Anne Barnhart of Virginia as a member from private life \non the part of the House to the Social Security Advisory Board to fill \nthe existing vacancy thereon.\n  The message also announced that the Speaker appoints the following \nMember on the part of the House to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council: \nMr. Yates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2273-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2273-S2274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1408.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the establishment of an intercity passenger rail trust fund, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     AMTRAK TRUST FUND LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \ncreate a dedicated source of capital funding for Amtrak. Joining me as \ncosponsors are Senators Moynihan, Lautenberg, Wyden, Jeffords, Biden, \nKerry, DeWine, Leahy, and Specter.\n  Mr. President, all major modes of transportation have a dedicated \nsource of capital funding, except for intercity passenger rail.\n  My legislation would correct this inequity and create a secure and \nreliable capital trust fund for Amtrak, no different than what other \nmajor modes of transportation now have.\n  My legislation would transfer one-half cent of the 4.3 cent per \ngallon motor fuels tax currently going to the general fund, to a new \nintercity passenger rail trust fund.\n  This rail trust fund would total approximately $3.9 billion dollars \nover 5 years to be used for capital improvement projects. After the \nfifth year, the revenues from the half cent would revert back to the \ngeneral fund. My bill would create contract authority to allow Amtrak \nto enter into contracts necessary for long-term capital projects. For \nStates that do not have Amtrak service, it would provide funding for \nqualified transportation expenses.\n  This capital funding proposal is critical to Amtrak's future.\n  Amtrak needs capital funding to bring it's equipment, facilities, and \ntracks into a state of good repair. Much of Amtrak's equipment and \ninfrastructure has exceeded its projected useful life. The costs of \nmaintaining this aging fleet and the need to modernize and overhaul \nfacilities through capital improvements to the system are serious \nfinancial challenges for Amtrak. My proposal would help reverse these \nproblems and give Amtrak the resources necessary to meet its capital \ninvestment needs.\n  Mr. President, Amtrak, and the National Commission on Intermodal \nTransportation have called for a secure source of capital funding for \nAmtrak. I believe that now is the time for this Congress to reverse our \ncurrent policy that favors building more highways at the expense of \nalternative means of transportation such as intercity passenger rail. \nDespite rail's proven safety, efficiency, and reliability in Europe, \nJapan, and elsewhere, inter-city passenger rail remains severely \nunderfunded in the United States. In fact, over half of the Department \nof Transportation's spending authority is devoted to highways and \nanother quarter to aviation; rail still ranks last with roughly 3 \npercent of total spending authority.\n  Last year we spent $20 billion for highways while capital investment \nfor Amtrak was less than $450 million.\n  In relative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, \ntransportation outlays for highways increased 73 percent, aviation \nincreased 170 percent, and transportation outlays for rail went down by \n62 percent. In terms of growth, between 1982 and 1992 highway spending \ngrew by 5 percent, aviation by 10 percent, while rail decreased by 9 \npercent.\n  A problem that is going to increase is the congestion on our roads. \nBetween 1983 and 1990, Vehicle Miles Traveled increased nationwide by \n41 percent. If current trends continue, delays due to congestion will \nincrease by more than 400 percent on our highways and by more than 1000 \npercent on urban roads. Highway congestion costs the United States $100 \nbillion annually, and this figure does not include the economic and \nsocietal costs of increased pollution and wasted energy resources.\n  Air travel is equally congested. Commercial airlines in the U.S. \npresently\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\ntransport over 450 million passengers each year. A recent \ntransportation safety board study revealed that 21 of the 26 major \nairports experienced serious delays and it is projected to get worse. \nAgain, the costs are enormous. A 1990 DOT study estimated the financial \ncost of air congestion at $5 billion each year, and it expects this \nnumber to reach $8 billion by 2000.\n  Congestion is a problem and it must be addressed. However, the \ncurrent path we are on directs more money for highways and airports. \nFor us in the Northeast, building more roads is simply not an option. \nWe do not have the land nor the financial resources to build more \nhighways or more airports. For these reasons, we must provide more than \njust good roads but a good passenger rail system as well.\n  Adequately funded passenger rail can successfully address highway \ngridlock and ease airport congestion. Passenger rail ridership between \nNew York and Washington is equal to 7,500 fully booked 757's or 10,000 \nDC-9's. Between New York and Washington, Amtrak has over 40 percent of \nthe air-rail market.\n  Improved Northeast rail service will also have the same positive \nimpact on road congestion--5.9 billion passenger miles were taken on \nAmtrak in 1994. These are trips that were not taken on crowded highways \nand airways. Improved rail service in the Northeast is projected to \neliminate over 300,000 auto trips each year from highways as well as \nreduce auto congestion around the airports.\n  Improved rail service will also have a positive affect on rural \nareas. Twenty-two of Amtrak's 55 million passengers depend on Amtrak \nfor travel between urban centers and rural locations which have no \nalternative modes of transportation.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to invest in our rail system.\n  Opponents of my legislation have said that we should not use revenues \nfrom our motor fuels tax to pay for Amtrak. I disagree. States are \ncurrently using revenues collected from our motor fuels tax for many \nnon-highway uses. For example, Virginia uses its motor fuels tax \nreceipts on mass transit and ports; New Hampshire uses its motor fuels \nreceipts to bolster their Fish and Game Department; Wyoming uses its \nportion of the motor fuels tax for snowmobile trails and boating \nfacilities; Florida and Arkansas use the motor fuels tax for \nenvironmental protection. Like these States have already done, I \nbelieve Congress should spend the revenues raised by the motor fuels \ntax on those programs it feels best serve our transportation needs. I \nthink passenger rail should be one of those programs.\n\n  Another argument I often hear is that we should stop subsidizing \nAmtrak. Amtrak needs to be self-sufficient.\n  I would like to see that happen, but to date, I am not aware of any \ntransportation system that supports itself without Federal assistance. \nFurther, I am not aware of any transportation system that supports \nitself through user fees. According to the Department of \nTransportation, in fiscal year 1994 nearly $6 billion more was spent on \nhighways than was collected in user fees.\n  In fiscal year 1995 nearly $8 billion more was spent on highways than \nwas collected in user fees. Transit which is exempt from the motor \nfuels tax, received $3 billion in revenues in motor fuels revenues last \nyear. I repeat, no mode is self-financed.\n  In closing, our national passenger rail system is important.\n  My legislation would provide capital funding to help improve and \nmaintain the corporation's infrastructure. Amtrak will not be able to \nmake it to zero operating subsidies by the year 2002 without it. If we \nare to adequately fund our passenger rail system like we fund our \nhighways and other major modes of transportation, Amtrak will need this \ntrust fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 437. A bill to improve Indian reservation roads and related \ntransportation services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n       THE AMERICAN INDIAN TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Inouye, Senator Campbell, Senator Johnson, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Stevens, and Senator Bingaman.\n  Our bill, the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997, \nsays that the U.S. Congress desires to treat the Indian people of the \nUnited States fairly when we pass a new ISTEA; that is, a new highway \nand transportation and transit bill. As everybody who knows anything \nabout our Indian reservations and Indian pueblos knows, the Indian \npeople buy gasoline just like average Americans. They have cars and \npickup trucks. But they have a road system that is maintained for the \nmost part by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Now, if there is not a \ndedicated source of revenue, then obviously you have to take money out \nof the Bureau of Indian Affairs general funding to build roads.\n  For a number of years we have decided--and I am pleased that I took \nthe leadership--to set aside some significant portion of money out of \nthe highway trust fund that should go to Indian roads.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that says to our 557 Indian tribes and \nthe Alaskan Native villages, which are served by about 50,000 miles of \nroad--about 42 percent of these roads are Bureau of Indian Affairs \nroads, as I indicated--we are going to try to begin a program that will \nnot only build some more roads but will maintain them and will give the \nIndian people their share of each category of ISTEA money for their \nroad needs, be it construction of bridges, transit programs, highway \nsafety, scenic byways, or the like.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's 557 Indian tribes and Alaska Native \nvillages are served by over 50,000 miles of roads. About 42 percent of \nthese roads are Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] system roads. Beginning \nin the 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act, these BIA system \nroads were included in the national highway trust fund for the first \ntime in history. The gasoline tax, paid by every Indian who buys \ngasoline, was invested on Indian reservations through the Indian \nReservation Roads [IRR] Program. Indian tribes were included in \nsubsequent major highway legislation, most recently in the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA], where annual funding has \nbeen $191 million for the past 5 years. Prior to ISTEA, annual IRR \nfunding was $80 million per year.\n  Our best estimates indicate that at least $300 million is needed \nannually to begin to bring the IRR system up to par with the rest of \nAmerican roads and highways. Today, I am proud to be joined by Senators \nInouye, Campbell, and Johnson in introducing the American Indian \nTransportation Improvement Act of 1997. Our legislation increases the \nIndian Reservation Roads Program from $191 million per year to $250 \nmillion in fiscal year 1998; $275 million in fiscal year 1999; and $300 \nmillion each year for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. These funds are \nprimarily used for the design and construction of the BIA road system \nin Indian country. It is significant to most tribes that our bill also \nincludes road maintenance as an eligible activity.\n  In addition to increasing the planning, design, construction, and \nmaintenance money in our bill, we make other significant changes in the \nIRR Program and related ISTEA Programs to improve the transportation \nsystem on our Nation's Indian reservations. These changes will improve \nthe bridge construction program; provide a set-aside for transit \nsystems; allow DOT certification to directly operate DOT programs; \nprovide a set-aside for highway enhancements like lighting and transfer \npoints to buses; create a competitive grant process for scenic byways; \nexclude State roads on tribal lands from the apportionment adjustment \nprovisions of ISTEA; and increase funding for Indian Technical Centers \nfrom $200,000 each to one million dollars each for the six existing \ncenters.\n  In the ISTEA Bridge Program, which now requires each State to set \naside 1 percent of its ISTEA Bridge Program funds for Indian tribes, \nour bill would consolidate the 50 separate State set-asides into one \nnational pool. This national set-aside is then distributed to all \ntribes using to the BIA National Bridge Inventory Standards Program. \nThis BIA Bridge Program rates each Indian bridge and gives it a \nnational\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\nranking by deficiency. Funding priorities for all tribes would be set \nthrough the BIA bridge ranking system.\n  To encourage and expand transit systems on Indian reservations, The \nAmerican Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 [TAITIA] would \nalso establish a 1 percent set-aside from ISTEA--and its successor--\ntransit programs. While a national formula to allocate transit funds is \ndeveloped in consultation with tribes, the Federal Transit \nAdministration of the U.S. Department of Transportation [DOT] would \nallocate the funds. Without the new set-aside, tribes would have to \ncontinue to compete within each State for transit moneys. Our bill also \nallows the conversion of up to 3 percent of IRR construction and design \nfunds for local transit purposes.\n  Under current law, tribes are not included as eligible entities for \ndirect certification by DOT. This situation is clearly detrimental to \ntribes hoping to directly operate DOT highway programs other than those \noperated by the BIA. While only a handful of tribes, like the Navajo \nNation, are potentially capable of meeting the DOT certification \nstandards, none are allowed to be certified under the terms of current \nlaw. Without changing any of DOT's certification standards, this bill \nwould allow tribes that qualify to become certified by DOT to directly \noperate Federal highway programs.\n  In a related certification issue, any tribe certified by DOT, as \nStates are now certified, would be allowed direct access to DOT highway \nsafety program funds. Other tribes--most tribes--would continue to fund \ntheir highway safety programs through the BIA-DOT program.\n  Indian tribes need better access to the Highway Enhancements Program \nfor such improvements as lighting, bike trails, transfer points to \nbuses, and other enhancements. States are allowed to use up to 10 \npercent of their ISTEA funds for these types of enhancements. Our bill \ncreates a national Indian set-aside of 1 percent and would be \nadministered through the Federal Highway Administration competitive \ngrant process. Each tribe would be eligible to compete for these funds.\n\n  The Scenic Byways Program of ISTEA is essential to many tribes for \nenhanced access to scenic areas for improved economic development \nactivities and other purposes. The Jicarilla Apache Tribe in New \nMexico, for example, has committed $3 million of its IRR funds--about 2 \nyears of its total allocations--to complete its portion of the narrow \ngauge scenic highway to Colorado. To improve critical roads like this \none without detracting from the more basic highway needs, our bill \nwould create a 1 percent set-aside for Indian scenic byways. The \nFederal Highway Administration would allocate these funds through a \ncompetitive process with priority consideration given to tribes with \nthe greatest potential for tourism and other economic development \nactivities for tribal members.\n  Many States commit ISTEA resources to public lands highways on Indian \nreservations. Under current law, there are apportionment adjustment \nhold harmless provisions between donor and donee States. If a donee \nState like New Mexico decides to allocate funds for a public land \nhighway through an Indian reservation, that donee State's allocation \nfor the following year is reduced by the amount of money committed to \nthe public land highway through the Indian reservation--as well as \npublic land highways elsewhere in the State. To encourage States to \ncommit their ISTEA resources to these critical highways on Indian land, \nlike New Mexico highway 537 on the Jicarilla Apache Tribe's \nreservation, our bill exempts State commitments to public lands \nhighways that are built on Indian land.\n  If The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 were \nlaw today, the State of New Mexico and similar donee States would not \nbe penalized for committing their resources to State roads like New \nMexico highway 537. Our bill does not address the more general issue of \nthe apportionment adjustment hold harmless provisions in ISTEA, we \nsimply exempt Indian land highways from those provisions.\n  Finally, The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 \nincreases the allocation of IRR funds to the Indian technical centers \nfrom $200,000 per center for six centers to $1 million per center for \nthe same six centers. These centers provide training to Indian tribes \nin all phases of highway planning, design, construction, maintenance, \nprocurement, and related bridge programs. Increasing the ability of \nthese centers to train Indian highway administrators, engineers, and \nothers involved in the IRR Program will significantly enhance the \nability of tribes to operate their own programs and improve their \ntransportation systems.\n\n  Mr. President, The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of \n1997, was developed in close consultation with Indian leaders. I would \nlike to give special recognition to Paulson Chaco and Sam Johns of the \nNavajo Nation Transportation Department and Arnold Cassador of the \nJicarilla Apache Tribe and Mark Wright, their tribal roads engineer. \nTheir assistance in developing this bill has been essential and their \nknowledge of these highway programs is impressive.\n  The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 will be a \nconsiderable improvement in the current way we do business for the BIA \nroads system. This system serves over a million American Indians who \nlive on or near a reservation. In my home State of New Mexico, IRR \nfunds have made a large difference in the past decade. It is time to \naccelerate this effort for the direct benefit of Indian people in \nAmerica.\n  Under the current relative needs formula for distributing the IRR \nmoney, the Navajo Nation--in New Mexico and Arizona--is now scheduled \nto receive about $55 million annually in IRR funds. New Mexico Pueblos \nreceive about $12 million and the Apache Tribes receive about $3 \nmillion in New Mexico. I know from personal observation, that these \nfunds are generally well spent and much needed throughout Indian \ncountry. I believe they are critical funds for improving the poor \nemployment opportunities on most Indian reservations. I urge my \ncolleagues to study the importance of Indian roads for economic \ndevelopment opportunities, and support our effort to greatly improve \nthe Indian Reservation Road Program as described in our bill. Our bill \nwill go a long way toward helping American Indians make the best use of \nour Nation's highway programs to improve their daily lives.\n  We have not heretofore broadly applied this degree of Indian \nparticipation in the trust fund we set up for highways and mass \ntransit. We have, in the past, principally put money in to build roads. \nThis year, the new bill that we introduced with the cosponsors that I \nhave spoken of, will increase the ISTEA Indian Reservation Road Program \nto $250 million in 1998, to $275 million in 1999, then $300 million in \neach of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The ISTEA Indian Reservation \n[IRR] Roads program is currently funded at $191 million per year.\n  I want to have a list printed in the Record at this point to show the \ncurrent distribution of IRR funds by the BIA regional offices. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record, \nand I ask that a program activity allocation, showing how this IRR \nmoney is currently allocated among the participating Federal agencies, \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        INDIAN RESERVATION ROADS PROGRAM, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION       \n                          [Dollars in millions]                         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      RNF               \n                                                   (percent)     Amount \n------------------------------------------------------\\1\\---------------\nBureau of Indian Affairs, Central Office, $191                          \n million:                                                               \n  Aberdeen.....................................        9.109      $15.2 \n  Anadarko.....................................        2.987        5.0 \n  Billings.....................................        6.052       10.1 \n  Juneau.......................................        9.460       15.8 \n  Minneapolis..................................        5.045        8.4 \n  Muskogee.....................................        7.705       12.9 \n  Phoenix......................................        9.327       15.6 \n  Sacramento...................................        2.863        4.8 \n  Albuquerque..................................        7.026       11.8 \n  Navajo.......................................       32.752       54.8 \n  Portland.....................................        5.700        9.5 \n  Eastern......................................        1.974        3.3 \n                                                ------------------------\n    Total......................................      100       \\2\\ 167.2\n                                                                    5   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ RNF=Relative Needs Formula (Allocation distribution).               \n\\2\\ Approximate amount available for design and construction after      \n  deductions for different categories.                                  \n\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\n\n         INDIAN RESERVATION ROADS [IRR] PROGRAM ALLOCATION PLAN         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Allocation           \n               IRR Program Activity                 (percent)   Million \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Yearly Authorization.........................  ..........    $191.0 \nLess FHWA Administration.........................       3.00        5.7 \nLess BIA Administration..........................       5.00        9.0 \nLess IRR Transportation Planning.................       2.00        3.8 \nLess 2 percent Tribal Transportation Planning *..       2.00        3.8 \nLess Mapping.....................................        .13         .25\nLess LTAP........................................        .63        1.2 \n                                                  ----------------------\n    Available for design and construction........  ..........     167.25 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* 23 U.S.C., Section 204(j)(b)-Up to 2% of funds made available for     \n  Indian Reservation Roads for each fiscal year shall be allocated to   \n  those Indian tribal governments applying for transportation planning  \n  pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and       \n  Education Assistance Act.

Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask it \nbe referred to the appropriate committee or committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a summary of the provisions, the \npurpose and various provisions. This document will show that Indian \nreservation bridges, for example, will be handled in a better way. Our \nbill continues the basic design and construction of Indian roads. We \nalso add road maintenance as an eligible activity. We also provide \ntransit, scenic byways, highway enhancements, and other Indian set-\nasides in our bill.\n  We include scenic byways, especially those that will help to develop \nreservation economies. We think if there are byways that are scenic in \nIndian country and can add to the reservation economy, they ought to \nget their share of these highway trust funds. We allow DOT \ncertification for tribes who can qualify to directly operate DOT \nprograms without going through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. We \nincrease funding for Indian technical centers to enhance tribal \ncapabilities in the entire range of highway planning, design, \nconstruction, and maintenance.\n  I ask that this bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997\n\n\n                                Purpose\n\n       To increase the Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) Program of \n     the Intermodal Surface Transportation Improvement Act (ISTEA) \n     from $191,000,000 per year to $300,000,000 per year, and to \n     include Indian tribes in other relevant programs of ISTEA as \n     described below.\n\n\n                IRR Funding Amounts and Road Maintenance\n\n       IRR Program funding will be increased from $191 million in \n     fiscal year 1997 to $250 million in fiscal year 1998; $275 \n     million in FY 1999; and $300 million in fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2002. Road maintenance is made an eligible activity.\n\n\n                       Indian Reservation Bridges\n\n       The current Indian reservation bridge program in ISTEA is \n     operated through the states. Each state has a set-aside of \n     one percent for Indian bridges. The American Indian \n     Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 (TAITIA) creates a \n     single national bridge program from amounts previously \n     allocated to the states. TAITIA allocates one percent to the \n     Secretary of Transportation for Indian bridges. Priorities \n     for distribution among tribes will be determined by the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) National Bridge Inspection \n     Standards Program which determines deficiency levels for \n     Indian reservation bridges. Priority for TAITIA funds will be \n     given to bridges with the highest level of deficiency.\n\n\n                        Indian Transit Set-Aside\n\n       In The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of \n     1997, one percent of the ISTEA Mass Transit funds will be set \n     aside for transportation services to Indian tribes. The \n     Secretary of Transportation will develop an allocation \n     formula in consultation with tribes. Until the allocation \n     formula is formally developed, the Administrator of the \n     Federal Transit Administration of DOT will establish a \n     temporary allocation formula. the funds through a temporary \n     formula.\n\n\n                         Scenic Byways Program\n\n       One percent of the funds for scenic byways are set-aside \n     for Indian tribes in a competitive grant process for the \n     planning, design, and development of Indian tribe scenic \n     byway programs. These scenic byways are important for tribal \n     economic development programs.\n\n\n              Certification Acceptance and Highway Safety\n\n       The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 \n     allows tribes with advanced transportation planning and \n     construction capabilities to be certified by DOT for direct \n     participation in DOT programs in a manner that is now allowed \n     for qualified states. Under current law, even a qualified \n     tribe is not allowed to be certified by DOT. This \n     certification acceptance provision will allow tribes that are \n     able to meet the national standards to be accepted by DOT. \n     TAITIA makes no changes in the certification standards.\n       Tribes that are able to achieve certification acceptance by \n     DOT will also be eligible for direct access to DOT highway \n     safety funds, Section 402 of ISTEA. These activities include \n     traffic safety, traffic law education, seatbelt law \n     enforcement, and free infant restraints.\n\n\n                        Indian Technical Centers\n\n       The six Indian Technical Centers are now funded at a level \n     of $200,000 each. To improve tribal capacity to plan, design, \n     construct, maintain, and otherwise operate their own Indian \n     Reservation Roads Programs, TAITIA will increase each \n     center's amount to one million dollars, adding $4.8 million \n     for this vital function.\n\n\n                 Transportation Enhancement Activities\n\n       ISTEA allows each state to use up to ten percent of its \n     allocation for transportation enhancements such as bike \n     trails, transfer points to buses, and lighting. Tribes are \n     allowed to compete for these funds in each state. TAITIA sets \n     aside one percent of the national transportation enhancement \n     pool to be used by the Secretary of Transportation to make \n     competitive grants to Indian tribes.\n\n\n                         Public Lands Highways\n\n       TAITIA exempts states from the apportionment adjustment \n     provisions of ISTEA for Public Lands Highways built on Indian \n     reservations. Although these are not IRR funds, states are \n     currently discouraged from committing their resources to \n     Public Lands Highways in Indian Country due to the hold \n     harmless provisions of the apportionment adjustment \n     requirements. This exemption is intended to encourage states \n     to make commitments of state ISTEA resources to Public Lands \n     Highways on Indian reservations.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to indicate the \ndistinguished former chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator \nMcCain, is very interested in the bill, and has indicated his support \nwhen it reaches his committee.\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici and Vice Chairman \nInouye in introducing the American Indian Transportation Improvement \nAct of 1997, to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct. [ISTEA].\n  More than any other communities in the United States, Indian tribes \nand Alaska Native villages suffer from a lack of adequate \ninfrastructure, and the necessary tools to build and maintain that \ninfrastructure. The United States has a special responsibility to \nIndian tribal governments to help them achieve economic self-\nsufficiency and political self-determination.\n  Economies today, whether State, tribal, or national, are increasingly \ndependent on interstate and international commerce for their \nlivelihoods. Solid physical infrastructure is the foundation for those \neconomies.\n  Federal ISTEA funding to tribal governments has lagged behind \nspending for States and local governments over the years, despite acute \nand unmet needs in Indian country. Poor and unsafe roads and highways, \ncrumbling bridges, and nonexistent transit and transportation systems \nall contribute to and result in tribal economies that are third world \nin nature.\n  In addition to facilitating the delivery of basic social services \nsuch as health, education, and nutrition to tribal members, solid \nphysical infrastructures act as an incentive to outside investors to \ninvest in tribal economies and to locate their businesses on tribal \nlands.\n  The legislation I am cosponsoring today recognizes the special \nFederal obligations, and will assist in the development and maintenance \nof Indian transportation infrastructures and in the process pave the \nway for higher levels of economic growth and job creation.\n  By increasing the funds available for the Indian reservation roads \nprogram, this bill will provide immediate relief to those tribes that \nhave a backlog of road development and maintenance. By strengthening \nthe capacity of tribes through transportation enhancement activities, \nthe reservation bridges programs, and technical centers, this \nlegislation will ensure that Indian tribes are not precluded from \nbuilding stronger, more vibrant communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in enacting this legislation so critical \nto tribal governments and economies across the Nation.\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, as a cosponsor of \nlegislation that he has authored which proposes an increase in the \nfunding for the Indian Reservation Roads Program and which would \nimprove the quality of Indian roads by directly including Indian tribes \nin Federal transportation service programs.\n  Indian reservation roads are the lifeline of tribal economic and \nsocial wellbeing, with about 50,000 miles of roads serving Indian \ntribes and Alaska Native villages nationwide. Over 90 percent of these \nroads are comprised of State and county roads and roads constructed and \nmaintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  The Bureau of Indian Affairs' road system includes approximately \n21,000 miles of roads which comprise about 42 percent of all roads \nserving Indian country. The overwhelming majority of these Bureau of \nIndian Affairs' roads--about 89 percent--are rated as being in poor \ncondition. This is an alarming statistic which this legislation is \ndesigned to remedy.\n  Historically, funding for the construction and maintenance of Bureau \nof Indian Affairs' roads has failed to keep pace with tribal \ntransportation needs and the result has been inferior Indian road \nconditions. In the 1950's, BIA funding reached a high of $10 million \nper fiscal year. By 1979, funding levels rose to $80 million per year. \nThereafter, BIA funding significantly declined.\n  The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 made the Indian \nReservation Roads Program eligible for support from the Highway Trust \nFund at $100 million for fiscal years 1984 to 1986. Between 1987 and \n1991, funding from the Highway Trust Fund decreased to $80 million. In \n1992, funding rose to $159 million and from 1993 to 1997, funding for \nIndian roads increased to $191 million.\n  Although funding for Indian reservation road construction and \nmaintenance improved, the increases were nonetheless woefully \ninadequate to meet tribal construction needs and to improve Indian \nroads so that they might be able to meet national standards. \nFurthermore, the current funding level of $191 million falls well short \nof the estimated national tribal transportation need of $300 million \nannually. Unless funding is increased, tribal roads will continue to \nfall behind national standards to the economic and social detriment of \nIndian tribes.\n  The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 includes \nnecessary funding increases and significant changes to the Indian \nReservation Roads Program and to relevant Federal transportation \nprograms that will provide Indian tribes with greater opportunities to \nmeet their transportation needs. The improvements to Indian \ntransportation include the following:\n  One, funding for the Indian Reservation Roads Program would be \nincreased from $191 million annually to $250 million for fiscal year \n1998, $275 million for fiscal year 1999, and $300 million for fiscal \nyears 2000 through 2002. Funds are primarily to be used for the design \nand construction of roads in the BIA system.\n  Two, identified as high priority by tribes, the bill includes Indian \nreservation road maintenance as an eligible activity for funding under \nthe Indian Reservation Roads Program. For BIA roads, Indian Reservation \nRoads Program funds would be used to supplement the nominal funding \nprovided for road maintenance.\n  Three, to encourage donee States to fund public land highway projects \nthat serve Indian country, the bill exempts funds expended on a public \nland highway constructed on an Indian reservation from the \napportionment adjustment hold harmless requirement which has in the \npast had the effect of decreasing a State's surface transportation \nprogram allocation by the amount a State expended on a public land \nhighway located on or running through an Indian reservation.\n\n  Four, this bill would establish a 1-percent set-aside of funds \nallocated for the National Scenic Byway Program for the development of \nan Indian scenic byway program to enhance access to scenic areas for \neconomic development and other purposes with funding to be distributed \nthrough competitive grants.\n  Five, currently, tribes qualified to meet the requirements of direct \ncertification in order to operate their own Federal highway programs \nare not eligible to do so. The bill overcomes this impediment by \nauthorizing the eligibility of Indian tribes for certification by the \nState or tribal highway department to directly operate Federal highway \nprograms. For example, certified tribal governments will have direct \naccess to Federal highway safety funds and be able to manage the \nhighway safety programs.\n  Six, to promote tribal highway enhancement activities on Indian \nroads, including bus transfer points and highway lighting, the bill \nauthorizes the transfer of 1 percent of the funds available to States \nfor transportation enhancement for competitive grants to Indian tribes.\n  Seven, in order to remedy the inefficient distribution of Indian \nbridge funds, the bill would establish a national Indian bridge program \nby consolidating the 1 percent of funds the States set aside for Indian \nbridges. The Secretary of Transportation would distribute the funding \nwith priority given to bridges with the highest level of deficiency as \ndetermined by the BIA National Bridge Inspection Standards. This \nprocess efficiently allocates Indian bridge funds based on demonstrable \nneed.\n  Eight, to enhance the capability of Indian tribes to improve their \ntransportation systems and qualify for direct certification, $1 million \nper fiscal year is authorized for each of six Indian technical centers \nwhere tribal members receive training in areas including highway \nplanning, construction, and maintenance.\n  Nine, finally, to address the inability of Indian tribes to apply \ndirectly for mass transportation funds and to meet increasing transit \nneeds, the bill provides authority for a 1-percent set-aside of mass \ntransportation funding for tribes with the allocation formula to be \nestablished by the Secretary of Transportation following negotiations \nwith the tribes. In addition, the bill authorizes the conversion of up \nto 3 percent of Indian reservation road funds to provide mass \ntransportation services to Indian tribes.\n  The American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997 will \nsignificantly improve surface transportation service on or near Indian \nReservations--improvements that will provide greater mobility for \ntribal members, increase economic opportunities for the tribe, \nincluding much-needed employment, and improve the overall quality of \nlife.\n  Mr. President, I want to recognize the outstanding leadership \ndemonstrated by Senator Pete Domenici in developing this important \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to join the chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, the Honorable Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, \nSenator Pete Domenici, and me in acting favorably on this bill when it \ncomes before the Senate for consideration.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the \nAmerican Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997. This is an act \nthat is long overdue. It would ensure that the native American \ncommunities in our country received the necessary funding to keep up \nwith their growing infrastructure needs, in this case, roads. This bill \nwould also ensure that we continue the Federal responsibility and \ncommitment to native Americans. In addition, Mr. President, the \nAmerican Indian Transportation Improvement Act would go a long way \ntoward providing native American communities the necessary means toward \neconomic and rural development to attract more business enterprises, \ntourism and thereby, job creation.\n  As my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has \naptly described today, Indian tribes and Alaskan communities must \nmaintain over 50,000 miles of roadways. Many of our Nation's bridges \nand roadways are in great need of repair and upgrade, and tribal roads \nand bridges are by no means an exception. This year as we work toward \nISTEA reauthorization, we must address many complicated issues. For \nexample, we must determine whether and to what extent distribution \nformulas should be adjusted, whether to provide States added \nflexibility in administering programs, and whether and to what extent \ncurrent environmental protections should be enhanced.\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\n  But as we toil to address these issues, we must realize that tribal \ncommunities are facing and must address transportation issues just as \nchallenging as those we address on a State and national Level. Tribes \nhave the same needs and are just as interested as our Nation's urban \ndwellers in improving roads and bridges. Tribal communities are \ninterested in establishing and maintaining mass transit systems \nespecially to assist their elderly, disabled, and youth get to and from \nplaces for goods, services, health care, and after-school activities.\n  Mr. President, our investment in city, State, county, and tribal \ntransportation systems is an investment from which we will certainly \nreap larger economic benefits and a much greater quality of life for \ncommunities greatly in need of help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n\n  S. 438. A bill to provide for implementation of prohibitions against \npayment of Social Security benefits to prisoners, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      THE NO CASH FOR CONVICTS ACT\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to prohibit the payment of Social Security benefits to \nconvicted criminals who are incarcerated at the expense of hard-working \ntaxpayers.\n  The fate of the Social Security program has become a major topic of \ndebate in Washington and in the homes of the American people. In the \nnews, on Capitol Hill, and in the conversations of people all across \nthis country the question of how to address the pending financial \nproblems of Social Security has caused considerable anxiety. Congress \nmust face one of its stiffest challenges in the next couple of years to \nenact legislation that will rescue the Social Security program for the \nlong term.\n  However, there are other flaws in the Social Security program that we \nmust not overlook. Because Social Security provides a lifelong \nentitlement to cash and health care, it is often a target of fraud and \nabuse. In the last couple of years, we have taken action to suspend \nbenefits paid to drug addicts and alcoholics and have increased funding \nso the Social Security Administration can perform continuing disability \nreviews which ensure that beneficiaries who may have recovered are no \nlonger receiving benefits.\n  Just last year, Congress enacted legislation to help SSA identify \nprisoners who received benefits from the Supplemental Security Income \nProgram. Unfortunately, Congress was unable to provide similar help to \nthe Social Security Disability Insurance Program.\n  No one incarcerated for a crime should continue to collect Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance. Criminals should not be allowed to \ndouble dip and receive Federal money earmarked for the purchase of food \nand clothing while they are part of a prison system which provides \nthese necessities already. The average SSDI payment in January of 1996 \nwas $682. When an individual's shelter, food, and clothing needs are \nalready being paid for at government expense--at least $13,000 a year \nin some States--paying out additional Federal funds is inexcusable.\n  Under current law, criminals are prohibited from collecting \ndisability insurance benefits if they are incarcerated and if that \nincarceration arises from a conviction punishable by imprisonment of \nmore than one year. However, this narrow standard applies to a limited \nnumber of criminals.\n  In order to fully confront this problem we must enact legislation \nthat accomplishes two goals. First, the law needs to be expanded to \nclose the existing loophole that allows criminals who are serving time \nfor misdemeanors or who receive a sentence of less than one year to \ncontinue to collect benefits. Second, we must amend the law to \nfacilitate the flow of information between Federal, State, county and \nlocal officials.\n  Right now, SSA is able to identify only a few of the individuals who \nhave been imprisoned to stop their benefits. The Social Security Act \nalready requires that any Federal, State, county or local agency send \nthe SSA the names and social security numbers of anyone who is confined \nto a penal institution or correctional facility in writing.\n  What's needed is an incentive for State and local law enforcement \nauthorities to report to the SSA any inmate illegally collecting DI \nbenefits. In testimony to the House Ways and Means Oversight Committee \non March 4, 1996, the General Accounting Office testified that SSA \nlacks timely and accurate information to stop benefit payments to \nprisoners.\n  My bill provides State and local law enforcement agencies with a \nfinancial incentive to report convicted criminals who are receiving \nbenefits while serving time in jail. The bill awards $400 for each \ncriminal reported to SSA within the first 30 days of confinement, and \n$200 if the required information is reported to SSA after the 30 day \nperiod ends. If the local authorities do not notify SSA within 90 days \nafter confinement begins, no award will be made.\n  Last year, as part of welfare reform we took steps to stop the \nflagrant abuse of the Social Security system with respect to SSI \npayments. Now we must finish the job by extending the law to include \nthe illegal collection of DI benefits.\n  By passing this legislation we will protect the financial soundness \nof Social Security disability insurance and preserve the program for \nthe people it is meant to assist. The only way to protect the hard-\nearned money of the American taxpayer is to insure that every penny is \nbeing spent properly. This legislation is projected to save $35 million \nover the next 7 years. In this day of hundreds of billions of dollars \nin deficit this may not seem overwhelming, but it will ease the \nadministrative burden on SSA and most importantly, help restore \nconfidence in this vital program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n        Kyl):\n  S. 439. A bill to provide for Alaska State jurisdiction over small \nhydroelectric projects, to address voluntary licensing of hydroelectric \nprojects on fresh waters in the State of Hawaii, to provide an \nexemption for portion of a hydroelectric project located in the State \nof New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n              THE FEDERAL POWER ACT AMENDMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, along with Senators Akaka, \nDomenici, and Kyl, I am today introducing legislation to address \nseveral issues associated with hydroelectric projects.\n  Section 1 gives the State of Alaska jurisdiction over small \nhydroelectric projects 5 megawatts or smaller. Section 2 precludes the \nvoluntary licensing of hydroelectric projects on fresh waters in the \nState of Hawaii. Section 3 provides an exemption from licensing for the \ntransmission line portion of a hydroelectric project located in the \nState of New Mexico. Section 4 gives the FERC the authority to extend \nfor up to 10 years the deadline for commencement of construction of \nhydroelectric projects.\n  Sections 1, 2, and 3 of this bill are virtually identical to sections \n7, 8, and 9 of S. 737 as reported in the 104th Congress. By unanimous \nvote, S. 737 was ordered reported by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources (Report No. 104-77). On September 27, 1996, the \nSenate unanimously passed S. 737 (Senate Calendar No. 100). \nUnfortunately, just a few days later, on October 6, the House of \nRepresentatives went out of session not having acted on the Senate-\npassed bill.\n  Sections 2 and 3 are of direct interest to Senators Akaka and \nDomenici, and they will speak separately on their merits. I will \ndiscuss sections 1 and 4, which are of direct interest to me.\n  Section 1 gives the State of Alaska jurisdiction over hydroelectric \nprojects 5 megawatts or smaller. It goes into effect when the Governor \nof Alaska notifies the Secretary of Energy that the State has in place \na comprehensive process for regulating these facilities. The required \nprocess is modeled on the one contained in the Federal Power Act for \nthe FERC. The authority granted to the State of Alaska would apply only \nto projects that are located entirely within the State. Moreover, these \nprojects may not be located on an Indian reservation, a unit of the \nNational Park System, a component of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, \nor a segment of a river designated for study for potential addition to \nsuch system. In the case of a project that is\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\nalready licensed by the FERC, the project sponsor may elect to make it \nsubject to State authority. Projects located on Federal lands are \nsubject to the approval of the Secretary of the Federal agency having \njurisdiction, and that Secretary may include such terms and conditions \nas may be necessary for the protection of the public interest. The \nprovisions specifically provide that nothing preempts the application \nof Federal environmental, natural, or cultural resources protection \nlaws according to their terms.\n  Section 4 amends section 13 of the Federal Power Act to give the FERC \nauthority to extend for up to 10 years the deadline for the \ncommencement of a hydroelectric project. Under existing law, a project \nmust commence construction within 2 years of the date of the issuance \nof the license. That deadline can be extended by the FERC one time for \nas much as 2 additional years, for a total of 4 years. If construction \nhas not commenced at the end of the statutory time period, the license \nmust be terminated by the FERC. Termination not only results in the \nlicensee losing its investment of time and many tens of thousands of \ndollars to obtain the license, it also delays the construction of the \nproject by requiring a new licensee to start the licensing process all \nover.\n  In the past, 4 years was adequate time to commence construction. \nHowever, with growing uncertainty in the electric power market, it is \nproving increasingly difficult for licensees to obtain the power \npurchase contract necessary to secure financing so as to permit \ncommencement of construction. This has resulted in a number of \nindividual requests to Congress to legislatively extend on a case-by-\ncase basis the commencement of construction deadline. During the 104th \nCongress, for example, 28 bills were introduced in the House and Senate \nto extend the deadline for individual projects. Acting on these \nindividual requests proved to be very time consuming for the committee \nand for the Congress. Had this provision been enacted, all of these \nrequests could have been accommodated administratively by the FERC. \nHence, I am introducing this bill to give the FERC the generic \nauthority to extend the deadline for the commencement of construction \nfor up to 10 years.\n  Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I am introducing this \nlegislation along with Senators Akaka, Domenici, and Kyl.\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the State of Hawaii, its delegation \nin Congress, and conservation organizations throughout the State are \ndeeply concerned about Federal efforts to regulate hydroelectric power \nprojects on State waters. The question of who should have authority for \nhydropower regulation--the State or the Federal Government--is very \ncontentious.\n  Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that \ncontinued Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our \nfresh water resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them. \nWhenever a hydroelectric power project is proposed, a number of \nenvironmental considerations must be weighed before approval is \ngranted. Important issues must be evaluated, such as whether the \nproposed dam or diversion will impair the stream's essential flow \ncharacteristics, or what effect the hydropower project will have on the \nphysical nature of the stream bed or the chemical makeup of the water. \nWill a dam or diversion diminish flow rates and reduce the scenic value \nof one of Hawaii's waterfalls? Will it harm recreational opportunities? \nThese, and other questions must be answered.\n  The effect of a new dam or diversion on the State's disappearing \nwetlands must be weighed. Wetlands provide vital sanctuary for \nmigratory birds, as well as habitat for endangered Hawaiian waterfowl. \nThey serve as reservoirs for storm water, filtering water-borne \npollutants before they reach the fragile coastal habitat, and provide a \nrecharge area for groundwater.\n  Historic resources may be at risk on streams when hydropower projects \nare proposed. When Polynesians first settled our islands, Hawaiian \nculture was linked to streams as much as it was linked to the sea. The \nremnants of ancient Hawaiian settlements can be found along many State \nrivers. Will the Federal Government give adequate attention to stream \nresources that have unique natural or cultural significance when it \nissues a hydroelectric license or permit?\n  Most important of all, hydropower development must be compatible with \npreserving native aquatic resources. Hawaiian streams support many \nspecies that depend on undisturbed habitat. Perhaps the most remarkable \nof these species is the gobie, which can climb waterfalls and colonize \nstream sections that are inaccessible to other fish. These are some of \nthe complex factors that must be considered during Federal hydropower \ndecisionmaking.\n  Federal agencies that have responsibility for fish, wildlife, and \nnatural resource protection have raised questions about the State of \nHawaii's commitment to protecting stream resources. They assert that \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is better equipped than the \nState to protect environmental values.\n  Nothing could be further from truth. The State of Hawaii has \ndemonstrated its commitment to protect stream resources by instituting \na new water code, adopting instream flow standards, launching a \ncomprehensive Hawaii stream assessment, and organizing a stream \nprotection and management task force.\n\n  Meanwhile, FERC has shown little regard for stream protection and has \ngranted a preliminary permit to a hydropower developer on the Hanalei \nRiver. This is the same river that the Fish and Wildlife Service is \nfighting to preserve. The Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge is the \nlargest refuge on the island of Kauai, and is home to four endangered \nwater birds. Sixty percent of the State's taro crop is grown in the \nwetlands adjacent to the river. When it comes to protecting \nenvironmental values, FERC is off to a very poor start.\n  The experience with the proposed Hanalei hydropower project raises \nserious questions about appropriateness of the Federal efforts to \nregulate hydropower in Hawaii. Our rivers and streams bear no \nresemblance to the wide, deep, long, and relatively flat rivers of the \ncontinental United States. Hawaiian streams generally comprise groups \nof short riffles, runs, falls, and deep pools. There are only five \nstreams with a length of 40 miles or more. Only two streams have a \nmedian flow rate greater than 100 cubic feet per second. By comparison, \nthe mean discharge of the Mississippi River is nearly 40,000 times the \nannual flow of Hawaii's longest river, the Kiikii River.\n  The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river \nsystems of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific \nlocation. When it comes to regulating hydropower in Hawaii, FERC is a \nfish out of water.\n  Chairman Murkowski has agreed to include the text of my legislation \nto exempt Hawaii from the FERC hydropower jurisdiction in section 2 of \nthe hydropower legislation he introduced today. Section 2 would \nterminate FERC's jurisdiction over hydropower projects on the fresh \nwater of the State of Hawaii. Section 2 is identical to the legislation \npassed by the Senate during the 103d Congress as part of an omnibus \nhydropower bill, but the House and Senate could not resolve their \ndifferences on the bill. In the 104th Congress, the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee again approved the bill. I will continue to \nfight for the passage of this legislation during the 105th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 440. A bill to deauthorize the Animas-La Plata Federal reclamation \nproject and to direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \nnegotiations to satisfy, in a manner consistent with all Federal laws, \nthe water rights interests of the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe and the \nSouthern Ute Indian Tribe; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                  ANIMAS-LA PLATA PROJECT LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to deauthorize the construction of the Animas-La Plata \nwater project in Colorado. I am very pleased to be joined in this \neffort by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback]. This measure is \nidentical to a bipartisan effort in the other body introduced on \nFebruary 13, 1997, by my colleague from Wisconsin [Mr. Petri] and my \ncolleague from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio].\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\n  The Animas-La Plata project is a $744 million water development \nproject planned for southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico that is \nlargely taxpayer funded. Designed to supply 191,230 feet of water, it \nwill consist of 2 major reservoirs, 7 pumping plants, and 200 miles of \ncanals and pipes. The project will pump water over 1,000 feet uphill, \nconsuming enough power to run a city of 60,000, to supply municipal, \nindustrial, and irrigation interests.\n  The legislation I am introducing today deauthorizes the Animas-La \nPlata Federal reclamation project and directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to work with the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes to \nfind an alternative to satisfy their water rights needs. It is \nsupported by a broad coalition of taxpayer and environmental groups \nthat includes: Taxpayers for Common Sense, Americans for Tax Reform, \nCitizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and \nNational Taxpayers Union. This legislation was also profiled in the \n1997 Green Scissors Report, and the Animas project has shown up on a \nnumber of deficit reduction target lists, including one recently \nproposed by the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the other body [Mr. \nKasich].\n  I believe that Federal legislation to terminate the Animas-La Plata \nproject is needed for four reasons. First, as a Senator who is \nextremely concerned about the Federal deficit and debt, this project \nhas an extremely high price tag--a projected total cost of $744 million \nin fiscal year 1998. That total projected cost estimate has increased \n$30 million over the fiscal year 1997 estimate of $714 million. The \nFederal share of that cost now exceeds half a billion dollars, $503 \nmillion to be exact, which is nearly 68 percent of the total cost. I \nbelieve, especially in these times of tight budgets, that commencement \nof significant Federal discretionary spending should be critically \nevaluated.\n\n  By no measure or metric is this project cost effective, Mr. \nPresident. A July 1995 economic analysis by the Bureau of Reclamation, \nthe only analysis that used economic procedures approved for Bureau \nanalyses and a current discount rate, reported that the project's \nbenefit-cost ratio is 0.36:1. In other words, Mr. President, the \nproject will return only 36 cents for every taxpayer dollar invested. I \nam additionally concerned, Mr. President, because recent GAO reports \nhave highlighted that Federal water projects, once built, do not recoup \nthe costs of the projects from the users, who are supposed to be paying \nthe government back for its investment. Municipal and industrial users \nare required under the Water Supply Act of 1958 to fully repay all the \nconstruction costs and operation and maintenance costs attributable to \nthe supply of municipal and industrial water. Those repayment contracts \nare to be in place before construction begins. Currently, the Bureau \nhas signed a repayment contract with two non-Indian project \nbeneficiaries. Those that have been signed do not cover the \nconstruction costs of the full project, due to cost increases. It is \nquestionable if the project will ever comply with the law and obtain \nfull reimbursement of municipal and industrial costs from the project \nbeneficiaries.\n  Second, I am introducing this legislation because I believe that the \nCongress should support the State of Colorado's ongoing dialog over \nlower cost alternatives rather than proceed to initiate construction. \nThe Animas-La Plata project has been the focus of controversy and \nlitigation for many years. In response to legislative activities last \nCongress, which I will describe in further detail, Colorado Gov. Roy \nRomer and Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler convened a discussion process in \nOctober 1996 with the Bureau of Reclamation, the Southern Ute and Ute \nMountain Ute Tribes, interested water districts, irrigators, and \nenvironmentalists in an attempt to resolve disputes among the parties. \nTo assist in the success of this process, the Bureau and the other \nparties executed a legal ``stand still'' agreement establishing basic \nground rules for the dialog and identifying the activities that could \ntake place outside the process. While the eventual outcome is not \nknown, a recommendation for a different formulation of the project is \npossible.\n  Thus far, the Department of the Interior, acting through the Bureau, \nis committed to finding a solution acceptable to the parties in \ngeneral, and to the Colorado Ute Tribes specifically, due to the \nFederal Government's tribal trust responsibility. My legislation will \ncodify that direction by specifically directing the Bureau to continue \nwith these negotiations, rather than proceed with Animas-La Plata.\n  Third, this legislation has been drafted to acknowledge the \nimportance of demonstrating support for ensuring that the Federal \nGovernment's obligations to the Colorado Ute Tribes are fulfilled. \nDuring debate over the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations \nbill, colleagues will remember that I offered an amendment to terminate \nfunding for Animas-La Plata. I believe that amendment was not \nsuccessful last year due to concerns by colleagues that the project is \nnecessary to fulfill Ute tribal water rights.\n  As I made clear to colleagues during the appropriations debate, \ndespite the contention that the project will address the Ute claims, \nAnimas-La Plata was not initiated as a way to address these claims. \nThis project was authorized in 1968 to supply irrigation water to \nfarmers growing forage crops in arid areas. Even back then, in the \nheyday of big water projects, this one was riddled with so many \nproblems it couldn't get going. In 1988, nearly 20 years after it was \nauthorized, the settlement of the Ute Indian water rights claims became \nan additional justification for pushing this project through.\n\n  Construction of this project has not yet begun because of a variety \nof factors, including concerns raised about the adequacy of the April \n1996 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, issues surrounding \ncost-sharing and repayment agreements, and compliance problems with New \nMexico's water quality standards.\n  Both the Ute Mountain Ute and the Southern Ute tribal governments \nformally support construction of Animas-La Plata. The water that the \nUtes will be provided from the project, however, is only a fraction of \nthe project's total capacity. Of the 191,230 acre-feet of water the \nproject will supply, two-thirds will go to nontribal interests with \nonly 62,000 acre feet of the total to be supplied to both tribes. There \nis dissent within the Southern Ute Tribe about the wisdom of this \nproject, and I am pleased that this legislation terminating the project \nhas received the support of the Southern Ute Grassroots Organization.\n  I am concerned that the Animas-La Plata as currently proposed cannot \nmeet the needs of the tribes because the initial construction phase of \nthe project will neither provide the delivery system nor the quantity \nof water needed to fully honor the Federal Government's commitments. We \nshould not spend hundreds of million of dollars and still find the \ntribal needs potentially unmet. Rather, I want to see that the Bureau \nis engaged in actively solving these problems rather than half-\nheartedly moving forward with construction and at the negotiating table \nto examine alternatives. The Ute Tribes' water rights settlement says \nthat if the project isn't built and fully functional by the year 2000, \nthe tribes may void the settlement and go back into negotiations or \nlitigation. Last year, the Bureau indicated that it cannot complete the \nproject before 2003. It is not unreasonable to expect that the Utes may \nseek to void their settlement, wherein the non-Indian irrigators will \nget their expensive project and Congress in the year 2005 or so will \nhave to fund a new water rights settlement.\n  Finally, I believe that there needs to be a proactive legislative \nsolution put forward to address the Animas-La Plata project because the \npolitical support for continued appropriations for this project is \neroding. Last year, during the 104th Congress, the other body voted 221 \nto 200 to stop the funding for the Animas-La Plata project as it is \ncurrently designed. The chairman of the Budget Committee in the other \nbody has put Animas-La Plata on a target list of corporate welfare \ncuts. I believe that during the appropriations cycle for fiscal year \n1998, the other body will again vote to terminate funding for this \nproject.\n  Politically, we may go back and forth for a few years with the other \nbody terminating funding and this\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nbody restoring the money. But eventually, both Houses of Congress will \nresist and we will have wasted millions of dollars.\n  My bill seeks to put this project back on a positive track. It \ndirects the Bureau of Reclamation to address legitimate water needs and \nexplore all the alternatives to meeting those needs, and terminates \nthis project that we can no longer afford. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis measure be printed in the Record.\n  Three being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEAUTHORIZATION OF ANIMAS-LA PLATA FEDERAL \n                   RECLAMATION PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Deauthorization.--The Animas-La Plata Project, Colorado \n     and New Mexico (a participating project under the Act of \n     April 11, 1956 (commonly known as the ``Colorado River \n     Storage Project Act'') (70 Stat. 105, chapter 203; 43 U.S.C. \n     620 et seq.), and the Colorado River Basin Project Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1501 et seq.)) is not authorized after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The first section of the Act of \n     April 11, 1956 (70 Stat. 105, chapter 203; 43 U.S.C. 620), is \n     amended in the proviso by striking ``Animas-La Plata,''.\n       (c) Negotiations.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     promptly seek to enter into negotiations with the Ute \n     Mountain Ute Indian Tribe and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe \n     to satisfy, in a manner consistent with all Federal laws, the \n     water rights interests of those tribes that were intended to \n     be satisfied with water supplied from the Animas-La Plata \n     Project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 441. A bill to improve health care quality and reduce health care \ncosts by establishing a national fund for health research that would \nsignificantly expand the Nation's investment in medical research; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the national fund for health research act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Specter to \nintroduce the National Fund for Health Research Act. This legislation \nis similar to legislation I introduced with Senator Hatfield during the \nlast Congress which gained broad bipartisan support in both the House \nand Senate.\n  Our proposal would establish a national fund for health research to \nprovide additional resources for health research over and above those \nprovided to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] in the annual \nappropriations process. The fund would greatly enhance the quality of \nhealth care by investing more in finding preventive measures, cures, \nand cost-effective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions \nthat strike Americans.\n  To finance the fund, health plans would set aside approximately 1 \npercent of all health premiums and transfer the funds to the Department \nof the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury would then transfer the \nmoney to the national fund for health research.\n  Each year under our proposal amounts within the national fund for \nhealth research would automatically be allocated to each of the NIH \nInstitutes and Centers. Each Institute and Center would receive the \nsame percentage as they received of the total NIH appropriation for \nthat fiscal year. The set aside should generate sufficient funds to \nprovide for a nearly 50-percent increase in funding for the NIH.\n  In 1994, I argued that any health care reform plan should include \nadditional funding for health research. Health care reform has been \ntaken off the front burner but the need to increase our Nation's \ncommitment to health research has not diminished.\n  While health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually our \nmedical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States \ndevotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health \nresearch. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on \nresearch. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war \nagainst disease and disability continues.\n  Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health \ncosts in the long run. If we can find the cure for a disease like \nAlzheimer's the savings would be enormous. Today, federally supported \nfunding for research on Alzheimer's disease totals $300 million yet it \nis estimated that nearly $100 billion is expended annually on caring \nfor people with Alzheimer's.\n  Gene therapy and treatments for cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's could \neliminate years of chronic care costs, while saving lives and improving \npatients' quality of life.\n  Mr. President, Senator Specter and I do everything we can to increase \nfunding for NIH through the appropriations process. But, given the \ncurrent budget situation and freeze in discretionary spending what we \ncan do is limited. Without action, our investment in medical research \nthrough the NIH is likely to continue to decline in real terms.\n  The NIH is not able to fund even 25 percent of competing research \nprojects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. This is \ncompared to rates of 30 percent or more just a decade ago. Science and \ncutting edge medical research is being put on hold. We may be giving up \npossible cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and countless \nother diseases.\n  Our lack of investment in research may also be discouraging our young \npeople from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people \nunder the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent \nbetween 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid \nthat the lower success rates among applicants is making biomedical \nresearch less and less attractive to young people. If the perception is \nthat funding for research is impossible to obtain, young people that \nmay have chosen medical research 10 years ago will choose other career \npaths.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that over 130 groups representing \npatients, hospitals, medical schools, researchers, and millions of \nAmericans have already endorsed our proposal.\n  Mr. President, health research is an investment in our future--it is \nan investment in our children and grandchildren. It holds the promise \nof cure or treatment for millions of Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 442. A bill to establish a national policy against State and local \ngovernment interference with interstate commerce on the Internet or \ninteractive computer services, and to exercise Congressional \njurisdiction over interstate commerce by establishing a moratorium on \nthe imposition of exactions that would interfere with the free flow of \ncommerce via the Internet, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      the INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I met with a group \nof small business folks at an Internet cafe in Portland. We talked \nabout the promise electronic commerce holds for businesses and \nconsumers. The Internet can give a small businessperson in Astoria, OR \naccess to the entire global marketplace. It can give consumers, \nespecially in rural areas, entry to a supernational shopping mall.\n  For governments, the Internet offers a different type of promise--the \nchance to be a new cash cow. As Federal funds decrease, States and \nlocal governments are looking to the Internet as a new source of \nrevenue. Some have already begun building tollbooths on the information \nsuperhighway. For sales taxes alone, there are nearly 6,500 different \ntaxing authorities in this country. One businessman at the Internet \ncafe told me he is wary of getting into electronic commerce because of \nthe prospect of as many as 30,000 different pairs of hands reaching \ninto his pockets to collect taxes. If current trends continue, State \nand local levies will transform the Internet from a bright and exciting \nnew frontier for commerce into a dark jungle of foreboding taxes.\n  Under today's mishmash of State and local Internet taxes, everyone is \npuzzled. Take a customer at his home computer who purchases an item \nfrom a virtual catalogue. With the click of his mouse, the purchase is \nlogged, his account billed and payment made by wire transfer and the \norder sent. The vendor is in another State, or even another country. \nHis bank is in a third State and the purchase is a gift being sent to a \nrelative in another State. Where did this transaction take place?\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\n Where was there nexus for tax purposes--the vendor State? The \ncustomer's State? The bank's location? Or the State where the gift is \nbeing sent? Is the answer all of the above, some of the above, or none \nof the above?\n  The enormity of the problem is underscored by the fact that the \nhottest selling software today is software to help entrepreneurs and \ncompanies figure out various State tax policies.\n  When a consumer in Corvallis, OR uses an Internet search engine in \nCalifornia, is that search a taxable service? When a housewife in \nHouston uses Virginia-based America Online to make a virtual purchase \nfrom a furniture company in North Carolina, what gets taxed where? Is \nan Internet service provider a public utility, as one State has ruled? \nEven if a State has enacted an online tax law, collection and \nenforcement are often haphazard. This system rewards ignorance and \npunishes the boy scout businesses that play by the rules.\n  The purpose of the bill I am introducing today with Congressman Chris \nCox is to allow everyone to step back and take a deep breath. It says \nlet's suspend this crazy tax quilting bee so that everyone can come \ntogether in a rational way to figure out what policy makes the most \nsense.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act has three parts. First, it would impose \nan indefinite moratorium on subnational taxes on electronic commerce. \nWhere States and local governments have already imposed taxes on \nelectronic commerce, their taxes would be grand fathered to the extent \nthat they are net income taxes, fairly apportioned business license \ntaxes or where the tax is collected in an identical way for mail or \ntelephone orders. This will assure uniformity and fairness, while \ntargeting inequitable technology taxes. Our intent is that the new tax \nmoratorium apply to all Internet and interactive computer services, \nregardless of the technology--such as cable systems and wireless \nnetworks--being used to deliver those services. It will give us a \nfunctionally equivalent and technologically equitable tax policy. It \nwill assure equity and fairness among all business entities and across \ntechnologies.\n\n  Second, the bill would call upon the administration to bring together \nState and local governments, businesses and consumers, and any others \nwith a stake in the Internet and online commerce to develop policy \nrecommendations on taxation of the Internet and use of the Internet to \ndeliver products and services. The Executive would have 2 years in \nwhich to prepare policy recommendations on taxation of the Internet.\n  Third, the bill directs the executive branch to seek an international \nagreement making the Internet a duty-free zone. Just as we seek a \nrational policy on electronic commerce taxation here in the United \nStates, our businesses cannot be expected to compete overseas if they \nfaced more than 160 different foreign tariff policies covering global \nelectronic commerce. Although about 75 percent of Web users live in \nNorth America, most electronic commerce is between companies, rather \nthan companies and consumers. Forrester Research of Massachusetts \npredicts business-to-business commerce will soon be worth $67 billion a \nyear.\n  Trying to find out exactly which States and local authorities are \nimposing taxes on electronic commerce and what types of taxes they are \nimposing is a daunting--if not outright impossible--task in itself. The \nVice President for a good-sized Internet service provider in California \nsaid he would need a whole department to untangle the various Internet \ntax laws around the country, ``It's in my nightmare pile,'' he \nobserved. If this has stumped some of the best accounting firms in the \ncountry, how in the world can a small business that wants to sell over \nthe Internet figure out its various tax liabilities? The difference \nbetween States in electronic commerce tax policy is mind-numbing.\n  Twenty States and the District of Columbia impose one or more taxes \non electronic commerce. New York levies taxes on gross receipts on the \n``furnishing of information,'' but not on personal or individual \ninformation. Ohio taxes electronic transmissions and real estate data \nbases because they provide objective data but exempts news services \nbecause they provide analysis. Texas taxes the transmission of \nelectronic information and software in whatever form, but does not tax \nsoftware sent out of State on a disk. Alabama's Revenue Department \nruled last fall that a utility tax applies to Internet service \nproviders, forcing them to pay a 4-percent public utilities tax.\n  Last year in Florida a small Internet service provider asked the \nState's Department of Revenue whether he should add a sales tax to his \ncustomers' monthly bills. He was certain he wouldn't have to since all \nnet surfers there already pay 10 percent or more in taxes for the \ntelephone service they use to link to the Internet. To his surprise, \nthe Revenue Department said his customers should have been paying a 7-\npercent service tax under a decade-old telecommunications law. Then, \nadding shock to surprise, the Department told him his company was \nsubject to an additional 2.5-percent tax on its gross annual receipts. \nThe uproar from users and providers led the Governor to suspend the \ntaxes until a panel could study the implications.\n  The legislation is constructed in such a way as to set up a dynamic \nand productive tension. It gives those that seek revenue from \nelectronic commerce--the States and local governments--an incentive to \nwork with the administration in developing policy recommendations on \nInternet taxation. Indeed, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures wrote me on February 21 that they have been ``working with \na number of other State organizations as well as the impacted private \nsector industries to find the common ground which will lead to the \ncoordination and uniformity of State tax structures which the draft \nlegislation desires.'' And an official with the Federal of Tax \nAdministrators observed last summer that ``States need to figure out \nhow to tax it [the Internet] and to make it a level playing field with \nother services.'' I will also continue to work with the Multistate Tax \nCommission to assure their efforts move forward.\n  But the question remains: Will the simple imperative for good public \npolicy outweigh the desire of cash-strapped States to tap a new source \nof revenue? Without a moratorium, as proposed in this legislation, I \nfear those State and local governments hungry for new sources of \nrevenue have little, if any, incentive to work for a fair and equitable \nInternet tax policy.\n  I want to thank a number of groups that have helped us craft this \nlegislation, and which have indicated their support for this bill: the \nAmerican Electronics Association, the Software Publishers Association, \nthe Association of Online Professionals, the Committee on State \nTaxation, the Direct Marketing Association, the Business Software \nAlliance, the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. \nTelephone Association, the California State Board of Taxation, the \nMassachusetts High Tech Council, CommerceNet, the Silicon Valley \nSoftware Industry Coalition, IBM, AT, and other companies.\n  I view the legislation being introduced today as the beginning of a \nprocess, not the end. It remains a work in progress and will hopefully \ncontinue to be refined throughout the congressional hearing process.\n  There is a great deal to learn in these unchartered waters. All of \nus--Congress, State and local governments, businesses and consumers--\nmust educate each other about how this new electronic medium works. We \nmust all work together to help it achieve its full potential as a \nmarketplace of ideas, products, and services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  Thee being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Freedom Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As a massive global network spanning not only State but \n     international borders, the Internet is inherently a matter of \n     interstate and foreign commerce within the jurisdiction of \n     the United States Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the \n     United States Constitution.\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\n       (2) Even within the United States, the Internet does not \n     respect State lines and operates independently of State \n     boundaries. Addresses on the Internet are designed to be \n     geographically indifferent. Internet transmissions are \n     insensitive to physical distance and can have multiple \n     geographical addresses.\n       (3) Because transmissions over the Internet are made \n     through packet-switching it is impossible to determine with \n     any degree of certainty the precise geographic route or \n     endpoints of specific Internet transmissions and infeasible \n     to separate intrastate from interstate, and domestic from \n     foreign, Internet transmissions.\n       (4) Inconsistent and inadministrable taxes imposed on \n     Internet activity by State and local governments threaten not \n     only to subject consumers, businesses, and other users \n     engaged in interstate and foreign commerce to multiply, \n     confusing, and burdensome taxation, but also to restrict the \n     growth and continued technological maturation of the Internet \n     itself, and to call into question the continued viability of \n     this dynamic medium.\n       (5) Because the tax laws and regulations of so many \n     jurisdictions were established before the Internet or \n     interactive computer services, their application to this new \n     medium in unintended and unpredictable ways threatens every \n     Internet user, access provider, vendor, and interactive \n     computer service provider.\n       (6) The electronic marketplace of services, products, and \n     ideas available through the Internet or interactive computer \n     services can be especially beneficial to senior citizens, the \n     physically challenged, citizens in rural areas, and small \n     businesses. It also offers a variety of uses and benefits for \n     educational institutions and charitable organizations.\n       (7) Consumers, businesses, and others engaging in \n     interstate and foreign commerce through the Internet or \n     interactive computer services could become subject to more \n     than 30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United \n     States alone.\n       (8) The consistent and coherent national policy regarding \n     taxation of Internet activity, and the concomitant \n     uniformity, simplicity, and fairness that is needed to avoid \n     burdening this evolving form of interstate and foreign \n     commerce can best be achieved by the United States exercising \n     its authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the \n     United States Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON IMPOSITION OF TAXES ON INTERNET OR \n                   INTERACTIVE COMPUTER SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Moratorium.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     section, no State or political subdivision thereof may \n     impose, assess, or attempt to collect a tax directly or \n     indirectly on--\n       (1) the Internet or interactive computer services; or\n       (2) the use of the Internet or interactive computer \n     services.\n       (b) Preservation of State and Local Taxing Authority.--\n     Subsection (a)--\n       (1) does not apply to taxes imposed on or measured by net \n     income derived from the Internet or interactive computer \n     services;\n       (2) does not apply to fairly apportioned business license \n     taxes applied to businesses having a business location in the \n     taxing jurisdiction; and\n       (3) does not affect a State or political subdivision \n     thereof of authority to impose a sales or use tax on sales or \n     other transactions effected by the use of the Internet or \n     interactive computer services if--\n       (A) the tax is the same as the tax generally imposed and \n     collected by that State or political subdivision thereof on \n     interstate sales or transactions effected by mail order, \n     telephone, or other remote means within its taxing \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (B) the obligation to collect the tax from sales or other \n     transactions effected by the use of the Internet or \n     interactive computer services is imposed on the same person \n     or entity as in the case of sales or transactions effected by \n     mail order, telephone, or other remote means.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Consultative Group.--The Secretaries of the Treasury, \n     Commerce, and State, in consultation with appropriate \n     committees of the Congress, consumer and business groups, \n     States and political subdivisions thereof, and other \n     appropriate groups, shall--\n       (1) undertake an examination of United States and \n     international taxation of the Internet and interactive \n     computer services, as well as commerce conducted thereon; and\n       (2) jointly submit appropriate policy recommendations \n     concerning United States domestic and foreign policies toward \n     taxation of the Internet and interactive computer services, \n     if any, to the President within 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) President.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress policy recommendations on \n     the taxation of sales and other transactions affected on the \n     Internet or through interactive computer services.\n       (c) Recommendations To Be Consistent With \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 Policy Statement.--The \n     Secretaries and the President shall take care to ensure that \n     any policy recommendations are fully consistent with the \n     policy set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 230(b) \n     of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(b)).\n\n     SEC. 5. DECLARATION THAT THE INTERNET BE FREE OF FOREIGN \n                   TARIFFS, TRADE BARRIERS, AND OTHER \n                   RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the President should \n     seek bilateral and multilateral agreements through the World \n     Trade Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation \n     Council, or other appropriate international fora to establish \n     that activity on the Internet and interactive computer \n     services is free from tariff and taxation.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act--\n       (1) Internet; interactive computer service.--The terms \n     ``Internet'' and ``interactive computer service'' have the \n     meaning given such terms by paragraphs (1) and (2), \n     respectively, of section 230(e) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(e)).\n       (2) Tax.--The term ``tax'' includes any tax, license, or \n     fee that is imposed by any governmental entity, and includes \n     the imposition of the seller of an obligation to collect and \n     remit a tax imposed on the buyer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       The Internet Tax Freedom Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1: Short title: ``The Internet Tax Freedom Act''\n       Section 2: Findings. Sets forth a series of findings, \n     including that the Internet is inherently a matter of \n     interstate commerce; that the Internet operates independently \n     of State lines; that inconsistent and unadministrable taxes \n     imposed on Internet activity by State and local governments \n     subject consumers and businesses to multiple, confusing and \n     burdensome taxation and are creating compliance problems for \n     Internet access providers, vendors and interactive computer \n     service providers; that consumers, businesses and others \n     engaging in interstate commerce through the Internet or \n     interactive computer services could become subject to some \n     30,000 separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States; \n     and that uniformity, simplicity and fairness are needed \n     regarding taxation of Internet activity to avoid burdening \n     this evolving form of interstate commerce.\n       Section 3: Moratorium on Imposition of Taxes on Internet or \n     Interactive Computer Services--\n       Subsection (a), establishes a moratorium on direct and \n     indirect state or local taxes on the Internet or interactive \n     computer services or the use of those services.\n       Subsection (b), preserves state and local authority for \n     taxes for the following types of taxes:\n       (1) taxes on or measured by net income derived from these \n     services,\n       (2) fairly apportioned business license taxes, and\n       (3) sales and use taxes on interstate electronic \n     transactions that are consistent with taxes on mail order and \n     telephone transactions.\n       Section 4: Administration Policy Recommendations to \n     Congress.\n       Subsection (a), Establishes a consultative group of the \n     Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce and State that will \n     work with State and local governments, consumer and business \n     groups and others to examine U.S. and international taxation \n     of Internet and interactive computer services and submit \n     policy recommendations to the President within 18 months of \n     enactment.\n       Subsection (b), directs the President to transmit to \n     Congress any policy recommendations within two years of \n     enactment.\n       Subsection (c), seeks to ensure that any policy \n     recommendations are consistent with the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act policy statement regarding promotion \n     of the Internet and interactive computer services.\n       Section 5: Declaration that the Internet Be Free of Foreign \n     Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and Other Restrictions\n       Sets forth the sense of the Congress that the President \n     should seek bilateral and multinational agreements through \n     various international trade organizations to keep the \n     Internet and interactive computer services free from tariffs \n     and taxation.\n       Section 6: Definitions\n       (1) Internet and interactive computer service terms are \n     defined as they are in the Communications Act of 1934, as \n     amended by the 1996 Telecommunications Act.\n       (2) Defines tax to include any tax, license or fee imposed \n     by any governmental entity and includes the imposition on the \n     seller of an obligation to collect and remit a tax imposed on \n     the buyer.\n\n

ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner and Mr. Akaka) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas over the years, Federal employees and retirees have \n     regularly been forced to bear a disproportionate share in \n     connection with deficit reduction: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that cost-of-\n     living adjustments for Federal retirees should be paid \n     beginning in January of each year, as current law prescribes, \n     and should not be delayed, whether as part of a budget \n     agreement or otherwise.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit along with \nSenators Mikulski, Warner, and Akaka, this sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution. It is a simple resolution which clearly states that it is \nthe sense of the Congress that Federal retiree COLA's should not be \ndelayed.\n  After 3 years of having their cost-of-living adjustments delayed, \nFederal retirees finally saw equity restored this year when their COLA \nadjustment became effective in January instead of April. Federal \nretirees should continue to receive their COLA on time, in line with \nall other Federal cost-of-living adjustments.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the average Federal \nretiree would lose an estimated $915 over the next 5 years if a three-\nmonth COLA delay is reinstated. To many of our Nation's more than 2 \nmillion Federal retirees, this can mean a significant difference in the \ncalculation of their yearly living expenses.\n  Further delaying Federal retiree COLA's would, in my view, set a \ndangerous, unfounded precedent where cutting or altering Federal \nretiree and employee benefits to effect cost savings becomes an all too \nregular and accepted practice.\n  Mr. President, Federal retirees have served this Nation with the \nexpectation that the benefits they have earned will be excluded from \nthe pressures of achieving arbitrary budgetary targets. Disparate \ntreatment of COLA recipients goes against longstanding congressional \npolicy that for more than 25 years has ensured COLA equity for all \nretirees, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant resolution.\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am joining with my \ncolleagues, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Warner, and Senator Akaka to \nsubmit a very important resolution. Our resolution states a simple \nfact--federal retirees should not be singled out for delays in their \ncost of living adjustments.\n  As my colleagues know, 1997 was the first year since 1993 that \nFederal retirees received a timely COLA. Their COLA's were delayed \nuntil April for the last 3 years as part of the 1993 deficit reduction \nplan. They were willing\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nto accept this delay because they knew that they would have to do their \nfair share to help us control the budget deficit. Many of them said to \nme, ``Senator, I'm willing to tighten my belt another notch to help \nthis country, as long as everyone else is asked to do the same.''\n  Now we have a situation where retirees are being asked to tighten the \nbelt again. Except this time they are being singled out for special \ntreatment. We have proposals to delay Federal retiree COLA's for \nanother 4 years. I don't think that's right --it's not fair and its not \nequitable. I think all COLA's--Federal, military, and Social Security \nshould be paid on time. They should be reliable and they should be \naccurate. We owe our seniors, our Government retirees, and our military \nretirees nothing less.\n  I am very disturbed by the recent trend of promises broken to Federal \nemployees, and retirees. I believe that promises made should be \npromises kept. When Federal employees signed up for service, they \nagreed to defer some compensation until retirement. They knew that they \nwould make less salary than in the private sector, but they also knew \nthat they would have a stable benefits package of health insurance, \nlife insurance, and retirement. If we delay their COLA's again we are \ntelling them--sorry, we did not exactly tell you the truth when you \nsigned up for service. We are telling them that they cannot rely on the \nbenefits that they planned their retirements around.\n  I do not think this is the way we should run our Government, and it's \nnot the way we should treat our Government retirees. I am working to \nmake sure we honor our commitments, and I urge all my colleagues to do \nthe same and support this resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of legislation \nexpressing the sense of Congress that Federal retirement cost-of-living \nadjustments [COLA's] should not be delayed.\n  I join with my colleagues Senator Sarbanes and Senator Mikulski of \nMaryland, and Senator Akaka of Hawaii in opposing President Clinton's \nfiscal year 1998 budget proposal to delay Federal retiree cost-of-\nliving adjustments [COLA's].\n  It was a matter of great satisfaction to me that the balanced budget \nproposal approved by the Congress in 1995 provided for full CPI-based \nCOLA's for Federal retirees each January through the year 2002. That \nlegislation was vetoed by President Bill Clinton on December 6, 1995.\n  The President has once again indicated his lack of support for COLA \nequity by submitting his fiscal year 1998 budget proposal including \ndelayed Federal retiree COLA's. It is my intention to strenuously \noppose the President's inequitable COLA policy whenever possible. I \nwill be looking to the Federal retiree community for support in this \neffort as the fiscal year 1998 budget process continues.\n  Federal retirees must be treated equitably in terms of cost-of-living \nadjustments [COLA's] and income security. You may recall that in 1986, \nI was an original cosponsor of the COLA equity amendment, landmark \nlegislation which guaranteed equal COLA treatment for all participants \nin Government retirement programs--Social Security, civil service, and \nmilitary. From that point until President Clinton's Deficit Reduction \nAct of 1993, full CPI-based COLA's were provided for all retirees each \nJanuary 1.\n  Regrettably, President Clinton's 1993 budget departed from the policy \nof COLA equity in that a series of COLA deferrals were put in place for \ncivil service, and military retirees. As you know, Social Security \nrecipients were not affected. What you may not know is that last year, \nI sponsored legislation which was enacted into law to at least retain \nCOLA equity for the military and civil service. A damaging proposal had \nsurfaced to further delay civil service COLA's to help fund military \nCOLA's, an unworkable and unfair proposition. I vigorously opposed it \nand fought for its defeat.\n  It is time once again to stand and oppose this COLA inequity for \nFederal retirees. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to \nrestore equity for all retirees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2285-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 8--RELATIVE TO COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. ROBB submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas over the years Federal retirees have been asked to \n     share in efforts to reduce the deficit by delaying their \n     annual cost-of-living adjustment while retirees under other \n     Federal programs who also receive cost-of-living adjustments \n     were not delayed:\n       Whereas it would be inequitable to continue delaying cost-\n     of-living adjustments for Federal retirees when like delays \n     for similarly situated retirees under other systems are not \n     under consideration: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the United States Senate (the House \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that cost-\n     of-living adjustments for Federal retirees should be paid at \n     the same time as other retirees receiving federal cost-of-\n     living adjustments.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I submit a concurrent resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that all Federal annuitants should \nreceive their cost-of-living adjustments at the same time.\n  This resolution is very similar to one submitted by my colleague from \nMaryland, and cosponsored by the other distinguished Senator from \nMaryland and my own esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from \nVirginia. And while I agree with them in spirit, I could not support \nthe wording of their resolution so I am here to offer my own.\n  As we are all aware by now, the President's budget proposal would \ndelay Federal retiree cost-of-living adjustments from their statutory \ndate of January 1 to April 1 until the year 2002. This same budget \nproposal, however, would leave the effective date for COLA's for other \nFederal COLA recipients at January 1, thus singling out Federal \ncivilian retirees as the only Federal beneficiaries with their COLA's \ndelayed. This seems blatantly unfair and violates the principle of COLA \nequity that so many of us have espoused over the years. If the budget \njustification is there to delay one group, then why isn't it there for \nthe others? Conversely, if there is a policy justification for not \ndelaying certain retirees, then why are Federal retirees any different?\n  I could not join my colleagues in cosponsoring their resolution \nbecause I can see a point where a policy decision to treat everyone \nequitably could result in delaying COLA's across all of these programs. \nThat is not what I believe we need to do this year, and I'll continue \nto support efforts to equalize COLA's in January. I could not, however, \nin good conscience cosponsor a resolution which I might contradict at a \nlater point in time.\n  As an alternative, I am offering a concurrent resolution which \nexpresses the sense of the Congress that COLA's for all of these \nFederal annuitants and beneficiaries should be paid at the same time. \nThe resolution deliberately does not state a date certain, simply that \nthe principle of equity between them should prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2286-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2286-S2287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 9--RELATIVE TO COUNTER-DRUG ACTIVITIES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dodd, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nBiden, and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                             S.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is no dispute that a lot of drugs \nreach this country through Mexico. Not we, not the administration, not \nMexico challenge this fact. Just as clearly, we must be concerned about \nthis traffic in illegal drugs. We must be concerned for what this \npoisonous trade is doing to our country and to our kids. We must be \nconcerned for what the drug money that results from this trade is doing \nto build criminal empires able to challenge and corrupt whole \ncountries. For these reasons, the United States and Mexico have a \nshared interest in stopping an illegal trade that is so damaging to \nboth our peoples and our institutions.\n  Mexico acknowledges its responsibility to help in combating the \nproduction and transit of illegal drugs. The production and transit of \nthese drugs are illegal under Mexican law. Mexico is a party to a \nvariety of international agreements to stop these practices. It also \nhas bilateral agreements with the United States to the same effect. \nThus, by solemn agreement, Mexico, along with most others countries, is \ncommitted in principle and practice to taking effective action to stop \nillegal drug production and transit.\n  The United States has a long and deeply intertwined relationship with \nMexico, a relationship that is very important to both countries. \nWhether for good or ill, we are linked to Mexico and Mexico to us. \nThus, we must be particularly thoughtful in how we treat that \nrelationship.\n  The resolution I am offering today does not amend the certification \nprocess. It does not change the President's decision to certify \nMexico--today. What it does do is send a clear, strong message from \nCongress that, while we have heard many promises, we have seen little \naction. And actions--appropriate actions--are paramount. While a change \nin the certification process may be necessary, doing so without taking \nthe time to hold hearings or look at the possible solutions is hasty. \nWe need to consider our next steps carefully.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in the last few days on what to do \nabout Mexico. The discussion has tended to go from conditions that \nproposed to go too far, in my judgment, to approaches that do not go \nfar enough. Clearly, striking the right balance on this important issue \nis not easy. In my view, however, we must lay down benchmarks with a \nclear time frame for deciding what Congress regards as the minimum we \nexpect. After all that has been said and done in the last several days, \nto do less falls shy of doing anything.\n  My resolution affords the Congress the time to make a reasoned \ndetermination about what to do. It requires\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nthe Administration to base its decision next March 1 on a specific set \nof measurable benchmarks. In brief, my proposal requires progress on \nnine specific issues. These include progress on establishing an \ninterdiction network of radars, progress on extradition, progress on \ndealing with corruption, steps to resolve carry weapons, steps to reach \na maritime agreement, and steps to resolve refueling rights.\n  I believe that this approach and these measures give us the \nreasonable terms of reference for how to proceed. This approach gives \nus the opportunity and time to develop the cooperation on the drug \nissue that I believe we all want.\n  This resolution outlines both the concerns that have been expressed \nby Congress and what we expect Mexico to accomplish before March 1, \n1998. Not rhetoric, but actions. We ought to proceed with care before \nwe take steps to fundamentally alter the United States-Mexican \nrelationship. But we must keep faith with our responsibilities to the \npublic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2287-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 11--RELATIVE TO A NUTRITION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources:\n\n                            S.

Res. 63\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, Nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of our society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the Nation;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play a very important role in supporting \n     family efforts by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     our youth play in the present and future of our Nation and to \n     recognize that character is an important part of that future;\n       Whereas in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``Effective character \n     education is based on core ethical values which form the \n     foundation of democratic society.'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \n     and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``The character and \n     conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the 6 core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of October 19 through October 25, \n     1997, as ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to embrace the 6 core elements of character and to \n     observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, both \nRepublican and Democrat--and especially Senator Domenici--in submitting \nthis year's resolution to designate the week of October 19-25 as \nCharacter Counts Week.\n  I believe it is important that we put character back into our \nvocabulary. The American people are crying out for virtue and values--\ncharacter does count and it's essential that we focus our efforts in \nextending this message.\n  The Character Counts movement, which emphasizes trustworthiness, \nrespect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship, seeks to \nteach the core elements of good character to our Nation's young people.\n  One of the most important things we can ever do for our children is \nto help them learn and understand the value of virtue and the \nimportance of character.\n  The Character Counts Coalition is gaining momentum across the \ncountry, and I am proud to be a part of that effort.\n  I think it is clear from the reports every night on the news, that \nsuch a movement has never been more timely. I am proud that the \ncitizens of my home State, Tennessee, have joined the call for \ncharacter renewal.\n  Last year, I spoke of the city of Greeneville, TN, which put together \na character education program featuring 10 community virtues including \nself-respect, respect for others, perseverance, courtesy, fairness and \njustice, responsibility, honesty, kindness, self-discipline, and \ncourage. Since then, Greeneville has extended its character education \nprogram from the city schools to the county school district, too.\n   Mr. President, I am proud that Hamblen County schools in Morristown, \nTN, have adopted the Character\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\nCounts Program with the leadership provided by their school \nsuperintendent, Ernest Walker. In addition, they have a local advisory \nboard composed of parents and leaders involved with youth activities in \ntheir professional and volunteer capacities.\n  Gary Chesney, a school board member has said ``It's good for schools \nto reinforce the job parents do at home with their kids.''\n  I had the opportunity to attend the kickoff event for the Sullivan \nCounty schools' Character Counts Program. Juvenile Court Judge, Steve \nJones, helped initiate this effort and is an outstanding example of how \none person can make a difference in a community. Judge Jones calls \nCharacter Counts ``the ultimate prevention program.''\n  In a way, the Character Counts movement--I believe--is an act of \nrenewal. By welcoming our children into a world of shared values and \nideals, we invite them to continue the task of preserving the \nprinciples we hold most dear.\n   Mr. President, Tennesseans have joined the national effort to save \nour children from the moral decay we see all around us because they \nrecognize that the only way to preserve this great democracy--this \nsystem that requires so much from each of us--and our American way of \nlife, is to instill virtue and moral fortitude in the next generation \nof Americans.\n  This will not happen without our effort, and without the incredible \nleadership of movement like Character Counts. Again, I commend Senator \nDomenici, and all those who are working so hard, to make character \ncount once again in the United States of America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say to my good friend, \nSenator Frist, from Tennessee, I compliment you on your remarks and \nthank you very much for what you are doing. I believe we are on to \nsomething. I believe people in your State and in my State and in every \nState in America are beginning to understand that the time is now--in \nfact, it might be past--for us to empower our teachers and parents once \nagain to inject a very common, ordinary idea into the classroom where \nour children spend much of their time. Students, in an attempt to learn \nhow to be grownup, self-sustaining citizens need to be empowered in our \nclassrooms, in various ways, with character education, plain and \nsimple.\n  Before this movement, many teachers were frightened to talk about \ntrustworthiness, which means you should not lie, which means there is a \nvirtue to honesty, which means that you ought to be loyal. When you \nmake a commitment, you ought to live up to it.\n  Many of our teachers and principals and superintendents were \nfrightened of the notion that we would talk with our young people about \nresponsibility. They thought that was an infringement some way or \nanother on somebody, somewhere, somehow who ought to be teaching this.\n  Respect: Our teachers were frightened with the notion that we ought \nto actually use that word and get our young people to understand the \nword ``respect'' has meaning and to find ways to instill into our \nclassrooms, and thus into our children, the idea of basic human \nrespect, one person for another.\n  Or fairness, or caring, or citizenship.\n  Those six simple words--the six pillars--form the nucleus for what is \ncommonly known as Character Counts that is associated with the \nCharacter Counts Coalition of America.\n  Today, for the fourth year, with the assistance of the original \ncosponsors, Senators Dodd, Cochran, Mikulski, Bennett, Lieberman, \nKempthorne, Dorgan, Frist, and Cleland, and I am sure many others will \njoin us, we are going to adopt soon in this Senate a resolution setting \naside a week in our Nation when our communities, our schools, and our \nbusinesses will participate in character development programs. These \nsix pillars of character that I have just described will come once \nagain to the forefront and will become commonplace words for the \nparticipatory activities of the previous year and with renewed \ncommitments in the future.\n  I am very proud to say that since the Aspen Declaration was adopted--\nan event which occurred sometime in 1990 or thereabouts under the \nauspices of an ethics foundation known as the Josephson Foundation, \nheaded by an ethics professional and lawyer named Michael Josephson--an \nevent attended by about 70 or 80 Americans from all walks of life, \nafter 2 or 3 days of discussions they came forth with these six pillars \nof character and this notion of Character Counts. These six pillars are \nwords that we should get back into our children's vocabulary and into \ntheir daily lives. Since that meeting, the program relies almost \nexclusively on action at the grassroots. There is a modest national \neffort directing this program, but the real efforts are at the \ngrassroots to take those six words and put them into our daily lives.\n  I am proud to say, and perhaps brag, that the State among all the \nStates that is doing the most in this area is the State of New Mexico. \nI took this notion to my home city of Albuquerque and asked Mayor \nChavez to help me, and together we started a Character Counts Program \nfor the city. Believe it or not, it has spread from that community to \nalmost every community in New Mexico. I will soon, just for the record, \nstate the counties, municipalities, and school districts wherein \nCharacter Counts is now a vital part of daily life.\n  Now, fellow Senators, if you want to do something exciting, you get \nCharacter Counts started in your States. You go on one of your recesses \nto visit a grade school, a grade school that has the six pillars of \ncharacter not only in the vocabulary day by day in that school but in \nthe month-by-month selection of one of those words as the word of the \nmonth, whereby all the students practice the word ``responsibility.''\n  Now, they all do it differently. Nobody has a book on this. Nobody \nsays exactly how it ought to be done. But if you want to do something \nexciting, start this program and get your school boards committed, the \nsuperintendents committed, and then get the teachers committed, and you \nwill see something very dramatic happen. The teachers are excited that \nfor once they have been relieved of the fear of discussing good \ncharacter, and you will find that with parent groups and others this is \nbecoming a vital and important part of the daily education life.\n  I frequently go to these schools when they are having their monthly \nassembly. That is how most of them do it. They have a monthly assembly, \nthey commend people, grant certificates, give awards. I am reminded of \none where the grade school was putting on a play with reference to the \nmonthly word which was ``responsibility.'' Something very, very funny \nhappened. They had chosen Little Red Riding Hood as their skit. I had a \nlot of difficulty understanding how that had to do with the word of the \nmonth, ``responsibility.'' As that wonderful skit completed, they \nrecalled how Little Red Riding Hood did not quite follow the \ninstructions that were given to her by her parents and went astray and, \nas a result, all these things happened, including in the one version \nwhere the grandma got eaten up by the wolf. When they finished the \nplay, they all stood up front, and their meaning of ``responsibility'' \nwas that if Little Red Riding Hood had followed the directions given by \nher parents and been more responsive, and thus responsible, then \nnothing bad would have happened to grandma. I am not sure everybody \ntakes the story that way, but in a sense it shows you how young people, \nhelped by adults, can get the message across.\n  I was recently in a community of Clovis, NM. A grade school there has \nbeen heavily involved in Character Counts. As my wife and I walked in \nto visit, they had just recently composed, under the direction of their \nwonderful music teacher, a song with its own melody and its words about \nthe six pillars of character, and everyone in the school would soon \nknow it. Part of the participation in the Character Counts program is \nthis kind of activity.\n  This resolution endorses character education for children. It clearly \nstates that children need, first and foremost, strong and constructive \nguidance from their families. In addition, children's communities--\nincluding schools, youth organizations, religious institutions, and \ncivic groups--play an important supportive role in fostering and \npromoting good character. The resolution identifies six core elements \nof character that transcend cultural, religious, and socioeconomic \ndifferences that are intrinsic to the well-being of\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nindividuals, communities, and society as a whole: Trustworthiness, \nRespect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and Citizenship.\n  These six simple elements are commonly referred to as the six pillars \nof character. They represent the values that define us at our best--the \ncommon ground we can build upon--individual by individual, family by \nfamily, community by community. Arguably, there can be many additions \nto this list. These six, however, are ones that can serve as the core \nelements of good character.\n  Since introduction of the first ``National Character Counts Week'' \nresolution, we are witnessing an enormous groundswell of interest in \nthe issue of character education. Secretary of Education Riley speaks \nto this issue often in his public addresses, and countless other \neducators have programs and training sessions to promote character \ndevelopment activities. More important, however, is the extraordinary \nsupport of character education at the local level. This is where \ncharacter development programs are the best because they involve the \nchildren and the community at large. And, character education is not \njust for children, it is for everyone who cares deeply about the social \nand cultural pulse of this country.\n  As the resolution quotes from the Aspen Declaration: ``The character \nand conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of society; \ntherefore, every adult has the responsibility to teach and model the \ncore ethical values and every social institution has the responsibility \nto promote the development of good character.''\n  From everything I have seen in the State of New Mexico, children and \nadults alike are embracing the six pillars of character. They are \nfinding ways to spread the message--from plays, to musical groups, to \nschool lessons, to printing the messages on billboards. Let me just \nbriefly outline a few of the community initiatives and related \nactivities that support the character-building idea:\n  The Albuquerque Public School (APS) system has endorsed the \nincorporation of character education programs in all of its 119 \nschools. It estimates that between 80-90 percent of its 89,000 students \nhave been introduced to the Character Counts program.\n  The Archdiocese of Santa Fe Catholic Schools system has incorporated \nCharacter Counts programs in all of its 21 schools--from preschool \nthrough seniors in high school--and has interwoven the six pillars of \ncharacter in all of its classes.\n  The New Mexico television and radio media have jointly cooperated to \npromote Character Counts through news coverage, public service \nannouncements, and incorporating Character Counts in most of their \nother public affairs projects. For example, there is now an annual \nCharacter Counts Care Fair each December. All of the television \nstations take part, illustrating their Christmas charitable projects; \nthey used the Character Counts theme in all of their air promotions for \ntheir holiday collection drives. Additionally, the KOB-TV/Hubbard \nFoundation made Character Counts one of the foundation's major grantees \nin 1996, with the award of $5,000 to be used by the Albuquerque \nCharacter Counts Coalition to help promote the character education \ninitiative.\n  In Farmington, the San Juan County Character Counts group has \ntranslated each of the six pillars into the Navajo language and \nproduces posters for the children.\n  In Gallup, the McKinley County School District incorporates Character \nCounts into its schools, and the local Character Counts organization is \ndeveloping a business community program to help support school and \ncivic activities.\n\n  The Las Cruces Character Counts Partnership Taskforce selected three \nstudents for special recognition for their Character Counts \nachievements. The elementary and secondary student winners received a \nday with the mayor and the Governor of New Mexico, and the high school \nwinner received a 3-day visit to Washington, DC, including attendance \nat the inauguration of President Clinton.\n  The New Mexico State Department of Education has initiated plans to \ncommence an overall assessment program to provide basic data to \ndetermine future needs, changes, additions, and modifications of the \nprogram throughout the State.\n  The Lea County Coalition for Character Counts planned an entire week \nof activities for last year's Character Counts Week. It included an art \nshow of children's works at the city library depicting people in \nsituations showing respect and responsibility. It also included a \nchamber of commerce-sponsored hotline that ran public service \nannouncements for Character Counts Week.\n  The Character Counts student council from Gadsden High School formed \ncommittees for cleaning up the school and school grounds, developed \ndoor contests in the school and public announcements at football games \non the six pillar words, and participated in the school talent show \nwith Character Counts lessons.\n  The Roswell Character Counts Partnership Taskforce has initiated \ntraining programs for all youth league program coaches and volunteers \nto include character programs in summer youth activities.\n  T-VI--Technical Vocational Institute--in Albuquerque now offers two \n5-week sessions on Character Counts.\n  I have given but just a fraction of the exciting programs and \ninitiatives under way in the State of New Mexico to promote the six \npillars of good character. Literally thousands and thousands of \nchildren and families, schools, youth organizations and businesses are \ninvolved in these endeavors. Simply put, the people of the State have \nsaid it is OK to talk about and practice the traits of trustworthiness, \nrespect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.\n  Practicing the principles of character goes beyond the schools too. \nIn Albuquerque, and now other communities are picking up the idea, an \nentirely new program is being launched: Character Counts in the \nWorkplace, sponsored by regional chambers of commerce. The stated goal \nof this program is to put the six pillars of character into the \nworkplace ``so we can count on one another to make principle-based \ndecisions rather than merely expedient ones throughout the New Mexico \nbusiness community.'' As one New Mexican said, ``People may not believe \nwhat you say, but they do believe what you do.''\n  Practicing the principles of good character is for everyone. I am \nimmensely proud of what the people of New Mexico have done in 4 short \nyears to awaken one another to the benefits of practicing good \ncharacter traits. It is an effort that has brought all ages of people \ntogether, in all professions, to work a little harder to bring civility \nin our relationships with one another.\n  I would like to close with some words from His Excellency, Michael J. \nSheehan, Archbishop of Santa Fe, in his letter endorsing the Character \nCounts program in the 21 Catholic schools in the Santa Fe Archdiocese:\n\n       Our Catholic schools assist parents in their efforts to \n     help their children understand that God commands us to be \n     honest, just, truthful, faithful, kind, generous, and \n     forgiving. Character Counts provides the common language for \n     citizens of all ages and all walks of life. Every educator \n     knows the key to an effective education is consistency and \n     repetition--from the pulpit to the boardroom to the \n     playground. Let us be consistent with our brothers and \n     sisters in our Nation's community by integrating this common \n     language into our everyday encounters with our children, our \n     families, our colleagues.\n\n  Mr. President, National Character Counts Week represents an important \ntime to set aside and observe the thousands of local programs and \nindividuals who believe we can endorse and practice six pillars of good \ncharacter. It is families, schools, civic and social organizations, \nlocal and State governments, businesses, and ordinary citizens who are \nparticipating in this movement. We, too, can be a part of this movement \nby supporting this resolution.\n  So, I could not be more pleased, even thrilled at what is happening \nin my State. I am hopeful within a couple of years we will be able to \nmeasure the positive consequences that we think are going to flow from \nbuilding these six words into the everyday vocabulary of our children, \nincorporating them just in the ordinary teaching every day so that \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and \ncitizenship might become a way of life. If\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\never we needed change in that direction and help in promulgating \ncharacter, it is now. In fact, it is long past due.\n  I am very hopeful that we are giving parents, children, teachers and \nthe entire community a vehicle to promote better character and build \ncharacter around these six very, very acceptable words that I have \nrepeated at least once or twice--three times here on the floor. That is \nthe essence of the Character Counts Program. Get these six pillars into \nthe classroom, into the daily vocabulary, into the teaching--those ways \nthat are used to teach our young people. And then use innovation and \ncreativity to instill them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us again this year in cosponsoring and \nadopting ``National Character Counts Week.'' Thank you.\n  I know other Senators are waiting to be heard, so I will yield \nespecially to my friend who is a cosponsor and one of the early \nfounders of this coalition in the Senate, the distinguished Senator \nBennett from the State of Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from New Mexico \nnot only for his statement here today but for his leadership on this \nissue. I remember, when he first called me several Congresses ago and \nsaid he was getting involved in this and would I be interested in \nhelping him, I was delighted to do what I could to help him because \nwhen the Senator from New Mexico leads out, helping is always pretty \neasy. With him as the leader, things always move well and strongly and \nin the right direction.\n  I can report that in the State of Utah we have not been as focused on \nthe six pillars of character as they have been in the State of New \nMexico, but we have not been lax in this particular area.\n  1996 was Utah's centennial year, 100 years since we had achieved \nstatehood, and the Governor of Utah, in the spirit of the Character \nCounts initiative, called for a discussion of values. He created the \nGovernors Commission on Centennial Values. As a result of that creation \nand the discussion that occurred, we now have in Utah 12 values in \ncommon that we talk about. I will read them and get them into the \nRecord so we can understand how this effort to get character into the \nschool curriculum and into the lives of our young people is going \nforward all across the country.\n  In Utah we value families. We value a commitment to our community and \ncountry. We value integrity. We value honesty. We value respect for \nself and others. We value lifelong learning. We value caring service. \nWe value work. We value personal responsibility. We value respect for \nthe rule of law. We value justice, fairness and freedoms, and we value \nrespect for the environment.\n  Those are the 12 values that came out of the Governor's Centennial \nCommission, and I believe they are certainly compatible with the six \npillars of character that are supported by the Character Counts \ncoalition. Perhaps now that our centennial is past and we are into \n1997, we can meld these two efforts and get the Character Counts \ncurriculum into the schools in the manner that the Senator from New \nMexico has done so well in his own State.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to be one of the cosponsors of this \neffort, to join with my friend from New Mexico and to recognize, once \nagain, his leadership and service in this because this has been, for \nhim, not just something to make a speech about on the Senate floor and \nthen forget; it has been something that he has pursued with vigor in \nhis own State and kept alive on the part of the rest of us, who joined \nwith him in the initial effort.\n\n  I hope that all Senators will recognize that this is not just \nmotherhood and apple pie, a quick thing to talk about and then move on. \n``Our Nation is indeed at risk,'' to use the phrase that came out of \nthe educational effort done during the Presidency of President Reagan, \nand headed by an educator from Utah, Terence Bell. It is at risk not \nonly because our young people have deficiencies in their education in \ntechnical skills, it is at risk because there are deficiencies of the \nmoral education of our young people. We have to have something like \nCharacter Counts to help us move in the direction of reducing that \nrisk. I am honored to be a part of the effort and pledge that I will do \nwhat I can to see to it that the Senator from New Mexico and the others \nin this program are given the support they need.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague from \nNew Mexico. I congratulate him for this resolution focusing on \ncharacter. He has been a leader since his election in 1972. Again, he \nhas demonstrated that today with this resolution on character. I am \npleased to join as a cosponsor of the resolution. It is an effort to \nfocus national attention on values and morality, and to try to instill \nin our young people and our older people, as well, a sense that \ncharacter does count.\n  This is in line with legislation that Senator Santorum and I have \nintroduced on abstinence. I have found that the issue of abortion, the \npro-life/pro-choice controversy, is the most divisive issue facing this \ncountry since slavery, and that one way to try to pull the country \ntogether is to focus on issues where we all agree. When you talk about \npremarital sex among teenagers, leading to unintended pregnancies, and \ntherefore ultimately abortions, we can all agree that such behavior \nmust be discouraged. That is an effort in a specific, targeted way to \ntry to develop and promote character. So I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague on that important subject.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Domenici in cosponsoring a resolution to designate a \nweek in October as ``National Character Counts Week.''\n  This will mark the fourth consecutive year that we have considered \nsuch a resolution to honor the Character Counts movement. It is small \ngesture, but a meaningful one all the same. By recognizing this \nprogram, Congress is making an important statement about both the value \nof character education and the state of our values. We are saying \naffirmatively that our public schools can and must play a central role \nin shaping the character and values of our children. And we are saying \nthat this kind of commitment, a commitment to the principles \nundergirding the Character Counts Program, is needed now more than \never.\n  The reality, Mr. President, is that the state of our values is not \nwell. The American people are deeply concerned about the abundant \nevidence they see of a real moral breakdown in our society--so much so \nthat polls taken over the last few years routinely show that the public \nis more worried about the country's moral decline than its economic \ndecline.\n  What's driving this concern, which many of us in this Chamber share, \nis an understanding that our growing inability to make moral \ndistinctions, to draw lines about right and wrong and set boundaries \nabout what is acceptable behavior, is having real consequences. We are \nrecognizing that this moral breakdown is contributing to and \nexacerbating some of our society's most profound social ills, such as \nthe rising tide of ever more random and vicious violence committed by \never more younger killers, the disintegration of the family, the crisis \nof teenage illegitimacy, the coarsening of our culture, and the loss of \ncivility in our polity and our everyday lives.\n  More and more these days there is a sense that our country is \nspiraling out of control, and at the root of that feeling is what might \nbe called a values vacuum. The traditional transmitters of values that \nwe have depended on for generations to build character and bind our \nmoral safety net have lost much of their power. One of those \ntransmitters is the family, which is under enormous economic pressure \nthese days and is prey to divorce and other forms of breakdown. Another \ntransmitter is the community and the loose connection of local civic \ninstitutions we refer to as civil society, which has weakened to the \npoint that an entire movement has sprung up to renew it.\n  Then there are our public schools. For generations the public school \nsystem was the backbone of our democracy, where children were not just \ntaught what is good grammar but what it means to be a good citizen, and \nwhere children of all backgrounds were versed in a common set of core \nvalues. But in recent years public schools have increasingly lost that \nmission, and too often shied away from questions of values and the \nformation of character. In\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\nthe eyes of many families, some schools might as well had signs out \nfront declaring them value-neutral zones.\n  What is perhaps most disturbing about this trend is that the values \nvacuum the schools have helped create is being filled more and more \nthese days by the electronic media and the frequently destructive \nmessages it is bombarding our children with. The collective force of \ntelevision, movies, music, and video games is so influential that many \nparents I talk to feel as if they are in a competition with the culture \nto raise their children and give them strong values. The character \ntraits they are trying to instill in their children are being openly \ncontradicted by the bulk of the messages kids are receiving about the \nacceptability and the inconsequentiality of casual sex, the contempt \nfor all forms of authority, and the appropriateness of settling a \ndispute by putting a bullet through the other person's temple. The \nresult is the prevalence of what one leading expert on child \ndevelopment calls the culture of disrespect.\n  The media's inability to make moral distinctions and draw lines about \nright and wrong makes it all the more important for us to strengthen \nour traditional values transmitters. And that is why the Character \nCounts movement deserves all the support we can provide. Rebuilding our \nfamilies and our communities will be a long, painstaking process. But \nreviving the role of schools in helping our children learn about the \nfundamentals of character is a challenge we can meet easily and \nquickly.\n\n  In fact, the Character Counts program has already done the hard part, \nidentifying the core values and principles that we can all agree that \nwe want our schools to instill and reinforce in our children. The \nquestion of whose values? that is often asked has been answered, with a \nconsensus behind our values--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, \nfairness, caring for others, and citizenship.\n  I am heartened to know that the Character Counts program is rapidly \nspreading through communities across the country, and I am particularly \nproud that my State of Connecticut has made a long-term commitment to \nbring character education into every school district in the State. With \nthe aid of a $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Education last \nyear, the State took the first major step toward that goal by selecting \nfour communities for funding to introduce the Character Counts Program \non a districtwide basis.\n  Some Connecticut schools have already embraced this program on their \nown, and I can report to my colleagues that it is bearing fruit. Let me \noffer one compelling example. Last year a nine-year-old from the town \nof Torrington named Joshua Dy found an envelope on the ground that \ncontained three $100 bills. Joshua said he initially thought of keeping \nthe money for himself, but he then thought of what he learned in \nCharacter Counts at the Southwest School and from his father about \nhonesty and integrity, and decided the right thing would be to turn the \nmoney over to the police. Joshua was rewarded for his honesty when the \npolice returned the money to him after no one claimed it and when \nPresident Clinton saluted his good character with a letter of \ncongratulations.\n  Mr. President, I would encourage my colleagues to find their own ways \nto reward and recognize the good deeds that are germinating from the \nseeds of Character Counts. A good place to start is with this \nresolution, which will help raise public awareness of this valuable \nvalues program and make Character Counts really count. Let me close by \npraising Senator Domenici for his leadership on this issue, and by \nasking that my remarks be placed in the appropriate place in the Record \nto accompany the Character Counts resolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico and a bipartisan group of my colleagues in co-\nsponsoring this Senate resolution designating October 19-25 as \n``National Character Counts Week.''\n  This morning, like every morning before it and every morning to come, \nyoung Americans are headed off to learn their three ``R's''--reading, \nwriting, and arithmetic--in our Nation's schools. But as we all know, \nthe school day involves more than just the transmission of facts or the \nrelaying of concepts. It's also about character. In the best classrooms \nin America our children are given the opportunity to learn and practice \nbasic character traits such as sharing, cooperation, and respect.\n  The Character Counts initiative calls on all Americans to embrace the \ndevelopment of six attributes--trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship--as a fundamental aspect \nof our children's education and as a critically important means of \nstrengthening our Nation. The lessons our young people learn as \nchildren are the ones that will stay with them the rest of their lives. \nAs Eleanor Roosevelt once said: ``Character building begins in our \ninfancy, and continues until death.''\n  We live in a time when teenage pregnancy and juvenile crime are \nspiraling out of control. A recent poll suggests that two-thirds of \nAmericans believe most people can't be trusted, half say most people \nwould cheat others if they could and in the end are only looking out \nfor themselves. These statistics and the seeming erosion in the basic \nnorms of civility, even among our Nation's children, are ample evidence \nof the need for programs that promote character development.\n  No one would argue that Character Counts is a panacea for these \ncomplex problems. First and foremost, we need better education, \nstronger families, and healthy doses of individual responsibility.\n  Clearly the primary obligation for the building of our children's \nvalues and belief systems lies with our Nation's families. There is \nonly so much government can and should do. But, with parents being \nforced to spend more and more time out of the house, our Nation's \nschools can and should do everything they can to work with parents in \nhelping to build character among America's children.\n  There is nothing inappropriate or heavyhanded about teaching \ncharacter in our schools. These programs don't impose morality or any \none group's world view. These programs teach honesty, courage, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and loyalty, attributes \nthat I believe all Americans agree upon.\n  These principles transcend religion, race, philosophy, and even \npolitical affiliation. For those Americans who share the goal of \nenergizing our democracy and strengthening our Nation's character these \ninitiatives are simply common sense.\n  What's more, these programs garner tangible benefits. In Connecticut, \nthe Southwest Elementary School in Torrington implemented a character \neducation program in September of last year and has witnessed positive \neffects as a result of its efforts. Attendance is up, students are more \nrespectful toward their teachers, and school administrators are \nconvinced that Character Counts is responsible. The school engages \nparents in the effort, who along with educators and the students \nthemselves, love the program.\n  Additionally, this year in Connecticut, the Leadership Committee of \nCharacter Counts will undertake a comprehensive training program to \nqualify 35 instructors to educate students about the importance of \nstrength of character. These instructors will bring the ideals stressed \nby Character Counts directly to the students of Connecticut, reaching \n100,000 students by year's end. While character education may not be a \nmagical solution to all of America's problems, it represents a positive \neffort to make a real difference in our children's lives. Character \ndevelopment programs for our children strengthen our lives, our \ncommunities, and our Nation as a whole.\n  I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for all of his work \nin this area. And I invite all my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to join us in supporting character education as a vital means of \nmolding better individuals, strengthening families, and creating a \nresponsible American citizenry.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the National Character Counts Week resolution submitted by \nmy esteemed colleague, Senator Domenici. I have cosponsored similar \nresolutions for the past 3 years, and am honored to\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nhave the opportunity to do so again this year.\n  At a time when we are exposed to a constant stream of violence, \nprofanity, and immorality--both through the media and in every day \nlife--the issue of character is of vital importance. Those of us in \nthis Chamber spend a great deal of time trying to develop ways to \nimprove the Nation. I can think of few things we could do to better \nachieve this goal than to emphasize the importance of character to \nyounger generations.\n  Those of us in positions of leadership, especially in the Government, \nhave a special duty when it comes to character. Whether we realize it \nor not, we are role models and we have a duty to demonstrate those same \nattributes of character--trustworthiness, respect, re- sponsibility, \njustice and fairness, caring, and civic virtue and citizenship--which \nNational Character Counts Week highlights. Unfortunately, far too many \nAmericans have come to believe, wrongly in most cases, that these \nqualities no longer exist in the Government. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to begin today to make that extra effort to show the people \nwe serve that the faith they demonstrated when they voted for us has \nnot been misplaced. In the words of President George Washington, ``Let \nus raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair.''\n  Mr. President, I recently chaired an Armed Services Personnel \nSubcommittee hearing in which the issue of character was prominent. \nDuring the hearing I was deeply disturbed to hear that the lack of \ncharacter, values, and discipline is making it harder and harder for \nthe Armed Forces to recruit the high quality people we need to serve in \nour military. Testimony supplied at the hearing indicated that an ever-\nincreasing number of potential recruits are unacceptable, in terms of \nethics, education, and values, for the armed services. I am not talking \nabout difficult kids who simply lack discipline, the military has \nalways done a fine job handling those recruits. I am talking about \nyoung people who have no respect for authority, no respect for their \npeers, no respect for our society, and often, no respect for \nthemselves. As a result, they lack basic values such as compassion, \nhonesty, and integrity. Our military commanders cannot be expected to \ninstill those kind of values in individuals who have lacked them \nthroughout their entire lives. That process must begin at birth and in \nthe home.\n  Mr. President, with this resolution, we are taking a step forward in \ntrying to teach younger generations about the importance of character. \nI am pleased to note that schools, churches, and civic organizations \naround the Nation are also seizing the initiative on this important \nissue. But our efforts, whether on the national or local level, must \nnot end here. Actually, to be more precise, our efforts must not begin \nhere. While there are certainly things we can do as a government, or as \na community, to teach character to young people, these lessons must \nbegin at home. We cannot hope to improve the overall character of the \nNation unless the fundamental values described in National Character \nCounts Week are instilled in the home. No amount of moral instruction \nfrom outside the home can replace the guidance of a loving and \nsupportive family.\n  Recognizing a national week to stress the importance of character is \nbut a small step in addressing the crisis of ethics the Nation faces. \nAt the same time, it is an important step which I believe all of us \nshould support. I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his \ncontinued leadership on National Character Counts Week, and urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2288-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on rules and administration\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, as a nation we have a deep \ncommitment to a decent home and suitable living environment for every \nAmerican family. Housing is the cornerstone for healthy communities, a \nvibrant economy, and a competitive nation. Although we have \nsignificantly improved housing conditions in the last 60 years, we \nstill have a long way to go. The latest figures in HUD's Report to \nCongress on the worst case housing needs estimate that 5.3 million very \nlow-income renter households pay more than half of their income in rent \nor live in poor-quality housing. They receive no help. Many of those \npeople are elderly or people with disabilities.\n  Today, four of the leading non-profit affordable housing producers--\nThe Enterprise Foundation, LISC--the Local Initiatives Support Corp.-- \nHabitat for Humanity International, and the National Neighborworks \nNetwork--are committing to a $13 billion investment in low-income \ncommunities across the country over the next 4 years. Each have built \nsuccessful partnerships, leveraging both public and private resources. \nThese partnerships have been critical in supporting local nonprofits to \nnot only build affordable housing but also provide services and \nencourage economic development to revitalize these neighborhoods. The \nsuccess of these organizations reverberates in low- and moderate-income \ncommunities across the country as they address our widespread \naffordable housing needs. Their work is supported by Federal programs \nsuch as HOME, the Community Development Block Grant, and the Low-Income \nHousing Tax Credit.\n  The Enterprise Foundation, based in Columbia, MD, is a true success \nstory in the affordable housing industry. Founded by Jim Rouse in 1982, \nEnterprise has raised and committed more than $1.8 billion in grants, \nloans, and equity to finance the development of 61,000 affordable \nhomes. They have a number of initiatives including the Enterprise \nSocial Investment Corp. [EISC] which works with 176 major American \ncorporations to help them find new ways to invest in affordable \nhousing. Much of this activity has been made possible by the low-income \nhousing tax credit. In addition, Enterprise, along with Fannie Mae, has \ncreated the Cornerstone Housing Corp., a nonprofit that buys and \npreserves large blocks of multifamily rental housing for low-income \nfamilies. Enterprise also runs an intensive training program to assist \nnonprofit organizations in increasing their technical and management \nabilities.\n\n  Habitat for Humanity International, since 1976, has provided \napproximately 55,000 homes through 1,336 local affiliates across the \ncountry. Using volunteer labor and tax-deductible donations, Habitat \nbuilds new homes and rehabilitates existing homes. An average three-\nbedroom Habitat home costs approximately $38,300, making homeownership \nfor many low-income families a reality.\n  The Local Initiatives Support Corporation, established in 1979, \nsupports 1,400 community development corporations throughout the \ncountry. This partnership has created over 64,000 homes and 9.6 million \nsquare feet of commercial and industrial space.\n  Neighborworks is a network of local resident-led partnerships \nsupported by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a public \nnonprofit chartered by Congress in 1978. The Neighborworks Network has \nproduced 38,831 units of affordable housing since its inception and in \nthe last 5 years has leveraged $1.5 billion in investment within \ncommunities.\n  In Maryland, I have seen these partnerships work. The Enterprise \nFoundation, along with its subsidiaries, have developed more than 3,700 \nunits of affordable housing and have committed more than $12.3 million \nin loans and $90.3 million in equity. In Sandtown-Winchester, \nEnterprise's Neighborhood Transformation Program has rebuilt more than \n700 abandoned homes through a comprehensive community revitalization \neffort that works in partnership with local residents and the city of \nBaltimore. Neighborworks has three neighborhood housing services \naffiliates in Maryland--in Baltimore, Salisbury, and Cumberland. \nBetween 1994 and 1996 alone these three Neighborworks affiliates \nproduced over 600 units of affordable housing and leveraged over $24 \nmillion in investments within these Maryland communities. Habitat for \nHumanity has 16 affiliates in Maryland which have built 89 new homes \nand rehabilitated another 227 homes.\n\n  Today these four organizations are challenging themselves and \nchallenging us to continue our successful partnerships through the \nCommunity Development Block Grant, HOME, and the Low-Income Housing Tax \nCredit. These are programs I have supported and programs which have \nbeen critical in the production of affordable housing. The HOME \nInvestment Partnership, for example, is an initiative I championed. \nHOME provides flexible grants to States and units of general government \nto implement local housing strategies designed to increase \nhomeownership for low-income people. By requiring a 25 percent match, \nHOME encourages the public-private partnerships that have proven so \nsuccessful in the production of affordable housing.\n  Mr. President, I commend the work of these organizations and applaud \nEnterprise, LISC, Habitat, and Neighborworks for their commitment to \ninvest $13 billion in our low-income communities. I fully support our \ncontinued role in this effective and successful partnership through \nFederal programs like HOME, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and the \nCommunity Development Block Grant and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame. This is an excellent step in the right direction, and I am \npleased to have the opportunity to highlight the work of these \norganizations and the Federal programs that support them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2294-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2294-S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  A PROMISING DAY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OUR NATION'S COMMUNITIES\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today four of this Nation's most \nremarkable nonprofit organizations are announcing the largest private \nsector investment in our Nation's affordable housing of all time. The \nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, the \nEnterprise Foundation and the National NeighborWorks Network have \njoined together and pledged to create 13 billion dollars' worth of \nhousing over the next 4 years. This investment in\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\nour Nation's most economically challenged areas is testament to the \ndedication and commitment of these organizations to our inner cities \nand impoverished rural areas. Theirs is a visionary and comprehensive \nplan to leverage renewal--this unprecedented investment not only will \ncreate nearly 200,000 affordable homes but also rebuild entire \ncommunities once left to waste.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Housing Subcommittee, I am often privy \nto some of the most distressing cases of deprivation experienced by \nsome of our fellow citizens. Joblessness, homelessness, lack of medical \ncare, crumbling schools, rising cases of AIDS and other infectious \ndiseases, and crime-riddled streets--those are too often the \ntouchstones in the mosaic of urban America. However, today, the news is \nquite different as this pledge will stimulate tens of billions of \ndollars in additional private investment which in turn will create tens \nof thousands of jobs and new businesses in nearly 2,500 communities \nacross the Nation.\n  And, Mr. President, some of those communities are located in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. This investment will further strengthen \nthe efforts of the Urban Edge Community Development Corp. in Jamaica \nPlain and the Codman Square Community Development Corp., to name just \ntwo of the many renewal success stories in Massachusetts. Mr. \nPresident, my home State enjoys a well-deserved reputation as the \nincubator of the Nation's most sophisticated, mature and comprehensive \napproaches to development in which housing is the cornerstone but the \nprovision of goods and services and jobs forms the foundation. For many \nyears, local community-based development groups and affordable housing \nadvocates have worked with corporations and philanthropies like Bank \nBoston, Polaroid, the Boston Foundation, and the Hyams Foundation to \ngenerate and dedicate millions of dollars to urban renewal.\n  Mr. President, I salute the commitment embodied in this pledge and I \nrecognize that the challenge to match this dedication is ours. In these \ntough budgetary times, we must not allow important programs which \nstimulate economic and community renewal to wither in the sometimes \nblinding devotional light of the year 2002. I have stood in this \nChamber on many occasions and discussed the importance of YouthBuild, \nCDBG's, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, the Housing Preservation \nProgram, and the Community Reinvestment Act. And today I stand resolute \nto bolster the Federal role in community-based development. Clearly, \nour national democracy is strengthened through this type of public-\nprivate partnership and I will redouble my efforts to assist community \nand local organizations which are making a vital and needed difference \nin towns and cities throughout our Nation.\n  This is a day of good news, hope, and promise, Mr. President. Let us \nrespond to the challenge with commensurate dedication to our Nation's \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2294-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE MEDICARE CANCER CLINICAL TRIAL ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nfor the Medicare Cancer Clinical Trial Act of 1997. This bill will \nprovide important assistance to the national battle against cancer.\n  In so many ways, this disease brutally impacts the lives of millions \nof Americans and their families. In my State of Michigan, for example, \nover 50,000 residents were diagnosed with cancer last year alone. Half \nof all those diagnosed with cancer are Medicare beneficiaries, who also \naccount for 60 percent of all cancer deaths.\n  One of the most effective weapons available in this war on cancer is \nresearch. Each year, scientists and medical clinicians provide valuable \ninsights about the causes of various cancers as well as new therapies \nto treat them. The legislation I endorse today will provide cancer \npatients with greater access to clinical trials. One of the most \nimportant benefits of these particular trials is determining the \neffects of treatments on persons over the age of 65. Should these \nexperimental therapies prove successful, this legislation will offer \nFederal agencies information to help them determine whether or not \nthese treatments should be expanded to include all Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  In my opinion, Michigan and the rest of the Nation can wait no longer \nto determine the applicability of these potentially groundbreaking \ntreatments. I believe that America's elderly population should be given \nevery means available to wage a war on cancer in which they can be the \nvictors. In addition, this Nation should have the opportunity to \nutilize those treatments that are cost-effective and successful in \ntreating the millions of Americans affected by cancer every year.\n  For these reasons, I am very proud to cosponsor this legislation and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2295-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CRUZ OLAGUE\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nNevada's leaders and activists, Cruz Olague. On March 15, 1997, the Los \nAmigos de Cruz Olague will honor former Mayor Cruz Olague--a fine \nArizonan and Nevadan--at their first testimonial dinner. I have known \nCruz for many years, and he is truly deserving of this honor.\n  Born February 26, 1934, in Winslow, AZ, Cruz later moved to \nHenderson, NV after serving 4 years in the U.S. Navy. Afterward, he \nworked as an office manager in a supermarket while completing his \naccounting studies at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.\n  In 1971, Cruz was persuaded to run for the Henderson City Council. \nAfter receiving 53 percent of the popular vote in the primary, a \ngeneral election was deemed unnecessary and Cruz was declared the \nwinner. This was the first and only time such an event has occurred in \nthe history of Nevada local politics. Moreover, Cruz won this seat on \nthe City Council with a campaign budget of a mere $3,000. Following \nthis tremendous feat, Mr. Olague went on to become a popular mayor of \nHenderson, and served in this capacity until 1975.\n  Cruz is a man with deep religious convictions and a remarkably calm \ndemeanor. Even when driving home a contentious point, he always \nmaintains a gentleman's dignity and an even temperament. With his \nkindness, Cruz easily won people over. Consequently, it came as no \nsurprise when he was selected Mayor of the Year in 1974.\n  This prominent member of the Hispanic community has long believed \nthat our racial and ethnic diversity is our Nation's greatest strength. \nCruz Olague has spent his life tirelessly fighting on behalf of \nminorities, the elderly, and the poor. He has used his abilities for \nthose who often lack a voice in our society. The work of this \noutstanding citizen has left a lasting impact on the lives of many \nNevadans.\n  Across southern Nevada, Cruz Olague will always be known as an \nindividual of great integrity and conviction with a passion for good \ngovernment. For 27 years, it has been a privilege to call Cruz Olague a \nfriend. It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to Cruz, and \ncongratulate him on this special honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2295-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2295-S2296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SECRETARY PENA'S NOMINATION\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to \nexpress my concern with the Department of Energy's handling of the \nappliance energy efficiency standards regulations. My concerns \nregarding this matter are well known. In the last Congress, I authored \nan amendment to impose a 1-year moratorium on new DOE appliance \nstandards rulemaking activities. That action became necessary because \nit was clear that DOE's energy efficiency standards program was placing \njobs and investment in the manufacturing industry at risk, not just in \nKentucky, but in other States around the Nation.\n  DOE's response to the moratorium was an interpretive rule that was \ndesigned to institutionalize a variety of reforms. While I commend DOE \nfor identifying and correcting their own shortcomings, DOE's first test \nis before us now in the form of new energy efficiency standards for \nrefrigerators. In my estimation, DOE deserves a failing grade.\n  I have raised the refrigerator standards issue with Secretary Pena \nduring his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy Committee, but \nI have not received a satisfactory answer to my questions. While I \nrealize Secretary Pena did not create this controversy,\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\nCongress will hold Secretary Pena responsible for the outcome and the \nconsequences of this rulemaking.\n  Mr. President, I am disturbed by the fact that DOE has changed its \nposition outlined in the August 1996, notice of proposed rulemaking, \nwhich established a 2003 standard as its preferred option. This option \nwas supported by manufacturers. DOE has since changed its position and \nnow supports implementing the new standards for refrigerators in the \nyear 2000. As a result of this flip-flop, manufacturers will be \nrequired to make costly investments twice--once to comply with the DOE \nenergy standards in 2000, and again when regulations mandate the \nelimination of HCFC insulation as required in the year 2003.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that these burdensome and \nduplicative regulations are not necessary. Once it was determined that \nDOE was not going to abide by its preferred option, manufacturers \noffered a good-faith compromise that would set a more stringent level \nof energy savings than proposed by DOE to be implemented in 2003. This \nproposal would save more energy while minimizing the reengineering and \nregulatory burden, which will add unnecessary costs to manufacturers \nand consumers.\n  What is more disturbing is that DOE has ignored its own contractor's \nanalysis in setting these standards. I am informed that the analysis by \nLawrence Berkeley Laboratories confirms that the energy savings \nattributable to the 2003 standard would exceed the benefits of the 2000 \nstandards. Unfortunately, DOE has chosen to ignore this analysis and \nnot include it in establishing these standards.\n  Mr. President, this is not the only procedural defect in DOE's \nproposed rule. The Department has failed to comply with the \nrequirements of law regarding the Department of Justice's role in this \nrulemaking. DOE has failed to obtain an updated competitive impact \ndetermination from the Department of Justice that takes into account \nnew evidence of the potential impact of the proposed rule. I believe \nsuch analysis is essential to maintaining a competitive marketplace.\n  Mr. President, considering the latest analysis by DOE's own \ncontractor, it has become apparent to me that this battle is no longer \nabout securing the greatest energy savings. Rather, it seems this is \nabout punishing manufacturers more than a legitimate or responsible \nbasis for regulation. The only regulation that makes sense is one that \ntakes effect in 2003.\n  This controversy raises fundamental questions about whether DOE will \nfaithfully administer the appliance standards program as currently \nauthorized. I will continue to follow this matter very closely and keep \nmy legislative option open.\n  I urge Secretary Pena to assume responsibility for assuring that the \nlaw is properly applied and the correct decision reached.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2295-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONFIRMATION OF FEDERICO PENA TO BE SECRETARY OF ENERGY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to \nconfirm Federico Pena to be Secretary of Energy. As a member of the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I have met with \nSecretary Pena and discussed issues of importance to Washington State, \nthe Northwest, and the Nation. I understand that some Senators had \nreservations about Secretary Pena because he does not have a great deal \nof experience on energy related issues. I do not hold this same \nreservation. I do not necessarily view Secretary Pena's lack of \nexpertise on energy issues as a liability, but rather as an opportunity \nto educate the new Secretary on issues important to the people of \nWashington State and the region.\n  Two issues immediately come to mind--Hanford and electricity \nderegulation.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Pena on the many challenges \nfacing the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the southeastern part of my \nState. While there are many difficult issues facing Hanford, there are \nalso many exciting opportunities.\n  One of these opportunities is the Fast Flux Test Facility [FFTF]. \nFFTF is a valuable asset for our national security interests and a \npotential cure for diseases and other medical conditions. Scientists \nbelieve FFTF can begin producing tritium--an essential part of our \nnuclear deterrent--within 5 years. Moreover, nearly 70 of our Nation's \nleading medical researchers have validated claims that FFTF is \nessential to the production of medical isotopes which could one day be \na valuable weapon in the fight against cancer.\n  FFTF is by no means the only important issue that Secretary Pena will \nface at Hanford in his new position. In addition, I look forward to \nworking with him on maintaining an adequate budget to meet the site's \ncleanup mission.\n  It's no secret that Hanford has been one of the most contaminated \nsites owned by the Federal Government. Despite the enormity of the \ncleanup, I believe we are making real progress due in large part to the \nextraordinary efforts and talents of the people who work at the site \nand make up the surrounding Hanford communities.\n  The DOE, in coordination with Congress, is also playing an important \nrole prioritizing, streamlining, and increasing efficiency at Hanford, \nI look foward to continuing my already strong working relationship with \nSecretary Pena in his new role to preserve continuity in funding at \nHanford and other DOE sites.\n  On the subject of electricity deregulation, it is critical that \nSecretary Pena listen and work closely with the Northwest congressional \ndelegation on electricity issues unique to the Northwest. The Northwest \nhas its own peculiar set of challenges--namely the ability of the \nBonneville Power Administration to market its power while paying nearly \n$500 million in annual fish and wildlife costs. Secretary Pena and I \nhave discussed these issues and he has committed to work with the \nNorthwest members of the Senate Energy Committee on these difficult \nNorthwest issues. I intend to take Secretary Pena up on his offer, and \nhope that together with my Northwest colleagues that we can work on \nthese issues critical to Northwest ratepayers, an the \nenvironment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2296-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 22\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \nagreement would allow the Senate to begin debate on this very important \njoint resolution regarding the appointment of an independent counsel at \n10 a.m., on Friday. It is my understanding that the Democratic leader \nis discussing what amendments would be offered to this resolution. \nPerhaps he is meeting on that at this time. When the Senate resumes its \nconsideration, then, on Monday, we would begin to take up the \namendments, if any. In addition, it is my hope that, prior to the close \nof business on Friday, I will be able to inform the Senate as to not \nonly the number of amendments we can expect, again, if any, on the \nother side of the aisle, but also I will be able to set a consent time \nfor final passage, potentially as early as Wednesday of next week. It \nis our hope that we can get a vote on the independent counsel issue by \nWednesday of next week. Then we will be able, on Wednesday afternoon or \nThursday, to deal with the Mexico certification issue, assuming we have\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nthat worked out in a way we would want to bring it to the floor at that \ntime.\n  Again, I am still discussing that with the Democratic leader, and \nthere is communication from both sides of the aisle with the \nadministration. So we don't know yet if that will happen, or what form \nit will be in. I look forward to further discussions with the minority \nleader on this issue. I hope it will not be necessary to file a cloture \nmotion on this resolution in order to bring it to conclusion by mid-\nweek. I haven't had an indication that that will be the case. I am \nthankful for the cooperation we have had in getting this agreement \nworked out.\n  In light of this agreement, and the agreement reached earlier calling \nfor a vote on the constitutional amendment for campaign expenditures at \n2:45 Tuesday, I am pleased to announce there will be no votes during \nFriday's or Monday's session of the Senate. The next vote will occur \n2:45 Tuesday, March 18.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/13/senate-section/article/S2296-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
