Help us to communicate respect for the dignity of other people. \nMay we respect their gifts and talents, and encourage them to be all \nthat You created them to be. Make us defenders of the rights of people \nto be distinctive, to honor differences of race and religious \npractices.\n  Lord, we also pray for the character pillar of respect to be \nexpressed in the way we live in Your creation.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the historic \nachievements of Liz Heaston of Richland, WA. Last Saturday, Liz became \nthe first woman to play in a college football game. Her performance as \nplace kicker for the Willamette University football team resulted in \nkicking two extra points in a victorious effort against Linfield \nCollege. This event also strikes a special chord for me because Liz is \nthe daughter of Suzanne Heaston, a member of my State staff in \nRichland, WA.\n  What is equally amazing about this young woman's accomplishments last \nSaturday is that her feat was accomplished after playing a full soccer \ngame, where she is the star defender on the Willamette University \nwomen's soccer team, ranked 14th nationally in the NAIA. It was Liz's \ntremendous abilities on the soccer field which led the Willamette \nfootball coaching staff to recruit Liz onto the football field.\n  While Liz may not have a future football career ahead of her, \nSaturday's milestone sets a tremendous precedent for future \ntrailblazers in womens sports. The athletic accomplishments of Liz \nHeaston, both in soccer and football, reinforce the role sports can \nplay in helping our daughters discover and realize their potential both \non and off the athletic field.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WOLFENSOHN OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, not many Americans--in fact not many \nhuman beings--have the opportunity to bring about permanent change in \nour world. Even if a person has the opportunity, it is seldom that \nchange can be brought about in a time span of only 3 years. A \ndistinguished exception to this is the president of the World Bank \nGroup, James D. Wolfensohn. Under\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nPresident Wolfensohn's wise guidance, the World Bank Group is \nfacilitating global changes through the application of systems and \nknowledge developed in the United States.\n  Jim Wolfensohn, formerly president and chief executive officer of his \nown corporation, chairman of the board of trustees of the John F. \nKennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and executive partner at \nSalomon Bros., recently delivered his third yearly address to the board \nof governors of the World Bank Group.\n  After reading this compelling statement twice, I concluded his \nmessage should be available to all who wonder if our citizens are \napplying the lessons of enlightened free enterprise in their business \nand personal lives throughout the world. I envy Jim Wolfensohn. He is \ntruly making a difference in this world. It is my pleasure to commend \nhis remarks to the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent that his \nstatement entitled ``The Challenge of Inclusion'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The Challenge of Inclusion\n\n                        (By James D. Wolfensohn)\n\n       I am very pleaded to welcome you to these Annual Meetings \n     of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund \n     (IMF). I am also delighted to be in Hong Kong. This beautiful \n     and bustling city, which I have visited regularly for forty \n     years, exemplifies the openness, dynamism, and optimism of so \n     much of Asia today. And so does our meeting here in this \n     magnificent conference center, where everything has been done \n     impeccably. I would like to express my thanks to our hosts, \n     the government of China, and the authorities here in Hong \n     Kong. It is impossible to imagine greater courtesy, \n     generosity, and efficiency. We look forward to your continued \n     progress.\n       China's success has been truly remarkable. Less than a \n     generation ago, eight in ten Chinese eked out an existence by \n     tilling the soil for less than a dollar day. One adult in \n     three could neither read nor write. Since then, 200 million \n     people have been lifted out of absolute poverty, and \n     illiteracy has fallen to less than one in ten. China is our \n     largest borrower, one of our most valued shareholders, and \n     home to more than a quarter of our clients. I am delighted \n     that our partnership continues to strengthen.\n       This is the third time that I address you as president of \n     the World Bank Group--the third time I have the opportunity \n     to express my deep gratitude to my friend Michel Camdessus, \n     whose collaboration over the past two and a half years has \n     been so invaluable to me. We work ever more closely together, \n     and I continue to benefit from his great experience and \n     judgment.\n       From the beginning, one of my priorities has been to take \n     the pulse of development firsthand. I have now visited almost \n     sixty countries. I have met with governments, \n     parliamentarians, and the private sector. I have talked with \n     national and international nongovernmental organizations \n     (NGOs) on subjects ranging from women's issues to the \n     environment, from health to the impact of macroeconomic \n     reform.\n       Wherever I go, I continue to be impressed by the people we \n     serve--by their strength, their energy and their enterprise, \n     even in the most abject conditions. By the hundreds of \n     thousands disadvantaged by war, by the millions of children \n     without families condemned to live on the streets, by the \n     disabled shut out from any kind of social support. By the \n     plight of the poorest.\n       Today our clients number 4.7 billion people in over 100 \n     countries. Three billion live on under 2 dollars a day. A \n     billion three hundred million live on under 1 dollar a day. \n     One hundred million go hungry every day; 150 million never \n     even get the chance to go to school.\n       But whether they live on the plains or in the valleys, \n     whether they live in slums or isolated villages, whether they \n     speak Hindi, Swahili, or Uzbek, they have one thing in \n     common: They do not want charity. They want a chance. They do \n     not want solutions imposed from without. They want the \n     opportunity to build from within. They do not want my culture \n     or yours. They want their own. They want a future enriched by \n     the inheritance of their past.\n       I have learned that people are the same wherever they are--\n     here in this room and across the world. We all want the best \n     for our children and our families. We all want peace and \n     economic and physical security. We all want to live in a \n     supportive community. We all want personal dignity.\n       This was vividly brought home to me six months ago when I \n     visited a large water and sanitation project that the Bank is \n     supporting in the favelas of Brazil. The project, which is \n     now self-sustaining, brings together the local community, the \n     private sector, and NGOs.\n       With my host, the vice governor of the state of Rio, I went \n     from one makeshift home to the next, talking with the women \n     who live there and who used to carry the water on their \n     shoulders from the bottom of the hillside to their dwellings \n     at the top. One after the other, they proudly showed me their \n     running water and flushed their toilets and told me how the \n     project had transformed their lives.\n       And as we walked around, more and more of the women came up \n     to me displaying pieces of paper showing charges and receipts \n     for a few reals a month. I watched and listened to this until \n     the vice governor said, ``What they're showing you, Jim, is \n     that this is the first time in their lives that their name \n     and address have appeared on an official notice. This is the \n     first time their existence has been officially recognized. \n     This is the first time that they have been included in \n     society. With that receipt they can get credit to purchase \n     goods, with that receipt they have recognition and hope.''\n       As I walked back down the hill from that favela, I realized \n     that this is what the challenge of development is all about--\n     inclusion. Bringing people into society who have never been \n     part of it before. This is why the World Bank Group exists. \n     This is why we are all here today. To help make it happen for \n     people.\n\n\n                  The State of Development circa 1997\n\n       Where are we in terms of ``making it happen'' in 1997? In \n     many ways, this is the best of times for developing \n     countries: Output grew last year by 5.6 percent--the highest \n     rate in twenty years. Foreign direct investment exceeded $100 \n     billion--the most ever. Private capital flows now total $245 \n     billion--five times official development assistance. And \n     developing countries are projected to enjoy continued strong \n     growth over the next ten years.\n       Social indicators are also improving. Life expectancy has \n     risen more in the past forty years than in the previous four \n     thousand. And freedom is blossoming. Today nearly two in \n     three countries use open elections to choose their national \n     leadership and 5 billion people live in a market economy--up \n     from 1 billion ten years ago.\n       There is also much good news regionally: Reform programs in \n     Eastern Europe and Central Asia continue to advance, and \n     prospects for accession to the European Union now look \n     promising for several countries in the region. There is real \n     progress in Sub-Saharan Africa, with new leadership and \n     better economic policies. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew \n     4.5 percent in 1996, up from 2 percent two years ago.\n       In the Middle East and North Africa, despite political \n     problems, efforts continue to boost regional trade and \n     investment, improve competitiveness, and expand economic \n     opportunity. In Latin America countries have emerged from the \n     tequila crisis, with their earlier gains against \n     hyperinflation fully intact.\n       In East Asia, despite recent turbulence in financial \n     markets, we still expect long-term growth and poverty \n     reduction to be strong. And in South Asia, home to 35 percent \n     of the developing world's poor, growth rates over the past \n     several years have approached 6 percent.\n       This all adds up to much to celebrate--but there is also \n     much to lament. Yes, the glass is half full, but it is also \n     half empty. Too many people are not enjoying the fruits of \n     success--\n       Here in East Asia, where, despite the ``miracle,'' \n     inequities between rural and urban areas and between the \n     skilled and the unskilled are becoming more widespread.\n       In the countries of the former Soviet Union, where the old \n     and the unemployed have become more vulnerable amidst the \n     turbulence caused by the transition from command to market \n     economies.\n       In parts of Latin America, where problems of landownership, \n     crime, drug-related violence, unequal access to education and \n     health care, and enormous disparities in income hinder \n     progress and threaten stability.\n       And in many of the world's poorest countries, where \n     population growth continues to run ahead of economic growth, \n     eroding living standards.\n       And the deeper tragedy is that the glass is almost totally \n     empty for too many. Indeed, for too many, it is the worst of \n     times, as huge disparities persist across and within \n     countries.\n       In too many countries, the poorest 10 percent of the \n     population has less than 1 percent of the income, while the \n     richest 20 percent enjoys over half. In too many countries, \n     girls are still only half as likely as boys to go to school. \n     In too many countries, children are impaired from birth \n     because of malnutrition, inadequate health care, and little \n     or no access to early childhood development programs. In too \n     many countries, ethnic minorities face discrimination and \n     fear for their lives at the hands of ethnic majorities.\n       What we are seeing in the world today is the tragedy of \n     exclusion.\n\n\n                          The Challenge Ahead\n\n       Our goal must be to reduce these disparities across and \n     within countries, to bring more and more people into the \n     economic mainstream, to promote equitable access to the \n     benefits of development regardless of nationality, race, or \n     gender. This--the Challenge of Inclusion--is the key \n     development challenge of our time.\n       You and I and all of us in this room--the privileged of the \n     developing and the industrial world--can choose to ignore \n     that challenge. We can focus only on the successes. We can \n     live with a little more crime, a few more wars, air that is a \n     little bit dirtier. We can insulate ourselves from whole \n     sections of the world for which crisis is real and daily but \n     which to the rest of us is largely invisible. But we must \n     recognize that we are living\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\n     with a time bomb, and unless we take action now, it could \n     explode in our children's faces.\n       If we do not act, in thirty years the inequities will be \n     greater. With population growing at 80 million a year, \n     instead of 3 billion living on under $2 a day, it could be as \n     high as 5 billion. In thirty years, the quality of our \n     environment will be worse. Instead of 4 percent of tropical \n     forests lost since Rio, it could be 24 percent.\n       In thirty years, the number of conflicts may be higher. \n     Already we live in a world which last year alone saw twenty-\n     six interstate wars and 23 million refugees. One does not \n     have to spend long in Bosnia or Gaza or the Lakes District in \n     Africa to know that without economic hope we will not have \n     peace. Without equity we will not have global stability. \n     Without a better sense of social justice our cities will not \n     be safe, and our societies will not be stable. Without \n     inclusion, too many of us will be condemned to live \n     separate, armed, and frightened lives.\n       Whether you broach it from the social or the economic or \n     the moral perspective, this is a challenge we cannot afford \n     to ignore. There are not two worlds, there is one world. We \n     breathe the same air. We degrade the same environment. We \n     share the same financial system. We have the same health \n     problems. AIDS is not a problem that stops at borders. Crime \n     does not stop at borders. Drugs do not stop at borders. \n     Terrorism, war, and famine do not stop at borders.\n       And economics is fundamentally changing the relationships \n     between the rich and the poor nations. Over the next twenty-\n     five years, growth in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, and \n     Russia will likely redraw the economic map of the world, as \n     the share in global output of the developing and transition \n     economies doubles. Today these countries represent 50 percent \n     of the world's population but only 8 percent of its GDP. \n     Their share in world trade is a quarter that of the European \n     Union. By the year 2020, their share in world trade could be \n     50 percent more than Europe's.\n       We share the same world, and we share the same challenge. \n     The fight against poverty is the fight for peace, security, \n     and growth for us all.\n       How, then, do we proceed? This much we know: No country has \n     been successful in reducing poverty without sustained \n     economic growth. Those countries that have been most \n     successful--including, most notably, many here in East Asia--\n     have also invested heavily in their people, have put in place \n     the right policy fundamentals, and have not discriminated \n     against their rural sectors. The results have been dramatic: \n     large private capital inflows, rapid growth, and substantial \n     poverty reduction.\n       The message for countries is clear: Educate your people; \n     ensure their health; give them voice and justice, financial \n     systems that work, and sound economic policies, and they will \n     respond, and they will save, and they will attract the \n     investment, both domestic and foreign, that is needed to \n     raise living standards and fuel development.\n       But another message is also emerging from recent \n     developments. We have seen in recent months how financial \n     markets are demanding more information disclosure, and how \n     they are making swift judgments about the quality and \n     sustainability of government policies based on that \n     information. We have seen that without sound organization and \n     supervision a financial system can falter, with the poor hurt \n     the most. We have seen how corruption flourishes in the dark, \n     how it prevents growth and social equity, and how it creates \n     the basis for social and political instability.\n       We must recognize this link between good economic \n     performance and open governance. Irrespective of political \n     systems, public decisions must be brought right out into the \n     sunshine of public scrutiny. Not simply to please the markets \n     but to build the broad social consensus without which even \n     the best-conceived economic strategies will ultimately fail.\n\n\n                       the development community\n\n       How can we in the broader development community be most \n     effective in helping with the enormous task ahead?\n       It is clear that the scale of the challenge is simply too \n     great to be handled by any single one of us. Nor will we get \n     the job done if we work at cross purposes or pursue rivalries \n     that should have been laid to rest long since. Name calling \n     between civil society and multilateral development \n     institutions must stop. We should encourage criticism. But we \n     should also recognize that we share a common goal and that we \n     need each other.\n       Partnership, I am convinced, must be a cornerstone of our \n     efforts. And it must rest on four pillars.\n       First and foremost, the governments and the people of \n     developing countries must be in the driver's seat--exercising \n     choice and setting their own objectives for themselves. \n     Development requires much too much sustained political will \n     to be externally imposed. It cannot be donor-driven.\n       But what we as a development community can do is help \n     countries--by providing financing, yes; but even more \n     important, by providing knowledge and lessons learned about \n     the challenges and how to address them.\n       We must learn to let go. We must accept that the projects \n     we fund are not donor projects or World Bank projects--they \n     are Costa Rican projects, or Bangladeshi projects, or Chinese \n     projects. And development projects and programs must be fully \n     owned by local stakeholders if they are to succeed. We must \n     listen to those stakeholders.\n       Second, our partnerships must be inclusive--involving \n     bilaterals and multilaterals, the United Nations, the \n     European Union, regional organizations, the World Trade \n     Organization, labor organizations, NGOs, foundations, and the \n     private sector. With each of us playing to our respective \n     strengths, we can leverage up the entire development effort.\n       Third, we should offer our assistance to all countries in \n     need. But we must be selective in how we use our resources. \n     There is no escaping the hard fact: More people will be \n     lifted out of poverty if we concentrate our assistance on \n     countries with good policies than if we allocate it \n     irrespective of the policies pursued. Recent studies confirm \n     what we already knew intuitively--that in a good policy \n     environment, development assistance improves growth prospects \n     and social conditions, but in a poor policy environment, it \n     can actually retard progress by reducing the need for change \n     and by creating dependency.\n       I want to be very clear on this point: I am not espousing \n     some Darwinian theory of development whereby we discard the \n     unfit by the wayside. Quite the contrary. Our goal is to \n     support the fit and to help the unfit fit. This is all about \n     inclusion.\n       In Africa, for example, a new generation of leaders \n     deserves our strongest possible support for the tough \n     decisions they are making; they have vast needs and a growing \n     capacity to use donor funds well in addressing them. We must \n     be there for them. It is an economic and a moral imperative.\n       However, where aid cannot be effective because of bad \n     policy or corruption or weak governance, we need to think of \n     new ways to help the people. not the old technical assistance \n     approaches of the past that relied too heavily on foreign \n     consultants. But helping countries help themselves: by \n     building their own capacity to design and implement their own \n     development.\n       Finally, all of us in the development community must look \n     at our strategies anew.\n       We need that quantum leap which will allow us to make a \n     real dent in poverty. We need to scale up, to think beyond \n     individual donor-financed projects to larger country-led \n     national strategies and beyond that to regional strategies \n     and systemic reform.\n       We need approaches that can be replicated and customized to \n     local circumstances. Not one agricultural project here or one \n     group of schools there. But rural and educational country \n     strategies that can help the Oaxacas and the Chiapas of this \n     world, as well as the Mexico Cities.\n       We need to hit hard on the key pressure points for change--\n     adequate infrastructure in key areas, social and human \n     development, rural and environmental development, and \n     financial and private sector development.\n       And we need to remember that educating girls and supporting \n     opportunities for women--health, education and employment--\n     are crucial to balanced development.\n       In the struggle for inclusion, this all adds up to a \n     changed bottom line for the development community. We must \n     think results--how to get the biggest development return from \n     our scarce resources. We must think sustainability--how to \n     have enduring development impact within an environmentally \n     sustainable framework. We must think equity--how to include \n     the disadvantaged. We must focus not on the easy projects but \n     on the difficult--in northeast Brazil, in India's Gangetic \n     Plain, and in the Horn of Africa. Projects there will be \n     riskier, yes. But success will be worth all the more in terms \n     of including more people in the benefits of development--and \n     giving more people the chance of a better life.\n\n\n                    The World Bank Group's Response\n\n       How is the Bank Group responding to the Challenge of \n     Inclusion?\n       Last year, I said that if the Group was to be more \n     effective, it needed to change--to get closer to our clients' \n     real needs, to focus on quality, and to be more accountable \n     for the results of our work. This year, I want to tell you \n     that it is happening. Not only is the Bank changing, but the \n     need for change is now fully accepted.\n       I know--and you know--that the Bank has tried to change \n     before. But there has never been this level of commitment and \n     consensus. We are building on the mission statement \n     articulated by my predecessor, Lew Preston, whose untimely \n     death prevented him from implementing his plans.\n       Earlier this year, we launched an action program--the \n     Strategic Compact--to renew our values and commitment to \n     development and to improve the Bank's effectiveness. I \n     believe the Compact is historic. Not because there is \n     agreement on every paragraph of the document; but because \n     staff, management, and shareholders--with terrific support \n     from our Executive Directors--are now united on the future \n     direction of the institution. And while we still have a long \n     way to go, and while change is painful--and some people are \n     undoubtedly feeling that pain--implementation is well under \n     way.\n       I really believe that this time we can succeed. And we will \n     succeed because of our truly remarkable and dedicated staff. \n     I do not believe a better development team exists, or one \n     with more experience in fighting poverty.\n       But the Compact is not primarily about our organization and \n     internal change; it is about our clients and meeting their \n     needs more effectively. To take this beyond rhetoric, we have \n     decentralized aggressively to\n\n[[Page S10914]]\n\n     the field. By the end of this month, eighteen of our forty-\n     eight country directors with decisionmaking authority will be \n     based in the countries they serve--compared with only three \n     last year.\n       We have speeded up our response time and have introduced \n     new products such as the single currency loan and loans for \n     innovative projects of $5 million or less that can be \n     implemented very quickly.\n       Working with Michel Camdessus and our colleagues in the \n     IMF--as well as with many other partners--we have prepared \n     debt reduction packages worth about $5 billion for six \n     heavily indebted poor countries under the HIPC Initiative. \n     Not bad for an effort that did not even have a name eighteen \n     months ago. And we are moving speedily ahead to help other \n     HIPC countries.\n       The New Bank is committed to quality.\n       We have put in place reinvigorated country management \n     teams, with 150 new managers selected over the last six \n     months, and rigorous training and professional development \n     programs have been introduced for all staff. The \n     International Finance Corporation (IFC) has also made \n     major changes in management and is decentralizing to the \n     field.\n       We have improved the quality of our portfolio, and as a \n     result our disbursements reached a record level last year of \n     $20 billion.\n       And the quality of all our work is being enhanced by the \n     progress we have made toward becoming a Knowledge Bank. We \n     have created networks to share knowledge across all regions \n     and all major sectors of development. Our Economic \n     Development Institute is playing a leading role in this area. \n     Last June in Toronto, working with the Canadian government \n     and many other sponsors, EDI brought together participants \n     from over 100 countries, for the first Global Knowledge \n     Conference.\n       My goal is to make the World Bank the first port of call \n     when people need knowledge about development. By the year \n     2000, we will have in place a global communications system \n     with computer links, videoconferencing, and interactive \n     classrooms, affording our clients all around the world full \n     access to our information bases--the end of geography as we \n     at the Bank have known it.\n       We are also promoting increased accountability throughout \n     the World Bank Group:\n       We have developed a corporate scorecard to measure our \n     performance. We are closely monitoring compliance with our \n     policies and are continuing to work to improve the inspection \n     process by making it more transparent and effective. And we \n     are designing new personnel policies that explicitly link \n     staff performance to pay and promotion.\n       We are also emphasizing accountability in the dialogue with \n     our clients. Last year, I highlighted the importance of \n     tackling the cancer of corruption. Since then, we have issued \n     new guidelines to staff for dealing with corruption--and for \n     ensuring that our own processes meet the highest standards of \n     transparency and propriety. We have also begun working with a \n     first half-dozen of our member countries to develop \n     anticorruption programs.\n       My bottom line on corruption is simple: If a government is \n     unwilling to take action despite the fact that the country's \n     development objectives are undermined by corruption, then the \n     Bank Group must curtail its level of support to that country. \n     Corruption, by definition, is exclusive: It promotes the \n     interests of the few over the many. We must fight it wherever \n     we find it.\n       But key to meeting the challenge of inclusion is making \n     sure not only that we do things right but that we do the \n     right things. Earlier, I mentioned the strategic pressure \n     points of change. Let me say a few words about what we are \n     doing in each of these areas.\n       Human and social development. We are mainstreaming social \n     issues--including support for the important role of \n     indigenous culture--into our country assistance strategies so \n     that we can better reach ethnic minorities, households headed \n     by women, and other excluded groups.\n       We are participating in programs designed by local \n     communities to address pervasive needs, such as the EDUCO \n     basic literacy program in El Salvador and the District \n     Primary Education Program in India, and these programs are \n     being replicated by other countries.\n       We are increasing our support for capacity-building--\n     particularly the comprehensive program initiated by the \n     African countries last year.\n       Sustainable development. In the rural sector, which is home \n     to more than 70 percent of the world's poor, we have \n     completed a major rethinking of our strategy. Lending is now \n     up after many years of decline, supporting innovative \n     programs such as the new market-based approach to land reform \n     in Brazil.\n       We are also supporting our clients' efforts to address the \n     brown environmental issues--clean water and adequate \n     sanitation--that are so often neglected but are so important \n     for the quality of the everyday lives of the poor.\n       And, through the Global Environment Facility, the Global \n     Carbon Initiative, and a new partnership with the World \n     Wildlife Fund to protect the world's forests, we are \n     continuing to advance the global environmental agenda.\n       The private sector. We are capitalizing on the synergies \n     between the Bank, the IFC, and the Multilateral Investment \n     Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and are coordinating our activities \n     under a single, client-focused service ``window.''\n       Across the Bank Group, we are building up our work on \n     regulatory, legal, and judicial reform designed to help \n     create environments that will attract foreign and domestic \n     private capital. We are using International Bank of \n     Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) guarantees to help \n     support policy changes and mitigate risk, and we are \n     expanding the product line of the International Development \n     Association (IDA) to help poor countries develop their \n     private sectors and become full participants in the global \n     economy.\n       Meanwhile, the IFC is working in 110 countries, and in more \n     sectors, employing more financial products than ever before. \n     Last year saw $6.7 billion in new approvals in 276 projects. \n     The IFC's Extending the Reach Program is targeting thirty-\n     three countries and regions that have received very little \n     private sector investment. Again, the goal is clear: to bring \n     more and more marginalized economies into the global \n     marketplace.\n       MIGA, too is playing an active and enhanced role. Last year \n     it issued a record seventy guarantee contracts for projects \n     in twenty-five developing countries, including \n     eleven countries where it has not been active before. I am \n     delighted that yesterday the Development Committee agreed \n     to an increase in MIGA's capital that will allow it to \n     continue to grow.\n       The financial sector. This pressure point has been brought \n     sharply into focus by recent events in East Asia. Here too we \n     are scaling up our work in coordination with the IMF and the \n     regional development banks for the simple reason that when \n     the financial sector fails, it is the poor who suffer most. \n     It is the poor who pay the highest price when investment and \n     access to credit dry up, when workers are laid off, when \n     budgets and services are cut back to cover losses.\n       But success in the financial sector requires much more than \n     the announcement of new policies or financial packages pulled \n     together when crisis hits. This is why we are expanding our \n     capacity for banking and financial system restructuring--and \n     not just for the middle-income countries, but taking on the \n     larger task of financial sector development in low-income \n     countries.\n       For those countries, home to the world's 3 billion poorest \n     people, IDA remains the key instrument for addressing the \n     Challenge of Inclusion. I will be coming back to you in due \n     course to seek your support for the twelfth replenishment of \n     IDA.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       I believe we have made considerable progress in putting our \n     own house in order in preparation for the challenges of the \n     new millennium.\n       1997 has been a year of significant achievement. We must \n     push ahead with this process. We must make sure that we \n     deliver next year's work program, that we strengthen the \n     project pipeline and increase the resources going directly to \n     the front line. And we must implement our recently completed \n     cost-effectiveness review.\n       But the time has also come to get back to the dream. The \n     dream of inclusive development.\n       We stand at a unique moment in history when we have a \n     chance to make that dream a reality. Today, we have \n     unprecedented consensus on the policies that need to be put \n     in place for sustainable and poverty-reducing growth. Today, \n     we have clear and unambiguous evidence of the economic and \n     social linkages between the developing and the industrial \n     worlds. Today, we face a future where, unless we take action, \n     our children will be condemned to live in a degrading \n     environment and a less secure world. All we need today is the \n     determination to focus on tomorrow and the courage to do it \n     now.\n       As a development community we face a critical choice.\n       We can continue business as usual, focusing on a project \n     here, a project there, all too often running behind the \n     poverty curve. We can continue making international \n     agreements that we ignore. We can continue engaging in turf \n     battles, competing for the moral high ground.\n       Or we can decide to make a real difference.\n       But to do that, we need to raise our sights. We need to \n     forge partnerships to maximize our leverage and our use of \n     scarce resources. And we need to scale up our efforts and hit \n     hard on those areas where our development impact can be \n     greatest.\n       We at the Bank Group are ready to do our part. But we \n     cannot succeed alone. Only if we work together will we make a \n     dent. Only if we collectively change our attitude will we \n     make that quantum leap. Only if, in board rooms and \n     ministries and city squares across the globe, we begin to \n     recognize that ultimately we will not have sustainable \n     prosperity unless we have inclusion, will we make it happen.\n       Let me end where I began: in that favela in Brazil: What I \n     saw in the faces of the women there, I have also seen on the \n     faces of women in India showing me passbooks for savings \n     accounts. I have seen it on the faces of rural cave dwellers \n     in China being offered new, productive land. I have seen it \n     on the faces of villagers in Uganda, able for the first time \n     to send their children to school because of the private \n     profit they can now make through rural extension schemes.\n       The look in these people's eyes is not a look of \n     hopelessness. It's a look of pride, of self-esteem, of \n     inclusion. These are people who have a sense of themselves, \n     who have a sense of tradition, who have a sense of family. \n     All they need is a chance.\n       Each one of us in this room must take personal \n     responsibility for making sure they get\n\n[[Page S10915]]\n\n     that chance. We can do it. For the sake of our children, we \n     must do it. Working together, we will do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10911-7", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO GEN. WILLIAM W. ``BUFFALO BILL'' QUINN\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the Senate the \nfact that in a few days one of our Nation's most distinguished military \nofficers, a veteran of World War II and of the Korean conflict, will \ncelebrate his 90th birthday.\n  Lt. Gen. William W. ``Buffalo Bill'' Quinn, a 1933 graduate of the \nU.S. Military Academy at West Point, completed Command and General \nStaff School the day before Pearl Harbor.\n  He had served as G-2 of the 7th Army, responsible for the \nintelligence on which the August 1944 allied landing in southern France \nwas based when the 19th German Army was routed.\n  The following year he helped to liberate the survivors of the Nazi \ndeath camp at Dachau. What he saw there so horrified him that he said \nhe would never let the world forget, so that nothing similar could \nhappen again.\n  After the war, General Quinn became director of the Strategic Service \nUnit that was formerly known as the Office of Strategic Services. Later \nhe was assigned to Korea where he boosted regimental morale by setting \nup a system for sending word of the accomplishments of individual \nsoldiers to their hometown papers. He also served as G-2 for the daring \nand historic landing at Inchon.\n  His duties as a combat commander began when he was assigned to \ncommand the 17th Regiment in Korea, which was known as the \n``Buffaloes.''\n  On a cold winter day in 1951, ending a report on his regiment, he \nsaid, ``Tell the old man''--and he meant by that Maj. Gen. Claude \nFerenbaugh, commanding general of the 7th Division--``that Bill of the \nBuffaloes said everything will be all right.''\n  From then on, Bill Quinn became known as Buffalo Bill.\n  After Korea, he served for 2 years as an adviser to the Greek Army. \nLater he assumed command of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, \nWA, and then returned to the Pentagon as the first Deputy Assistant \nChief for Intelligence of the Army. In 1959, he became the Army's Chief \nof Public Information.\n  Assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency as Deputy Director in \n1961, he was then promoted to lieutenant general. In 1964, General \nQuinn was appointed the 18th commanding general of the 7th Army in \nGermany. He retired 2 years later.\n  I met General Quinn when I went to visit Senator Barry Goldwater once \nover on the Chesapeake. He is a great individual, Mr. President. \nGeneral Quinn's distinguished military career provides a picture of a \ngreat man. Those of us who are fortunate enough to call him a friend \nknow that he has many more dimensions. He is a fine writer, who has \ncontributed to many periodicals. He wrote a successful television \nseries on our American infantrymen. General Quinn is an ardent \nfisherman, an outdoorsman, a golfer. In his Academy days, he played end \non the football team and attack on the lacrosse team.\n  As a father and grandfather, he has a family which is extremely proud \nof him. His list of citations, decorations, and civic activities and \nmany accomplishments would be a long one and still would not tell the \nstory of the whole man. I know him as an almost professional Irishman. \nHe knows more jokes about Irish people and can tell them at length. And \nhe enjoys Irish whiskey, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in honoring a great man, \nGen. ``Buffalo Bill'' Quinn on his 90th birthday, which he will \ncelebrate with his friends and family on November 1.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask unanimous consent that I might proceed for up to \n15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10915-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10915-S10917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE GAZPROM DEAL\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on September 30, Total, a French company, \nand Petronas, a Malaysian company, and Gazprom, a Russian company, \nsigned a $2 billion agreement to develop the South Pars oilfields in \nIran. This contravenes the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act which passed the \nSenate unanimously, and passed the House of Representatives with I \nthink all but four votes, and which was signed into law August 5, 1996, \nby President Clinton.\n  Mr. President, the history of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act is one \nthat, unfortunately, it seems to me, too many are ready to forget. Too \nmany are ready to forget the 300-plus American citizens who were killed \nin PanAm 103, or that two Libyan agents have been indicted in \nconnection with that terrorist attack and provided a safe harbor by the \nLibyan Government. Too many of us are fickle, it seems to me, and are \nready to forget past acts of terrorism committed by these two countries \nbecause of political expedience, on the altar of corporate profits and \ngreed.\n  Let us bring their arguments right out here: ``Oh, if we don't \nparticipate in this, others will. If we don't provide the bullets for \nthe killers, others will, so why don't we sell them. Oh, forget the \nfact that this legislation was passed unanimously because, when this \nbill passed it was in close proximity to another tragedy that took \nplace, the TWA flight that inexplicably exploded off the shores of Long \nIsland.'' When the legislation passed, people were concerned whether or \nnot it might have been a terrorist bomb or missile. I am not suggesting \nthat it was terrorism, but there was that concern, and so the Congress \nwas quick to respond.\n  I think we responded correctly. We said to those who are going to do \nbusiness with countries that export terrorism, that are in the business \nof financing the fanatical kinds of acts that result in a terrorist \nattack at the World Trade Center in New York where 6 people are killed, \nthat result in the bombing of the barracks in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia \nwhere our troops are killed, that engage in the kind of terrorist \nattack sponsored by the Libyans where 300-plus Americans are killed; we \nare not going to help promote trade with those countries that played a \nrole in these attacks. And if companies and countries want to enter \ninto agreements that will promote the financial resources and \ndevelopment of Iran and Libya, then they cannot have free access to the \nmarketplace in America.\n  Is that a sacrifice? Yes, it is. Is it a sacrifice that we have a \nright to expect? I believe it is. Should it be greeted by the French \nPrime Minister standing up and cheering on the day that Total enters \ninto this agreement, an agreement that our State Department was aware \nof and attempted to intercede and to get the French to work with us? I \ndon't believe so.\n  What does that sanction bill provide? It has a litany of \nopportunities for the Libyans and the Iranians to escape punitive \nmeasures; if they act in conformity with the world community and stop \nsponsoring terrorist attacks, if they begin to show actions that they \nwill live and let live, then the President does have the ability to \nrelax and alter those sanctions.\n  But, Mr. President, to date there has not been one showing, not one, \nthat any of those countries, the Libyans or the Iranians, are willing \nto cease and desist from promoting terrorist attacks against the United \nStates, against our interests and against those who seek peace and want \nto live in peace. Indeed, if anything, they have become more violent.\n  By the way, I say to those who argue that this agreement or this \narrangement or this law has not worked, it has worked. We know that \nthere have been billions of dollars of investments that would have gone \ninto promoting the economy of Iran so that they would have more \nresources to export terrorism that has been precluded.\n  For the leader of France to stand up and cheer, I believe, is \nhorrendous. For him to say that this is extraterritorial legislation \nflies in the face of common sense. Are you really saying that the \nUnited States cannot take a position;\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\n``that we are not going to support terrorist nations, that there will \nbe sanctions, and that you cannot do business with us as if everything \nis fine and well and that you are comporting yourself as a good world \ncitizen?''\n  Let me suggest to you that many of those who decry the U.S. position \nwere the same who were so quick to come in and say a recent corporate \nmerger that was about to take place should not take place. Oh, yes, the \nEuropean Community, led by, once again, our friends the French, were \nready to step in and say that the agreement between two American \ncompanies, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, be invalidated. What about \nextraterritoriality in that situation? And in that case we are talking \nabout two companies that are not exporting terrorism right here within \nthe United States. Yet today we have the European Common Market talking \nabout sanctioning the United States if we were to proceed in allowing \nthose two aircraft manufacturers to merge and not ask for waivers and \nnot work out a situation, because this would be competition that would \nbe difficult for a European company, Airbus.\n  So let us not have a situation where there are those who are willing \nto condemn us for fighting terrorism--and by the way, how do we take on \nthose who promote terrorism? We cannot bomb them. I am not suggesting \nthat we do. But should we not deny them the financial resources with \nwhich to fuel the engine for exporting terrorism? Of course, we should.\n  It takes a little courage. I think that our administration has not \ndone the kind of things that it should do behind the scenes, working \nwith our allies to make this policy one that is easier to enforce. We \nhave not told the Europeans to stand up to the Iranians, and say ``if \nyou want to be able to have commerce and trade like others, then you \nhave to behave. There is a code of conduct that we expect of you, or \notherwise, there will be sanctions.'' We have simply not told them to \ntell the Iranians that.\n  There was once a time not too long ago when we imposed sanctions of \nall kinds on our current allies, the Russians, before the wall of \ncommunism came down. Sanctions that related to human rights, related to \ntheir anti-democratic activities. We didn't have pure free trade and \ncommerce under the sanctions of yesterday, so the sanctions of today \naren't anything new. For those who say somehow this is terrible, I'll \ntell you what is terrible: I think it is terrible that we have not laid \nour cards on the table with our allies and told them we expect them to \njoin with us in the battle against terrorism.\n  I received a letter from our colleagues Senator Brownback and Senator \nKyl, asking that the Banking Committee hold a hearing on the question \nof offering $1 billion of convertible bonds on the U.S. markets. And \nwhat were these bonds to be used for? They were to be used for helping \nto finance a company by the name of Gazprom; Gazprom, the very Russian \ncompany that helped bring about this deal promoting the exploration and \ndevelopment of the oil fields in Iran. Owing to the fact that Gazprom \nis clearly one of those companies that is in violation of the Iran-\nLibyan Sanction Act, and it can be sanctioned, I have a difficult time \nunderstanding--along with my colleagues Senator Kyl and Senator \nBrownback who have raised the question whether or not we should permit \nfinancing under our law--whether these financing activities wouldn't be \nin violation of our national security. Do these activities require a \nwaiver from the President? We will be holding a hearing next week, next \nThursday, to ascertain this.\n  In addition, I have learned from a number of accounts that Gazprom is \nnow negotiating with our Export-Import Bank to get something in the \narea of $800 to $850 million worth of Export-Import Bank credits. This \nis incredible. Today I have written a letter to Senator McConnell in \nwhich I have asked him to take the appropriate actions to see to it \nthat this is not business as usual, that he puts a hold on this as he \nis marking up the appropriations bill dealing with the Export-Import \nBank.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter dated October 22 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Appropriations \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write today with a matter of urgent \n     concern. Gazprom, a Russian company has violated the Iran-\n     Libya Sanctions Act by signing a $2 billion contract along \n     with Total, S.A. of France and Petronas of Malaysia, with \n     Iran to develop the South Pars oil field there. This flagrant \n     act cannot be rewarded with U.S. inaction. Most importantly, \n     it must not be rewarded with U.S. export financing.\n       Now, after this act of corporate greed and obstructionism \n     of U.S. counter terrorism policy, we learn that Gazprom might \n     well receive some $800 million in Export-Import credits. This \n     cannot be allowed to happen. We must prevent the extension of \n     these loans. There is no reason that we should be financing \n     their violation of our laws and the enrichment of Iran.\n       Mr. Chairman, Iran's international misdeeds are legendary. \n     Their sponsorship of international terrorism and their \n     ongoing attempts to obtain weapons of mass destruction should \n     cause all of us great concern. In this vein, Gazprom's aid to \n     Iran cannot and should not be allowed to proceed without \n     penalty. I, therefore, urge you in the strongest of terms, to \n     seek an end to this financing as you prepare the final \n     version of the FY 98 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill \n     in the coming weeks.\n       Thank you for your support of this extremely important and \n     urgent request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I urged upon Senator McConnell in the strongest terms to \nseek an end to this financing in the fiscal year 1998 foreign \noperations bill. If, indeed, we are going to have a situation where, on \none hand we have a law that says you cannot do business with these \ncountries, and on the other hand we are indirectly financing a \ncorporation which is going to be undertaking these activities, then I \nthink this is wrong. How can the United States provide $800 to $850 \nmillion worth of Export-Import Bank credits allowing U.S. companies to \ndo more business with companies whose actions violate U.S. law and \ndamage U.S. security? So we certainly have an obligation to look into \nthis.\n  In fact, Gazprom is a company that is closely tied to the Russian \nPrime Minister, Victor Chernomyrdin. And when the Vice President, Vice \nPresident Gore, was in Russia several weeks ago, he reportedly spoke at \nlength, to Mr. Chernomyrdin, about the Russian company's providing \nmissile technology to Iran. It is my understanding Mr. Chernomyrdin \nsaid he had no knowledge of this, and that he could not do anything \nabout it.\n  What are we talking about? I mean, the fact of the matter is the \nRussians have been providing this technology to Iran. It seems to me \nthis situation is like the parent who doesn't want to acknowledge that \na son or daughter may have some problems with substance abuse, but they \nlook the other way. All the signs are there, but they look the other \nway. All the facts are there, but we don't want to have an \nacknowledgment.\n  Let me be clear, Iran is the foremost sponsor of international \nterrorism. They threaten our national security, the interests of our \ncitizens and our allies, and it is unconscionable that we provide aid \nto them to do so. For the Russian Prime Minister to say we should stop \nworrying about this threat is incredible.\n  I think we should start worrying about the damage that will be done \nif this kind of contract is carried out by us acting as willing \nconsorts. For Russian companies to be providing missile aid to Iran and \nthen helping finance gas deals which will make it possible for the \nIranians to undertake more terrorist activities, I think is simply \nimpermissible. Are we supposed to really be quiet? Sit back? Are we \ngoing to really read the editorials that say that now I have somehow \ncreated a terrible situation by coming forth and saying ``let's look at \nthis, let's examine this--I believe this is wrong.'' As far as Total \nand Petronas are concerned, I hope the administration understands the \nonly correct course to take is to implement the law and to impose the \nsanctions to their fullest and to sit down with our allies and say to \nthem: Instead of poking us in the eye deliberately and publicly, we \nshould be working together; not for one to advantage oneself and make a \nquick buck.\n\n[[Page S10917]]\n\n  We cannot fail to take this initiative and implement the law the way \nit was intended--it was intended to bring sanctions upon those who deal \nwith countries that promote terrorist activities unless and until those \ncountries change and mend their ways. Failure to act now will only come \nback to haunt us in the future. It will only bring more in the way of \nconduct that can be detrimental to world peace and to our security and \nto the national interests of the United States. I hope we have the \ncourage to stand and act, instead of listening to those in the \ncorporate and business sector come down and say: ``Oh, well, if they \ntake this action today against Total that tomorrow it may impact \nagainst us.''\n  This is a battle. It is a war. It is a different kind but in many \nways it is even more dangerous, more pernicious, more evil than the \nkinds of wars where nations may declare themselves against another \nnation. There, you know where the battlefields lie and you understand \nwhat is taking place. But this is a savage one, which is waged against \ninnocent civilians, children--people throughout the world. That is why \nwe need to employ all of the economic power and legal and moral \nauthority that we have in bringing our allies together with us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10915-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GERI MEAGHER\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise with a pleasant report \ntoday. There are very serious things that occur on this floor in this \ngreat Chamber of debate. This is also serious, but very pleasant to \nreport.\n  This past Saturday history was made in our country. It occurred in my \nState. It occurred because a young woman by the name of Liz Heaston \nappeared in a men's football game at Willamette University. She became \nthe first woman in college football history to play in a game.\n  Before a crowd of 2,500 people, Liz kicked 2 extra points in what \nhelped Willamette University defeat Linfield College 27-0.\n  Liz is a starter for the Willamette University soccer team. And at \nthe last minute she was asked to fill in for the team's regular kicker \nwho was injured. She did it with great aplomb and obviously very \neffectively.\n  After the game, Liz merely said, ``I was out there to have fun and do \nmy job on the field for the team. That was enough for me.''\n  It isn't enough for me to just acknowledge this, but I wanted to come \nto the Senate floor today to pay tribute to her and to say in this day \nand age anything is possible.\n  I commend her for being the first woman to play in a men's college \nfootball game.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10917-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10917-S10918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WOMEN IN MILITARY SERVICE TO AMERICA MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those whose \nservice has at long last been recognized by their country. I am \nspeaking, of course, of those women who have served their country in \nuniform. This past weekend, women veterans converged in Washington for \nceremonies dedicating the Women in Military Service to America \nMemorial.\n  Two million women have stepped forward to serve in every conflict \nfrom the American Revolution to Desert Storm. This is a surprising fact \nwhen you look around Washington, DC, with its many monuments to \nAmerican military heroes and battles--generally men on horseback.\n  The Women in Military Service to America Memorial, thanks to the \ndauntless effort of retired Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught, has finally become \na reality. It will serve as a permanent reminder that the words ``duty, \nhonor, country'' are not merely the motto of West Point cadets; they \nare part and parcel of citizenship in this great Nation. They certainly \nare not gender specific.\n  Today, there are over 1 million women who are veterans of our Armed \nForces; and 14 percent of the U.S. military are women, many of whom \nhave made military service a career.\n  These are women who have nursed the wounded and comforted the dying; \nthey have flown aircraft; they have delivered the mail; they have \nrequisitioned and moved supplies; they have maintained equipment; they \nhave gathered and assessed intelligence; they have managed offices and \npushed paperwork.\n  They have braved every condition and suffered every deprivation. They \nhave been prisoners of war; they have been wounded; and many have \noffered the ultimate sacrifice of their lives for the Nation.\n  A person who serves in our Nation's Armed Forces is a citizen who has \nsworn to step into harm's way to defend freedom. Male or female, we owe \nour veterans a debt of gratitude for taking on these risks.\n  With the dedication of the Women in Military Service to America \nMemorial, we are finally recognizing the contributions of women in our \nArmed Forces.\n  I want to pay special tribute to the many women of Utah who have \nserved. Utah's population includes more than 6,000 women veterans.\n  During the First World War, the Red Cross made desperate pleas for \nqualified nurses to staff the hospitals for the troops. One-fourth of \nthe nurses in Utah at the time offered their skills and joined the \neffort. I think it is of particular note that, although Utah women had \nthe right to vote, other women volunteered for military service in \nWorld War I before they could even vote.\n  And yet, they served under brutal conditions.\n  Mabel Winnie Bettilyon of Salt Lake City worked at an evacuation \nhospital in France where she faced an unrelenting patient load. During \none night, more than 800 wounded American soldiers came into the \nhospital, and she was assigned to care for 136 of them.\n  Ruth Clayton called her service in France ``the most important \nexperience of my life'' because, she said, ``I was able to help.'' She \nworked in a mobile medical unit caring for soldiers wounded by gas \nattacks, many suffering from horrifying disfigurement. She held the \nhands of the dying and strengthened the weak. They ate sitting in the \nmess tent on a wooden coffin. Upon Clayton's return, she went on, as so \nmany others did, to a distinguished nursing career at home.\n  During World War II, Mary Worrell of Layton, UT, was among a select \ngroup of women who were trained to fly military cargo planes. Although \nrelegated to the copilot's chair, these women proved their bravery and \nskill. Worrell trained as a Navy transport airman, a WAVE, flying the \nB-54 in alternately hot or cold unpressurized cabins. One of her \nassignments was to distribute the balance of weight in the plane. She \nrecalls directing passengers to stand in the front of the plane for \ntake off, or have them crouch in the tail depending on conditions. \nToday, Worrell helps educate and inspire visitors as a volunteer at the \nHill Aerospace Museum in Utah.\n  Other women became Women Airforce Service Pilots [WASP's]; 25,000 \nwomen volunteered for the program to compensate for the shortage of \npilots; 1,037 were accepted and completed the\n\n[[Page S10918]]\n\ntraining to become full-fledged pilots, delivering bombers from factory \nto the troops in Europe during the 1940s. They flew every kind of \nmission except combat. Because they were not officially part of the \nmilitary, there were no bands or benefits awaiting them at the \ncompletion of their service. In fact, 39 of them lost their lives, and \nfamilies and friends paid for the return of their remains. Not until \n1977 were these women finally recognized and granted veterans status.\n  Efforts to integrate more women, to incorporate those military groups \nwho had served as auxillaries, grew during the Korean war. Barbara \nToomer is a Utah veteran of the Army Nurse Corps during the Korean \nconflict, when the total enrollment of women in the armed forces was at \njust 4 percent.\n  Their sacrifice does not always end with their military tours of \nduty, nor does their struggle for respect. When Veda Jones, a disabled \nVietnam-era veteran, sought to work with her local service \norganization, the local commander pointed her in the direction of the \nauxillary. Undaunted, Jones persisted. She recalls thinking, ``I'm 60 \npercent disabled. I am a Vietnam-era veteran. I did my time--22 years \non active duty. I belong with the main body.'' Ten years later, Jones \nwas installed as the president of this 5,400 member organization. The \nveterans of Utah have looked to her leadership, and she has unfailingly \nbeen found at her post. She has been an inspiring champion on behalf of \nveterans, working tirelessly to assist with veterans' employment and \nhealth issues in Utah today.\n  When the country called many reservists to active duty during the \ngulf war, there were many Utahns, men and women, who answered the call. \nWe hold the ideals of patriotism and service dear in Utah. With 6,000 \nmembers in the Army Reserve and 1,500 members in the Air National \nGuard, Utah has more units per capita than any other State. Brigham \nYoung University in Provo, UT, has one of the few all-female Army ROTC \nunits in the Southwest, a unit that has distinguished itself already as \na force to be reckoned with.\n  As is the case throughout today's military, women hold key leadership \npositions and comprise vital elements of the units, proving not only \nthat women have the skills to be full players in the defense of our \nNation, but also that they have the same motivation for service as \ntheir male colleagues.\n  The women veterans of World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam \nhave opened the doors of opportunity for those Utah women on active \nduty today--as near as Hill Air Force Base or as far away as Europe, \nKorea, or on board ship.\n  The memorial dedicated last Saturday tells the stories of individual \nwomen, and it tells the story of a nation. Remember the women of the \nRevolutionary War and Civil War who disguised themselves as men in \norder to serve. Remember the women who worked as spies for the Army or \nnurses on the battlefield. Remember your grandmothers dodging fire as \nambulance drivers in World War I, or your mothers staffing essential \nsupply depots during World War II and Korea. Remember the women who \nworked in intelligence units in Vietnam or as helicopter pilots in the \nPersian Gulf. Today, military women are serving aboard ships and flying \nthe space shuttle.\n  I will look forward to visiting this beautiful and fitting memorial; \nand, when I do, I will think of Mamie Ellington Thorne, Mabel Winnie \nBettilyon, Mary Worrell, Barbara Toomer, and Veda Jones, among so very \nmany others. I will think of those now serving and be grateful to them \nas well as to their male colleagues for keeping this country safe.\n  May the Women in Military Service to America Memorial stand to remind \nfuture generations of these noble women who, like their brothers, have \ngiven up certain comforts of civilian life, have volunteered to go to \nfar flung places around the globe, and put themselves at risk to \nadvance the cause of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10917-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10918-S10919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 97) making further continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. House Joint Resolution 97 is now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this resolution would extend the \ncontinuing concept of our appropriations to Friday, November 7, of this \nyear. The terms and conditions are exactly the same as the bill that \nwas passed by the Senate in September. The 1997 fiscal year funding \nlevels and policy limits will prevail during the extended period of \nthis continuing resolution.\n  We have made considerable progress on the appropriations bills for \nfiscal year 1998. The Defense, military construction, Treasury, energy \nand water, and legislative branch bills have all been enacted.\n  The Transportation and VA-HUD bills are pending before the President \nand should be signed within the next few days.\n  The Agriculture conference report has passed the House and is pending \nhere in the Senate.\n  We expect to file an Interior appropriations conference report later \ntoday.\n  And it is my opinion we will complete the conference on the foreign \noperations, Commerce and Labor, Health and Human Services bills this \nweek.\n  Additionally, we should pass or obtain cloture on the District of \nColumbia bill this week.\n  I am here to say I am grateful for the cooperation of the two \nleaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, in aiding our Appropriations \nCommittee in passing these bills with significant bipartisan \nmajorities.\n  We continue to need the help of all Members to complete our work \nprior to November 7.\n  Mr. President, I do not hope to come back to this floor again during \nthis session of Congress to seek another continuing resolution.\n  We have very difficult policy issues to be settled on foreign \noperations, the Labor bill, and the Commerce bill, but I do believe we \ncan complete the budget aspect of those bills this week. The \ncontroversial riders that are attached to the bills will dictate \nwhether we can complete all of our work on these appropriations bills \nwithin this extended period.\n  I urge Senators who are concerned about these bills to support this \ncontinuing resolution, to give the committee the time it needs to work \nout the remaining differences between the House and the Senate on the \nbills that I have just enumerated.\n  Mr. President, again, it is my hope that we will, in this session, \npass the separate appropriations bills, let the President exercise his \nwill with regard to each bill, and conduct our affairs in the \nAppropriations Committee with separate appropriations bills and not to \nhave one all-encompassing global type of continuing resolution as we \nwind up this session.\n  It is possible, Mr. President, to do our job, as we should do it--13 \nseparate bills. That is my plea to the Senate. Help us work out the 13 \nseparate bills.\n  I thank the President and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation that the \nSenate may soon consider. The number of this bill is S. 270; it is the \nTexas low-level radioactive waste disposal compact bill.\n  As my colleagues know, the Congress is supposed to consent to all \ninterstate compacts, which are contractual arrangements between States. \nIn this case, we are asked to give our consent to the shipment of low-\nlevel nuclear waste from Maine and Vermont, and potentially other \nStates, to Texas for disposal. I am opposed to this legislation as it \nis currently written. I want to make clear today what my intentions \nare.\n  Mr. President, we will have further opportunity to debate this \nlegislation in full, and I do not intend to engage the bill's \nsupporters today. I certainly never intend for this to become an \nacrimonious or bitter debate. But I want to publicly explain my \nopposition to this legislation and also what I intend to do.\n  I do not believe that it is the intention of the bill's sponsors, my \ngood friends from Maine and Vermont, to do anything to harm the \ncitizens of Sierra Blanca, TX, through this compact. My friends from \nNew England are attempting to meet the concerns of their constituents. \nThey just want to get rid of this nuclear waste and they want to figure \nout how to dispose of it. They want to get it out of their own States. \nI also understand that no one wants to have a nuclear waste dump in \ntheir neighborhood.\n  Now, this compact legislation says little about where the waste \nshould go in Texas, other than that the State of Texas has an \nobligation to find a site. The State legislature in Texas has decided \nthat there indeed will be a site and it will be in a small town in \nHudspeth County, TX. My friends from Maine and Vermont, with whom I \nagree on many issues, and whom I enjoy working with, have not said that \ntheir State's nuclear waste should go to Sierra Blanca. But the effect \nof this legislation is to create a low-level nuclear waste dump site in \na dusty little town in Texas called Sierra Blanca near the border with \nMexico, about 60 miles east of El Paso.\n  Mr. President, I believe that there are many concerns that have been \nraised about the siting of this dump and the enactment of this \nlegislation, including environmental issues, seismic problems, economic \nviability, current legal actions, and our relations with Mexico.\n  But I want to talk about one issue and one issue only, and hold what \nmay be the first debate we have ever had on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate that deals with environmental justice, which is a shorthand way \nof talking about the disproportionate exposure of ethnic minorities and \npoor people to environmental pollutants. That is to say, all too often, \nwhen it comes to where we site these nuclear waste dump sites or where \nwe put an incinerator, we tend to locate them in communities where \nthere is a disproportionate number of people of color or poor people \nbecause they don't have the political clout.\n  Why do I raise the issue of environmental justice on a bill that \nprofesses to do no more than grant the Congress' consent to a compact \nbetween Maine, Vermont, and Texas for the disposal of nuclear waste? \nBecause it is this bill which will enable Maine and Vermont to indeed \nship nuclear waste to Texas--and I understand why they are trying to do \nit--but also because Texas has made it very clear where it intends to \nlocate the dump site. That dump site, not surprisingly, is located in \nan area of west Texas that is populated disproportionately by poor \nHispanics. This happens over and over and over again in our country. \nWhen we want to figure out where we are going to put the nuclear waste, \nwe look to where the poor people live, to where communities of color \nwithout the economic clout live, and that is where we put it.\n\n  Is the proposed location of the dump in a poor community simply a \ncoincidence, I ask my colleagues? Was it chance that the dry, sparsely \npopulated county in Texas tentatively chosen for the dump site is 66 \npercent Hispanic with 39 percent of the people living below the poverty \nlevel? There certainly were other scientifically acceptable sites for \nthe dump, so why did the Texas Legislature choose this spot, the sixth \npoorest county in Texas, with a high minority population, a low median \nhousehold income and a sludge dump?\n  The answer to these questions is simple. We in this body understand \nthe answer to this question all too well. It was politics. The \ncommunity living near the site singled out by the Texas Legislature did \nnot have the political clout to keep it out. While all the other \ncandidate sites were able to deflect the dump, Sierra Blanca, in far \nwestern Texas, a poor community, a Hispanic community, did not pack the \npolitical punch of the communities near the other possible sites.\n  Another question that has arisen is, why am I, as a Senator from \nMinnesota, involving myself in the decision of the Texas Legislature to \nselect a particular Texas site for a nuclear waste dump? For this \nreason, colleagues: It doesn't just happen in Texas, it happens all \nover this country. Poor and minority communities, unable to protect \nthemselves in the political arena, find the old plumber's maxim is as \ntrue as ever: ``Waste flows downhill,'' both figuratively and \nliterally, and if you are at the bottom of the socioeconomic slope, the \npollution lands on you.\n  That is what this is all about. That is what this cry for \nenvironmental justice is all about. I predict that eventually \nenvironmental justice will become a huge issue in the Congress. To \nrepeat, it is the old plumber's maxim that ``waste flows downhill, both \nfiguratively and literally, and if you are at the bottom of the \nsocioeconomic slope, the pollution lands on you.''\n  I am standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate today to say that \nenough is enough. Until more of us say enough and we face up to the \nenvironmental injustices that we may contribute to in the granting of \nour consent in legislation such as this, poor and minority communities \nwill continue to suffer disproportionately from environmental \ndegradation in our country. We are in desperate need in the United \nStates of America of a meaningful dialog on environmental justice. I \nbelieve Americans understand the need for fairness, and I want \nAmericans to understand that we have to address environmental justice \nwhenever we think about how to deal with problems like waste disposal. \nAll our actions have moral implications, and what we decide on \nlegislation like this can ultimately harm our most vulnerable citizens.\n  I intend, Mr. President, to have a full debate on environmental \njustice. I want Members to explain why we should overlook the \nenvironmental justice implications of our actions in this instance. I \nwant to talk about how this situation is symptomatic of many situations \nthat we face in our country today. I want the U.S. Senate, as a body, \nto reflect on the consequences of pollution on poor and minority \ncitizens all across the United States of America. I also intend to \noffer an amendment which adds one additional condition to Congress' \nconsent to the compact. That condition is essentially that Congress \ngrants its consent as long as the compact is not implemented in a way \nthat it discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, or \nincome level. Specifically, it will be designed to allow people who \ndon't have the chance to fight fairly in the political process to make \ntheir case in the courts. I want to give poor and minority people, \ncommunities of color, a chance to fight this out in the courts.\n  That is the very point of environmental justice. When the political \nprocess fails, environmental justice means trying to level the playing \nfield, sometimes forcing conflict into a more evenhanded forum in this \ncountry. In this particular case, that would be the courts. I am sure, \nMr. President, that none of our colleagues would argue that it is \nacceptable to discriminate against people by locating a nuclear waste \ndump site in their community. That being the case, it is a simple \nmatter to say that if the location of the compact dump discriminates \nagainst people on the basis of their race or economic status, Congress \nwill not consent to this compact. That will be the\n\n[[Page S10920]]\n\namendment I will bring to the floor if this compact is brought to the \nfloor. I think this will happen and we will have this debate, and I \nthink it will not be an acrimonious debate, but it will be one of the \nfirst debates we have ever had in the Senate on environmental justice \nor environmental injustice.\n  I would like to make one point crystal clear. I am not rising in \nopposition to compacts. My amendment does not pass judgment on the \ncompact this bill attempts to create. Rather, it is designed to give \nthe citizens of Sierra Blanca, a poor Hispanic community, another tool \nto have their voices heard above a political process that would just as \nsoon ignore them. I hope my colleagues will recognize our obligation to \nthe people of Sierra Blanca and to all our citizens in taking a stand \nfor environmental justice.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to this debate. I will bring to the \nfloor documents and other information for discussion. I will raise \nimportant questions as a Senator. It will be a civil debate, but I feel \nvery strongly about this. What has happened to the people of Sierra \nBlanca, or what might happen to them, is all too indicative of what \nhappens all too often to those communities that are the poorest \ncommunities, communities of color that over and over and over again are \nasked to carry the disproportionate burden of environmental \ndegradation. It is not fair to these citizens. It is not fair to their \nchildren. It is not fair to their families. It is not fair to their \ncommunities. I believe this is a fundamentally important question that \nwe have to address as an institution, as the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. For the moment, I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I would like to comment on what is a \nchallenge unique in human history that we face as a nation, and I am \ntalking about global warming. It is unique because we have to make \nimportant decisions without a visible crisis staring us in the face.\n  In the 1970's, we had the long gas lines, we had two oil price \nshocks, the taking of hostages by a revolutionary mob in Iran, and that \nspurred our Nation to reduce its reliance on oil. And in the 1960's and \nthe 1970's we had the dark clouds of particulates and the smog that \nsmothered urban areas which moved us to clean up the air. Today, we are \nfaced with a potentially greater threat, but it is not a visible \nthreat. We are talking about something that is going to happen, \nsomething that is going to affect our children and their children, and \nthe question is what are we going to do? It is a challenge for my State \nof Minnesota. It is a challenge for our country. It is a challenge for \nthe whole human race. It is also a challenge about leadership. I am \ntalking about the problem of global warming, the problem of climate \nchange.\n  In 1992, for the Earth summit, President Bush made a commitment to \nreturn greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and we have \nnot lived up to that commitment. We have not honored that commitment. I \nbelieve the President, in 1993, made a similar commitment that we would \nreduce our greenhouse gases to the 1990 level by the year 2000.\n  I believe that the President's announcement today will fall far short \nof meeting this challenge--but I certainly want to say to the President \nand to the White House that I appreciate their efforts to try to move \nthis process forward as we move toward a very important international \ngathering in Kyoto.\n  For more than a decade, the scientific community has investigated the \nissue. Initially, its reports called for more research, better modeling \ntechniques, more data. But in December 1995, the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, composed of more than 2,000 scientists from \nmore than 100 countries, concluded that there was a discernible human \nimpact on global climate. In June, more than 2,000 U.S. scientists, \nincluding Nobel laureates, signed the Scientists' Statement on Global \nDisruption, which reads in part that the accumulation of greenhouse \ngases commits the Earth irreversibly to further global climate change \nand consequent ecological, economic and social disruption.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe as a Senator from Minnesota that we have \nreached a point where unduly delaying action on reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions is foolhardy and it is tantamount to betrayal of our future \ngenerations. We know what this is going to do. The consequences can be \ncatastrophic for our country and for the world, and I believe that the \nPresident and the United States of America have to do better in \naddressing this challenge.\n  What has saddened me about this debate is that I believe we should be \nbelow 1990 levels certainly before the year 2010. I believe our country \nshould make a commitment to meeting these kind of targets. I think the \nevidence shows that as opposed to being on the defensive, we should be \nproactive, and the very bridge the President talks about building to \nthe next century is going to be a bridge that combines a sustainable \nenvironment with sustainable energy with a sustainable economy. I think \nthe country that is the most clean country is going to be the country \nwith an economy powered by clean technologies, industries and \nbusinesses. It is going to be a country run with an emphasis on energy \nefficiency and with a renewable energy policy. It is going to be a \ncountry which will generate far more jobs in the renewable energy and \nclean technology sectors, which are labor intensive, small business \nintensive and community building sectors.\n  We have an opportunity as we move into the next millennium to really \ncreate a new marriage between our environment and our economy. We are \nall but strangers and guests on this land, as the Catholic bishops have \nsaid. We have to take action now. What the President is calling for is \nnot likely to be enough to address this challenge and the task before \nus. We can do better as a nation. We can be more respectful of our \nenvironment while still growing our economy.\n  In the Red River Valley, the people of North Dakota and people of \nMinnesota went through a living hell this past winter and spring. We \ndon't want the floods in the Red River Valley to be 5-year occurrences. \nAnd there will be other catastrophic consequences from global warming. \nFor my State it could be agricultural devastation; for my State it \ncould be deforestation and lower lake levels in the Boundary Waters, an \narea that we love, a crown jewel wilderness area in northern Minnesota.\n  The more important point, however, is that not only for ourselves but \nfor our children and grandchildren we need to take much stronger \naction. We have to stand up to some of the powerful forces that are \nsaying no to a meaningful treaty. We have to lay out a proactive, \npositive agenda which makes it crystal clear that energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy and clean technologies will create many more small \nbusinesses and many more jobs for our country. This marriage between \nour economy and our environment would respect the environment, respect \nthe economy, and would give us an energy policy that is much more \nproductive and positive, while helping us to build and sustain our \ncommunities and our country.\n  I am disappointed in the position the President seems to have taken \non targets and timetables for climate change action. I hope as we move \nforward toward an international treaty, our country will take a \nstronger negotiating position. We need to be the leaders of the world \nin meeting what I think is perhaps the most profound environmental \nchallenge which we have ever faced.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, next week Chinese President Jiang Zemin \nwill arrive for his first State visit, the first State visit by a \nChinese leader in 12 years. As this visit approaches, I rise to discuss \nour China policy and the things we might hope to see from this event.\n  Let me begin with the broad goals of our Asia policy. I think they \nare clear. First, a peaceful Pacific. Second, open trade. Third, joint \nwork on problems of mutual concern like environmental problems and \ninternational crime. And fourth, progress toward respect for \ninternationally recognized human rights.\n  Generally speaking, our Asian policy has helped move us toward these \ngoals. We have a permanent military force in the Pacific which, coupled \nwith strong alliances with Japan and South Korea, Thailand, the \nPhilippines, and Australia, has helped to keep the peace for 20 years. \nWhile we have a lot of work ahead on Asian trade, our work has produced \nover $100 billion in export growth, an increase of 70 percent. That is \nsince 1991. We are beginning to adopt a more systematic approach to the \nregion's growing environmental problems, and can cite the \ndemocratization of the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, and South Korea \nas human rights success stories.\n  Where does China fit in? China is the largest country in Asia, the \nfastest growing economy, the largest military power, and the Asian \nnation with which our relationship has been most volatile during this \ndecade. If we can establish a stable, workable relationship with China, \nall of our goals will come closer to realization. If we cannot, both \nAmericans and Chinese, and other Pacific nations, will suffer a great \ndeal.\n  Next week's summit offers us a chance to make a start. Following it \nmust be a work program focusing on a very practical agenda. And as we \napproach the summit, I think we can help ourselves by putting the \nissues we must address in three broad categories. They are: mutual \ninterests, areas of dispute, and issues we will face in the future.\n  First are the areas where we have mutual interests.\n  Regional security is one case. We must work with China to maintain \npeace in Korea. Both countries want to avoid a conflict over Taiwan. We \nneed to ensure that Japan does not feel pressured to become a military \npower. On weapons proliferation, if India and Pakistan develop nuclear \nmissiles, China will suffer from it a lot more than we would.\n  Environmental issues are another matter. We both need to ensure \nsustainable management of fisheries and to address air pollution and \nacid rain problems caused by the boom in Chinese power production. We \nalso must work much closer together to do our best to protect \nbiodiversity and prevent large-scale climate change. One concrete \nproposal that will help in this area, if the public reports that China \nhas agreed to our proposals on nuclear proliferation are accurate, is \nopening up civil nuclear technology sales.\n  A number of domestic Chinese issues also fall into this area. Helping \nChina establish a broad rule of law will contribute to our human rights \ngoals.\n  Labor safety is a second case where we could contribute to China's \nown efforts to improve factory safety and improve the lives of many \nordinary Chinese; and helping Chinese farmers take advantage of cleaner \npesticides, modern agricultural technologies, and an up-to-date \ninfrastructure is a third.\n  We also clearly have some disputes with China. We should not make \nthem the whole focus of our relationship, but neither should we try to \nduck them.\n  At times we will need simply to understand one another's positions \nand agree to put off disagreements into the future.\n  Taiwan policy has been handled reasonably well in this manner for the \npast few decades. Perhaps with some adjustments in detail, we should \ncontinue that policy.\n  Likewise, China has recently expressed some unhappiness with our \nstationing of troops in Asia. They need to understand that the issue is \nbetween us on the one hand and Japan and Korea and our allies on the \nother. It is not on the table for discussion.\n  In other areas we should expect to do better. We seem to be doing \nwell in nuclear proliferation. It is my hope that the President will \nseal that achievement by certifying China as in compliance in the \nnuclear area, and open up civil nuclear power trade with China. On \nmissiles and chemical weapons, we see less thus far. And while I do not \nregard sanctions as a tool appropriate for every issue on the table \nwith China--and I do not believe Congress should be passing broad new \nsanction laws--these are areas where we should use targeted sanctions \nif necessary. We did this last spring in the case of the sale of \nchemical weapons precursors involving a Nanjing company. If it happens \nagain, we should use tougher penalties.\n  Trade is another example. Despite the optimism of United States \nbusiness, since 1980 our exports to China have grown more slowly than \nour exports to any other major market, whether it be Canada, Japan, \nEurope, Mexico, or ASEAN. Meanwhile, we have been tremendously generous \nto China, keeping our market to Chinese goods more open than any other \nin the world.\n  This is not acceptable. It is wrong when Chinese shoe companies can \nsell to Montana but Montana wheat farmers cannot sell to China. We \nshould expect China to be as fair and open to us as we are to them. And \nwe should offer an incentive to do that. Specifically, we should make \nMFN status permanent when China comes up with a good WTO package. But \nwe should also be clear that we cannot wait forever.\n  Our 5-year bilateral trade agreement negotiated in 1992 is about to \nbe completed. And if the pace of the WTO talks does not pick up soon, \nwe should use our retaliatory trade law, section 301, to win a broad \nsuccessor to it.\n\n  On human rights, while we should seek common ground and recognize \nwhere China is doing better, we should also not shrink from bringing up \nthe tough issues. The time is past when these questions could be \nconsidered strictly domestic concerns. We should bring up individual \ncases of political prisoners, ask for talks with the Dalai Lama and Red \nCross access to Chinese prisons. If the Chinese want us to stop \nsponsoring resolutions at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, they need \nto show some understanding of our concerns and the world's concerns on \nthese issues.\n\n\n                   THE ISSUES: LOOKING TO THE FUTURE\n\n  A third set of issues may be the most important of all, especially as \nwe approach a state visit and a summit. These are the issues we will \nface in the years ahead, and where mutual understanding beforehand is \ncrucially important.\n  The most important of all will be Korean unification. I recently \nvisited North Korea. Hunger is widespread and chronic. Economic life in \nPyongyang is at a standstill, with broken down streetcars in the middle \nof the road, empty streets and darkened buildings. And officials there \noffered no proposals for change other than planting more trees to \nprevent erosion.\n  This cannot continue forever. Whether it results from a violent \ncollapse, peaceful if belated reform, or even a desperate attack on the \nsouth, change is sure to come on the Korean Peninsula. There will be no \nbelligerent, autarkic regime on the Korean Peninsula.\n  And as Koreans sort out their own future, we will have to make some \nvery serious security and economic decisions in a very short period of \ntime. They will involve American troop movements and a crisis on the \nChinese border. And we need to ensure beforehand, through intensive \ndiscussions with China, Russia, Japan, and South Korea, that our \npolicies do not bring us into unnecessary disputes or conflicts with \nChina or any of Korea's neighbors.\n  We can all think of other issues. They include the effects of very \nrapid financial flows on fast-growing regions,\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\nthe potential of newly developed technologies to spur terrorism and \norganized crime. And the vulnerability of the new states on China's \nwestern border to civil war and religious fanaticism, which we hardly \nthink about but which the Chinese Defense Minister told me last winter \nwas, together with Korea, the most serious security issue China faces \ntoday.\n\n\n                       IF THINGS GO WRONG ANYWAY\n\n  One final point. China policy does not exist in a vacuum. We should \ndo our very best to make this relationship work. But we cannot predict \nthe course China will take. And so, as we think about China policy, we \nmust also think about broader Asian policy.\n  If we manage our alliances with Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, \nand Australia well; preserve our commitment of troops in the Pacific; \nand protect our own economic and technological strength, we will be \nable to handle whatever lies ahead.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  But I believe we can do better than that. I have met this year with a \nnumber of Chinese officials, including the President as well as senior \nmilitary officers and trade officials. And I think the Chinese on the \nwhole are pragmatic people who understand the importance of this \nrelationship to their own country. And I believe they are interested in \nworking with us to set it right.\n  So as this summit approaches, we have a great opportunity to set our \nrelationship with China on the right course to create a stable, long-\nterm relationship that contributes to our goals: peace, prosperity, \nenvironmental protection, and human rights. It is a great chance, and \nwe must not miss it. Because the issues dividing us may be many and \ncomplex. But the basic choice is simple. China will be there for a long \ntime. So will we. And both governments can either try their best to get \nalong, or all of us can suffer the consequences.\n  It's just about that simple, and that important.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Madam President, as chairman of the International \nNarcotics Control Caucus, sometimes called the drug caucus of the U.S. \nSenate, I periodically report to the Senate on trends in the use of \ndrugs and the dangers thereof that go on in our society.\n  This month of October in my State of Iowa is called Drug-Free Month. \nI want to bring my colleagues' attention to this fact and the reason \nfor it. Iowa has only 2.8 million people. As you know, it is largely a \nrural State. Des Moines, our largest city, numbers fewer citizens than \none of the suburbs of some of our Nation's big cities. There are more \npeople in the Los Angeles area or Chicago than in all of my State of \nIowa. We are a closely knit community, proud of our commitment to \nfamilies and the virtues of self-reliance, hard work and personal \nresponsibilities.\n  These facts, however, do not mean that Iowa is isolated from the \nmainstream or provincial in its thinking. This also does not mean that \nIowa is free of the problems that beset States with larger cities and \nmore people. We, in Iowa, unfortunately, see our share of gang violence \nand teen drug use. Indeed, Iowa shares in the growing drug problems \namong the young, the same that troubles the rest of the Nation. The \nfact that this problem reaches beyond our larger States and beyond our \nbig cities into our rural heartland should tell us something about the \nfar-reaching nature of our national--and I emphasize national--drug \nproblem.\n  According to recent numbers from my State of Iowa, as many as 11 \npercent of our high school seniors are regular users of marijuana. This \nnumber is up dramatically from just a few years ago. This number is \ngrowing as more kids at even younger ages no longer see using heroin as \nrisky or dangerous. In the last few years, the number of regular users \nhas grown steadily, whether it is in Iowa or across the country. In \naddition, we know from experience and research that as marijuana use \ngoes up, so does drug use of other varieties.\n  We now have a major problem in my State of Iowa in methamphetamine. \nThis problem has exploded in just the last few years, paralleling the \ntrend in the West and the rest of the Midwest. Reports of treatment \nepisodes for meth problems in my State of Iowa soared over 300 percent \nbetween 1994 and 1995. The trend continues. Just as troubling is the \neffort by the criminal gangs to site the labs that produce and sell \nthis poison to our kids in Iowa. This is something that we are seeing \nthrough the West and Midwest, and the problem is moving eastward.\n  The lab problem is a double whammy. The labs produce a dangerous drug \nthat poisons the hearts and souls of our kids and then they create a \nvery dangerous environmental hazard requiring cleanup wherever the labs \nare found. Cleanup is risky, dangerous, costly. Many of our local fire \nand police departments lack the resources or the training to deal with \nthe problem of cleaning up meth labs.\n  This problem and the trends that I have noted are not unique to Iowa. \nThey are indicative of what is happening across the country. They are \nhappening because we have lost our fear of drugs. We have let our guard \ndown. Into that environment drug pushers and drug legalizers have \nstepped in to do their own song and dance. They are making gains; we \nare losing ground. And it is the kids who are paying the price.\n  Two very important concerns are being missed. The first is the \nserious nature of the growing drug use among kids. The second is the \ngrowing tendency to regard this trend with complacency, or worse, to go \nalong with the drift into a de facto legalization of dangerous drugs. \nThe last time we as a country did this we landed ourselves into the \nmidst of a major drug epidemic. We were just beginning to dig ourselves \nout from the 1970's and 1980's. Now it seems the earlier lessons are \nforgotten.\n  There is no way to put a happy face on what is happening. It is not \nhard to describe. It is not difficult to understand. It is not beyond \nour power to do something about it. Yet what is happening is happening \nright under our very noses, and to date what we are doing about it is \nnot working. This is what is happening:\n  Between 1992 and 1995, marijuana use among kids aged 12 to 17 has \nmore than doubled--from 1.4 million to 3.1 million. More than 50 \npercent of the high school seniors have used drugs before graduation; \n22 percent of the class of 1996 were current users of marijuana. LSD \nuse by teens has reached record levels. Evidence indicates that the \ncurrent hard-core addict population is not declining.\n  Hospital emergency room admissions for cocaine-related episodes in \n1995, the last year for which there is complete information, were 19 \npercent above the 1992 levels. Heroin admissions increased almost 60 \npercent. Drugs of every sort remain available and of high quality at \ncheap prices while the social disapproval has declined, especially \namong policy leaders and opinion makers.\n  Hollywood and the entertainment industry are back in the business of \nglorifying drug use in movies and on TV. There is a well-funded \nlegalization effort that seeks to exploit public concerns about health \ncare issues to push drug legalization, most often under the guise of \nmedical marijuana.\n  Opinion polls among kids indicate that drugs and drug-related \nviolence are their main concerns. They also make it clear that drugs \nare readily available in schools, and the kids as young as 9 and 10 \nyears are being approached by drug pushers in school or on the way to \nschool.\n  This is only part of what is happening. Taken together, what these \nthings indicate is that we are experiencing a rapid increase in teenage \ndrug use and abuse. This comes after years of progress and decline in \nuse. These changes are undoing all of the progress\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\nthat we had made during the 1980's. If the trend continues, our next \ndrug epidemic will be worse than the last one. We will not only have \nthe walking wounded from our last epidemic--there are over 3 million \nhard-core addicts--we will also have a new generation of substance-\ndependent kids moving into adulthood. As we learned, or as we should \nhave learned during the last time that we went through this, this \ndependence is not a short-term problem. For many addicts, it is a \nlifetime sentence.\n  For the communities, families, and the Nation that must deal with \nthese people and with the problems associated with it, it is also often \nan open-ended commitment.\n  Along with this comes all the associated violence that has made many \nof our inner cities and suburban neighborhoods dangerous places. Not to \nmention the medical and related costs in the tens of billions of \ndollars annually. And all of this for something that advocates reassure \nus is purely a personal choice without serious consequences. This is \none of those remarks that should not survive the laugh test.\n  The fact that it does, however, and people can somehow make light \nthat personal choice of drug use is not something to worry about and \ndoesn't have serious consequences is an indicator of our problem in \ncoming to terms with the drug use.\n  In the last 5 years, the record on drugs has gotten worse. Pure and \nsimple. It's not because we are spending any less on the effort. \nIndeed, the drug budget has grown every year. One of the first acts of \nthe Republican Congress was to increase the money devoted to combat \ndrugs. Yet, the numbers on drug use grow worse.\n  One of the leading causes of that is a lack of leadership at the top. \nThe President and First Lady in previous administrations were visible \non the drug issue. That is not now the case. The present occupant of \nthe White House has put a great deal of emphasis on tobacco but he has \nbeen the Man Who Never Was on illegal drugs. More than this, the \nmessage about both the harmfulness and, just as important the \nwrongfulness of illegal drug use has been allowed to disappear. I leave \nto others to determine if the President's absence is because his \nadvisors believe he has no credibility on the issue or simply do not \ncare. Whatever the explanation, the result is an ambiguous message or \nno message.\n  If we could have the same message coming out of the White House on \nillegal drugs as we do on tobacco, I think we would be much further \nalong on the road to victory on the war against drugs.\n  We need to be consistent in our no-use message on illegal drugs. To \nbe ambiguous or complacent or indifferent sends the wrong message. The \nrecipients of that muddled message are kids. The consequences of \ngarbled messages can be seen in changes in attitudes about drugs, and \nin drug use numbers among kids at earlier and earlier ages. We cannot \nafford this type of unmindfulness.\n  That is why we are having Drug-Free Iowa Month. We need to come \ntogether as a community to recognize the threat and deal with it. We \nneed community leaders involved. We need our schools, politicians, \nbusiness, entertainment, sports, and religious figures to be aware of \nthe problem and engaged to deal with it. We can make a difference, but \nthat begins with awareness. It requires an effort. It requires \nsustaining that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on October 13, the Army Times had an \narticle by George C. Wilson entitled ``One Man's Fight for a Better \nWorld.'' It is about a man I admire as much as anyone I have met in my \nyears in the Senate, and that is Bobby Muller, the head of the Vietnam \nVeterans of America Foundation.\n  The article, written by George Wilson in his usual definitive and \nexacting manner, speaks about Bobby probably far better than I could \nand I am going to shortly ask to have the article printed in the \nRecord. The reason I want to do that--though I doubt that there are \nmany people in Washington who do not already know Bobby Muller, is \nbecause I hope those who read the Congressional Record will see this. \nHe has been my inspiration and really my conscience on so many issues. \nBut the thing that I think sets him apart from so many others is the \nfact that for well over a decade he has fought so hard to rid the world \nof landmines. He has done it not only in this country, in working with \nthose of us who have sponsored and backed legislation to ban landmine \nuse by the United States, but he has done it worldwide. He founded the \nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines. He was its inspiration.\n  I talked with him early one morning a couple of weeks ago after \nhearing that the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the \nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines, which was shared with its \ncoordinator, Jody Williams of Putney, VT. I said to Bobby at that time \nhow proud he must be because he is the one who started this campaign, \nand who hired Jody to coordinate it worldwide. Because of his vision \nand the hard work of so many people, in Ottawa this December some 100 \ncountries will sign a treaty banning landmines.\n  I am extremely proud of Bobby. I feel privileged to be his friend. I \nhave certainly been helped over the years by his advice and by his \nconscience.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Army Times, October 13, 1997]\n\n                   One Man's Fight for a Better World\n\n                         (By George C. Wilson)\n\n       ``Oh my God! I'm hit! My girl. She'll kill me. I can't \n     believe I'm dying on this piece of ground.'' Those were the \n     last conscious thoughts of Marine 1st Lt. Bobby Muller as he \n     lay bleeding on top of the hill he just taken in Quantri \n     Province, Vietnam, in 1969. An enemy bullet had pierced this \n     chest tumbled through his lungs and severed his spinal cord.\n       He woke up in a military hospital, astonished he was still \n     among the living. ``I'm here!'' his mind silently screamed at \n     him in astonishment, ``I didn't die.''\n       Like any 24-year-old, especially a former athlete, Muller \n     inventoried his body while lying in the hospital bed. He \n     discovered he was paralyzed from the chest down. He would \n     walk again, much less run with this old teammates or dance \n     with that girl back home.\n       The rest of this story could have been like that of so many \n     other Vietnam veterans that you and I have known, and perhaps \n     helped get through the night. An all-consuming bitterness \n     that eats away at everything: jobs, marriages, self-respect. \n     Nothing matters any more. The Vietnam War, for thousands of \n     young men, trivialized everything after it.\n       Not so with Bobby Muller. He is one of those welcome, \n     shinning Vietnam success stories, which I want to tell here, \n     because it is both timely and timeless. Doesn't matter if you \n     agree with him or not. To everyone from President Clinton, \n     who has sought his counsel, to the secretaries who work for \n     him at the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, Bobby \n     Muller is a man committed to leaving the world better than he \n     found it.\n       Of late, Muller, from his wheelchair, has been the most \n     credible and powerful voice arguing for ridding the world of \n     anti-people land mines, which kill or maim somebody somewhere \n     every 22 minutes. Years ago, he railed against the Vietnam \n     War, calling it an ``atrocity'' and demanded that the \n     Veterans Administration stop treating the men who got hurt in \n     it like lepers. Many VA hospitals really were as bad as the \n     one portrayed in the movie ``Born on the Fourth of July''.\n       ``People would call me a traitor,'' he told a television \n     audience, in recalling the reaction to his anti-war \n     statements in the 1970s. ``It's harder for me to repudiate \n     the war,'' the paraplegic told his detractors. ``Don't you \n     think I'd love to be able to wrap myself in the mantle of \n     being a hero? Don't you think I'd love to be able to say that \n     what happened to me was for a reason--it's a price you got to \n     pay for freedom? When I have to say what happened to me, what \n     happened to my friends, what happened to everybody over there \n     was for nothing and was a total waste, that's a bitter pill \n     to swallow.''\n       Muller did swallow the pill. It still burns in his gut. But \n     he has managed to use the burn to fuel his drive, not consume \n     it.\n       ``The reality of that war has stayed with me every day,'' \n     Muller has said. ``I know what it is to have people around me \n     die. I know what it is to hear the screams in the recovery \n     room. The most important thing for me in life is dealing with \n     those issues\n\n[[Page S10924]]\n\n     that come out of war. And particularly the Vietnam War.''\n       Muller learned the hard way that he had to mobilize not \n     only himself, but also other Vietnam veterans before he could \n     take the new hills he set out to conquer. He was thrown out \n     of the Republican convention in 1972 for shouting at \n     President Nixon to stop the war. He needed comrades and soon \n     got them, founding the Vietnam Veterans of America in 1978. \n     He left that membership organization in 1980 to found and \n     head the more broadly involved Vietnam Veterans of America \n     Foundation. Nobody throws Bobby Muller out of anywhere \n     anymore.\n       White-haired but still passionate about his causes, the 52-\n     year-old Muller has led the battle against land mines from up \n     front. How would you like to be Clinton and--in refusing to \n     sign the treaty banning anti-personnel land mines--pit your \n     thin credibility and bureaucratic rhetoric against such \n     penetrating statements as these from Muller, who had a mine \n     blow up near him before he was shot in Vietnam:\n       Land mines, mostly our own, were ``the single leading cause \n     of casualties'' to U.S. service people in Vietnam. ``Land \n     mines are not a friend to the U.S. soldier. They are a threat \n     to the U.S. soldier. The Pentagon is institutionally \n     incapable of giving up a weapon.''\n       I don't fault the Joint Chiefs of Staff for fighting to \n     keep their weapons, including certain types of land mines. \n     That's their job. And it was ever thus. But it's the \n     president's job to stand up to the chiefs if the Mullers of \n     the world have the more persuasive case.\n       ``I can't tolerate a breach with the Joint Chiefs,'' Muller \n     says Clinton told him. You can, and should, Mr. President. \n     You're our only commander in chief. And Bobby won't let you \n     forget it as he takes this new hill.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, there is much more I could say about \nBobby Muller, but I know what would happen if I went on longer. I would \nhear from him and he would chastise me for praising him, because Bobby \nalways finds others to praise. I have probably risked that already, but \nI want people to know that this is a man who has done so much for the \nworld and a man who should feel so honored by what he did to create the \nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines and by its receipt of the Nobel \nPeace Prize.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10923-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10924-S10927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPUBLICAN ATTACKS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last month, the President of the United \nStates devoted a national radio address to the threats being posed to \nour federal judiciary by the campaign of intimidation, including the \nstall in confirming judicial nominees for the almost 100 vacancies that \npersist nationwide. It is a sad day when the President must remind the \nSenate of its constitutional responsibilities to consider and confirm \nqualified nominees to the Federal bench. I regret that we have reached \nthis point.\n  The President's address was an important one. I hope that his call \nfor an end to the intimidation, the delay, the shrill voices of \npartisanship will be headed. I will continue to do all that I can to \ndefend the integrity and independence of our federal judiciary and to \nurge the Republican leadership of the Senate to move forward promptly \non judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \ntext of the President's address be printed in the Record at the end of \nmy statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have previously included in the Record on July 31 a \nletter dated July 14 to Senator Lott from the presidents of seven \nnational legal associations similarly urging the Senate to act to \npreserve the integrity of our justice system by fulfilling its \nconstitutional responsibility to expedite the confirmation process for \nfederal judges so that longstanding vacancies could be filled. These \nbar association presidents noted the ``looming crisis in the Nation \nbrought on by the extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial \npositions.''\n  Last month also saw the publication of a report by People for the \nAmerican Way entitled ``Justice Delayed, Justice Denied: The Right Wing \nAttack on the Independent Judiciary.'' This report concludes that the \ncampaign attacking the legitimacy of the judiciary and pressuring the \nSenate not to process the judicial nominees of the President is \nresulting in the judiciary not having the judges it needs to fulfil its \nresponsibilities:\n\n       Dockets are backing up, cases are going unheard for years \n     at a time, justice is being delayed. In the end, the right \n     wing's campaign has increased the risk that the law will not \n     be enforced because there are two few judges to enforce it.\n\n  During the week of September 22 through September 26, National Public \nRadio broadcast a series of five reports on the federal judge shortage \nby correspondent Nina Totenberg.\n  When a U.S. attorney can refer to the lack of courtrooms and Federal \njudges as a bottleneck in the criminal justice process and the chief \njudge of a Federal district court can acknowledge that the court is so \noverwhelmed with criminal cases that it is operating like an assembly \nline, that cases are not given the attention that they deserve and that \nyou know that you're making a lot of mistakes with--because of the \nspeed, we have reached a crisis. That is not American justice, that is \nnot the Federal justice system on which all of us rely to protect our \nrights while enforcing the law.\n  I have addressed the Senate on this problem on a number of occasions \nalready this year, including March 19, March 20, April 10, May 1, May \n14, May 23, June 16, July 31, September 4, September 5, September 11, \nSeptember 25, September 26, October 9, and October 21. I have spoken of \nit at meetings of the Judiciary Committee on March 6, April 17, May 22, \nJune 12, July 10, July 31, September 18 and October 9 and in Judicial \nCommittee hearings on March 18, May 7, June 25, July 22, September 5, \nand September 30.\n  The current vacancy crisis is having a devastating impact on the \nadministration of justice in courts around the country. Let me note a \nfew examples:\n  In the Northern District of Texas, a family filed their lawsuit 7 \nyears ago and is still waiting for their day in court.\n  Chief Judge J. Phil Gilbert, head of trial court in the Southern \nDistrict of Illinois, where two of the four judgeships are vacant, \nreported that his docket has been so burdened with criminal cases that \nhe went for a year without having a hearing in a civil case. That \nhappened despite the fact that 88 percent of the cases filed in all \nFederal trial courts were civil, while only 12 percent were criminal in \n1996.\n  In California, one family's 1994 lawsuit against police, filed after \nthe family's 14-year-old child was killed in a police chase 6 years \nago, is still pending.\n  In Oregon, the Federal courts has stopped doing settlement \nconferences, an invaluable tool for resolving claims before trial, \nbecause of the unavailability of judges.\n  Due to vacancy problems, the district court in San Diego is holding \nonly 10 civil trials per year.\n  In Florida, to reduce an expected backlog of 4,400 cases, 10 district \ncourt judges have announced that they will hold a 3-month marathon \nsession in Tampa next year.\n  In the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, for which the Senate has found \ntime to include as a rider on an appropriations bill a politically \ninspired plan to split the circuit but not to fill any of the 10 \nvacancies that plague that Court, 100 oral argument panels and 600 \nhearings were canceled this year due to lack of judges. As a result, it \ntakes a year after closing briefs have been filed to schedule oral \narguments.\n  Chief Judge Ralph Winter testified that the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals expects to include a visiting judge on 80 percent of its panels \nover this year in light of the four unfilled vacancies on that court \nand its burgeoning workload.\n  Across the country, the number of active cases pending for at least 3 \nyears jumped 20 percent from 1995 to 1996, and there are now more than \n16,000 Federal cases older than 3 years.\n  These are real life examples of the harm caused by the irresponsible \nlack of action by this Senate in considering highly qualified judicial \nnominations. It is time for the Senate to fulfil its constitutional \nresponsibility to confirm the Federal judges needed for the effective \nadministration of justice.\n  Judge Stephen Trott, formerly a high-ranking Reagan appointment in \nthe Department of Justice, included the following summary of the \nsituation in which the ninth circuit finds itself in light of the \nSenate's unwillingness to consider nominees to fill the vacancies that \nplague that court in an opinion that he wrote early this year:\n\n       With nine [now ten] vacancies out of twenty-eight \n     authorized judges in the United\n\n[[Page S10925]]\n\n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . . . one \n     wonders how Congress and the President expect us promptly to \n     process our ever increasing 8,000-plus caseload. . . . Our \n     current 9 [now 10] vacancies mean we will process 1,500 fewer \n     cases this year than we could with a full bench. To the \n     litigants who wait in line for us to resolve their disputes, \n     this unnecessary disability is unpardonable. . . . In a \n     country that prides itself on being a nation of laws rather \n     than just a nation of leaders, and which exalts the rule of \n     law as the appropriate method of resolving controversies, we \n     must do better in keeping our civil and criminal justice \n     system able without unnecessary delay to deliver to the \n     People the important promises of our Constitution.\n\n  In light of all of this, I was surprised to read the remarks of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee in response to the \nPresident of the United States in the Record for September 29. The \nSenator from Utah referred to myths and distortions, but I do not \nbelieve that he could have been referring to the statement by the \nPresident. The President spoke the truth. There is a vacancy crisis in \nthe Federal judiciary and there is a Republican slowdown of judicial \nconfirmations.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States recognized the crisis when in \nhis 1996 end of the year report he noted:\n\n       The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact \n     on the courts ability to manage its caseload effectively. \n     Because of the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in \n     comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the \n     vacancy rate is beginning to climb. . . . It is hoped that \n     the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize \n     that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and \n     effective administration of justice.\n\n  More recently, the Chief Justice termed the rising number of \nvacancies on the Federal bench ``the most immediate problem we face in \nthe federal judiciary.'' This is hardly a partisan statement but a \nrecognition of the seriousness of the crisis posed by judicial \nvacancies.\n  As for the slowdown, there are currently 27 judicial vacancies that \nthe Administrative Office of the United States Courts terms judicial \nemergencies because they have been vacant for more than a year and one-\nhalf. Last year the President had sent 15 nominees to the Senate to \nfill judicial emergencies and all were returned without action at the \nend of the year.\n  This year, after months of delay, the Senate finally filled judicial \nemergencies by confirming the nominations of Merrick Garland, Colleen \nKollar-Kotelly, Eric Clay, Arthur Gajarsa, Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr., \nJoseph Battalion, Katherine Sweeney Hayden, Richard Lazzara, Marjorie \nRendell, and Richard C. Casey. Some of these nominations were pending \nbefore the Senate for periods of 18 months, 12 months, 16 months, 16 \nmonths, 19 months, and 17 months.\n  Still, the Federal judiciary and American people face a record number \nof judicial emergency vacancies and await action on the nominations of \nAnn Aiken, James Beaty, Richard Caputo, William Fletcher, Bruce \nKauffman, Stanley Marcus, Michael McCuskey, Margaret McKeown, Susan Oki \nMollway, Margaret Morrow, Richard Paez, Anabelle Rodriguez, Michael \nSchattman, Christina Snyder, Clarence Sundram, Hilda Tagle, Jame Ware, \nand Helene White, who are pending before the Senate eager to get to \nwork and fill them.\n  We have seen 115 judicial vacancies over the course of this year. The \nSenate has seen fit to confirm only 21 nominees. More than 50 \nadditional nominees remain pending in committee and before the Senate. \nThe Senate is not even keeping pace with attrition. Since the \nadjournment of Congress last year, judicial vacancies have increased by \nalmost 50 percent. Indeed, this net increase in judicial vacancies, 29, \nstill exceeds the number of judges confirmed over the course of the \nyear, 21, and likely will when the Senate adjourns in November.\n  I have not attacked Senator Hatch on this floor and will not today. I \nknow that if it were up to him we would be doing better, we would have \nfewer judicial vacancies and they would have been filled more quickly. \nI have asked him to hold more hearings and to consider nominations more \nexpeditiously.\n  I thought we might be seeing a change in the atmosphere in the Senate \nin September. Anticipation of the President's radio address on the \njudicial vacancy crisis obviously reached the Senate. Even those who \nhave been holding up the confirmations of Federal judges were \nuncomfortable defending this Senate's dismal record of having proceeded \non only 9 of the 61 nominees received through August of this year.\n  As rumors of the President's impending address circulated around \nCapitol Hill, the Senate literally doubled its confirmations from 9 to \n18 in the course of 23 days in September and forth first time all year \nachieved the snail-like pace of confirming 2 judges a month while still \nfaced with almost 100 vacancies.\n  September was the only month all year that the Judiciary Committee \nheld two confirmation hearings for judicial nominees during a single \ncalendar month.\n  Following the wave of attention generated by the President's address, \nhowever, the Republican majority has reverted to its prior destructive \ncourse and the Judiciary Committee has yet to hold a hearing for any of \nthe more than 40 nominees who have yet to be according hearings this \nyear.\n  The President has sent the Senate 73 judicial nominations so far this \nyear. The Senate has confirmed 21 judges. From the first day of this \nsession of Congress, the Judiciary Committee has never worked through \nits backlog of nominees and has never had pending before it fewer than \n20 judicial nominees awaiting hearings. The Committee's backlog has \ndoubled, with 10 of these nominations having been pending since at \nleast 1996; 5 have been pending since 1995.\n  Early this year, Chairman Hatch worked hard to bring the nomination \nof Merrick Garland to a vote. He gave that nominee his strong personal \nendorsement and fought for him. After an 18-month delay over 2 years, \nthat outstanding nominee was finally confirmed 77 to 23. During that \ndebate, the Christian Coalition circulated a letter opposing this \noutstanding nominee. Senator Hatch concluded the debate on the \nconfirmation of Merrick Garland observing that he was sick of those \nplaying politics with judges. I agreed with him then and still do. \nUnfortunately, the stall has continued and some in his party have \ncontinued to play very dangerous politics with judges.\n  In the last five rollcall votes on judicial nominees, there has been \na cumulative total of one negative vote by a single Senator. Five \njudges were confirmed by unanimous rollcall votes and one was confirmed \n98 to 1. The only judicial nominee to receive any negative votes was \nJudge Merrick Garland of the District of Columbia Circuit. He was \nopposed by the majority leader and 22 other Republican Senators. He was \nwell qualified and was confirmed. That confirmation took over 18 months \nfrom when the Senate received the nomination.\n  Another of the well-qualified nominees who has been delayed far too \nlong is Margaret Morrow. I spoke of her earlier this week when the \nSenate acted in less than 7 weeks to confirm the nominee to the \ndistrict court in Utah. Unfortunately, not every nominee fills a \nvacancy in the home state of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  In contrast to the Senate's treatment of the Kimball nomination, \nMargaret Morrow's nomination has been pending before the Senate for \nover 16 months and pending on the Senate calendar awaiting action for \nmore than 7 months.\n  Last year this nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee and was left to wither without action for over 3 months. This \nyear, the committee again reported the nomination favorably and it has \nbeen pending for another 4 months. There has been no explanation for \nthis delay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this \nshameful treatment.\n  Senator Hatch noted in his recent statement on September 29 that he \nwill continue to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that he \nwill vote for her. He said: ``I have found her to be qualified and I \nwill support her. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she \ndeserved to have her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the \nmajority leader that she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to \nargue for and on her behalf.''\n  I have looked forward to that debate since June 12 when she was \nfavorably reported to the Senate for a second\n\n[[Page S10926]]\n\ntime. This is a nomination that has been pending for far too long and \nthat has been stalled here on the floor twice over 2 years without \njustification.\n  Meanwhile, the people served by the District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California continue to suffer the effects of this \npersistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being \ntried. This is one of the many vacancies that have persisted for so \nlong that they are classified as judicial emergency vacancies by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. There are four vacancies in \nthe court for Los Angeles and the Central District of California. \nNominees have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee for \nboth of the judicial emergency vacancies in this district but both \nMargaret Morrow and Christina Snyder have been stalled on the Senate \ncalendar.\n  This is a district court with over 300 cases that have been pending \nfor longer than 3 years and in which the time for disposing of criminal \nfelony cases and the number of cases filed increased over the last \nyear. Judges in this district handle approximately 400 cases a year, \nincluding somewhere between 40 and 50 criminal felony cases. Still \nthese judicial vacancies are being perpetuated without basis or cause \nby a Republican leadership that refuses to vote on these well-qualified \nnominees.\n  I am told that last week a Republican Senator announced at a speech \nbefore a policy institute that he has a hold on the Morrow nomination. \nA press release stated that he had placed a hold on Margaret Morrow's \nnomination because he wants to ``be able to debate the nomination and \nseek a recorded vote.'' I, too, want Senate consideration of this \nnomination and am prepared to record my vote.\n  After being on the Senate calendar for a total of 7 months, this \nnomination has been delayed too long. I believe all would agree that it \nis time for the full Senate to debate this nomination and vote on it. I \nhave inquired about a time agreement but gotten no response. Now that \nan opponent has finally come forward to identify himself, I look \nforward to a prompt debate and a vote on this nomination in accordance \nwith the apparent commitment of the majority leader. I look forward to \nthat debate. I ask again, as I have done repeatedly over the last \nseveral months, why not now, why not today, why not this week?\n  I again urge the majority leader to call up the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow for a vote. She has suffered enough. The people of the \nCentral District of California have been denied this outstanding jurist \nfor long enough. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last \nmonth that he had the assurance of the majority leader that she will be \ncalled up for a vote but neither has said when that will be. I hope \nthat the majority leader will proceed to the consideration of this \nnomination and that he will support Margaret Morrow to be a district \ncourt judge for the Central District of California.\n  Madam President, the reason I say that I am concerned that the \nPresident had to speak to this is that we should not have to be \nreminded of our constitutional duties. Indeed, the President was right \nin reminding us of this. I have served here now with numerous majority \nleaders--Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, Senator Robert C. Byrd of \nWest Virginia, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, Senator Robert Dole \nof Kansas, Senator George Mitchell of Maine--and all of these leaders \nof both parties are strong partisans for their parties, but all shared \nthe responsibility as majority leader that there are certain things the \nSenate must do, and it is the responsibility of the leader to see that \nthe Senate does it. One of those things, of course, is to see that the \nSenate votes on Presidential nominations to the Federal bench. Now, \nevery Senator can vote against any nominee. Every Senator has that \nright. They can vote against them this committee and on the floor. But \nit is the responsibility of the U.S. Senate to at least bring them to a \nvote. It is our responsibility under the Constitution, it is our \nresponsibility to the Senate itself, it is our responsibility to the \nAmerican public not to allow 1 Senator to determine for all 100 \nSenators whether a person will be confirmed to a Federal judicial \nposition or not. All Senators should be allowed to vote, and today they \nare not.\n  We really have not done our job as Senators. We have not fulfilled \nour responsibility to the Constitution. We have not fulfilled our \nresponsibility to this body. We have not fulfilled our responsibility \nto advise and consent. And we certainly have not fulfilled our \nresponsibility to the American people or the Federal judiciary.\n  I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will accept our \nresponsibility and vote people up or vote them down. Bring the names \nhere. If we want to vote against them, vote against them. But time \nafter time after time I hear that there are vacancies where people are \nreally concerned, a lot of Senators have a concern about this person. \nThen we come to a vote and 99 out of 100 Senators or all 100 Senators \nvote for that person.\n  This is not a fair way to do it. This is not being responsible. This \nis something, frankly, as I have said to my good friend, the majority \nleader, and he is my good friend, this is something that none of the \nmajority leaders I have served with have ever allowed to happen, \nRepublican or Democrat. Why? Because it would not be responsible. Why? \nBecause it affects the administration of justice. Why? Because it fails \nour responsibility to the American public. Why? Because it is beneath \nthe Senate of the United States. We should get on with the process.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              Radio Address of the President to the Nation\n\n       The President. Good morning. I want to talk this morning \n     about a very real threat to our judicial system. For more \n     than 220 years our nation has remained young and strong by \n     meeting new challenges in ways that renew our oldest values. \n     Throughout our history our judiciary has given life and \n     meaning to those values by upholding the laws and defending \n     the rights they reflect, without regard for politics or \n     political party.\n       That is the legacy of the judicial system our founders \n     established, a legacy we recalled this Thursday on the 40th \n     anniversary of the court-ordered desegregation of Little Rock \n     Central High School.\n       But in the past 18 months this vital partnership has broken \n     down as the Senate has refused to act on nomination after \n     nomination. And in federal courthouses across America, almost \n     100 judges benches are empty. In 1996, the Senate confirmed \n     just 17 judges--that's the lowest election-year total in over \n     40 years.\n       This year I've already sent 70 nominations to Congress, but \n     so far they've acted on less than 20. The result is a vacancy \n     crisis in our courts that Supreme Court Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist warned could undermine our courts' ability to \n     fairly administer justice.\n       Meanwhile, our courts are clogged with a rising number of \n     cases. An unprecedented number of civil cases are stalled, \n     affecting the lives of tens of thousands of Americans--from \n     the family seeking life insurance proceeds, to the senior \n     citizen trying to collect Social Security benefits, to the \n     small business protecting its right to compete. In our \n     criminal courts nearly 16,000 cases are caught in limbo, \n     while criminals on bail await punishment and victims await \n     justice. Our sitting judges are overloaded and overworked, \n     and our justice system is strained to the breaking point.\n       The Senate's failure to act on my nominations, or even to \n     give many of my nominees a hearing, represents the worst of \n     partisan politics. Under the pretense of preventing so-called \n     judicial activism, they've taken aim at the very independence \n     our founders sought to protect. The congressional leadership \n     has actually threatened sitting judges with impeachment, \n     merely because it disagrees with their judicial opinions. \n     Under this politically motivated scrutiny, under ever-\n     mounting caseloads, our judges must struggle to enforce the \n     laws Congress passes and to do justice for us all.\n       We can't let partisan politics shut down our courts and gut \n     our judicial system. I've worked hard to avoid that. And the \n     people I've nominated for judgeships and had confirmed have \n     had the highest rating of well qualified from the American \n     Bar Association of any President since these ratings have \n     been kept.\n       So today I call upon the Senate to fulfill its \n     constitutional duty to fill these vacancies. The \n     intimidation, the delay, the shrill voices must stop so the \n     unbroken legacy of our strong, independent judiciary can \n     continue for generations to come. This age demands that we \n     work together in bipartisan fashion--and the American people \n     deserve no less, especially when it comes to enforcing their \n     rights, enforcing the law, and protecting the Constitution.\n       Thanks for listening.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that upon the conclusion of the \nremarks by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. Abraham be \nrecognized to speak for not to exceed 10 minutes; that he be followed \nby Mr. Breaux for not to exceed 7 minutes; that he be followed by the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for not to exceed 30 minutes; \nthat he be followed by Mr. Gramm of Texas for not to exceed 20 minutes; \nthat he be followed by Mr. Baucus for not to exceed 20 minutes; that he \nbe followed by Mr. Warner for not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it may be those last four speakers will all \ncut their remarks a little short of what was included in the request.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I noted Senator Feinstein came to the floor earlier. \nDid you mean to include her in any way?\n  Mr. BYRD. I haven't spoken with her. Did she indicate that she wanted \nsome time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. She had at one time wanted to speak. I don't know \nwhether she would want to be included. I think it might be appropriate \nto name her in the request in the event she decided to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion \nof the remarks of the Senators aforementioned, the distinguished \nSenator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] be recognized for whatever \ntime she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10924-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10927-S10937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to raise certain issues about the \ncontinuing resolution which is before the Senate. It is a plan to \ncontinue the operation of Government for the next several weeks while \nwe finish the appropriations process. As you well know and as most of \nus are keenly aware, there are matters that are still in controversy in \nthe committees which are convened between the House and Senate to try \nto arrive at a final appropriations measure or a series of final \nappropriations measures that we could send to the President.\n  One of those contentious appropriations measures is the Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education appropriations bill. In that \nappropriations measure are a number of important things that relate to \nthe future of the country. I submit, however, that none are more \nimportant than the components of this measure that relate specifically \nto the education of young Americans. If I were to try to rank the \nresponsibilities of a culture, I would have to rank very close to the \ntop of the list the responsibility to prepare the next generation to be \nsuccessful and to survive. I suppose survival is more important than \nsuccess, but the idea that we have to prepare the next generation is a \nvery important idea, and we want to do more than just prepare it for \nsurvival. I think we want to prepare it for success.\n  The job of preparation has been labeled in a variety of cultures in \ndifferent ways. I think we expect a lot of the preparation to take \nplace in the homes of America. We expect a lot of parents, and I think \nwe have found that over the course of time we succeed most when we \nexpect a lot of parents and when we get high delivery from parents in \nterms of what happens to young people.\n  Parents are not expected to do it all, however. We have a pretty \nsubstantial education system in the country, public education if you \nwill, which is designed to help prepare young people for their lives in \nthe next century. I think the way in which we address those issues \nrelated to education is fundamental. It is very, very important. As the \nfather of three children, all of whom went to public schools, I know \nhow important it is, and I am delighted to say they are all doing \npretty well now, although my youngest is still in college so we want to \nmake sure he continues that particular practice of preparation.\n  Education is among the top priorities of a culture. The preparation \nof one generation, the development of the skills to survive and succeed \nin the next generation is a top priority, a top responsibility. That is \none of the reasons it demands our focus when the Federal Government \nstarts to expand its participation in or indicate its intention to \ninterfere with education as conducted at the local level. When the \nPresident of the United States in his State of the Union Message this \nyear indicated that he wanted to have a Federally developed test, that \nthere would be a test given to every fourth grade and eighth grade \nstudent across the country and that that test would be used to measure \nthe success or failure of education systems around the country, I think \na lot of us sat up and began to take notice. When there is talk about \nhaving a Federal test, a sort of one-size-fits-all test, with a group \nof bureaucrats in Washington deciding what would be tested and what \nwould not be tested and what teaching techniques would be honored in \nthe test and what teaching techniques would not be honored in the test, \nyou begin to raise questions about this most serious and fundamental \npart of preparing the next generation to both survive and succeed.\n  As a matter of fact, I think there is a role for Government, but I am \nnot sure about a uniformity that comes from Washington, DC, that \nignores or displaces the responsibility of parents and local school \nboards and teachers at the local level.\n  In my previous opportunities for public service, I had \nresponsibilities at the State level. I was Governor of the State of \nMissouri for 8 years, and education was one of our top priorities. We \nwanted to do what we could to make sure that we got the best \nachievement. After all, we did not necessarily want education for the \nsake of the education community. The focal point of education is the \nnext generation, and how well it prepares them, and so we want to \ntarget student achievement. We want to always be sensitive to what will \nbe the operative set of conditions which will result in the greatest \nstudent achievement, because if we can get students to achieve and \ntheir preparation is high and their skill levels are strong, they will \nbe survivors and succeeders in the next generation. They will be \nswimmers and not sinkers, and that is very important.\n\n  One of the things that I had the opportunity to do when I was \nGovernor of my State was to lead the Education Commission of the \nStates. This is a group of officials, legislators, Governors, and \nschool officials from every State in America, and they come together \nwith a view toward finding ways to sort of exchange information. They \nare able to share about what is working in a particular jurisdiction--\nit is a clearinghouse. It is a way to say maybe you ought to try this \nin your locality. Perhaps it would not work there but perhaps it would. \nWhat are ways we can improve?\n  The information we began to develop, at least I began to be aware of, \nwas that perhaps the single most important operative condition in \neducational achievement by students is the involvement of parents. How \ndeeply involved in the education progress and product and projects are \nthe parents? If the parents really care, if the community, meaning \nfirst the family, which is the fundamental building block of \ncommunities, and, second, the teaching community and, third, the larger \ncommunity, which we think of as our towns or neighborhoods, if all of \nthose institutions assign a very high value to education and are deeply \ninvolved in education and feel engaged in the educational experience, \nwonderful things happen to student levels of achievement.\n  I think we could all figure out that would be the case just by using \nour common sense. But we never leave everything to total common sense \nwhen we are considering policy. We like to have surveys and we like to \nhave education studies and control groups and\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\nthe like. But it is true that when families are deeply involved, when \nthe local culture assigns a very high value to education, when they \nfeel they are engaged, student achievement goes up substantially.\n  Let me give you the results of a 1980 report. It was published in \n``Psychology in the Schools'', and it shows that family involvement \nimproved Chicago elementary school children's performance in reading \ncomprehension. Here is the data. One year after initiating a Chicago \ncitywide program aimed at helping parents create academic support \nconditions in the home--in other words, involving parents in the \nschools--students in grades 1 through 6 intensively exposed to the \nprogram improved .5 to .6 grade equivalents in reading comprehension on \nthe Iowa Test of Basic Skills than students less intensively involved \nin the program.\n  Now, if you really talk about an improvement which is .5 to .6 over \nthe other students, you are talking about a 50 percent better \nperformance or a 60 percent better performance. That means if normal \nstudents went up 1 year of study, these students with activated home \nenvironments and engaged parents went up 1.5 years to 1.6 years.\n  That is a real increase. I think some of our manufacturers, if they \nhad the opportunity to get increases of 5 percent, not 50 percent, or \nincreases of 6 percent, not 60 percent, in their output, they would \nhave a tremendous competitive edge. But here is a study which says that \nwhen you actively engage parents, you get massive increases in the \nproductivity in terms of the achievement levels of students. This \nhappened when there was a contract signed by the superintendent, \nprincipal, teacher, parents, and student.\n  Note the involvement here. The school officials, the principals, the \nteachers, the parents, and the students. They stipulated that parents \nwould provide a special place for home study, that they would encourage \nthe child by daily discussion, attend to the student's progress in \nschool and compliment the child on such points, and cooperate with the \nteacher in providing all these things properly. This is real engagement \nby parents. More than 99 percent of the students in the 41 classes, \ngrades 1 through 6, held such contracts that were signed by all the \nparties. It is a clear example of the fact that student achievement \nskyrockets when you have a culture at the local level which is engaged \nin the development of school improvement policies. This study was from \n``School-Based Family Socialization and Reading Achievement in the \nInner-City,'' by H. J. Walberg, R. E. Bole, and H. C. Waxman in \n``Psychology in the Schools.''\n  National surveys also demonstrate this. Listen to this: a national \nsurvey reveals that parental involvement is more important in high \nschool achievement than is the parental level of education.\n  So what it is really saying is that having smart parents is not \nimportant in terms of your educational achievement. Having parents that \ncare about what you are doing and that are involved in the educational \nprocess, that is what drives student achievement.\n  A 1989 report found that, although parent education level and income \nare associated with higher achievement in high school, when \nsocioeconomic status is controlled, meaning if you will take \nsocioeconomic status out, only parent involvement during high school \nhad a significant positive impact on achievement. So the real operative \ncondition of student achievement in the high school years--we already \ntalked about the Chicago study which showed in grades 1 through 6 you \nhad a 50 to 60 percent improvement performance--but in the high school \nyears what really makes a difference is whether or not there is \nparental involvement.\n  The report documents that students who enjoyed the most parental \ninvolvement, the students who had the most reinforcement, the strongest \ninput from their culture, the ones who had the parents who were most \nlikely to be participants, were most likely to achieve higher \neducational levels than their counterparts who did not have such \ninvolvement.\n  It's kind of interesting. They developed a chart there. When parents \nwere highly involved during high school, 80 percent of their students \ngot additional education after high school. You see what this does for \nstudents is to energize them. They think, ``Education is important. I \nam going to get it. I am going to be involved in it.'' When parents \nwere only moderately involved during their children's high school \nyears, 68 percent of the students went on to studies after high school. \nWhen parents were not very involved, only 56 percent continued their \neducation after high school. It makes a big difference.\n  These statistics show that students who have lots of involvement by \ntheir parents during their high school years were nearly 1\\1/2\\ times \nas likely to get some postsecondary education or a BS or BA degree, as \nstudents whose parents were not very involved. Further, students of \nhighly involved parents are more than three times as likely to obtain a \nbachelor's degree than their counterparts whose parents were not very \ninvolved. This study used data from the 1980 ``High School and Beyond'' \nnational survey conducted by the National Center for Educational \nStatistics, particularly focusing on 11,227 seniors who participated in \nthe 1980 ``High School and Beyond'' survey, and in the 1986 followup \ndocumentation.\n  What we really have here is a fundamental understanding that when \nparents are involved in education, when parents are engaged in the \neducational process, students achieve. What I want to point out is when \nyou have the President of the United States starting to nationalize \nschools by saying we are going to have a test and we are going to ask \nthat everyone do, in school, what will show well on this test, you \nbegin to say that you are going to test for a particular standard. And \nyou begin to say we are going to make that standard up in Washington--\nnot by parents, not by local school boards, not by interested parties \nin the community at the local level--but we are going to have a group \nof bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who are unreachable, uninfluenceable \nby local parents, who are going to design a test.\n  Of course, you know in order to pass a test you have to know \nbasically what the test is wanting and you have to teach what the test \nwants. Once our schools begin the process of responding to the drummer \nin Washington, DC, teaching what that drummer wants instead of what is \nwanted at the local level, what is going to happen to parental \ninvolvement? How involved, how engaged, how important are parents going \nto feel when local school boards are no longer relevant? How successful \nare our students likely to be when their parents lose interest because \nno matter what they say they can't affect or change or direct the \napproach of their educational institutions, their schools?\n  I think the strong indication here is that when you start to \ndislocate parents from the process and put in their place a \nbureaucracy--one that is thousands of miles away in many instances--you \npull the rug out from under student achievement.\n  The ultimate objective we are talking about is preparing the next \ngeneration to be survivors in the next century; to be succeeders; to be \nswimmers, not sinkers. And they do that best when their parents and the \ncommunity is directly involved, has confidence in and is engaged in the \neducation process. The absence of parental participation in that is, I \nthink, a real threat to the success of our students.\n  Let me just take you to some more examples. California and Maryland \nelementary schools achieved strong gains in student performance after \nimplementing partnership programs which emphasize parental involvement. \nIf we say to the parents, ``You don't matter, you can't affect \ncurriculum, you can't affect what is being taught, we are going to \ndecide all that in a bureaucracy in Washington, you just do as you are \ntold,'' how much parental involvement are we going to be able to \nexpect?\n\n  I think people will really respond if they have the opportunity to \nlook carefully and participate in the development of curricula and the \nway the schools are run. Here is the data from California and Maryland, \nboth of which show strong gains in student performance after \nimplementing what are called partnership programs, which emphasize \nparental involvement. A 1993 study describes how two elementary schools \nimplemented a partnership program which emphasized two-way \ncommunication and mutual support between parents and teachers, enhanced\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\nlearning both at home and school, and joint decisionmaking between \nparents and teachers. Students at the Columbia Park School in Prince \nGeorges County, MD, ``who once lagged far behind national averages, now \nperform above the 90th percentile in math, and above the 50th \npercentile in reading, after implementing the Partnership Program. Here \nis kind of an interesting thing. There are already ways to find out \nwhether you are doing well, according to national averages. There are \nall kinds of tests that schools can implement in order to find that \nout.\n  What we are really saying here is that the operative condition is not \nsome set of new computers or new set of reading materials. The \noperative condition is a culture at the local level which assigns value \nto education and is engaged and is working to improve education. \nInstead of students that were below the 50th percentile, they are now \noperating above the 90th percentile. That is a formula for success \ninstead of failure. That's a formula for survival instead of difficulty \nin the next century.\n  Here is another example, one from the other end of the country. ``In \nits fourth year of the [partnership] program, the Daniel Webster School \nin Redwood City, CA, shows significant gains in student achievement \ncompared to other schools in the district. Webster students have \nincreased their average California Test of Basic Skills math scores by \n19 percentile points.'' That means if they were at the 50th percentile \nbefore the partnership program, they were at the 69th percentile at the \nnext testing period. They did this by having a situation in which \nparents were directly and substantially involved. ``In language,'' the \nstudy continues, ``most classes improved by at least 10 percentile \npoints. ``\n  What I am really trying to say here is that there is a fundamental \ntruth that when local governments and local education officials and \nparents are working together to determine the curriculum and to \nenergize student involvement and behavior, they produce success rates \nin school which are literally phenomenal. Remember the first of those \nrates we talked about in Chicago? That was a 50- to 60-percent \nimprovement over the other group that had not had as much parental \ninvolvement in the local program.\n  If we take the component of parental energy and parental involvement \nout of our schools by divorcing from local school boards the \nopportunities to shape curricula because we have a national test which \nrequires that everyone teach material which will help them survive on \nthe next national test, we will have done a grave injustice to the next \ngeneration. An increase in parent involvement leads to significant \ngains in student academic achievement in virtually every instance.\n  Here is one from Mississippi elementary schools. According to a 1993 \nreport of the Quality Education Program, which is designed to increase \nstudent success in school by increasing parental involvement, student \nsuccess was strengthened in seven school districts in Mississippi in \n1989. Between the 1988-89 school year, which was before the program was \nimplemented, and the 1990-1991 school year, the 27 participating \nschools, which serve 16,000 elementary school students, showed a 4.5-\npercent increase in test scores over control schools. So, just \nimplementing a program for increasing parental involvement resulted in \na very important increase in test scores in Mississippi. That program \nprovided, of course, a number of ways to engage parents in the process \nof being involved in schools.\n\n  I think it is a real, serious threat to parental involvement, local \ncontrol and a community and culture which cares about education when we \nsay we are going to take the fundamental decisions about what is taught \nand how it is taught out of local hands and we are going to put it into \nthe hands of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who operate under a third \nlevel wing of the U.S. Department of Education, individuals appointed \nby the Secretary of Education but really accountable to no one.\n  Even our U.S. Department of Education stated, in a 1994 report, that \n``when families are involved in their children's education in positive \nways, children achieve grades and test scores, have better attendance \nat school, complete more homework, and demonstrate more positive \nattitudes and behavior.'' That sounds like the ultimate in what you \ncould want. Here you have children who achieve higher grades and test \nscores, have better attendance, they complete more homework and they \ndemonstrate more positive attitudes and behavior. How do you get that? \nYou engage parents and the local community in building a culture which \nreinforces student achievement.\n  Sadly, Federal testing takes away local control and parental \ninvolvement. Education should be focused at the local level, where \nparents, teachers, and school boards can have the greatest opportunity \nto be involved in the development of school curricula and testing. The \nFederal Government should not impose its will on teachers, parents and \nschool boards about the education of their children. We should not have \na dumbed-down national curriculum imposed through the back door of a \nnational test. There are ways to test. There are ways to test at the \nlocal level. There are ways to compare local achievement to the \nperformance of individuals in other districts and across the Nation. \nThere are tests which are given across the Nation on a voluntary basis. \nThe Iowa Test of Basic Skills, the Stanford test, and a number of other \ntests are developed by private agencies. But they don't impose \ncurriculum because they are selected at the option of the schools.\n  The hallmark of the education proposals being considered by the \nCongress, rather than being proposed by the President, is a hallmark of \nlocal control and parental involvement. Look at the things that we have \nbeen discussing in the U.S. Congress. We have discussed the idea of \nscholarships for District of Columbia school children, giving parents \nmore choice and more opportunity for assigning their students to \nschools that are productive and schools that are helpful to their \nchildren. That is empowering parents. It is putting parents in the \ndriver's seat instead of the nickel seats. I believe we want parents in \nthose front seats.\n  We have proposed education block grants, which send dollars to the \nclassroom instead of the bureaucracy and move decisions from Washington \nto the local school districts. The Senate of the United States voted \nnot long ago to send the resources to the States, where the money could \nbe invested in classrooms, where the money could be invested in \nteachers, where the money could be provided to make a real difference \nrather than to say that the power would be somehow drawn to Washington, \nDC, or somehow provided to bureaucrats in some part of the Department \nof Education.\n  Here is another thing we are considering, A-plus accounts, that allow \nparents to save for their children's education and to make choices on \nspending resources for education.\n  Another thing we have been talking about is charter schools, creating \ninnovative schools that are run by parents and teachers, not a \nbureaucracy.\n  We have had an effort moving schools away from bureaucracy towards \nmore parental involvement, more and more active participation, hands-on \ncontrol and engagement by parents. That is the design of what we have \nbeen talking about in the U.S. Congress. Then the President comes along \nand says no, we need a program where we develop a test nationally. The \nfact of the matter is, if you test nationally you are going to drive \nthe curriculum nationally. You have to teach to the test, in order to \ndo well on a test. National testing transfers power from parents and \nschools to Washington. It is exactly the opposite of what we are trying \nto accomplish in education.\n  States, educators, and scholars all stress the importance of local \ncontrol in education decisions, and many of them stress the dangers of \nlosing such local control. Gov. George Allen of Virginia has developed \nwidely acclaimed Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, \nscience, history and social studies. And he stated the importance of \neducational reform at the grassroots level:\n\n       If there is one important lesson we have learned during our \n     efforts to set clear, rigorous and measurable academic \n     expectations for children in Virginia's public school system, \n     it is that effective education reform occurs at the \n     grassroots local and State level, not at the federal \n     government level.\n\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\n\n  That was in a letter sent to Congressman Goodling on July 29 of this \nyear.\n  Here is Theodore Sizer, a liberal critic of the national standards \nagenda, who acknowledges that who sets the standard and controls the \ncurriculum is crucial. Listen to Ted Sizer, a noted education \nauthority:\n\n       The ``who decides'' matter is not a trivial one. Serious \n     education engages the minds and hearts of our youngest, most \n     vulnerable, and most impressionable citizens. The state \n     requires that children attend school under penalty of the \n     law, and this unique power carries with it an exceedingly \n     heavy burden on policymakers to be absolutely clear as to \n     ``who decides'' and why that choice of authority is just. We \n     are dealing here with the fundamental matter of intellectual \n     freedom, the rights of both children and families.\n  Who decides? Theodore Sizer asks the question and says it is \ncritical. Very few times would we let someone decide what is done who \nis not paying the bill, not footing the tab. I mean, we usually say \nthat the person who makes the order gets to select from the menu.\n  Local governments and parents and communities pay 92 to 93 percent of \nall the bills for elementary and secondary education in the United \nStates. The Federal Government pays about 7 percent. In most settings, \nwe would say that the person who is picking up the tab should be able \nto pull the items off the menu to decide what he is getting. But \nthrough the back door of a national test developed by the Federal \nGovernment, we are in the position of saying to people, ``Yeah, you're \ngoing to have to continue with your 93 percent of the cost, but we're \ngoing to tell you what you have to teach and how you have to teach it; \nwe're going to tell you we know better than you do, and we'll be able \nto figure out from a thousand miles away in a conference room in \nWashington what is better for you and your family and your community \nthan you will.''\n  We have kind of gotten the genius of the democracy inverted. The \ngenius of a democracy is not that the Government would impose its \nvalues on the citizens, it is that the citizens tell Washington what to \ndo. I think in this instance, the citizens ought to say to Washington, \n``Wait a second, we are picking up 93 percent of the bill here, we \nshould make the decisions and we can make the decisions and we can make \nthem effectively. To yield to the bureaucrats in Washington, DC, the \nright to say what is going to be taught and how it is going to be \ntaught in our schools, no thank you.'' It would be a disaster. As a \nmatter of fact, it has been known and understood to be a bad idea for a \nlong time. Nearly 30 years ago, education Professor Harold Hand \naccurately framed the issue when discussing whether the Federal \nGovernment should institute a national testing program.\n  ``The question before us then,'' Professor Hand said, ``is whether \nthe national interest would be best served by embarking on a national \nachievement testing program in the public schools at the certain cost \nof relinquishing the principles of states and local control and of \nconsent as these now apply to the public schools.''\n  He points out clearly that there is a certain cost and the cost is \ngiving away your ability to control what is taught and how it is \ntaught.\n  This is being asked of the American citizens in spite of the fact we \nare going to say you still have to pay for it. ``Ninety-three percent \nof the tab is still going to be yours, but we want to make that \ndecision.''\n  I don't think there is any question about the fact that national \ntests will lead to a national curriculum. Acting Deputy Secretary of \nEducation Michael Smith has said:\n\n       To do well on the national tests, curriculum and \n     instruction would have to change.\n\n  So what we have here is an admission by those who are promoting the \nnational test. Their admission is that they would expect to change the \ncurriculum and to change instruction in order for people to do well on \nthe national test. That is one of the reasons I think the Missouri \nState Teachers Association, made up of 40,000 teachers in the State of \nMissouri, has stated:\n\n       The mere presence of a federal test would create a de facto \n     federal curriculum as teachers and schools adjust their \n     curriculum to ensure that their students perform well on the \n     tests.\n\n  Here you have it, 40,000 classroom teachers from the State of \nMissouri saying, ``Wait a sec, thanks but no thanks. We don't need a \nnationally directed curriculum that disengages the community, that \ndisengages the parents, that disengages the local school board, \nprincipals and teachers and mandates from Washington what to teach and \nhow to teach it.''\n  Test researchers George Madaus and Thomas Kellaghan point out that \nsome advocates for national tests advance the argument that ``a common \nnational examination would help create and enforce a common national \ncore curriculum,'' and that ``national examinations would give teachers \nclear and meaningful standards to strive for and motivate students to \nwork harder by rewarding success and having real consequences for \nfailure.''\n\n  What that really means is, if they are giving them a common national \nexamination and help enforce a common national core curriculum, then \nthe local level is no longer respected. It means that individuals at \nthe local level are no longer meaningful. How long can we expect \nparents to stay engaged and to be active participants and to endorse \nand reinforce what their children are doing if the parents are told, \n``No thanks, we don't care for your input, we'll settle this with a \ngroup of folks behind closed doors in a bureaucracy in Washington, \nDC.''?\n  Prof. Harold Hand, speaking on behalf of the Association for \nSupervision and Curriculum Development in opposition to the development \nof national tests, said:\n\n       A national testing program is a powerful weapon for the \n     control of both purposes and content of curriculum, no matter \n     where in the nation children are being taught, and so leads \n     to increasing conformity and restriction in curriculum.\n\n  When President Carter was considering a national test proposed by \nSenator Pell of this body in 1977, here is what Joseph Califano, \nCarter's Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, warned--Joseph \nCalifano is not thought to be a person who was some kind of iconoclast, \nwho was more interested or only interested in States rights, but here \nis what he warned:\n\n       Any set of test questions that the federal government \n     prescribed should surely be suspect as a first step toward a \n     national curriculum.\n\n  That is a substantial statement from a Secretary of Education. He \ngoes on to say, and this is striking:\n\n       In its most extreme form--\n\n  These are the words of Joseph Califano, President Carter's Secretary \nof Health, Education and Welfare. He says about a national test:\n\n       In its most extreme form, national control of curriculum is \n     a form of national control of ideas.\n\n  I find that to be a rather striking statement. I don't know whether I \nwould go so far as to say that, but I think it is pretty clear that we \nwant parents and teachers and community members and local school boards \nto be in charge of what is taught and how it is taught in our local \nschools, especially when they are being asked to pay 93 cents out of \nevery dollar committed and devoted to schools. I can't imagine saying \nto the parents, ``You don't matter anymore.'' I really don't like what \nthat says to children when we tell them, ``Really, the kind of \ndecisions about your future are so important we have to relegate them \nto Government in Washington, DC; we can no longer trust your parents to \nmake those kinds of decisions.''\n  I think all of us know we want to say to children in their school \nsystem, ``Respect your parents; there are things you can learn from \nyour parents, and if your parents are engaged with you in a partnership \nfor learning, your test scores and your achievement will go up and your \nlife will have a higher quality.''\n  It puzzles me to think that the President of the United States is \nsuggesting that we should go to a national testing operation which \nwould, as a matter of fact, drive curricula, and begin to take that \ncontrol away from the local governmental entities and deprive parents \nof their participation in the development of educational opportunities \nfor their young people.\n  There is a fundamental responsibility of our culture to help provide \na basis through education for the survival of our children in the next \ncentury. If we do that effectively, we will be successful as a culture. \nBut if we destroy the capacity of our young people to do well by \nnationalizing our schools and pulling the rug out from under those who\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nwould otherwise at the local level be able to make good decisions \nregarding schools and be involved with their children's education, we \nwill have done a disservice to this country, not only in this \ngeneration but in the next.\n  H.D. Hoover, the director of the Iowa Basic Skills Testing program, \nhas noted:\n\n       There is a whole history of trying to use tests to change \n     curricula, and the record there is not particularly sterling.\n\n  So the point is with the idea of national tests, you drive national \ncurriculum. Curriculum is, of course, the fundamental reason for \nschool. It is what is being taught, and if we drive and we dislocate \nparents and we take people from the local community out of the \nsituation where they can determine what is taught and how it is taught, \nwe will have impaired the quality of our schools very, very \nsignificantly.\n  I am not against tests, and I don't want it to be said that I am \nagainst tests because I don't think you can really have education \nunless you test to see whether or not you make progress.\n  There was a time, there was a set of fads that came along that said \nwe don't ever test anybody, we just hope they get excited about \nsomething and learn it and we don't give grades. You remember that. I \nunfortunately missed that. I was graded on almost everything I did.\n  But while I was teaching in college--and I spent 5\\1/2\\ years as an \nassociate professor, assistant professor--there were some of these fads \nthat came through where students wanted to take things pass-fail; just \nbe really vague about our performance here and don't tell anybody \nwhether we did well or did poorly.\n  Frankly, it was a cover for doing poorly. They would never ask that \nthey take a course pass-fail if they thought they were going to do well \nin it. But, of course, they were going to slide by and, of course, \nsuggest they take this pass-fail. I don't blame them. That makes sense.\n  So I am not against testing. I am in favor of testing. I think you \ncan overtest. You can spend all your time testing and do too little \nteaching. You can spend too much resource in testing and too little in \nteaching. But in a balanced program of testing and teaching, providing \naccountability both for teachers and students, and providing \naccountability to the community, I am in favor of that.\n  But if you take that accountability and you impose it from a thousand \nmiles away by a bureaucracy in Washington, DC, and you render powerless \nthe people who are out there on the front lines, and particularly \nparents and school board members, and you basically have what you would \ncall a national school board, so that they make the decisions in \nWashington--and the role of the local communities is to put up the \nmoney, but Washington decides what will be taught and how it will be \ntaught--I do not think that really provides the energy and the \nincentive to get the job done well. As a matter of fact, I think it \nwould be a disaster.\n  It is kind of interesting. A few years ago we had a rush to impose \nnational standards. I may talk about that a little bit later. People \nrejected national standards because they were afraid there would be a \nchange in curriculum based on national standards. Well, that is kind of \ninteresting.\n  Terrance Paul of the Institute of Academic Excellence, has stated it \nthis way:\n\n       Standards don't cause change.  . . . Tests with \n     consequences cause change.\n\n  Of course, some people may say, ``Well, the President wants to give \nthis test, but there won't be any consequence.'' Well, why give the \ntest? Frankly, we want something from our testing --and testing time is \na precious resource--we should use it effectively. We should use it at \nthe local level to test, to see whether or not we are achieving what we \nwant to do at the local level.\n  And to take that precious resource and to fill it up with tests from \nthe national level, that you say will not have any consequence, makes \nlittle sense. And to use resources--it costs to make tests.\n  The President's program, all told, is to be in the $50 to $60 million \nrange to develop tests for reading and mathematics. I think I could \ndevelop a test to see if people could add, subtract, and multiply and \ndivide, and if they could read for a little less than that. Be that as \nit may, I am not one of those that would be on this national testing \ndevelopment group that the President has suggested.\n  The important thing is that no one should devise a test for the local \ncommunity unless the local community asks for it. A local community has \na great opportunity to purchase tests and to deploy tests, administer \ntests that are either developed at the local level or developed by some \nnationally known, well-reputed testing agency in the United States, \nlike the Iowa Test of Basic Skills or some other analogous or similar \norganization.\n\n  There are a number of States--48 as a matter of fact--that have \ndeveloped or are developing State standards and State tests. To switch \nin midcourse from these would have a disruptive impact on those State \ntests and State standards, because you are going to have to teach to \nthe national test if we have a national test.\n  Teaching to that test will pull the rug out from under teaching that \nis designed to prepare individuals for the tests at the State level by \nsupplanting or superseding State and school district efforts. A \nnational test will undercut their efforts and impose a one-size-fits-\nall system.\n  I have a little story I like to tell about one size fits all, because \nI think one size fits all is one of the greatest ruses in history. It \nis a joke. If you were to order pajamas for your family out of a \ncatalog that says, ``one size fits all''--and for all five members of \nmine, if you were to send the same set, I guarantee you that we would \nrename ``one size fits all'' to ``one size fits none.''\n  The value of this country is that we have a lot of different \napproaches to things. It is a major strength of this country. What \nwould happen, for instance, if we were to take our computer industry--\njust an industry, for example--and decide that we were going to test \nall the computers in the same way, that they all had to have the same \nthing in them, they all have to meet the very same standards?\n  We would end up without competition, first of all. And we would end \nup without improvement because once people learned what the test was \ngoing to be, they would teach to that test and everybody would be \nuniform. We would not want it in industry. And we would not want it in \nautomotives because we know that when people compete and they do what \nworks best for them, we get the kind of energy in the economy and get \nthe energy in our culture that provides for improvement.\n  Problems that would result from a national test are a national \ncurriculum or national education standards. The National Assessment of \nEducation Progress' science tests results show how the test can drive \ncurriculum. Here is an article from today's Washington Post.\n\n       Still, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley cautioned that \n     the results may not be as dismal as they first seem. Student \n     scores in science have improved substantially since the early \n     1980s, he said, and many schools are revamping how they teach \n     the subject.\n\n  He said that revamping it, because of the new science test that the \nnational group put out, that they went down in performance and they \nwent against the trend that they had been going up in.\n  So we had a trend during the early 1980's of going up. Now they come \nout with a new test and they do not do well. And the Secretary of \nEducation says, ``Well, they'll do better on the new test because \nthey'll start teaching to this test.''\n\n  Well, first of all, if they were doing well on the other tests--or \nbetter--I wonder if we want to change and mandate the change through \nthis curriculum or through a curriculum change that is imposed by this \ntest, the National Assessment of Education Progress, the NAEP, test, \nwhich was in the paper today.\n  The scores were reported yesterday by the National Assessment \nGoverning Board. ``Education officials said the latest test results \npresent stark new evidence of a problem in how science is being \ntaught.'' They brought out a new test and they found out students did \npoorly on the new test. So they said: ``Well, we have got to change how \nthings are being taught. Too many schools, they contend, still \nemphasize\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\nrote memorization of facts instead of creative exercises that would \narouse more curiosity in science and make the subject more relevant to \nstudents.''\n  This whole endeavor suggests that they intend to shape how things are \ntaught from the education bureaucracy. And they admit that that is the \nway change will take place.\n  In discussing proposed changes to the National Assessment of \nEducation Progress, back in 1991, Madaus and Kellaghan described the \ndanger caused by the momentum of instituting a national test. Here is \ntheir quote.\n\n       Current efforts to change the character of [the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress] carry a clear lesson \n     regarding the future of any national testing system. That is, \n     testing and assessment are technologies.  . . . Further, the \n     history of technology shows us that ``Once a process of \n     technological development has been set in motion, it proceeds \n     largely by its own momentum irrespective of the intentions of \n     its originators.''\n\n  What it means is you put a test in place, and people have to teach to \nthat test. It develops a momentum of its own. And we are seeing that \nconfessed in today's Washington Post. Students have been going up in \ntheir science evaluation, and the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress program comes in with a new type of science exam that says, \n``We don't care what you know, we want to find out different things \nabout how creative you might be.'' And they all of a sudden say that \nthe science performance falls off because they do not want to know what \nstudents have learned, they want to know how curious they are.\n  I think it is important for us to do more than develop curiosity in \nstudents. It is important for us to develop learning in students. And \nthe previous tests were showing that learning was taking place and the \ntest scores were going up. So they changed the test, redirected the \nobjective from learning to curiosity. And when it shows that they are \nnot as curious as they wanted them to be, they say, ``Well, we're just \nchanging the curriculum by keeping and giving this test over and over \nagain, and pretty soon we will have curious students, although they \nmay be ignorant of the kinds of facts we would want them to know.''\n\n  This is a serious problem. Experts point out that Great Britain's \nattempt to provide a national exam ``with a wide-achievement span seems \nto have been unsuccessful, not only in the case of lower-achieving \nstudents but is reported . . . to have lowered the standards of the \nhigher-achieving students.''\n  These experts, Madaus and Kellaghan, point out that in Great Britain \nthe attempt to provide a national exam with wide achievement span, \nmeaning over broad areas, seems to have been unsuccessful not only in \nlower-achieving students--meaning that lower-achieving students are not \ndoing better because of the exam--but also it is saw the standards of \nhigher-achieving students go down.\n  This is a lose-lose situation. It would be one thing if we were able \nto pull up the guys at the bottom at the cost of the guys at the top, \nmaybe losing some, but this says that when you have these broad exams \nin Great Britain, not only do the people at the bottom do worse, the \npeople at the top do worse.\n  In assessing the Educate America program in their 1991 report, these \nsame experts dispel the argument that a national test would not lead to \na national curriculum:\n\n       Educate America claims that their national test would not \n     result in a national curriculum since it would only delineate \n     what all students should know and what skills they should \n     possess before they complete secondary school but would not \n     prescribe how schools should teach. This assertion is \n     disingenuous [according to the experts]. European schools \n     have national curricula but do not prescribe how schools \n     should teach. Through a tradition of past tests, however, \n     national tests de facto constitute a curriculum and funnel \n     teaching and learning along the fault lines of the test. Two \n     acronyms describe what inevitably happens: WYTFIWYG--what you \n     teach for is what you get--and HYTIHYT--how you test is how \n     you teach.\n\n  If you are going to test for something, that is what you end up \nteaching.\n  These experts indicate that all over the continent of Europe, when \nyou nationalize the testing you nationalize the curriculum.\n  Dr. Bert Green, professor of psychology at Johns Hopkins University \nnotes:\n\n       The strategy seems to be to build a test that represents \n     what the students should know, so that teaching to the test \n     becomes teaching the curriculum that is central to student \n     achievement.\n\n  A nationalized curriculum dislocates parents. It sets them out of the \noperation, along with other members of the local community. They no \nlonger have an influence on the central core of what a school is about, \nthat is, what is taught and how it is taught. And once that is done, I \nthink we make a very serious inroad into the potential for student \nachievement.\n  Lyle V. Jones, a research professor in psychology at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, fears that efforts to recast \nclassroom curricula will focus simply on teaching what will likely \nproduce higher scores on national tests. Let me quote Professor Jones: \n``The pressures to teach what is being tested are bound to be very \nlarge and hard to resist,'' he said, ``Particularly in schools where \nthe teachers and principals know the results will be published, the \nfocus will be on getting kids to perform well on the test rather than \nmeeting a richer set of standards in mathematics learning.''\n  Marc F. Bernstein, superintendent of the Bellmore-Merrick central \nhigh school district in Seattle, worries that a national test will lead \nto a national curriculum. Here is what he said:\n\n       I know that the president has not recommended a national \n     curriculum, only national testing, but educators know all too \n     well that ``what is tested will be taught.''\n\n  The point here is the choice. Someone will decide what is tested; \nsomeone will decide what is taught; someone will decide how it is \ntaught. Will it be a group of individuals made up of parents, teachers, \nbusiness people, community officials, who want a local school board to \nhave a sensitivity to what is happening in the local school, and when \nsomething goes wrong can try something else, can mediate a problem? Or \nwill it be a group of individuals in Washington, DC, in some conference \nroom in the Department of Education, inaccessible, who do not pay the \nbill but who will impose a national curriculum that is not correctable \nat the local level when it flops, when it does not work, when it fails \nstudents, when it fails the community but still is enshrined in either \nthe egos or in the minds or in the theories of people 1,000 miles or \n2,000 miles away?\n  That is the question. It is simple. And I think we do not want to \ndevelop some backdoor entry to a national curriculum. These experts, \nexpert after expert that I have been quoting, they say that if you \ndevelop the test, you develop the curriculum, you specify the \ncurriculum.\n  The superintendent of the Bellmore-Merrick central high school \ndistrict in Seattle says:\n\n       I know that the president has not recommended a national \n     curriculum, only national testing, but educators know all too \n     well that ``what is tested will be taught.''\n\n  President Clinton remarked on May 23, 1997, at an Education Town Hall \nmeeting--these are the words of the President:\n\n       The tests are designed so that if they don't work out so \n     well the first time, you'll know what to do to teach, to \n     improve and lift these standards.\n\n  Let me read that again. This is a quote from the President of the \nUnited States.\n\n       The tests are designed so that if they don't work out so \n     well the first time, you'll know what to do to teach, to \n     improve and lift these standards.\n\n  Basically, you will know, says the President, to change your \ncurriculum. You will know how to teach differently. You will know how \nto remove the opportunity to decide curriculum from the local level and \nforfeit it to those who make the test in Washington, DC.\n  The Association for Childhood Education International notes, ``What \nwe are seeing is a growing understanding that teaching to tests \nincreasingly has become the curriculum in many schools.''\n  William Mehrens, Michigan State College of Education Professor, has \nnoted that one major concern about standardized achievement tests is \nthat when test scores are used to make important decisions, teachers \nmay teach to the test too directly. Although teaching to the test is \nnot a new concern, today's greater emphasis on teacher accountability \ncan make this practice more likely to occur.\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\n  While basic skills are the most important thing for kids to learn, \nthe proposed national tests contain high-risk educational philosophies \nand fads. It would be one thing if we thought the test would work or \nthis test would help us get to the basics. I am afraid that they do not \nhold such promise.\n  John Dossey, chairman of the President's math panel to develop the \nmath test, served on the 1989 National Council of Teachers of \nMathematics group that criticized American schools' ``long-standing \npreoccupation with computation and other traditional skills.'' We have \nbeen too long preoccupied with addition, subtraction, multiplication \nand division. He is saying teaching kids the multiplication tables--\nwhether 12 times 12 is 144 or 15 times 15 is 225, or 6 times 7--\ndemonstrates our ``long-standing preoccupation with computation and \nother traditional skills.''\n  I believe that is what we need in our schools. We need to teach young \npeople to be able to multiply, subtract, add, divide. His focus on what \nadvocates call ``whole math'' would teach our children that the right \nanswer to basic math tables are not as important as an ability to \njustify incorrect ones, to argue about incorrect ones. The ability to \nadd, subtract, multiply and divide should be replaced, it seems, by \ncalculator skills in students. These are ``whole math'' individuals, \nthe people who want to start students with calculators so they are \nnever encumbered by the responsibility of learning addition, \nsubtraction, multiplication, and division. They can always do it on a \ncalculator.\n  The proposed math test is steeped in the new, unproven ``whole math'' \nor ``fuzzy math'' philosophy, deemed by some as ``MTV math,'' which \nencourages students to rely on calculators and discourages arithmetic \nskills and has resulted in a decline in math performance.\n  Now, this is the sort of approach to mathematics taken by a group \nthat the President has had working on these exams for quite some time--\nhe has spent millions of dollars in trying to develop this, and we have \ntalked about this previously. The last meeting convened at the Four \nSeasons Hotel here in Washington, DC. Their approach to mathematics is \nsimilar to this ``new-new math'' or the ``fuzzy math'' or ``MTV math,'' \ndepending on how you characterize it.\n  This fad was tried, unfortunately, on our Defense Department \ndependent students. The Defense Department has to operate schools all \nover the world in order to make it possible for the dependents, the \nchildren of people who work in our defense operation around the world, \nto get an education. Here is what happened when they implemented this \nprogram in the Defense Department schools. The median percentile \ncomputation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by \nmore than 37,000 Department of Defense dependent students one year \nafter the Defense Department introduced whole math dropped 14 percent \nfor third graders, 20 percent for fourth graders, 20 percent for fifth \ngraders, 17 percent for sixth graders--this is not a laughing matter--\n17 percent for seventh graders and only 8.5 percent for eighth graders.\n  Now, that is the whole math, that is the new-new math or the fuzzy \nmath. That is the kind of math that they want to test for in the new \nnational test. It means you will have to be teaching it in order to \nsurvive on the test, and if we reorient the curriculum of this country \nacross America to the so-called new math or fuzzy math woe be unto our \nability in the next century for our young people to be able to make \nsimple calculations.\n\n  These are the folks who say that calculation is not important, we \nhave been too long focused on calculation. I disagree as totally as I \ncould with the statement that we have been too focused on calculation. \nI think the average parents in America know we have not focused enough \non teaching kids to add, subtract, multiply and divide. We have not \noverdone it. The fact we are in trouble in terms of mathematic or \narithmetic literacy in this country indicates we have not focused on \ncomputation of skills, not that we have.\n  Five hundred mathematicians from around the Nation have written a \nletter to President Clinton describing the flaws in the proposed math \ntest. They say that the committee members who developed the test relied \non the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards, which \nrepresents only one point of view of math and has raised concerns from \nmathematicians and professional associations. No. 2 in their concerns, \nthe test failed to test basic computation skills.\n  The President said we want to have a national test, and the math \nteachers, 500 of them, took a look and said, wait a second, these tests \nfail to test basic computational skills under the assumption that all \nthe students will know these things already. I think that would be a \ntragedy to try to drive a curriculum, try to test under the assumption \neverybody knows how to add, subtract, multiply and divide, so you give \neverybody a calculator in the test.\n  One California parent's 11th grade daughter, who was in the whole \nmath curriculum in a local district there, was diagnosed as having \nsecond-grade math skills. The mother panicked and got a teacher and \nbegan to teach at home what would not be taught in the schools. Parents \nin Illinois were advised to let their son work with a school \ncounselor--and here is the reason they were told to do so--because ``he \nvalues correct and complete answers too much.'' I think counseling is \nindicated in a situation like that--but it is not for the student. \nThere should be some counseling that goes on for the so-called \neducators.\n  Lynne Cheney, former chairman of the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, who, incidentally, tried to develop a national set of \nhistory standards and found out how difficult it was and how \ninappropriate it would be to try to impose the proposed standards on \nthe students, has become an opponent of national standards and national \ntests. She wrote in the Wall Street Journal not long ago about Steven \nLeinwand, who sits on the President's math panel. Leinwand had written \nan essay, explaining why it is ``downright dangerous'' to teach \nstudents things like 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2 and carry the 4. \nSimple multiplication. Such instruction sorts people out, Mr. Leinwand \nwrites, ``anointing the few'' who master these procedures and ``casting \nout the many.''\n  Now we have people who are developing the national test who have such \na low view of the talent pool in America that they say only a few \nstudents can learn 6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2 and carry 4. That \nkind of low understanding and low evaluation of America's future is not \nwhat we need in designing a curriculum through the back door of a \nnational test. It is just that simple.\n  Students all over the world have arithmetic literacy. They have the \ncapacity to compute fundamentally. They have the fundamental capacity \nto do arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. \nAnd to say that only a few could do it in the United States and is to \nundervalue our most important resource--that's the students who will \nmake up the population of this great country.\n  I have to say this. If we have very, very low expectations of \nstudents, that will drive the levels at which they produce. There are \nbooks full of studies that say, if you have low expectations, you get \nlow output; if you have high expectations, you get much better \nperformance. Let's not turn this country over to a group of individuals \nwho think that most American students are simply incapable of learning \n6 times 7 is 42, put down the 2 and carry the 4.\n\n  I was pleased to have an opportunity to speak with the Senator from \nWest Virginia here earlier this afternoon. Senator Byrd made a speech \nin June of 1997, a speech on a whole math textbook called Focus on \nAlgebra. After looking at the textbook, he called it ``whacko \nalgebra.'' We have his entire speech. It is an interesting speech in \nwhich he points out some of the real problems we have with this \napproach. He says:\n\n       A closer look at the current approach to mathematics in our \n     schools reveals something called the ``new-new math.'' \n     Apparently the concept behind this new-new approach to \n     mathematics is to get kids to enjoy mathematics and hope that \n     ``enjoyment'' will lead to a better understanding of basic \n     math concepts. Nice thought, but nice thoughts do not always \n     get the job done. Recently Marianne Jennings, a professor at \n     Arizona State University, found that her teenage daughter \n     could not solve a mathematical equation. This was all the \n     more puzzling because her daughter was getting an A in \n     algebra. Curious about the disparity, Jennings\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\n     took a look at her daughter's Algebra textbook, \n     euphemistically titled ``Secondary Math: An Integrated \n     Approach: Focus on Algebra.'' . . . After reviewing it, \n     Jennings dubbed it ``Rain Forest Algebra.''\n\n  I think the Senator may have been right when he said, ``I have to go \na step further and call it whacko algebra.''\n  If that is the kind of new-new math, if that is the kind of whole \nmath that this national test would impose upon citizens across this \ncountry and would literally say to individuals, ``This is what we will \ntest, and you will have to take this test and you will be wanting to \nteach to this test,'' I think it is a terrible disservice to the next \ngeneration.\n  Now, the President has not only indicated he wants to have a \nmathematics test or a test of arithmetic or skills in that area, he \nwants to have a reading test. What I fear about tests is that they not \nonly drive what is taught but they drive how it is taught. How you \nteach reading makes a tremendous difference in terms of your capacity \nin your life-long endeavor with the written word. Of course, we know \nthat being able to read instructions and being able to read things is \nfar more important than it has ever been in history. One philosophy for \nteaching reading is what is called the ``whole language approach,'' \nwhich doesn't really focus on phonics.\n  One of the real advantages of the English language is that we have \nletters. There are some languages that do not have letters. They just \nhave pictures. Some of the Oriental languages just have pictures, and \nthe picture, if you have never seen it before, really can't tell you \nhow to pronounce it. It won't tell you what it might mean. It won't \ngive you many clues of how to look it up because it is just a picture. \nIf you don't recognize it, you don't recognize it.\n  With English, on the other hand, if you understand it phonetically, \nyou look at it and you know that there are certain sounds that are \nassociated with certain letters and combinations of letters. As you \nsound words out, it also provides a pretty easy way to look it up \nbecause we have the ability to have the dictionary and it is in \nalphabetical order. There is an order. There is a logic to phonetically \nunderstanding the English language. It is the capacity to take the \nlanguage, a word you have never seen before, sound it out, and \ndeconstruct the word and figure out what it means.\n  I think it would be a tremendous disaster if, instead of allowing \nschools to decide how they want to teach English, if we were to have a \ntest constructed and from that test drive an approach to teaching \nEnglish, for instance, that ignored phonics.\n  Now, I have to say this, and I have said it before, and I guess I \nwill be saying it many times: I don't think we ought to have a national \ntest even if it were one that I thought perfectly represented what \nought to be taught. The point I think we have to understand is that \nparents deserve the right to shape the curriculum and the way it is \ntaught at the local level. When parents have that right and can be \ninvolved in it, they are far more likely to be engaged in the \neducational effort and we go back to our primary understanding that \nwhen parents are involved in the education effort, students' \nachievements skyrocket. The whole purpose of education is not for \nteachers. It is not for school boards. It is not for parents. The \npurpose of education is for students. We should be doing those things \nwhich drive student achievement and performance, and parental \ninvolvement in the system drives student achievement and performance. \nNow, the President of the United States has come before the American \npeople and he has said that the test would be voluntary. He says that \nthese are going to be voluntary. Well, frankly, he wants everybody to \npay for the tests. So you have to pay for them whether you would use \nthem or not. I think if he really wanted them voluntary, he would say, \nif you don't use the test, you could get the money that would be spent \nif you did use the test to do other things. So a school district that \nhad plenty of tests and knew what its weak points were and how it \nwanted to advance the interest of its students could spend the money on \nsomething worthwhile to them from what they already knew. Most good \nschool districts know where they are weak and where they are strong and \nthey know what they need to do.\n\n  The President said, though, this is going to be a voluntary test, you \ndon't have to worry. Don't worry about a test that drives curriculum \nall over the country and makes it uniform and monotonous and dumbs down \nthings to a single, low common denominator on the national level, \nbecause that won't happen. ``This is a voluntary test.'' That is the \nline, that is the statement, that is the oft-repeated sales pitch of \nthe Department of Education. However, it is pretty clear that that is \nreally not their intention. While the President has stated that it will \nbe voluntary, and clearly indicated that in his remarks in the State of \nthe Union message, he went to Michigan on March 10, 1997, just a couple \nmonths later, and said, ``I want to create a climate in which no one \ncan say no.''\n  So much for your voluntary test. The President says he wants the test \nto be voluntary, but he goes to Michigan and says, ``I want to create a \nclimate in which no one can say no, in which it's voluntary but you are \nashamed if you don't give your kids the chance to do [these tests].'' I \nreally think we need to get an understanding of whether this is \nvoluntary or not. I think when you open the backdoor through national \ntesting to the development of national curriculum and you displace the \ncapacity of parents, teachers, school board members, and community \nmembers to develop what they want taught and how they want it taught, \nand to correct it when mistakes are being made at the local level, \ndisplace that with a national system of tests that directs curriculum \nand say they will be voluntary so there is not a problem, but then you \ngo to Michigan and say you want to create a climate in which no one can \nsay no, I will guarantee you that you properly raise suspicion on the \npart of the American people.\n  When the President of the United States decides what is voluntary and \nwhat is not voluntary and he tells you in one instance he wants it to \nbe voluntary, but in another instance ``no one can say no,'' you have \nto consider the fact that the President has a lot of power, a lot of \nresources and a lot of money, a lot of grants, and other things that \nare available to the President through his department. He can say, oh, \nthat is one of those school districts that decided they didn't need our \ntesting system. You know, that indicates they are not very progressive, \nso they should not be able to participate in this, that, or the other \nthing. Or we certainly would not want to favor them with a visit from \ngovernmental leadership from the executive branch--or any number of \nthings. The President himself says, ``I want to create a climate in \nwhich no one can say no.''\n  Now, I have heard about choices where no one can say no, and I have \nheard about people who were so attractive that no one could say no. But \nI don't think we want to create a situation or a circumstance in \neducation where we have a nationally driven, federally developed test \nby bureaucrats in Washington, to which no one can say no. William \nSafire talked about the ``nose of the camel under the tent.'' He wrote, \n``We're only talking about math and English, say the national standard-\nbearers, and shucks, it's only voluntary.'' Safire said this: ``Don't \nbelieve that; if the nose of that camel gets under the tent, the hump \nof a national curriculum, slavish teaching to the homogenizing tests, \nand a black market in answers would surely follow.''\n\n  It sounds to me like he has listened to what the President said in \nMichigan. Voluntary? Hardly. It is the nose of the camel, and a \nnationalized, federalized curriculum--a Federal Government curriculum \nwill follow. If a State chooses to administer the tests, all local \neducational agencies and parents will not have a choice whether they \nwant to participate. The truth of the matter is that this is the \ndislocation of parents, school boards, and communities, and it is \ninvesting power in Washington, DC, in a new bureaucracy to control \ncurriculum and testing across the country.\n  Other Federal ``voluntary'' plans have ended up becoming mandatory. A \nMissouri State Teachers Association memo says: ``Experience in dealing \nwith federal programs has taught us to be wary. For example, the 55 mph \nspeed limit was voluntary, too--on paper, at\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\nany rate. In practice, the speed limit was universally adopted because \nfederal highway funds were contingent upon states' `voluntary' \ncooperation. The point is that what is voluntary often becomes \nmandatory when you have federal programs and funds involved.''\n  The Department of Education stated in a September 16 memorandum that \nit is willing to use the leverage of Title I funds to gain acceptance \nfor the proposed national tests--Federal funds linked to the proposed \nnational tests. Voluntary? Hardly.\n  The memo says that the Federal agency will accept the national tests \nas an adequate assessment of the proficiency of Title I/educationally \ndisadvantaged funds. This offer is totally inappropriate. It \ndemonstrates how desperate the Department is to gain acceptance for \nthese flawed Federal tests. Use of the tests is being linked directly \nwith Federal funds. Today, the use of the tests for Title I students is \n``permitted,'' or suggested, perhaps even encouraged. It is only a \nmatter of time before it could be required.\n  An October 1990 study from the Ohio Legislative Office for Education \nOversight revealed that 173 of the 330 forms, 52 percent of the forms, \nused by a school district were related to participation in a Federal \nprogram, while Federal programs provide less than 5 percent of \neducation funding.\n  Here is what we have already. We have a National Government that is \nintrusive. It is responsible for more than half of the paperwork load \nthat teachers are struggling under, and that school officials are \nstruggling under, which displaces resources that might otherwise go to \nthe classroom. So you have 52 percent of the paperwork at the Federal \nlevel and only 5 percent of the funding, according to the 1990 Ohio \nLegislative Office of Education Oversight. I don't think we need \nadditional invasion by Federal bureaucrats to displace what ought to be \ndone, which can be done, what is being done and can be done far more \nsuccessfully at the local level with a Federal bureaucracy.\n  What happened when we tried this through a Federal bureaucracy in the \npast? What has been our success at imposing things we thought might be \ngood? It is kind of interesting to look at the so-called ``National \nStandards for United States History,'' which were assembled in hopes of \nproviding some sort of standard for history teaching. These standards \nwere funded in 1991 by the National Endowment for the Humanities and \nthe Department of Education for just over $2 million.\n  Here is what we got for our $2 million. If you think you want to \ninvite the National Government in a bureaucracy, through a test, to \nbegin to develop a curriculum and to set standards that have to be \nfollowed in every district, think about what happened to this effort to \ndevelop national standards. The National Standards for United States \nHistory do not mention Robert E. Lee, Paul Revere's midnight ride, and \ndid not mention the Wright Brothers or Thomas Edison. Who made the \ngrade with the revisionists, the educationists, the liberals who wanted \nto rewrite history? Well, Mansa Musa, a 14th century African king, and \nthe Indian chief Speckled Snake had prominent display--but not these \nothers. I would not be against adding some people to our history books, \nbut I am against deleting the Wright Brothers and Robert E. Lee. The \nAmerican Federation of Labor was mentioned nine times, and the KKK was \nmentioned over a dozen times. It was obviously an attempt to set \nstandards that would make students ashamed of their country instead of \ngiving them an awareness of what their country was all about.\n\n  Lynne Cheney criticized the National Standards for U.S. History, in \nspite of the fact that she was the chairperson of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities when the Endowment contributed to the \nfunding for the standards project. She said that the U.S. history \nstandards were politically biased. She cited a participant in the \nprocess who said the standards sought to be ``politically correct.'' \nWhat a tragedy that we would take an effort to our classroom that we \nwere trying to make politically correct and impose that instead of the \ntruth to people about our history. Cheney also said that the standards \nslighted or ignored many central figures in U.S. history, particularly \nwhite males. The standards were uncritical in their discussions of \nother societies. The standards were unduly critical of capitalism. The \neconomic system, which has carried the United States into a position \nwhere it is the best place in the world to be poor, not the best place \nto be rich. You can get richer in some other place, but the poor of \nAmerica are better off than the rich in many places around the world. \nBut, no, the standards were unduly critical of capitalism, so writes \nLynne Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for Humanities at the \ntime it funded this effort to build standards. In testimony before a \nsubcommittee of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities \nCommittee, she reiterated concerns about the history standards and \nconcluded that national standards were not needed in any subject area, \nmuch less any entity to certify or approve them.\n  So that is what Lynne Cheney, who had experience with national \nstandards, said when they tried a bureaucracy in Washington to dictate \na history standard. She said it was a failure. She spent our money \ndoing it, but she had the courage to stand up and say it ended up with \na bunch of politically correct stuff that was inappropriate to use as \nteaching tools for our children.\n  Finally, George Will attacked the failed history standards as \n``cranky, anti-Americanism.''\n  The English/language arts standards were such an ill-considered \nmuddle that even the Clinton Department of Education cut off funding \nfor them after having invested more than $1 million dollars. Over and \nover again, when there have been national efforts to establish \nstandards, create curriculum, to develop tests, they have to suspend \nthe effort because they get bogged down in politically correct \nlanguage, they get bogged down in the compromise of politics and end up \nnot speaking to the students' real needs, which is for education.\n  Can you imagine a politically driven math test that is not concerned \nabout computing--adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing--but is \nconcerned about making sure that we don't offend anybody? Frankly, we \nneed to be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide. To say that it \ndoesn't matter whether you get the right number, that if you just get \nclose, sounds a little bit too much like Washington, where people \naround here mumble ``close enough for Government work.'' Well, if you \nare having your appendix taken out or you are having your teeth filled \nby a dentist, you hope they would not have that attitude toward \nmathematics or anything else. There are a lot of things that are \nrelative in the world, I suppose. But one thing is not--we ought to be \nable to say to people that 2 plus 2 equals 4, and 2 plus 3 doesn't. It \nis hard to say to students that there are any absolutes left in the \nculture, but at least we ought to be able to say to them there are some \nabsolutes. You can find them, at least, in the mathematics curriculum.\n  Well, USA Today reported that according to Boston College's Center \nfor Study of Testing, children are already overtested, taking between \nthree and nine standardized tests a year. The truth of the matter is, \nStates and communities are already testing students. They are keenly \naware of the need to improve performance, and to subject students to a \nnational test on top of the testing that is already being done is to \nbasically impose a resource allocation judgment by the Federal \nGovernment on the people who are at the State level and at the local \nlevel, who know how much testing is appropriate. Can you imagine that \nthe State and local folks have been testing too little purposely for a \nlong time in hopes that there would someday be a Federal test arrive \nwhich could take a day of their activities, or 2 days of their \nactivities, and take resources and funding away from the teaching \ncurriculum and add it to the testing curriculum? No, I don't think that \nis the case.\n  I think we have been having teachers and school officials deciding \nhow much testing is appropriate, testing that amount, making sure that \nthey had tests that could compare them to relevant groups.\n  We talked at the beginning of my remarks today, and that was some \ntime ago, about school districts that have moved up dramatically \ncompared to\n\n[[Page S10936]]\n\nthe national average. National averages are available today and \ninternational averages are available today. As a matter of fact, when \nwe went to the Washington Post to talk about the new science results in \nthe United States, we found out that we fell against international \naverages. We fell in large measure because we decided we would test for \nsomething else instead of testing for the hard science that the \ninternational averages are involved with.\n  If there is in this proposal for national testing--and obviously it \nis the one that is now being debated between the House and the Senate \nin the conference committee--a proposed national body which would \ndevelop a national Federal test with the Federal Government directing \nit through the Department of Education, it is important to note that \nthis is still going to be Government. They may say that it is \nindependent. It is not. It is the National Assessment Governing Board \nwhich would continue to get Federal appropriations for all of its \nactivities through the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm \nof the U.S. Department of Education. This board, although it would have \nGovernors and some local officials on it, would be a limited group of \npeople that would operate in Washington, DC, under the direction and \ncontrol of the Department of Education.\n  The Secretary of Education would still make final decisions on all \nboard appointments. The Assistant Secretary for the Federal Office of \nEducation Research and Improvement would still exert influence as an ex \nofficio member of the National Assessment Governing Board.\n  While the House voted overwhelmingly by a vote of 295 to 125 to not \nallow one cent to go for national testing, the Senate-passed proposal \nwould provide a new assessment governing board which would add a \nGovernor, two industrialists, four members of the public and remove \nfive individuals who are currently members of the board. But it would \nstill operate in the U.S. Department of Education under the National \nCenter for Education Statistics. The Secretary of Education would still \nmake final decisions on all board appointments. The Assistant Secretary \nwould be the person who drove the ship as an ex officio member of the \nboard and as, obviously, a representative of the Department through \nwhich all the funding would flow.\n  Now, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, part \nof Goals 2000, was repealed April 26, 1996, a little over a year and a \nhalf ago, over concerns that it would function as a national school \nboard, establishing Federal standards and driving local curriculum. I \nthink it is fair to say that we had good judgment there. We said, wait \na second, we don't want something that establishes a national \ncurriculum, that establishes national standards. We saw how bad that \nwas with the history standards. The history standards were repudiated \nunanimously by the Senate because they were just politically correct \nitems that were revisionist history, designed, as I said, to make \nstudents ashamed of the country rather than to inform students about \nthe country. And at the time the National Education Standards and \nImprovement Council was repealed, because there were concerns it would \nfunction as a national school board, it was said on this floor that \n``it is logical to presume that once a national standard has been set \nand defined by some group which has received the imprimatur of the \nFederal Government, you will see that standard is aggressively used as \na club to force local curriculums to comply with the national standards \n* * * it was a mistake to set up the national school board, NESIC.''\n  Well, if it was a mistake to set up a national school board under the \nnomenclature of an education standards and improvement council, it is a \nmistake to establish a national school board under the label of a test \ndevelopment committee.\n\n  It was further said in the Chamber that ``the National Education \nStandards and Improvement Council should never have been proposed in \nthe first place. It was a mistake and we should terminate it right now. \nThe Federal Government does not have a role in this area, and it \ncertainly should not be putting taxpayers' dollars at risk in this \narea.''\n  Well, if that was a mistake in 1996, where they had no authority to \npropose a national test to be imposed on every student in America to \ndrive curriculum, it is certainly a mistake now. And the number of \nletters or the identity of the letters which label the federal \nbureaucracy doesn't change the facts.\n  A single national test for students was rejected by the only \ncongressionally authorized body ever to make recommendations on \nnational testing. The National Council on Education Standards and \nTesting was authorized in 1992 by the Congress, and its final report \nconcluded that ``the system assessment must consist of multiple methods \nof measuring progress, not a single test.''\n  Whether you allow test development and implementation through the \nDepartment of Education or through the National Assessment Governing \nBoard, the fatal flaw is that we would be allowing the development of a \ntest which would drive curriculum. When you drive curriculum from \nWashington and you make it impossible for people at the local level to \ndecide what they want taught and how they want it taught and you \ndeprive them of the ability to correct mistakes--if it is not working, \nthey can't change it because it is all driven from the national level--\nyou are forfeiting a great opportunity to make the kind of progress \neducationally which will make those who follow us survivors and \nsucceeders.\n  As I said when I had the opportunity to begin making these remarks, \nthe genius of America is bound up in our ability to hand to the next \ncentury, the next generation, a set of opportunities as great as ours. \nI firmly believe we have that opportunity and we have the \nresponsibility to make sure that the next century is characterized by \nindividuals who are capable. If we decide to spoil that opportunity by \nruining our education system with a one-size-fits-all, dumbed-down \ncurriculum that is driven by national, federalized testing that comes \nas a result of a bureaucratic organization in Washington that could \nonly honestly be labeled as a national school board, we will have \nfailed in our responsibility to protect the future of the young people \nin this country.\n  Some have concluded that the public is demanding what the President \nsays he wants to provide. Nothing could be further from the truth. I \nseldom cite polls in things that I say because I don't want to be poll \ndriven. I do not want to follow polls around. I want to try to find out \nwhat is the right thing to do. Living by polls is like driving down the \nroad looking in the rear view mirror to find out what people thought a \nlittle while ago. We need to be driving down the road finding out where \nwe need to be and where we want to go.\n  But there are those who say that, well, we can't say to the American \npeople they should not embrace the President's proposal because the \nAmerican people want the President's proposal. Here is what the Wall \nStreet Journal said about that. This was quite some time ago:\n\n       The Wall Street Journal/NBC national poll found that 81 \n     percent of adults favor President Clinton's initiative, with \n     almost half the public strongly in favor and only 16 percent \n     opposed.\n       But when asked whether the federal government should \n     establish a national test--with questions spelling out the \n     pro and con arguments of a standard national accountability \n     vs. ceding too much power to the federal government--the \n     public splits 49 percent to 47 percent, barely in favor.\n\n  This is fewer than half the people. With just one moment of \nexplanation, all of a sudden the so-called 81 percent endorsement \ncrumbles. When the real facts of the proposed federalized national test \nmandated by a group of folks acting as a national school board, in \neffect, in Washington, DC, reach the American people, they are going to \nknow that is not the recipe for greatness. That is a recipe for \ndisaster.\n\n  I have to say this is a little bit like the health care program that \ngot so much support early on, but the more people knew, the less they \nliked it. One academic writer whom I will have an opportunity to quote \nwhen I speak again at another time says that the worst thing that could \nhappen for the President would be for this plan for testing to be \nimplemented because people would find out the disaster that it would \nreally cause in the event it were implemented.\n  Our primary objective must be preparing the next generation \neducationally for the future, and we cannot pull\n\n[[Page S10937]]\n\nthe rug from beneath the components that make education a success--\nparental involvement, a strong culture supporting education at home, \nlocal control, the ability to change things that are failing, and the \nability to adjust at the local level. A national bureaucracy cannot get \nthat done. It is something that we must not embrace. National \nfederalized testing is a concept that must be rejected if we are to \nsave the opportunity for the future for our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I would like today to speak briefly about \nan issue that pertains in large measure to the Subcommittee on \nImmigration, which I chair.\n  In the last several months, a number of incidents have come to our \nattention involving the pursuit by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService of aliens, sometimes legal immigrants with American citizen \nspouses and children, for deportation based on one crime committed \nyears ago. These crimes have on occasion been crimes like forgery, and \nsome individuals have apparently been pursued where they did not even \nhave a conviction.\n  I would like to make a few brief remarks on this because I, along \nwith Republicans and Democrats, made efforts last Congress through the \nillegal immigration bill to improve the INS' poor record of removing \ndeportable criminal aliens.\n  Our goal was to deport convicted criminal aliens starting with the \nthousands currently serving in our jails and prisons. I believe that \nlaw-abiding people, not hardened criminals, should be filling our \npriceless immigration slots. Yet, until last year's bill, only a tiny \npercentage of deportable criminal aliens were actually being deported.\n  This happened because of a number of weaknesses in the immigration \nenforcement system. First, there were only very limited efforts to \nidentify deportable criminal aliens, particularly in our State and \nlocal prison systems. This meant that the INS was not even learning \nabout the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens.\n  Second, where deportable criminal aliens were identified and where \ndeportation proceedings were begun, those aliens were frequently \nreleased into the community and, not surprisingly, were never heard \nfrom again.\n  Finally, in those rare instances in which deportation proceedings \nwere begun and criminal aliens were detained, they were able to take \nadvantage of delaying tactics and loopholes in our immigration law to \nsignificantly increase their chances of staying in the country or, at a \nminimum, lengthening their stays. In addition, the INS was often \nlimited in its ability to remove criminal aliens due to the definition \nof deportable crimes under the old laws. Given the reality of the plea \nbargaining process, we wanted to broaden INS's ability to deport \nserious criminals who should be deported where they might have pled \ndown to a lesser offense.\n\n  We took steps to address each of these flaws in the system. We \nincreased INS's resources so they could identify deportable criminal \naliens. We enhanced detention requirements to reduce the risk of \nflight. We removed criminals' abilities to delay deportation, and we \nclosed loopholes in our immigration laws. We also increased the number \nof crimes for which criminal aliens could be deported, both to reflect \nthe realities of our criminal justice system and to enhance the INS's \nabilities to go after hardcore criminals who should not be permitted to \nremain in the country.\n  Through all of this, we had assumed that the INS would focus their \nlimited resources and manpower on deporting more serious criminals who \nhad more recently committed crimes, especially those currently in \nprison. However, either because of an inability to set priorities, \ndifficulty in interrelating the many different sections of the new \nimmigration bill, or a combination of both, the INS seems to be \npursuing some seemingly minor cases aggressively--by even, we are told, \ncombing closed municipal court cases and old probation records--while \nletting some hardened criminals in jail go free.\n  Accordingly, I will be conducting investigative hearings of the \nImmigration Subcommittee to determine why this is happening and what is \nneeded to clearly establish the right priorities. This particularly \nconcerns me given the INS's continuing inability to detain and process \ndeportable criminal aliens despite all the enhanced enforcement \nauthority we gave them in last year's immigration bill.\n  Let me speak for a moment about a report issued just last month by \nthe inspector general of the Department of Justice, which provides just \none example of the troubling concerns about the INS's handling of \ncriminal aliens. The inspector general's report dealt only with the \nKrome detention facility in Miami, which has attracted a great deal of \nattention and which ought to be one of the better run detention \nfacilities at this point. While the IG's report covered a wide range of \nissues at that facility, what he found with respect to the release of \ncriminal aliens is quite disturbing.\n  For example, the inspector general found that from a sample of 28 \ncriminal aliens released into the community in June of 1997, 9 of the \n28 had ``known criminal records or indications of potential serious \ncriminal history'' and 4 of the 28 had ``insufficient evidence in the \nfiles to indicate a criminal history check was even performed before \nrelease,'' something the INS's written policies require.\n  Here are some of those aliens that INS released:\n  A criminal alien who was convicted in 1994 of conspiracy to commit \naggravated child abuse and third-degree murder in connection with the \nkilling of a 5-year-old child.

Mr. President, I would like today to speak briefly about \nan issue that pertains in large measure to the Subcommittee on \nImmigration, which I chair.\n  In the last several months, a number of incidents have come to our \nattention involving the pursuit by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService of aliens, sometimes legal immigrants with American citizen \nspouses and children, for deportation based on one crime committed \nyears ago. These crimes have on occasion been crimes like forgery, and \nsome individuals have apparently been pursued where they did not even \nhave a conviction.\n  I would like to make a few brief remarks on this because I, along \nwith Republicans and Democrats, made efforts last Congress through the \nillegal immigration bill to improve the INS' poor record of removing \ndeportable criminal aliens.\n  Our goal was to deport convicted criminal aliens starting with the \nthousands currently serving in our jails and prisons. I believe that \nlaw-abiding people, not hardened criminals, should be filling our \npriceless immigration slots. Yet, until last year's bill, only a tiny \npercentage of deportable criminal aliens were actually being deported.\n  This happened because of a number of weaknesses in the immigration \nenforcement system. First, there were only very limited efforts to \nidentify deportable criminal aliens, particularly in our State and \nlocal prison systems. This meant that the INS was not even learning \nabout the vast majority of deportable criminal aliens.\n  Second, where deportable criminal aliens were identified and where \ndeportation proceedings were begun, those aliens were frequently \nreleased into the community and, not surprisingly, were never heard \nfrom again.\n  Finally, in those rare instances in which deportation proceedings \nwere begun and criminal aliens were detained, they were able to take \nadvantage of delaying tactics and loopholes in our immigration law to \nsignificantly increase their chances of staying in the country or, at a \nminimum, lengthening their stays. In addition, the INS was often \nlimited in its ability to remove criminal aliens due to the definition \nof deportable crimes under the old laws. Given the reality of the plea \nbargaining process, we wanted to broaden INS's ability to deport \nserious criminals who should be deported where they might have pled \ndown to a lesser offense.\n\n  We took steps to address each of these flaws in the system. We \nincreased INS's resources so they could identify deportable criminal \naliens. We enhanced detention requirements to reduce the risk of \nflight. We removed criminals' abilities to delay deportation, and we \nclosed loopholes in our immigration laws. We also increased the number \nof crimes for which criminal aliens could be deported, both to reflect \nthe realities of our criminal justice system and to enhance the INS's \nabilities to go after hardcore criminals who should not be permitted to \nremain in the country.\n  Through all of this, we had assumed that the INS would focus their \nlimited resources and manpower on deporting more serious criminals who \nhad more recently committed crimes, especially those currently in \nprison. However, either because of an inability to set priorities, \ndifficulty in interrelating the many different sections of the new \nimmigration bill, or a combination of both, the INS seems to be \npursuing some seemingly minor cases aggressively--by even, we are told, \ncombing closed municipal court cases and old probation records--while \nletting some hardened criminals in jail go free.\n  Accordingly, I will be conducting investigative hearings of the \nImmigration Subcommittee to determine why this is happening and what is \nneeded to clearly establish the right priorities. This particularly \nconcerns me given the INS's continuing inability to detain and process \ndeportable criminal aliens despite all the enhanced enforcement \nauthority we gave them in last year's immigration bill.\n  Let me speak for a moment about a report issued just last month by \nthe inspector general of the Department of Justice, which provides just \none example of the troubling concerns about the INS's handling of \ncriminal aliens. The inspector general's report dealt only with the \nKrome detention facility in Miami, which has attracted a great deal of \nattention and which ought to be one of the better run detention \nfacilities at this point. While the IG's report covered a wide range of \nissues at that facility, what he found with respect to the release of \ncriminal aliens is quite disturbing.\n  For example, the inspector general found that from a sample of 28 \ncriminal aliens released into the community in June of 1997, 9 of the \n28 had ``known criminal records or indications of potential serious \ncriminal history'' and 4 of the 28 had ``insufficient evidence in the \nfiles to indicate a criminal history check was even performed before \nrelease,'' something the INS's written policies require.\n  Here are some of those aliens that INS released:\n  A criminal alien who was convicted in 1994 of conspiracy to commit \naggravated child abuse and third-degree murder in connection with the \nkilling of a 5-year-old child. She had committed bank fraud in 1982, \nand her INS file clearly indicated that she had been convicted of an \naggravated felony. She was released by the INS this past June without \ndeportation proceedings being initiated.\n  Another alien was convicted in 1988 of cocaine trafficking, an \naggravated felony, and was imprisoned in Florida. In 1994 the alien was \nprocessed by the INS and released on his own recognizance. Deportation \nproceedings were never completed. Although the INS served him with a \nwarrant for arrest in June of 1997, they released him on bond the next \nday.\n  Yet another alien had several convictions in 1992 related to drugs, \ntax evasion and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. In 1982 \nthe alien had entered the country without proper documentation and was \nplaced into exclusion proceedings but was not detained. He only came to \nthe INS's attention again after the 1992 convictions. As a result of \nthose convictions, he was initially sentenced to 12 years in Federal \nprison, which was later reduced to 88 months. In June of 1997 he was \ntaken into custody by the INS upon his release from Federal prison. \nUnfortunately, once again the INS just let him go. He was released the \nsame month.\n\n  These are just a few examples, but they highlight the urgent need for \noversight into the identification and removal of deportable criminal \naliens. We simply must ensure that our immigration priorities are set \nproperly so we can guarantee that dangerous and deportable criminal \naliens are not permitted to remain on our streets and in our \ncommunities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Immigration \nSubcommittee to address these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia reaches the floor and is recognized, he will introduce an \namendment that he and I are introducing with Senator Warner and Senator \nBaucus. It is a very important amendment. It is the culmination of a \nlong debate about highway funding and about using trust funds for the \npurpose that the trust funds are cumulated. My colleagues have heard a \ngreat deal about this debate to this point. They are going to hear a \nlot more about it in the next few days. But I wanted to outline how we \ngot to the point of offering this amendment. I think it is a very \nimportant vote. I think it is important that it be an informed vote. So \nlet me go back to 1993. What I want to do is outline how we got to the \npoint that we find ourselves today. I then want to talk about the \namendment, and I will leave the great preponderance of the details up \nto Senator Byrd.\n  In 1993, as part of the initial budget adopted with the new Clinton \nadministration, the Congress adopted a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on \ngasoline. For the first time in the history of the country since we had \nthe Highway Trust Fund, this permanent gasoline tax did not go to build \nroads or to build mass transit. Unlike any other permanent gasoline tax \nthat we had adopted since the establishment of the trust fund, it went \nto general revenues.\n  When we had the debate, obviously much objection was raised to the \nfact that we were taxing gasoline and not funding roads. On the budget \nresolution this year, I offered an amendment that called on the Senate \nto do two things: One, to take the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline--\nwhich is an annual revenue, by the way, of about $7.2 billion--to take \nthat money out of general revenue and put it into the Highway Trust \nFund, where historically permanent gasoline taxes have always gone. The \nsecond part of this amendment was to require that the money be spent \nfor the purpose for which it had been collected as part of the Highway \nTrust Fund, and that is that the money be spent to build roads. That \namendment was adopted with 83 votes in the Senate. Every Republican \nexcept two voted for the amendment; 31 Democrats voted for the \namendment. It was a strong bipartisan declaration of the principle that \nwhen you collect money from gasoline taxes that that money ought to be \nused to build roads as part of the user fee concept which has always \nbeen the foundation on which we have had gasoline taxes.\n  When we passed the tax bill this year, I offered an amendment in the \nFinance Committee to take the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline away \nfrom general revenue and to put it into the Highway Trust Fund. That \namendment was adopted in the Finance Committee and that amendment was \npart of the tax bill both times it was voted on in the Senate. Those \nwho opposed the amendment contemplated offering an amendment to strip \naway that provision and, after looking at the level of support in the \nSenate, decided not to offer it. As a result, in the new tax bill the \ntransfer of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline became the law of the \nland and it now is going into the Highway Trust Fund where historically \nour gasoline taxes have gone.\n\n  Now, in this last month, the transportation bill, the highway bill, \nwas reported out of committee, but that highway bill did not provide \nthat any of the funds from the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline be \nspent for roads. What would occur if in fact the bill as written by \ncommittee were adopted is that we now have--if you will look at this \nchart--we have $23.7 billion of surplus in the Highway Trust Fund. What \nthat really means is that over the years we have collected $23.7 \nbillion to build roads, but rather than building roads with those funds \nwe have allowed that money to be spent for other purposes. And as a \nresult, Americans have paid taxes on gasoline but that money has not \nbeen used for the purpose that they paid the taxes. Now, as a result of \nthe adoption of the amendment that I offered on the Finance Committee \nbill, the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline is now going into the trust \nfund and, if we don't amend the transportation bill before us, by the \nyear 2003 we could have a surplus in the Highway Trust Fund of $90 \nbillion.\n  What does that surplus mean? It is simply an accounting entry to say \nthat we have collected $90 billion that we told the American people \nwould go to build roads, we have collected it by taxing gasoline, and \nyet every penny of that $90 billion will have been spent but not on \nroads. It will have been spent on many other things--some worthy, some \nnot so worthy--but it will not have been spent for the purpose that the \nmoney was collected in the first place. And that purpose is to build \nroads.\n  The amendment that Senator Byrd and I are offering will basically do \nthis. It will take the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and it will \nallow it to accumulate for a year. And then, after the accumulation has \noccurred for 1 year, it will commit that revenue for the purpose that \nit was collected: To build roads. What it will mean is that over the \nperiod of our bill it will authorize about $31 billion of additional \nfunds to build roads, and the actual expenditure will be about $21 \nbillion.\n  If we don't pass this amendment, what will happen is this $90 billion \nwill be collected, it will not be spent for roads, and every penny of \nit will be spent for something else. Senator Byrd the other day likened \nthis procedure to the story of Ananias in the Bible, where, in the book \nof Acts, Ananias has sold his worldly goods to give the money to the \nnew, fledgling church, only Ananias holds back part of the money. And \nGod not only struck Ananias dead but struck his wife Saphira dead.\n  In a very real sense, what we have been doing on the Highway Trust \nFund is we have been engaged in an action which is basically deception. \nWe have been telling people that they are paying taxes to build roads \nwhen they pay at the gasoline pump, and we have not been building \nroads. We have, in fact, been spending that money for other purposes. \nThe amendment that Senator Byrd will offer for himself and for me, for \nSenator Warner, and Senator Baucus, will simply take the 4.3 cents of \nrevenues and assure that they are, in turn, spent for the purpose that \nthe tax is now collected, and that is building roads.\n  I would note that even under our amendment, the unexpended balance of \nthe trust fund will grow from $23.7 billion today, to at least $39 \nbillion by the year 2003.\n  The issue here is, should money that is collected for the purpose of \nbuilding roads be authorized for expenditure for that purpose? Or \nshould we continue to allow it to be spent for other purposes?\n  Let me address the issue of the budget. Nothing in our amendment \nbusts the budget. Nothing in our amendment increases expenditures by \none thin dime. Nothing in our amendment will allow the budget deficit \nto grow. All our amendment does is require that the funds that are \ncollected on the gasoline tax to build roads be authorized to be \nexpended on building roads. Obviously we cannot require, in the \ntransportation bill, that the Appropriations Committee appropriate the \nmoney each and every year to fund the authorization. But I would remind \nmy colleagues that 6 years ago we wrote a highway bill and we set out \nin that highway bill the authorization levels that would allow \nappropriations, and that highway bill, through 6 long years, was never \nchanged.\n  Some of our colleagues will argue, ``Well, let's not authorize the \nbuilding of roads with taxes collected to build roads now, let's wait a \ncouple of years and write another budget and make a decision.''\n  Our decision today is about whether or not we are going to be honest \nwith the American people and whether or not we are going to spend money \ncollected to build roads for the purpose that they are collected.\n  That basically is the issue. This is not an issue about total \nspending. Nothing in our amendment changes total spending. It is an \nissue about truth in taxing, and that is, when we tax people on a user \nfee to build roads, do we build roads with the money or do we allow it \nto be spent for other purposes?\n  In our amendment, we say that we are not raising the total level of \nspending, but we make it clear we are serious about funding highways. \nWe say that if savings occur in the future relative to the budget \nagreement and if Congress decides to spend any of those savings in the \nfuture, that those savings must be used to fully fund highways and meet \nthe obligation that the\n\n[[Page S10939]]\n\nrevenues collected in this gasoline tax be used for the purpose of \nbuilding roads.\n  So there will be many issues debated, but they really boil down to a \nvery, very simple issue: When we are imposing a tax on gasoline, a tax \nthat people are paying when they are filling up their car and truck, \nand we tell them that that money is being spent for roads so that they \nare beneficiaries of the tax they are paying, are we going to fulfill \nthe commitment we make to them when we tell them that or are we going \nto allow, incredibly, $90 billion to be collected over the next 6 years \nwhere people are told the money is going to build roads but, in \nreality, the money goes to fund something else?\n  There are many ways you can debate this issue, but it all comes down \nsimply to priorities. What the Byrd-Gramm amendment will do is fulfill \nthe commitment we have made by authorizing that funds collected in the \ngasoline tax be available to build highways. That is the issue. We do \nnot change the formula in allocating the funds. We meet the same \nrequirement the committee met, and that is, we guarantee that for the \nfirst time, every State, at a minimum, will get back 90 percent of \ntheir share of the gas taxes they send to Washington, DC. As a person \nwho is from a donor State, which means we are currently getting 77 \ncents for every dollar we send to Washington, that is a dramatic \nimprovement.\n  The amendment that Senator Byrd will be offering on behalf of some 40 \nor 50 cosponsors is an amendment basically that will allow us to \nfulfill the commitment that we have made to the American people.\n  So I am very proud to be an original cosponsor with Senator Byrd of \nthis amendment. I think it is a very important amendment. I hope our \ncolleagues will look at it. I hope they will decide that it is time to \ntell the American people the truth. It is time to stop collecting \ngasoline taxes and then using those gasoline taxes for purposes other \nthan building roads.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nLouisiana is to be recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the President.\n  Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Texas. I think what he and Senator Byrd are doing is the \ncorrect thing to do. I am proud to be a cosponsor of their amendment \nand hope that the Senate recognizes that this makes a great deal of \nsense and is the right policy as well.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Breaux pertaining to the introduction of S. 1308 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is now recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my distinguished friend, Mr. Gramm, who has spoken \nalready on this subject. And I thank Mr. Warner and Mr. Baucus, both of \nwhom will speak. I thank them for being chief cosponsors of the \namendment along with me.\n  I should state at this point that there are 40 Senators, in addition \nto myself, who will have their names on this amendment. I will not \noffer it today except to offer it to be printed. And at such time as I \ndo offer it, I will then add additional names by unanimous consent.\n  So in the meantime, if any Senators wish to cosponsor the amendment, \nif they will let either me or Mr. Warner or Mr. Baucus or Mr. Gramm \nknow, we will act accordingly and have their names added at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. President, S. 1173, the reauthorization of the Intermodal----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Because this is such an important announcement you are \nmaking, and having had the opportunity to work with you and the others \non this, there are 41 cosponsors, but we also know of others who made \npersonal commitments to us over and above the 41 that intend to vote \nfor the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right. And I am glad the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, has pointed that out. I have had several Senators \nsay, for one reason or another, they would not cosponsor the amendment \nbut that they intended to vote for it when the time comes. I am glad \nthe Senator has brought that to the attention of the Senate.\n  The reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act, or ISTEA II as it is often referred to, will set the \nauthorization levels for the next 6 years for major portions of our \nnational transportation system. And I congratulate the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, for his decision to take up this 6-year \nbill rather than the 6-month extension proposed by the other body.\n  In the end, however, the committee did not report a bill that in my \nview provides sufficient highway funding authorizations for either the \nAppalachian Development Highway System or the entire National Highway \nSystem.\n  The levels reported were constrained by the allocation of budget \nauthority provided to the Committee on Environment and Public Works by \nthe budget resolution. And that allocation does not allow anywhere near \nthe levels of highway authorization that can be supported by the \nhighway trust fund revenues over the coming 6 years, nor the levels \nthat are seriously needed to prevent further deterioration in our \nNational Highway System.\n  Senators will recall that last year I, along with Senator Gramm and \nother Senators, urged the leadership to allow us an opportunity to vote \non an amendment to a tax measure to transfer the 4.3 cents per gallon \ngas tax which was going toward deficit reduction into the highway trust \nfund where it could be used for increased highway and transit spending \nin the coming years. At the request of both the majority and minority \nleaders, I deferred offering such an amendment during last year's \nsession.\n  On May 22 of this year, I joined 82 other Senators in voting for an \namendment by Senator Gramm in support of transferring the 4.3 cents gas \ntax--Mr. President, I think I left my cough drops in the office. I can \nassure all Senators, however, I do not have whooping cough nor do I \nhave consumption, but I have had a severe cold. If I could proceed, I \nwill do so by rereading the sentence that I stumbled on.\n  Earlier this year, I joined 82 other Senators in voting for an \namendment by Senator Gramm in support of transferring the 4.3 cents gas \ntax to the highway trust fund and spending it on our rapidly \ndeteriorating transportation systems.\n  And then on July 14, I joined with 82 other Senators and expressed in \na letter to Senators Lott and Daschle, as well as to the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Roth and Moynihan, \nthe view that additional funding for transportation is urgently needed.\n  We 83 Senators urged that the conferees on the Reconciliation Act \nretain the Senate's transfer of this gas tax into the highway trust \nfund so that it could then be used for additional transportation \nspending in the future rather than being applied toward deficit \nreduction.\n  Ultimately, the balanced budget agreement did include the transfer of \nthe 4.3 cents gas tax into the highway trust fund, beginning October 1, \n1997. And as a result, the highway account of the highway trust fund \nwill receive additional revenues totaling almost $31 billion over the \nnext 5 fiscal years.\n  One would think that the budget agreement would have taken this \nadditional revenue into account in setting the allocations of budget \nauthority for the pending 6-year highway bill. Instead, under the \nreported bill, the cash balances in the highway trust fund will grow \nmassively over the next 6 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that under the committee \nreported bill the balance in the highway trust fund will be just over \n$25.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 1998. And according to CBO, \nthat trust fund balance will grow each year thereafter, to an \nunprecedented level of almost $72 billion by the end of fiscal year \n2003. In other words, if we accept the levels of contract authority \nprovided in the reported bill for the next 6 years, we will have \naccomplished nothing by placing the 4.3 cents gas tax into the highway \ntrust fund other than to build up these huge surpluses which have the \neffect of masking the Federal deficit.\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\n  I have called for increased levels of infrastructure investment for \nyears. And yet, despite my pleas and despite the needs of our States \nand of our constituents, we in the Congress have allowed much of the \nNation's physical infrastructure to fall further and further into \ndisrepair.\n  As the chart to my left shows, the Federal spending for \ninfrastructure as a percentage of all Federal spending, 1980 through \n1996, has significantly declined since 1980. And it was more than 5 \npercent at that time. And as of 1996, it is less than 3 percent.\n  So in that year--in that year--Federal spending on highways, mass \ntransit, railways, airports, and water supply and waste water treatment \nfacilities amounted to just over 5 percent of total Federal spending. \nBut as I have already pointed out, our 1996 Federal spending on these \nsame infrastructure programs had dropped to less than 3 percent of \ntotal Federal spending--less than 3 percent of the total Federal \nspending.\n  Nowhere is there infrastructure investment more inadequate than on \nour Nation's highways. Our National Highway System carries nearly 80 \npercent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 percent of intercity \npassenger and tourist traffic. The construction of our national \ninterstate system represents perhaps the greatest public works \nachievement of the modern era. But we have allowed segments of our \nNational Highway System to fall into serious disrepair.\n\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation, the DOT, has released its most \nrecent report on the condition of the Nation's highways. Its findings \nare even more disturbing than earlier reports. The Department of \nTransportation currently classifies less than half of the mileage on \nour interstate system as being in good condition. And only 39 percent \nof our entire National Highway System is rated in good condition. Fully \n61 percent of our Nation's highways are rated in either fair or poor \ncondition. Almost one in four of our Nation's bridges is now \ncategorized as either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  There are literally over a quarter of a billion miles of pavement in \nthe United States that is in poor or mediocre condition. There are over \n185,000 deficient bridges across our country. If we allow the decay of \nour transportation systems to continue, we will vastly constrict the \nlifelines of our Nation and undermine our economic prosperity.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, our investment in our \nNation's highways is a full $15 billion short each year of what it \nwould take just to maintain current inadequate conditions. Put another \nway, we would have to increase our national highway investment by more \nthan $15 billion a year to make the least bit of improvement in the \nstatus of our national highway network.\n  It is also critical to point out that while our highway \ninfrastructure continues to deteriorate, highway use--highway use--is \non the rise. Indeed, it is growing at a very rapid pace. The number of \nvehicle miles traveled has grown by more than one-third in just the \nlast decade.\n  On the chart to my left we see shown U.S. highway vehicle miles \ntraveled. The source is the Federal Highway Administration, highway \nstatistics, 1983 through 1997.\n  As I say, the number of vehicle miles traveled has grown by more than \none-third. And the chart represented here shows the miles traveled in \nbillions, billions of miles. As a result, we are witnessing new highs \nin levels of highway congestion, causing delays in the movement of \ngoods and people that costs our national economy more than $40 billion \na year in lost productivity. And, Mr. President, it is clear that the \nrequirements we place on our National Highway System are growing, while \nour investment continues to fall further and further behind.\n  We are simply digging ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole. It is \na proven fact that investments in highways result in significant \nimprovements in productivity and increased profits for business as well \nas improvements to both our local and our national well-being. \nAccording to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 billion \ninvested in highways creates and sustains over 40,000 full-time jobs. \nFurthermore, the very same $1 billion investment also results in a $240 \nmillion reduction in overall production costs for American \nmanufacturers.\n  And while we can easily see the economic impact of this \ndisinvestment, we must not lose sight of the fact that deteriorating \nhighways have a direct relationship to safety. Almost 42,000 people \ndied on our Nation's highways in 1996. And that is the equivalent to \nhaving a midsized passenger aircraft crash every day killing everyone \non board.\n  Let me say that again: 42,000 people died on our Nation's highways in \n1996. That is the equivalent to having a midsized passenger aircraft \ncrash every day killing everyone on board.\n  Substandard road and bridge designs, outdated safety features, poor \npavement quality and other bad road conditions are a factor in 30 \npercent of all fatal highway accidents according to the Federal Highway \nAdministration. The economic impact of these highway accidents costs \nour Nation $150 billion a year, and that figure is growing.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am pleased today to bring before the Senate, \ntogether with the very able Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner, an \namendment that will increase substantially the highway authorization \nlevels contained in the underlying bill. In doing so, the amendment \nwill authorize the use of the increased revenues that began flowing \ninto the highway trust fund on October 1 of this year. As shown on this \nchart to my left, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that over \nthe 5-year period 1999 through 2003, increased revenue to the highway \naccount will equal $30.971 billion. This amendment will utilize these \nadditional revenues in full to authorize additional highway spending \nover the 5-year period 1999-2003.\n\n  Our amendment does not change the formulas of the underlying bill. \nEach State will receive its same formula percentage share of these \nadditional authorizations as it did in the reported bill. For the donor \nStates, the amendment still ensures they will receive a minimum of 90 \npercent return on their percentage contribution to the highway trust \nfund. Moreover, our amendment, like the committee-reported bill, \nutilizes 10 percent of the total available resources for discretionary \npurposes. Increased discretionary amounts of contract authority will \ntherefore be available for the multi-State trade corridors initiative, \nas well as the 13-State Appalachian Development Highway System.\n  Adoption of this amendment will not change the scoring of the deficit \nby one dime. It has been a routine event in this Senate for us to adopt \nauthorization bills that authorize spending levels that far exceed \navailable appropriations. Within the education area, we have funding \nauthorizations on the books that exceed actual appropriations by \nbillions of dollars. The same is true in the area of health research, \nenvironmental programs, agricultural programs and the like. The actual \nobligation ceiling that will pertain to these highway programs will be \nset annually by the Appropriations Committees as has been the case for \nthe past 6 years under ISTEA and for many of the highway authorization \nbills before that.\n  The real question at this time is whether we will allow the 4.3-\ncents-per-gallon gasoline tax that is now going into the highway trust \nfund to be authorized for use in the 6-year highway bill or not. \nEighty-three Senators signed a letter this past July stating their \nsupport of the use of these funds for the purposes for which the tax is \nbeing collected; namely, for the construction and maintenance of our \nnational system of highways and bridges.\n  Much has been made by the opponents of this amendment about the \npossibility that the increased highway spending authorized by the \namendment will cause drastic cuts over the next 5 years in other \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this argument is unfounded. Enactment \ninto law of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment does not cause any \ncut in any Federal program. Let me repeat again that the bill before us \nis an authorization bill. It is not an appropriations bill. Therefore, \nthe Appropriations Committees in each of the next 5 years will have to \ndetermine what level of highway spending they can afford versus all of \nthe other programs under the committee's jurisdiction. Each\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\nyear's transportation bill for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 will \ncontain an obligation limit for total highway spending. That limitation \nwill be set each year in light of the circumstances being faced by the \nAppropriations Committees in that particular year. The allocation of \noutlays to the Transportation Subcommittee hopefully will be sufficient \nto fully fund the entire contract authority provided in this amendment \nfor each of the next 5 years. But, the Senate and House and the \nPresident will have the final say as to what is provided for highway \nspending and for all other areas of the discretionary portion of the \nbudget. Put another way, if we do not adopt this amendment, we may have \nprecluded for the next 5 years any additional highway spending.\n  Regarding the question of outlay caps on discretionary spending, I \nfully support and will strongly urge the Budget Committee chairman and \nthe Senate to include in the budget resolution for fiscal year 1999 the \nnecessary provisions to increase discretionary caps for the following 5 \nyears if the economy continues to perform at a positive rate. As \nSenators are aware, since the adoption of the balanced budget agreement \nearlier this year, the projections of revenues have dramatically \nincreased and the projections for spending have been dramatically cut. \nThe result is a far better forecast than was thought to be the case \nwhen we voted for the balanced budget agreement this past spring.\n  As the chart to my left shows, a comparison of the budget agreement \nand OMB's Mid-Session Review now projects revenues to be a total of \n$129.8 billion greater over the 5-year period 1998 through 2002 than \nwas projected in the balanced budget agreement --$129.8 billion greater \nin revenues than was projected at the time of the balanced budget \nagreement. For outlays, the forecast is also much brighter than it was \na few short months ago. Compared to the balanced budget agreement, OMB \nnow projects in its Mid-Session Review that total spending over the \nperiod 1998 to 2002 will be $71.6 billion less than was projected in \nthat agreement.\n  The pending Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment takes note of the new \nprojections in the following way. The amendment provides that if--if--\nsavings in budgetary outlays for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 are \nstill projected to exist in connection with the fiscal year 1999 budget \nresolution, and if that budget resolution calls for using any of the \nprojected spending savings, an allocation of additional discretionary \noutlays for highways should be made sufficient to cover the costs of \nthe pending amendment.\n  So what we are saying in our amendment is this: If any of the $71.6 \nbillion in spending savings is to be used in the fiscal year 1999 \nbudget resolution, $21.6 billion should go toward increasing \ndiscretionary caps in order to cover the outlays that will result from \nthe increased authorizations of contract authority for highways \ncontained in the pending amendment.\n  I am for increasing discretionary outlays sufficient to cover the \ncosts of the additional highway construction that will occur under the \npending amendment if the economy continues to perform favorably as \nprojected. But, we are not here today to debate the budget resolution. \nThe time for that debate is next spring when the budget resolution for \n1999 is before the Senate. We are here today to decide whether to \nauthorize additional highway levels for the next 5 years or whether to \nlet the 4.3-cents gas tax be used instead as a bookkeeping mechanism to \nbuild up huge surpluses to mask the Federal deficit. I urge all \nSenators to vote to waive points of order on this amendment so as to \nallow it to be voted on, and I urge all Senators to vote for its \nadoption. In so doing, Senators will be voting to restore public trust \nin the highway trust fund, and they will be voting to take the next \nstep toward providing substantially increased highway investments for \nall States--not just one, not just 10, but all States--over the next 6 \nyears.\n  Let us take a step forward in restoring confidence in Government \npolicies by using gas tax revenues as we have told the people that they \nwould be used. Taxes collected at the pump are intended to be used to \nconstruct and maintain safe and modern highways and also to provide \nneeded transit systems.\n  It is unconscionable that we should continue to hold back public \nmoneys from our Nation's highways when they are slipping into such \ndeplorable disrepair. Promise keepers we certainly are not when it \ncomes to the highway trust fund. The money is there. It has been \nspecifically collected and designated to be plowed back into highways \nfor the benefit of the taxpayer, and yet we are stubbornly sitting on \nit. We are stubbornly sitting on that money.\n  It is wrong. It is deceitful. It is bad public policy. It is \ndeplorable in terms of its detrimental impact on our economy. It is \ncontributing to the death and accident rates on our highways. It ought \nto be stopped. This amendment gives Senators a way to stop it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record certain tables, \nand I shall send the amendment to the desk not for the purpose of it \nbeing offered today but only for the purpose of it being printed and \navailable for all Senators to see it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              PAVEMENT MILES IN POOR TO FAIR CONDITION \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Mileage\n                     State                         poor &    Federal aid\n                                                  mediocre      miles\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.......................................        3,628       23,230\nAlaska........................................        1,259        3,010\nArizona.......................................        1,705       11,869\nArkansas......................................        1,994       19,744\nCalifornia....................................       14,985       48,165\nColorado......................................        5,571       15,965\nConnecticut...................................        1,384        5,579\nDelaware......................................          584        1,428\nDistrict of Columbia..........................          184          389\nFlorida.......................................        7,858       24,378\nGeorgia.......................................          224       29,777\nHawaii........................................          306        1,321\nIdaho.........................................        4,719        8,594\nIllinois......................................       10,681       33,207\nIndiana.......................................        5,028       21,586\nIowa..........................................        4,545       23,395\nKansas........................................       10,987       22,274\nKentucky......................................        3,380       14,389\nLouisiana.....................................        4,943       14,503\nMaine.........................................        1,377        6,138\nMaryland......................................        1,704        7,404\nMassachusetts.................................        3,028        9,154\nMichigan......................................       10,032       30,729\nMinnesota.....................................       13,252       29,501\nMississippi...................................        6,853       20,257\nMissouri......................................        8,191       30,178\nMontana.......................................        5,336       12,058\nNebraska......................................        6,120       15,086\nNevada........................................          633        5,472\nNew Hampshire.................................          832        3,291\nNew Jersey....................................        2,318        9,382\nNew Mexico....................................        4,715        9,787\nNew York......................................        7,656       25,268\nNorth Carolina................................        7,467       20,036\nNorth Dakota..................................        5,226       13,294\nOhio..........................................        4,316       27,791\nOklahoma......................................        6,813       25,716\nOregon........................................        5,454       17,535\nPennsylvania..................................        4,864       27,105\nRhode Island..................................          852        1,589\nSouth Carolina................................        4,598       17,274\nSouth Dakota..................................        6,527       14,559\nTennessee.....................................        4,282       16,733\nTexas.........................................       19,277       73,003\nUtah..........................................          950        7,520\nVermont.......................................        1,869        3,760\nVirginia......................................        5,198       20,352\nWashington....................................        5,231       18,422\nWest Virginia.................................        2,223       10,114\nWisconsin.....................................        8,806       27,606\nWyoming.......................................        3,664        7,329\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total...................................      253,629     886,246\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes only pavement mileage eligible for federal highway funds.\n \n Sources: The Road Information Program (TRIP).

authority: CBO.\n\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I might just enter into a colloquy \nhere with our distinguished former Senate leader and now the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and \nreflect a little on the very important work which the Senator has led \non this amendment, together with Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, and \njoined in by myself.\n  I think it is important to share with our colleagues what this \namendment does not do. It doesn't break the budget. We have reviewed \nthat in the number of sessions that the four of us have had.\n  I wonder if my colleague would recount some of the things to dispel, \nif I may say, some rumors that seem to be circulating at the moment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have read and heard some things that are \nbeing said about the amendment that do not conform to the proper rules \nof exactitude. I don't say it is intentional. I think some of these \nthings have been said, perhaps all, through a misunderstanding. I am \nwilling to see it in that way.\n  There is a great deal of misinformation that has been spread. I can \nunderstand why, to some extent. The amendment has not been available \nfor Senators to read. Now it is available, and Senators and their \nstaffs will be able to read for themselves.\n  It does not bust the budget. It will not intrude upon other programs. \nIt will not mean that other programs will be cut.\n  I have read a letter or memo recently which indicated certain other \nprograms--by the way, many of them are funded by my own Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Department of the Interior, and I have supported \nthose programs for years and years and intend to continue to support \nthem. I would not vote to cut them. It would not result in the cutting \nof any programs.\n  I can think of those two things in particular. As we go along further \nin the debate, there will be other matters that I hope can be \nstraightened out and the light of truth can be focused on them.\n  If the Senator thinks of other things being said, I will be happy to \nrespond.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might follow along, in drafting this bill we have \nmade it very clear that any additional funds next year would be subject \nto a budget resolution, but they would flow and be distributed \nprecisely as provided in the committee bill, which I hope will \neventually become law.\n  So there would be a law in place next spring by which those funds as \ndesignated in this amendment would flow immediately pursuant to the \nterms of the committee bill.\n  Now, the key point, Madam President, is that it would not require the\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\nSenate to have another bill, but alternative measures that I have heard \nabout, Madam President and colleagues, that may be offered in the \nsecond degree to the amendment we are now discussing would require a \nnew bill.\n  Now, that, to me, is very important because we would take an existing \nlaw, move the funds through it under a formula, hopefully, that \nSenators will find equitable and not have to revisit in an election \nyear. Madam President, those of us who have been here a while know--and \nI certainly defer to the experience and knowledge of the former \nmajority leader of the U.S. Senate--in an election year, the chances of \ngetting through a bill of this nature, allocating funds, is exceedingly \ndifficult. I ask my colleague, does he not agree with that observation?\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with the distinguished Senator. He is preeminently \ncorrect. We should do it in this bill that is before the Senate now. It \nshould not be a 6-month bill or a 1-year bill. We ought to do it in \nthis year, in this bill. Then we will have notified the highway \ndepartments of the 50 States more accurately as to what they can depend \nupon over the next 5 years insofar as planning is concerned.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished Senator brings up a key point. I hope \neach Senator will consult with their respective Governors and highway \nofficials on this matter, because particularly in the Northeast States \nand the Far West, Madam President, weather will close in. There is a \nshorter period within which to do the vital construction for surface \ntransportation. And unless there is in place a piece of legislation \nthat gives the certainty of 6 years, then they are put at a severe \ndisadvantage. I think that is key to this bill.\n  One last thing and I will yield the floor. Another situation that is \nbeing discussed, should we say, in the hallways, is a means to stop the \namendment we are discussing by repealing altogether the 4.3-cent gas \ntax. Now, Madam President, if that measure is brought forward, that is \na very significant step that I think we should give a great deal of \nconsideration to before anybody takes that initiative.\n  So, Madam President, I conclude by putting a question to the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, the former chairman and former \nmajority leader, what would be the consequences, in his judgment, if \nsuch a measure as repealing the 4.3-cent tax were to be brought before \nthis body--with the extensive debate that we have and the unlikely \nnature of it being accepted--but in the event it were?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the 30 minutes of \nthe Senator from West Virginia have expired, and under the previous \norder, the Senator from Montana was to be recognized, followed by the \nSenator from Virginia. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia such time as he \nneeds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the time allocated to the \nSenator from Virginia be consumed by what we have just covered in this \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I would view that happening with some \ndisappointment, if not sadness. I hope that no effort will be made to \nrepeal the gas tax. If that happens, that would mean an increase in the \ndeficit. And if the author of such an amendment happens to think that \nthat would bar the amendment that has been offered by the distinguished \nSenator and two others of my colleagues, and myself, and has been \ncosponsored by 37 additional Senators--if the author of such an \namendment thinks for a moment that that would bar the carrying into the \neffect of the amendment we have been discussing, that Senator would be \nsadly mistaken because there are moneys in the trust fund sufficient to \ncarry out the purpose of the amendment that I am offering, or will be \noffering at the appropriate time, which I have sent to the desk for \nprinting. So, No. 1, it would increase the deficit. No. 2, it would \nhave no effect on the amendment that is being offered by the other \nSenators and I.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. That would enable the funds in the trust fund to carry out \ntheir purposes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We clearly looked at our amendment to make certain it \nwould be operative irrespective of the Senate and, indeed, \ncongressional action on such a proposal as to repeal the 4.3-cent gas \ntax.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Byrd, Senator \nGramm, and Senator Baucus, to increase the authorization levels in \nISTEA II using funds generated by the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax.\n  Along with the support of many of my colleagues, we have waged strong \nefforts this year for higher funding levels for our nation's surface \ntransportation programs.\n  I initiated that effort and my amendments to spend additional \nrevenues from the highway trust fund earlier this year failed by 1 \nvote.\n  Later, during the debate on the conference on the budget resolution, \n85 Senators urged--by letter--the conferees to raise the allocation to \nthe highway program so that a portion of the 4.3 cents Federal gas tax \ncould be spent. That effort received no response.\n  Once again, with the amendment we offer today, we have another \nopportunity to ensure that additional funding is made available to \nmodernize and expand our nations surface transportation system.\n  I continue to believe that investments in our transportation system--\nhighways, rail and transit--are a wise and essential investment for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Almost every economic effort by the U.S. private sector is met by \ncompetition worldwide. Mr. President, for every dollar invested in \ntransportation, there is an economic return of $2.60. Transportation \ndollars are, in military terms, a strong force multiplier.\n  The Department of Transportation also confirms that transportation \nspending is important for American workers. For every $1 billion spent \non transportation, there are 50,000 new jobs.\n  Only with such forces can we survive in this one market world. So, \nMr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the amendment \nwe offer today.\n  The Byrd-Gramm, Warner-Baucus, amendment is the most realistic chance \nfor us to provide needed funds for transportation based on actions by \nthis Congress in future budget resolutions.\n  I have joined this amendment because it ensures that the underlying \nformula, for distribution of funds, of the Committee bill remains \nintact.\n\n  For donor states, this is critically important because every state \nwill continue to receive 90 percent of the funds distributed based on \neach state's contributions to the highway trust fund.\n  Ninety percent of the additional funds, provided under this \namendment, will likewise be apportioned to each state. Apportioned in \nthe same manner as the formula provides under the committee bill.\n  Simply stated, this means that no state's percentage share of the \nprogram will change with the additional funds provided in the Byrd-\nGramm amendment.\n  Ensuring that every state gets a fair return of 90 percent of the \nfunds sent to the states under the formula is a fundamental principle \nof ISTEA II.\n  It is a principle that I will not abandon.\n  I am satisfied that this amendment is compatible with the formula \nrevisions established in the committee bill.\n  For this reason, I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of \nthis amendment.\n  My colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, may offer a different \napproach that makes it very difficult for more funds to be directed to \nour nation's highways.\n  The amendment which may be offered by Senators Domenici and Chafee \nwill provide an expedited process to pass another bill to allow for \nmore transportation spending following action on next year's budget \nresolution.\n  That expedited process, however, requires the Senate to pass a new \nbill. No additional funds that may be provided in a future budget \nresolution can be released unless we enact a new bill.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of the Byrd amendment ensures that our \nstates will not have to wait again for\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\nthe Congress to act. If any additional funds are provided in a budget \nresolution, they will go out through the normal process in an \nappropriations bill and then be allocated by the provisions, then in \nlaw hopefully, in this committee bill.\n  As a result, America's transportation system will benefit. Americans \nwill not be left stalled in gridlock waiting for the Congress to pass \nanother bill in an election year.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I wonder if the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia would yield for a couple of questions.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be happy to. I may have to ask my friends who are on \nthe committee and are far more expert than I on the subject matter to \nanswer, or to help answer.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. First, I say to the Senator that I am very pleased that \nthe amendment has now been submitted. It is submitted for printing--I \nguess not formally submitted. Anyway, this is the amendment that we are \ngoing to act upon, as I understand it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator for that because, so far, we have not \nbeen sure what we were dealing with. But now we know.\n  I say this to the Senator. I ask the Senator, I listened to the \nstatements on the floor here from the Senator from Texas and others, \nand there has been a lot of talk about truth in taxes and how wicked it \nwas that this 4.3 cents has not gone for highways, and that it was \ndeceptive to the American motoring public that when this tax was \nlevied, it was levied on the basis that it would be used for bridges, \nhighways, and so forth. Yet, I ask the Senator, was it not true when \nthat tax was enacted, the 4.3-cent additional gasoline tax, in 1993, it \nwas crystal clear to everybody that that was a deficit reduction; am I \ncorrect in that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's go back to 1990 just a bit. The distinguished Senator \nhas specificated the 4.3 cents. Let's go back to 1956, when I was in \nthe Congress. We passed the interstate highway bill during the \nEisenhower administration and I voted for it. We passed legislation \nproviding for a highway trust fund and for taxes on fuels that would be \ndeposited into that highway trust fund. And it was clearly understood \nby the American public then that that money was going to come back to \nthe public in meeting their highway and other transportation needs. So \nthat thought was thoroughly ingrained into the minds and hearts and \npocketbooks of the American people more than 40 years ago.\n  Now, we come up to 1990, 34 years subsequent thereto, and we go to \nthe meeting that was held over at Andrews Air Force base. I was part of \nthat meeting. We passed the legislation as part of a package. President \nBush entered into that agreement. I believe that former Speaker Foley \nwas there and was part of it. Several us were there. A part of that \npackage provided that 2.5 cents of the fuels taxes be for deficit \nreduction, temporarily, and that we would put it into a trust fund. \nThat was in 1990. It was to go back into the trust fund in 1995.\n  Tomorrow, I am going to lay a clearer outline in the Record. But I \nknow that our friends--and they are our friends; I consider them \nfriends--are going to argue that the American people did not understand \nthis money to be used for transportation needs, that the American \npeople, all along, have known otherwise. But that is not the case. I go \nback to 1956, and there are people who were infants at that time--I \nshould even say babies, some who hadn't been born yet who, for the next \n34 or 36 years after that period were paying taxes on gasoline at the \npump and who believe clearly and had good reason to believe because \nthat is what they were told and that was a fact, that those gas taxes \nwere going to be returned to the States by way of transportation \ninfrastructure. So that's what the American people have been told. We \nknow now, and it has been made clear in a recent study titled, ``What \nAmericans Think About Federal Highway Investment Issues.'' This is \npresented by the Transportation Construction Coalition Commission' \nOpinion and Survey.\n\n       It is not surprising then that fully 75 percent of \n     Americans say that the United States should use the gas tax \n     exclusively to pay for road and bridge improvements and not \n     on nontransportation programs. Fully 71 percent of Americans \n     want the $6 billion in gas tax revenues, now spent on \n     nontransportation programs, shifted to highways and bridge \n     safety improvements. Indeed, 69 percent of the majority say \n     the U.S. Government should place an even higher priority on \n     highway and bridge improvements of any type than it does now.\n\n  So I thank the distinguished Senator for asking the question. I say, \nyes, there was a brief interlude in those years between 1956 and 1997 \nwhen some of the gas taxes were to be used on reduction of the \ndeficits. But that is not the case now, and it was not the case for 34 \nyears prior to the year 1990.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, Madam President, the point I am making here is \nthat, in 1993--and we were all here at the time--the President of the \nUnited States came forward with a deficit reduction program. In that \ndeficit reduction program--this was in 1993--there was a 4.3-cent added \ngasoline tax imposed. It was crystal clear to everybody who paid any \nbit of attention to it that that was for deficit reduction. That went \ninto the general fund. It wasn't for gas, it wasn't for highways or \nbridges, it was for deficit reduction. I voted against it. Every single \nRepublican voted against it, but that is neither here nor there. The \nfact is that it passed. In those days, there were a majority of \nDemocratic Senators in this body, and those 1993 moneys were clearly \nfor deficit reduction. So the reason I am stressing this is because we \nhave heard some powerful discussion here on the floor about truth in \ntaxes and how unfair it is to the American public that when our wives \ngo and pump the gas into the car, they believe that every tax they pay \non that is going into roads and bridges. That may be what they think, \nbut that isn't what the facts are. In 1993, it was crystal clear. There \nwas all kinds of debate here. I am not saying that was wrong. I voted \nagainst the entire package but, as I said, that is neither here nor \nthere. It is clear that the money for gasoline taxes was to go for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I don't even have the floor. I am here by sufferance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is entitled to the floor at this point.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will give you all of my time that I don't have.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to the Senator, back in 1993, it was a very \ndifficult time. The President and the Democratic majority of the \nCongress were trying to figure out a way to get us on the path toward \ndeficit reduction.\n  I might say to my good friend from Rhode Island that I think it \nworked. That package dramatically set us on a glidepath which has \nenabled us to begin to reduce our budget deficit. In fact, the budget \nresolution which was passed this year, which allows us to balance the \nbudget was due in large part to that 1993 package.\n  Having said that, I can remember when I cast that vote. At first, \nsome were proposing a higher tax than 4.3-cents per gallon. I think it \nwas up to a nine cents or so. I argued that I opposed using a gasoline \ntax for deficit reduction. And because of these arguments, the final \nnumber was 4.3 cents. So while I didn't like the idea of a gas tax for \ndeficit reduction, I supported it for the greater good of getting the \ndeficit reduced. And again, that package led get down the road to \ndeficit reduction. But I knew at that time, that once the deficit was \nreduced, we would be working get this money back to the trust fund for \ntransportation uses.\n  Indeed, that is what this Congress has done. We have voted to \ntransfer the 4.3 from deficit reduction to the trust fund. That vote \npassed by a very large margin with a majority of Republicans voted for \nit.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am not going to argue against the action that was taken \nat that time. I think the Senator may well be right, that those actions \nstarted a glidepath toward significantly reducing the deficit. All I am \nsaying here is that nobody was under any illusions at the time. I am \njust trying to rebut the statements being made\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\nhere that what we need is truth in taxation, truth in gasoline \ntaxation, and that this is a great deception to the American people. \nThere was no deception. It was absolutely clear in 1993 when those \nvotes were taken--I am not arguing with people who voted for or against \nit, but nobody in this Chamber was under any illusion that that money \nwas going to build roads or bridges. It was going to go to deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator, if he \nis going to speak, not to speak in my time because I would like to \nfinish my statement, and I see it slowly slipping away.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think we better let the Senator get on with his \nstatement. I have no time.\n  Is the Senator the last speaker?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have no idea.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Go to it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the good points made by my friend from Rhode \nIsland, but they are really sort of obfuscation. They really don't get \nto the central point, the central point being should we or should we \nnot pass the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment which will increase the \ncontract authority or authorization of transportation programs.\n  There have been a lot of statements from my colleagues about this \namendment already. So I will be very brief. The most important point is \none the Senator from West Virginia has so correctly made. We have \ntremendous transportation infrastructure needs, and that they are not \nbeing met. Indeed, the Department of Transportation has concluded under \nthe current highway program we need about $15 billion a year in \nadditional spending to meet our highway needs.\n  And these investments help us compete globally. It is this \ncompetition that has helped us reach the economic growth we have today. \nBut we have to invest more in the engine of the economy, our \ntransportation network. Other nation's are investing more in \ninfrastructure in order to catch up to us. If you look at what other \ncountries spend on infrastructure, Japan is four times as a percentage \nof GDP and Europe twice as much as we do. Just look around the D.C. \narea. Anybody who drives around here, with all the pot holes and \ncongestion, knows how much we need to improve the highways in this \ncountry.\n  So how do we meet these transportation needs? We begin by increasing \nthe authorizations for transportation spending. We have to do that with \nthe Byrd-Gramm amendment because we are faced with a budget resolution \nwhich has limited the amount of money that the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee can spend. And these limits are too low.\n\n  So the amendment Senator Byrd is offering is a very creative way to \nmeet the needs of our highway system. It is very simple. It says that \nif the savings, or a portion of the savings projected in OMB's \nmidsession review are realized and if Congress decides to spend them, \nthen transportation programs should be fully funded. Let me emphasize \nthe key words here. If there are additional savings from the economy \nand if Congress decides to spend them, then transportation should be \nfully funded. So nothing is mandated. There is no automatic increased \nspending. All of that will be decided by Congress next year and in \nfuture years. We are only saying that we should authorize these \nadditional funds so that if additional spending is available, the \nauthorization process is complete. We do not mandate anything. We are \nnot mandating the Budget Committee to take action. We are not mandating \nthe Appropriations Committee to spend any additional money. We are just \nsaying they should spend the additional savings if that savings is \navailable.\n  Now, the total savings available, if OMB's midsession review is \naccurate, will be about $200 billion. That is to say that we in the \nCongress will have $200 billion more than we thought we had when we \npassed the last budget resolution. That is, the economy has been doing \nso well that there will be about $71 billion less in spending--that is \nless in unemployment compensation insurance, for example--and about \n$130 billion in additional revenues because the economy is doing so \nwell. This is over a 5-year period. It is these savings that we are \ntargeting in this amendment.\n  Let me also say what this amendment does not do. Some Senators have \nsaid, and I think it is true that it is based on incorrect \ninformation--it is not their fault; the amendment has not been \navailable for them to read. Some Senators said, well, this amendment \nwill cut other programs. It is going to cut Head Start. It is going to \ncut education programs.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment in no way cuts funding for any \nprogram. Let me repeat that. The effect of this amendment is not to cut \nany program. That is because we are only authorizing additional \nspending with the anticipation that future economic savings will be \navailable to fund these authorizations. If we do not do this, if we are \nlocked into the lower numbers in the underlying bill, we will not be \nable to increase these numbers during the six year authorization. Not \nunless the Environment and Public Works Committee writes a new bill to \ndo so. We do not want to have to write a new highway bill every year. \nThat does not make sense. But the important point is that increasing \nthe contract authority will not cut the spending for other programs.\n  And this amendment does not bust the budget. Again, that is because \nit only increases the contract authority for transportation programs.\n  Another point. If this amendment does not pass, the balances in the \nhighway trust fund will be $71 billion by the year 2003. That is not \nright. Congress would continue to use this money to mask the true \nbudget deficit. It is phony business. It is smoke and mirrors to let \nthat happen. It just is not right to let these balances accumulate to \nsuch a large degree to mask the true budget deficit. That is wrong. And \nagain that would happen if this amendment does not pass. It just \nhappens automatically if it doesn't pass.\n  I might also add, Madam President, that I hear some Senators who are \nunhappy with the formula in the underlying bill. They have asked for \nmore money for their States. I have heard from many States. It is a \nrare State that doesn't make that plea.\n  There is only one way to help States get more money and that is to \nvote for the Byrd amendment. Every State will receive more contract \nauthority. If we do not have this extra contract authority, there is no \nway we can help States get more money. So if you need more money and if \nyou feel you are not being dealt with fairly, this amendment will help \nbring that result. We will not be able to help any States or any \nprograms without more money.\n  Madam President, I have more points I want to make, but I think it is \nprobably more appropriate to bring those points up when the amendment \nis actually before us. But I just wanted to summarize by saying that I \nask Senators to read the amendment now that it is available and they \nwill see it does not cause all these problems that some fear it will \ncause. And on the contrary, they will see that it does not bust the \nbudget and will not cause a funding cut to other programs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I want to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues, both here on the floor and elsewhere, that there will be a \nDomenici-Chafee amendment which will provide a simple, fast-track \nmethod to increase highway spending without requiring an entire new \nISTEA bill. So let's put to rest the suggestion that all kinds of \ncomplications are going to have to be gone through in order to increase \nhighway spending under the bill that is before us, plus the amendment \nthat Senator Domenici and I will submit.\n  So, therefore, you say, what's the difference? What's the difference \nbetween the two bills? Domenici-Chafee provides a fast-track method to \nprovide additional funding and the so-called Byrd bill, Byrd-Baucus-\nWarner-Gramm bill says there will be increased funding for highway \nspending. But, let me just tell you the difference, Madam President. \nWhat the Byrd bill says, it says, now, what the contract authority will \nbe, and since that is to be apportioned in just the present proportions \nthat exist amongst the States, that applies a chart immediately that \nwill go out, telling each State what it will get for each successive \nyear.\n  There is a hitch there, though. That's a promise, it appears. But the \nsponsors\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nare stressing that it is not a promise, that the appropriators do not \nhave to provide that amount of money. Here is the problem under that \napproach. I just look here on page 2, ``Authorization Of Contract \nAuthority: There shall be available from the Highway Trust Fund . . . \nto carry out this subsection [$5.x billion] for fiscal year 1999,'' \n$5.471 billion the next year, on and on it goes until it gets up to \n$5.781 billion.\n  That is contract authority. And, absent something occurring, that is \nwhat the States will get. But the question is, is that what the \nappropriations are going to be? Here is the hitch. Every State \ndepartment of transportation will look, as I say, at these amounts, \neverybody can figure out what their percentage is now and, since the \npromise is they are going to get the same percentage, we will figure \nlet's see, what does Rhode Island get out of this? Let's see, in fiscal \nyear 2001 things look pretty good. You just take $5.573 billion, which \nis on top of the amounts we have already, the $21 billion, you just add \nthat in and figure this is what we are going to get in Rhode Island. \nBut Rhode Island is not--or Maine, or Montana or West Virginia--is not \nnecessarily going to get these amounts which appear to be promises \nbecause they are not promises because the appropriators have to act.\n  So, it seems to me the proponents of the bill are riding two horses \nhere. One, they are saying to every State, you are going to get 25 \npercent more, isn't that wonderful? At the same time they are saying, \noh, there are no commitments. Nothing is done. We are not breaking the \nbudget. We are just going to leave it to the appropriators. Other \nprograms can get what they want.\n  The problem, it seems to me, is once you get these sums out there in \ncontract authority, as is in the Byrd bill, that every department of \ntransportation, every Governor will figure that is what is coming and \nthere will be tremendous pressure on this body to come through on the \npromise, seeming promise. They will stress, rightfully, it is not a \npromise. But who knows what the requirements are going to be for the \nbudget, on the budget in the year 2001? Or 2002? Or 2003? It may well \nbe we want to spend more on education. We may want to spend more on \nhealth care. It may be we want to cut taxes. But here this is locking \nus in.\n  I know they will deny it is locking us in. Why, contract authority, \nthat is just there, you can change it. But I will guarantee by this \ntime tomorrow every State will have a chart showing what they are going \nto get for 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. And it will appear to be a \npromise. That, to me, I believe, is a definite flaw in this measure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, if I understand the Senator, \nhe is saying under the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment it is true \nthat it is up to the discretion of the Budget Committee and \nappropriations committees to make these decisions, but that they will \nbe under such pressure that they will not be able to decide responsibly \nwhat is right for the country? That is what I understand the Senator to \nbe saying.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What I am saying is these amounts are listed here as \ncontract authority. I mean that is the word. And that means that every \nsingle State will anticipate--they can work these percentages out. You \ndon't have to be a Phi Beta Kappa to do that. And they will anticipate \nwhat they are getting.\n  Indeed, proponents are already saying every State is going to get 25 \npercent more. They don't know they are going to get 25 percent more. \nThat is what I mean. They are riding one horse saying you are going to \nget 25 percent more because there it is, ``in contract authority.'' At \nthe same time they are saying we leave it completely up to the \nappropriators, it is not necessarily 25 percent.\n  Which is it?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think it is very clear. The point of this is we \ntransferred 4.3 cents to the highway trust fund. Those are dollars that \nAmericans expect to be used for highways. And I think the Senator is \ncorrect in saying there is a very strong presumption that that contract \nauthority will be spent someday. The Budget Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee along with the rest of Congress will decide if \nthe contract authority will be spent. But that is only if economic \nsavings are realized. But the beauty of the amendment is if for some \nreason it does not make sense next year to increase transportation \nspending, they still have that discretion. That is the beauty of it.\n  So, in answer to the Senator, it is very clear. It could not be more \nclear. Yes, there is a very strong presumption because the amendment \nsays it should be spent. But it does not say it must be spent. It does \nnot mandate that. But I personally feel it should be spent. The \ncosponsors of this amendment very strongly believe that those dollars \nshould be spent.\n  But, still, we can't totally predict the future. I can't. I don't \nthink anybody in this body can. So next year if for some reason the \nBudget Committee and Congress decides it wants to make some other \ndecision, it can. And the Senator knows, under the terms of this \namendment, the Budget Committee can. But the Senator also is correct in \nsaying there is a strong presumption under this amendment that this \nmoney should be spent on highways if the savings are realized. Again, \nthe amendment provides ``if the savings are realized.''\n  I have one question for the Senator. When are we going to see the \namendment of the Senator?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It will be available tomorrow.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Tomorrow. Good.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I might say I think the Senator is on weak ground to \nsuggest I am slow. If I understand, the first discussion of the Byrd \namendment was on October 9th. I know there is a gestation period here, \nbut this has been unusually long. Whereas we have not been discussing \nour amendment publicly and talking about it, it is going to come. I \nthink it was first going to come on the 10th; then it was going to come \non Monday the 20th. Then we looked forward with bated breath for it on \nthe 21st. Indeed, it has not even been submitted yet.\n  You could perfectly well revise this. I don't know why you haven't \nfiled it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I call the attention of the Senator to a \nletter dated October 9th, signed by Mr. Chafee and by Mr. Domenici, to \ncolleagues, in which the two Senators promise that there will be an \namendment forthcoming. They even enclose an one-page summary of their \namendment. And they say, ``We hope that we can have your support for \nthis important matter.'' So on October 9th they had an amendment. That \nwas before the recess occurred. They had an amendment, apparently, \nthen, because they sent this to all their colleagues. I don't believe I \nreceived one. Maybe I did. I'm not sure.\n\n  In any event, they had the amendment then. Why have they waited until \nthis date? They had it on October 9th. Today is October the 22nd, and \nwe still don't see the amendment. But that is not so important.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island that the \nStates know that they may not get the full authorized level. They never \ndid under ISTEA, under ISTEA I, in previous years. They didn't get the \nauthorized level.\n  May I also add I will be glad to join with the Senator and with Mr. \nDomenici in raising the caps. I will be happy to do that at the proper \ntime, and I will urge that that be done. But there is time for that, \nyes.\n  Yes, the pressure is going to increase. No doubt about it. The \npressures will increase because the people are going to want to get \nwhat they have been promised. Say what you like, but on May 22, 83 \nSenators voted that 4.3 cents should be returned to the trust fund and \nbe spent on highway needs. That was 5 months ago. Only half of the task \nhas been done, the transfer of the tax, but no spending of that revenue \nis currently authorized. So, I think when the people out in the various \nStates, the hills and hollows, the seashores, read about this amendment \nthey are, indeed, going to increase pressure to have us live up to the \ncommitment that we know has been made and which was being urged by 83 \nSenators on May 22nd.\n  I thank my good-natured friend, Mr. Chafee. He is always very good \nnatured, humorous, pleasing to get along\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nwith. I enjoy serving with him. I thank him for yielding.\n  If he will yield just one moment further, I ask unanimous consent, \nMadam President, that the amendment that I am offering today on behalf \nof myself, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Warner and 36 other Senators, be \nprinted in the Record so that all Senators may read it tomorrow.\n  (The text of the amendment No. 1397 is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. And, while I am on the floor on my feet, I shall read the \nnames of the other cosponsors. And we are expecting additional \ncosponsors, as I indicated earlier today, with several Senators saying \nthey won't cosponsor but they would vote with us.\n  The following Senators have agreed up to this point to cosponsor the \namendment: Senators Akaka, Ashcroft, Baucus, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, \nBurns, Byrd, Cleland, Coats, Coverdell, DeWine, Dorgan, Faircloth, \nFeinstein, Ford, Gramm of Texas, Grams of Minnesota, Harkin, Hollings, \nHutchinson of Arkansas, Inhofe, Inouye, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerrey of \nNebraska, Kerry of Massachusetts, Landrieu, Leahy, Lieberman, McCain, \nMcConnell, Mikulski, Reid of Nevada, Rockefeller, Santorum, Sessions, \nShelby, Specter and Warner.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me the privilege of reading these \nnames into the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

I'm interested in \nthis language as it relates to the treatment of railroads. I understand \nthat the provisions proposed to be added to the ISTEA legislation are \nthe same as the provisions of S. 1115, the ``Comprehensive One-Call \nNotification Act of 1997.''\n  The Leader, together with the Minority Leader, introduced this bill \nas S. 1115 in July, and the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation already held a hearing on this bill in September.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Ford is correct. Thank you for focusing attention \non this important safety aspect of the amendment. Our country \nincreasingly depends on a reliable, safe, dependable underground \ninfrastructure of pipelines and communications networks. To protect \nthese facilities against damage from excavation activities, States have \ndeveloped one-call programs. These programs notify facility owners of \nimminent excavation in the vicinity of those facilities. The owners can \nthen mark the location of those facilities, protecting both the \nfacilities and the excavator. My legislative goal is to augment and \nimprove the effectiveness of these State programs.\n  Mr. FORD. Does the legislation impose mandates on States and require \nthem to change their programs?\n  Mr. LOTT. The answer is an emphatic ``no.'' The legislation does not \nimpose any federal mandate on the States to modify their existing one-\ncall programs. The bill does not dictate the content of these programs \nfrom Washington. Period. The legislation does, however, encourage \nStates to improve their programs, and it makes funding available for \nthat purpose.\n  To be eligible for the funding, the State programs must meet certain \nminimum standards, but even those standards are performance-based, not \nprescriptive.\n  Frankly, legislation that contained a federal mandate for a one-call \nsystem was tried a few years ago, and it failed. There were endless \nfights over how the bill should be written precisely due to the fact \nthat there are indeed 50 differing perceptions. Valid perceptions and \nexperiences which match up to the many programs already in existence. \nThis year, this mistake was avoided with this legislative approach--no \nmandates. And I am pleased to say that is why it enjoys broad support \non both sides of the aisle.\n  In fact, at the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter from Secretary of \nTransportation Slater, dated October 16, recognizing the importance of \nincluding one-call legislation as part of the reauthorization of the \nISTEA legislation.\n  Mr. FORD. Among the minimum standards required for a program to be \neligible for federal assistance is the requirement for ``appropriate \nparticipation by all excavators.'' However, the bill does not define \nthese terms. Isn't that going to lead to a variety of inconsistent \noutcomes?\n  Mr. LOTT. What I have found is that there is not one single one-call \ndefinition that applies equally to all 50 States. The various State \nlaws on the books have certain elements in common, but there are just \nas many differences, and those differences often are appropriate. \nMontana will not need the same law as Mississippi. For that reason, the \nbill allows States flexibility by not mandating a single definition \nwritten in Washington.\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. While there is not a definition of ``excavation'' in the \nbill, some definitions in other bills on this subject would have \ncovered routine railroad maintenance. I am concerned that railroads \nmight be required to participate in a program that places an undue \nburden on activities that pose little threats to underground \nfacilities. How would the bill before us affect this matter?\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, I say to Senator Ford, the bill does not require \nStates to change their existing programs. So it would not change the \nway railroads are treated under any existing State laws. I understand \nabout 30 States laws now cover at least some railroad activities while \nabout 10 specifically exempt railroads from coverage. The bill will not \nchange the exemption in these States. Will not. The fact that 30 States \nhave chosen to include railroads within their programs suggests that at \nleast in these instances, State legislatures determined that some \npotential threat to underground facilities from railroad activity does \nexist. Again, this bill in and of itself will not require a change in \nhow the railroad activity is treated. Will not.\n  However, I want to reiterate that what is appropriate for one State \nmay not be appropriate for another. To receive Federal assistance under \nthe bill, a State must only demonstrate that its program covers those \nexcavators whose action poses a significant risk to underground \nfacilities.\n  The State's decisions will not be measured and second-guessed against \na national standard.\n  Mr. FORD. Railroads also raised the issue of whether it is \nappropriate to require them to participate in one-call systems as \n``underground operators'' because railroads own their right-of-ways and \nknow the location of their own facilities within those right-of-ways.\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, if States do not now require railroads to \nparticipate as operators of underground facilities, then there still is \nno provision in the bill that would change that status. Remember, no \nmandates. Most State programs do not require participation by persons \nwhose underground facilities lie within their own property like a gas \nstation. The bill in no way discourages States from continuing such \ncommon sense exclusions.\n  Mr. FORD. The railroads also urged Congress to provide for immediate \nresponse in the case of derailments and natural disasters. Does the \nbill address this issue?\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, this bill neither specifies or directs the details \nof a State program nor does it override existing State programs. All of \nthe State programs of which I am aware allow for an immediate response \nin the event of an emergency. And this bill does not change this \nsituation.\n  Mr. FORD. Finally, the railroad industry expressed concern that the \nbill could possibly interfere with the right-of-way agreements \ncompanies have negotiated between themselves. Can this concern be \naddressed?\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to personally assure Senator Ford that this bill \ndoes not override private contracts, just as it does not override \nexisting State programs. If expert opinions believe doubt is created \nthan I will offer an amendment to remove this consequence.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Leader for his clarifications regarding this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from \nSecretary Slater be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: Thank you for your continued support in \n     developing legislation to enhance protection of America's \n     underground utilities.\n       As you know, safety is the Department of Transportation's \n     highest priority. Prevention of damage to underground \n     facilities, including pipelines and telecommunications \n     cables, is a key departmental safety initiative. That is why \n     we included one-call legislation as part of the \n     Administration's proposal to reauthorize the Intermodal \n     Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA).\n       Your continued leadership on one-call issues is critical to \n     enacting legislation during this Congress. I am pleased that \n     our respective bills share the same fundamental principles: \n     that all underground facility operators must participate in \n     one-call systems and that, with very limited exceptions, all \n     excavators must call before they dig. I look forward to \n     working with you to enact this important legislation.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me or Mr. Steven O. \n     Palmer, Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs, at 202-\n     366-4573, if you have any questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rodney E. Slater.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10947-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending October 17, the United States imported \n7,927,000 barrels of oil each day, 204,000 barrels less than the \n8,131,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil \nthan the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil \nfor 55.4 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that \nthe upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United \nStates obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign \ncountries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil \naccounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By \nU.S. producers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United \nStates--now 7,927,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10948-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      Executive Messages Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10948-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10948-S10949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:05 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the amendments of the Senate to concurrent resolution (H.

A bill for the relief of Belinda McGregor; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am today introducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of Belinda McGregor, the beloved sister of one of my \nconstituents, Rosalinda Burton.\n\n  Mistakes are made everyday, Mr. President, and when innocent people \nsuffer severe consequences as a result of these mistakes, something \nought to be done to remedy the situation.\n  In the particular case of Ms. Belinda McGregor, the federal \nbureaucracy made a mistake--a mistake which cost Ms. McGregor dearly \nand it is now time to correct this mistake. Unfortunately, the only way \nto provide relief is through Congressional action.\n  Belinda McGregor, a citizen of the United Kingdom, filed an \napplication for the 1995 Diversity Visa program. Her husband, a citizen \nof Ireland, filed a separate application at the same time. Ms. \nMcGregor's application was among those selected to receive a diversity \nvisa. When the handling clerk at the National Visa Center received the \napplication, however, the clerk erroneously replaced Ms. McGregor's \nname in the computer with that of her husband.\n  As a result, Ms. McGregor was never informed that she had been \nselected and never provided the requisite information. The mistake with \nrespect to\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\nMs. McGregor's husband was caught, but not in time for Ms. McGregor to \nmeet the September, 1995 deadline. Her visa number was given to another \napplicant.\n  In short, Ms. McGregor was unfairly denied the 1995 diversity visa \nthat was rightfully hers due to a series of errors by the National Visa \nCenter. As far as I know, these facts are not disputed.\n  Unfortunately, the Center does not have the legal authority to \nrectify its own mistake by simply granting Ms. McGregor a visa out of a \nsubsequent year's allotment. Thus, a private relief bill is needed in \norder to see that Ms. McGregor gets the visa to which she was clearly \nentitled to in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I have received a very compelling letter from \nRosalinda Burton of Cedar Hills, UT which I am placing in the Record. \nMs. Burton is Ms. McGregor's sister and she described to me the strong \nrelationship that she and her sister have and the care that her sister \nprovided when Ms. Burton was seriously injured in a 1993 car accident.\n  I hope that the Senate can move forward on this bill expeditiously. \nMs. McGregor was the victim of a simple and admitted bureaucratic \nsnafu. The Senate ought to move swiftly to correct this injustice.\n  Mr. President, I am also including in the record additional relevant \ncorrespondence which documents the background of this case.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Cedar Hills, UT,\n\n                                               September 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Hatch. This is one of the many endless \n     attempts to seek fairness and justification regarding a very \n     unique and still unresolved case pertaining to the future of \n     my beloved sister, Belinda McGregor.\n       This is a plea on my part for you to please allow me the \n     opportunity to humbly express in this letter, my deepest \n     concern which is also personally shared by Senator Edward \n     Kennedy.\n       It would be a challenge to explain what once stated as \n     ``the dream come true'' for my sister, Belinda, on to paper, \n     but I hope you will grant me a moment of your time to read \n     this attempt to seek your help, as my Senator.\n       Towards the end of 1993 I was the victim of a very serious \n     car accident and I could not have coped without the support \n     of my church and the tremendous help of my beloved sister, \n     Belinda, after which she expressed a strong desire to come \n     and live in Utah, to be close to me, her only sister. In \n     1994, therefore, a dream came true when, after applying for \n     the DV1 Program, which is held yearly, my sister's husband \n     David, was informed by the National Visa Center, that he was \n     selected in the 1995 Diversity Visa Lottery Program. Finally, \n     my sister had a chance to live near her family and friends. \n     Belinda, who is Austrian/British, then working for the \n     ``United Nations Drug Control Programme'' (UNDCP) at the UN \n     Headquarters in Vienna, Austria, was so thrilled to be \n     informed of the good news. Therefore, all the necessary \n     documents were provided to the National Visa Center in New \n     Hampshire.\n       Her patience was put to the test, as she did not hear from \n     anybody during a lengthy period of time. She contacted the \n     American Embassy in Vienna from time to time, but to no \n     avail. She then tried contacting various offices and people \n     without success and as a last resort made contract with \n     Senator Edward Kennedy's office, who kindly looked into her \n     case. She was so happy that someone took the time to check \n     into ``the ongoings of the National Visa Center'' and you can \n     imagine the surprise when Ms. Patricia First (Senator \n     Kennedy's staff) contacted my sister to let her know the \n     outcome of their investigation (Attachment \\1\\). I am also \n     attaching a copy of Senator Kennedy's letter to Ms. Mary A. \n     Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, United States \n     Department of State. (Attachment \\2\\), which explains very \n     clearly what actually had happened. Mr. McNamara, then \n     Director of the National Visa Center, addressed his reply to \n     Senator Kennedy (Attachment \\3\\). As my sister always wanted \n     to come live and work near me, and always believed very \n     strongly in fairness, she was convinced that the U.S. \n     Government would then do anything possible to find a \n     resolution to this predicament. By this time it was already \n     April 1997 and being quite a determined lady due to her 3 \n     year struggle, my sister, therefore, got in touch (via e-\n     mail) with the newly appointed Director of the National Visa \n     Center, Ms. Josefina Papendick. She explained the whole \n     situation, sent copies of previous correspondence to Ms. \n     Papendick but was always told (Attachments \\4\\ \\5\\) that \n     unfortunately there were no more visa numbers available as \n     the deadline for the 1995 Diversity Visa Lottery was 30 \n     September 1995. This was indeed a shock and disappointment \n     that no effort or willingness was shown to rectify the \n     matter, especially as the National Visa Center acknowledged \n     their own mistakes. The McGregor family did everything within \n     their power--submitted all necessary papers in a timely \n     fashion, but due to serious errors made by the National Visa \n     Center, were disqualified and their numbers were given to \n     someone else. She realizes of course that she is only a \n     minority but nevertheless--we all feel that injustice has \n     been done.\n       This injustice prevented my sister in building her future \n     here with me. For one tiny moment this special gift was \n     placed in her hands, to build her own world, but was quickly \n     taken, due to these errors made. As advised, my sister has \n     since then applied every year for the DV1 Program under her \n     Austrian Nationality.\n       She always worked in an international environment, her \n     previous employment being with the drug control program of \n     the United Nations and was confident her experience and \n     skills would be invaluable and beneficial to her newly \n     adopted homeland. In preparation for her invitation to \n     immigrate, she sought independence immediately and acquired a \n     secretarial position, which was put on hold for her. \n     Unfortunately and with deep regret she had to abandon the \n     offer when she was informed of the errors that were made.\n       She has been in contact with the honorable Senator Kennedy \n     ever since and his kind office suggested that I contact you \n     and maybe between you and Senator Kennedy this problem could \n     be looked into and resolved.\n       The future happiness of my sister is as important as my \n     own, and I hope and pray with all my heart, her tears of \n     sadness will, via your understanding, help and determination, \n     turn those tears to joy. Thank you for listening, dear \n     Senator Hatch.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Rosalinda Burton.\n       PS: Should you need any further information, please do not \n     hesitate to contact Belinda at my address. Thank you.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Ms. Patricia First's (Senator Kennedy's office) e-mail to \n     Belinda McGregor\n     \\2\\ Senator Edward Kennedy's letter to Mary A.

It appears that the Department \n     of State and National Visa Center grossly mishandled your \n     applications. Our office has sent a letter to Mary Ryan, \n     Assistant Secretary of Consular Affairs for the State \n     Department. Ms. Ryan's Section oversees the visa process. I \n     have attached the letter to Ms. Ryan which details the \n     mistakes made by the National Visa Center in processing your \n     applications.\n       The ultimate result seems to be that you were unfairly \n     denied a diversity visa to which you were entitled. Please be \n     assured our office is doing everything we can to find an \n     administrative solution to your case. We are awaiting a \n     response from the State Department, and I will communicate \n     their response to you as soon as I receive it.\n       Again, I urge you to apply for the 1997 Diversity Visa \n     Lottery, and I am sorry I cannot delivery better news. Please \n     feel free to contact me should you have any questions. I can \n     be reached at (202) 224-7878. I will update you as soon as I \n     have any new information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patricia First.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             attachment two\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 1996.\n     Mary A. Ryan,\n     Assistant Secretary, Consular Affairs,\n     U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n     RE: 1995 Diversity Visa Lottery\n     Applicants: Belinda McGregor, David John McGregor\n     Case No: 95-EU-00020036\n       Dear Ms. Ryan: I am writing to request your assistance in \n     resolving the above-referenced case. I am deeply concerned \n     about the way this case was handled by the Department of \n     State and the National Visa Center in New Hampshire.\n       Belinda McGregor, a citizen of the United Kingdom, and her \n     husband, David John McGregor, a citizen of Ireland, each \n     filed a separate application for the 1995 Diversity Visa \n     Lottery program. As you know, although Belinda McGregor was \n     born in the United Kingdom, she is eligible for the diversity \n     program through her husband's Irish citizenship.\n       According to your visa office and the National Visa Center, \n     Belinda McGregor's application was among those chosen as \n     eligible to receive a diversity visa. When the National Visa \n     Center received Belinda McGregor's application, however, the \n     clerk handling her case erroneously assumed Ms. McGregor, as \n     a citizen of the United Kingdom, was ineligible for the \n     diversity program. The clerk, in an apparent attempt to \n     remedy the problem, replaced Belinda McGregor's name in the \n     computer with that of her husband, David John McGregor.\n       The National Visa Center then sent David John McGregor a \n     notice that his name had\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\n     been selected in the 1995 Diversity Visa Lottery Program, and \n     listed the additional information Mr. McGregor needed to \n     provide to be eligible for a diversity visa (including, inter \n     alia, educational background and an affidavit of support). \n     David John McGregor provided this information about himself \n     to the National Visa Center in a timely fashion. The \n     McGregor's, who currently live in Austria, heard nothing more \n     about Mr. McGregor's diversity application until they asked \n     my office to inquire into the status of the application. \n     Belinda McGregor was never informed that her application had \n     been selected in the diversity lottery.\n       Upon receiving Mr. McGregor's completed information, a \n     second clerk at the National Visa Center discovered that \n     Belinda McGregor's name had been improperly changed to David \n     John McGregor in the computer. This clerk changed the name \n     back to Belinda McGregor, and noted the receipt of Mr. \n     McGregor's information. The clerk, however, failed to inform \n     the McGregor's that Belinda McGregor was the diversity \n     applicant selected in the lottery, and, therefore, the \n     National Visa Center needed information on Belinda McGregor, \n     instead of David John McGregor.\n       Having not received any information on Belinda McGregor by \n     the diversity visa entitlement date, September 30, 1995, the \n     National Visa Center disqualified Belinda McGregor's \n     application and gave her visa number to another applicant.\n       It appears that Belinda McGregor was unfairly denied the \n     1995 diversity visa which was rightfully hers due to a series \n     of errors made by the National Visa Center. A review by your \n     office of procedures at the National Visa Center may be in \n     order. And, I would greatly appreciate your help in finding a \n     solution to the McGregor's case in light of the serious \n     errors committed by the Center. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            attachment three\n\n                                         U.S. Department of State,\n\n\n                                         National Visa Center,\n\n                                   Portsmouth, NH, March 14, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I refer to your letter of February \n     16, to Ms. Mary A. Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular \n     Affairs, regarding the Diversity Lottery application for Ms. \n     Melinda McGregor.\n       The Immigration Act of 1990 provides for an annual \n     Diversity Immigration Program, making available each year by \n     random selection 55,000 permanent residence visas in the \n     United States. Visas are apportioned among six geographic \n     regions based on immigration rates over the last five years, \n     with a greater number of visas going to regions with lower \n     rates of immigration.\n       The National Visa Center (NVC) acknowledges the allegations \n     made in your correspondence as true and correct. However, \n     there are no visa numbers available as the deadline for the \n     1995 Diversity Lottery was September 30, 1995. Unfortunately, \n     we are unable to correct the situation at this time. Ms. \n     McGregor may wish to apply for any future lotteries.\n       We have reviewed this incident with our staff and have \n     taken steps to ensure that this error will not be repeated in \n     the future.\n       I hope this information is helpful.

Mr. McGregor's case was \n     chosen at random and entered into the computer system at the \n     National Visa Center (NVC). We assigned lottery rank number \n     95-EU-00020036 to this application.\n       Unfortuantely, the deadline for the completion of the DV-95 \n     was September 30, 1995. If you were not issued a visa by this \n     date, the application for the 1995 program is no longer \n     valid.\n       Your correspondence indicates that you believe you may be \n     eligible for immigrant visa issuance under the provision for \n     the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \n     Act of 1996 (Act 1996). However, this provision applies only \n     to applicants who were residing in the U.S. and were unable \n     to adjust their status. As you were residing outside the U.S. \n     you are not eligible to be processed under the Act of 1996.\n       I hope this information is helpful.

Since no paper \n     file is still available after all this time, I am unable to \n     provide any new or additional information regarding the \n     processing of your case.\n       I recognize your sincere wish to immigrate to the United \n     States. However, I very much regret to inform you that there \n     is no provision of law or regulations that would allow your \n     DV-95 application to be processed after September 30, 1995.\n       If you wish to pursue your interest in living and working \n     in the United States, the diversity program is an option \n     available every year for applicants (or their spouses) who \n     were born in eligible countries. For individuals who are not \n     eligible under any family immigrant visa category, there are \n     other visa classifications, both non-immigrant and immigrant, \n     in the employment or professional fields to apply for. For \n     more information on these, I suggest you contact the American \n     Embassy in London.\n       I am sorry that this response cannot be more encouraging. I \n     wish you and your family the best of luck in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Josefina L.

A bill to invest in the future of the United States by \ndoubling the amount authorized for basic scientific, medical, and \nprecompetitive engineering research; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n              THE NATIONAL RESEARCH INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, President Clinton has talked a lot about \nbuilding a bridge to the 21st century and, our philosophical \ndifferences aside, I want to help him build that bridge--with Bucky \nBalls.\n\n  ``Bucky Ball'' is the nickname for Buckminsterfullerene, a molecular \nform of carbon that was discovered by Prof's. Robert F. Curl and \nRichard E. Smalley of Rice University in Houston. They won the 1996 \nNobel Prize in chemistry for this discovery.\n  Bucky Balls were named after R. Buckminster Fuller, the architect \nfamous for his geodesic domes, because this new molecule closely \nresembles his designs. The silly nickname notwithstanding, their \ndiscovery was a breakthrough that will have scientific and practical \napplications across a wide variety of fields, from electrical \nconduction to the delivery of medicine into the human body.\n  Bucky Balls are impervious to radiation and chemical destruction, and \ncan be joined to form tubes 10,000 times smaller than a human hair, yet \n100 times stronger than steel. Use of the molecules is expected to \nestablish a whole new class of materials for the construction of many \nproducts, from airplane wings and automobile bodies to clothing and \npackaging material.\n  This may be more than you want to know about molecular physics, but \nthink about it this way: Because we encourage the kind of thinking that \nleads to discoveries like Bucky Balls, the United States stands as the \neconomic, military, and intellectual leader of the world. We achieved \nthis not by accident, but by a common, unswerving conviction that \nAmerica's future was something to plan for, invest in, and celebrate. \nUsing the products of imagination and hard work, from Winchester rifles \nand steam engines to space shuttles, Americans built a nation. We're \nstill building, but for what we need in the next century, we're going \nto have to turn to people like Curl and Smalley to give us materials \nlike Bucky Balls, and the Government has a role to play.\n  Unfortunately, over the past 30 years, the American Government has \nset different priorities. In 1965, 5.7 percent of the Federal budget \nwas spent on nondefense research and development. Thirty-two years \nlater in 1997, that figure has dropped by two-thirds. We spend a lot \nmore money than we did in 1965, but we spend it on social programs, not \nscience. We invest in the next elections, not the next generation.\n  The United States is underinvesting in basic research. That's right. \nThe author of the landmark deficit reduction legislation known today as \nGramm-Rudman supports the idea of the Government spending more money on \nsomething.\n  Not only do I support the idea of spending more on science and \ntechnology, I am today introducing a piece\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\nof legislation to achieve that goal. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Lieberman, Domenici, and Bingaman as I introduce S. 1305, the \nNational Research Investment Act of 1998. This bill, an update of my \nearlier bill, S. 124, would double the amount spent by the Federal \nGovernment on basic scientific, medical, and precompetitive engineering \nresearch over 10 years from $34 billion in 1999 to $68 billion in 2008.\n  If we, as a country, do no restore the high priority once afforded \nscience and technology in the Federal budget and increase Federal \ninvestment in research, it will be impossible to maintain the U.S. \nposition as the technological leader of the world. Since 1970, Japan \nand Germany have spent a larger share of their national income on \nresearch and development than we have. We can no longer afford to fall \nbehind. Expanding the Nation's commitment to research in basic science \nand medicine is a critically important investment in the future of our \nNation. It means saying no to many programs with strong political \nsupport, but by expanding research we are saying yes to jobs and \nprosperity in the future.\n  I believe that if we want the 21st century to be a place worth \nbuilding a bridge to, and if we want to maintain the U.S. position as \nthe leader of the free world, then we need to restore the prominence \nthat research and technology once had in the Federal budget. Our \nparent's generation fought two World Wars, overcame some of the worst \neconomic conditions in the history of our Nation, and yet still managed \nto invest in America's future. We have an obligation to do at least an \nequal amount for our children and grandchildren.\n  Over the past 30 years, we have not lived up to this obligation, but \nit isn't too late to change our minds. The discovery of Bucky Balls is \na testament to the resilience of the American scientific community. I \nbelieve that if we once again give scientists and researchers the \nsupport that they deserve, if we make the same commitment to our \nchildren's future that our parents made to ours, then the 21st century \npromises to be one of unlimited potential.\n  America is a great and powerful country for two reasons. First, we \nhave had more freedom and opportunity than any other people who have \never lived and with that freedom and opportunity people like us have \nbeen able to achieve extraordinary things. Second, we have invested \nmore in science than any people in history. Science has given us the \ntools and freedom has allowed us to put them to work. If we preserve \nfreedom and invest in science, there is no limit on the future of the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the National Research Investment Act of \n1998, which Senator Gramm and I introduced this morning, is important \nlegislation designed to reverse a downward trend in the Federal \nGovernment's allocation to science and engineering research. Although \nAmerica currently enjoys a vibrant economy, with robust growth of over \n4 percent and record low unemployment, we should pause for a moment to \nexamine reasons which underlie our current prosperity.\n  In one of the few models agreed upon by a vast majority of \neconomists, Dr. Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize for demonstrating that \nat least half of the total growth in the U.S. economy since the end of \nWorld War II is attributable to scientific and technological \ninnovation. In other words, money spent to increase scientific and \nengineering knowledge represents an investment which pays rich \ndividends for America's future.\n  Dr. Solow's economic theory is the story of our Nation's innovation \nsystem--a system that has transformed scientific and technological \ninnovation into a potent engine of economic growth for America. In \nbroad terms, our innovation system consists of industrial, academic, \nand governmental institutions working together to generate new \nknowledge, new technologies, and people with the skills to move them \neffectively into the marketplace. Publicly funded science has shown to \nbe surprisingly important to the innovation system. A new study \nprepared for the National Science Foundation found that 73 percent of \nthe main science papers cited by American industrial patents in two \nrecent years were based on domestic and foreign research financed by \ngovernments or nonprofit agencies.\n  Patents are the most visible expression of industrial creativity and \nthe major way that companies and inventors are able to reap benefits \nfrom a bright idea. Even though industry now spends far more than the \nFederal Government on research, the fact that most patents result from \nresearch performed at universities, government labs, and other public \nagencies demonstrate our dependence on these institutions for the vast \nmajority of economic activity. Such publicly funded science, the study \nconcluded, has turned into a fundamental pillar of industrial advance.\n  Last week's awarding of the Nobel Prize to Dr. William Phillips from \nthe Government's National Institute of Standards and Technology \nprovides a wonderful example of how publicly funded science pays \ndividends. Dr. Phillips was honored for his work which used laser light \nto cool and trap individual atoms and molecules. I am told that the \nmethods developed by Dr. Phillips and his coworkers may lead to the \ndesign of more precise atomic clocks for use in global navigation \nsystems and atomic lasers, which may be used to manufacture very small \nelectronic components for the next generation of computers. Dr. \nPhillips' achievement is the most visible recognition of the Department \nof Commerce's laboratory. Since 1901, however, the agency has quietly \ncarried out research to develop accurate measurement and calibration \ntechniques. The NIST laboratory, together with Commerce's technology \nprograms, have greatly aided American business and earned our \nNation billions of dollars in industries such as electrical power, \nsemiconductor manufacturing, medical, agricultural, food processing, \nand building materials.\n\n  Yet, despite the demonstrated importance of publicly funded \nscientific research, the amount spent on science and engineering by the \nFederal Government is declining. Senator Gramm has already noted that \n``in 1965, 5.7 percent of the Federal budget was spent on nondefense \nresearch and development. Thirty two years later, that figure has \ndropped by two-thirds to 1.9 percent.'' If you believe as I do, that \nour current prosperity, intellectual leadership in science and medicine \nand the growth of entire new industries are directly linked to \ninvestments made 30 years ago, then you have got to ask where will this \ncountry be 30 years from now?\n  At the same time, it is likely that several countries, particularly \nin Asia, will exceed on a per capita basis, the U.S. expenditure in \nscience. Japan is already spending more than we are in absolute dollars \non nondefense research and development. This is an historic reversal. \nGermany, Singapore, Taiwan, China, South Korea, and India are \naggressively promoting R investment. These facts led Erich Bloch, the \nformer head of the National Science Foundation, to write that the \n``whole U.S. R system is in the midst of a crucial transition. Its \nrate of growth has leveled off and could decline. We cannot assume that \nwe will stay at the forefront of science and technology as we have for \n50 years.''\n  The future implications of our failure to invest can be better \nunderstood if we consider what our lives would be like today without \nthe scientific innovations of those past 50 years. Imagine medicine \nwithout x rays, surgical lasers, MRI scanners, fiber-optic probes, \nsynthetic materials for making medical implants, and the host of new \ndrugs that combat cancer and even show promise as suppressors of the \nAIDS virus. Consider how it would be to face tough choices about how to \nprotect the environment without knowledge of upper atmospheric physics, \nchemistry of the ozone layer or understanding how toxic substances \neffect human health. Imagine communication without faxes, desktop \ncomputers, the internet, or satellites. Less tangible but nonetheless \ndisconcerting, is the prospect of a future for our country of free \nthinkers, if all new advances and innovation were to originate from \noutside of America's shores.\n  Although difficult, the partisan conflicts and rifts of the past \nseveral years may have performed a useful service in clarifying the \ndebate over when public funding on research is justified. Senator Gramm \nand I have discussed this\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\ntopic at some length. We believe it is a mistake to separate research \ninto two warring camps, one flying the flag of basic science and the \nother applied science. Rather the research enterprise represents a \nbroad spectrum of human activity with basic and applied science at \neither end but not in opposition. Every component along the spectrum \nproduces returns--economic, social, and intellectual gains for the \nsociety as a whole. The Federal Government should patiently invest in \nscience, medicine, and engineering that lies within the public domain. \nOnce an industry or company begins to pursue proprietary research, then \nsupport for that particular venture is best left to the private sector. \nThis is what we mean by the term ``precompetitive research.''\n  With introduction of the National Research Investment Act of 1998, we \nbegin a bipartisan effort to build a consensus that will support a \nsignificant increase in Federal research and development efforts. I am \nparticularly appreciative of the support given today from nearly 100 \ndifferent scientific and engineering professional societies which \ncollectively represent many more than 1 million members. \nAccomplishments of your members illuminate the role that science and \nengineering plays in the innovation process.\n  In a Wall Street Journal survey of leading economists published in \nMarch, 43 percent cited investments in education and research and \ndevelopment as the Federal action that would have the most positive \nimpact on our economy. No other factors, including reducing Government \nspending or lowering taxes, scored more than 10 percent. While Senator \nGramm and I are certainly committed to fiscal responsibility and \nbalancing the budget, we think that the country would be best served by \npromoting investments in education and R and reducing entitlement \nconsumption spending. Failure to do so now may well imperil America's \nfuture economic vitality and our leadership in science and technology.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof S. 1305, the National Research Investment Act of 1998.\n  Boosting the strength of our R infrastructure is crucially \nimportant to the future health and prosperity of every inhabitant of my \nhome State of New Mexico, just as it is to every American. The \nscientific, technical, and medical advances of the past 40 years have \ndramatically improved our standard of living. If we are to maintain \nthese advances into the future, we cannot afford to stand still.\n  Unfortunately, we are now headed in the wrong direction. Federal \nfunding for research and development has declined as an overall \npercentage of the Federal budget over the last 20 years. We now spend \nless than 2 cents of each dollar of Federal spending on science and \nengineering research and development. We need to do better. It is clear \nthat if we want to create the kind of high-paying, high-technology jobs \nthat will ensure a decent standard of living for American workers, we \nwill need a much stronger commitment to investing in research and \ndevelopment.\n  Although the focus of this bill is ensuring a strong future for \ncivilian R, it is important to recognize that the basic science and \nfundamental technology development supported by the Defense portion of \nour budget also contributes to our domestic prosperity. For our Nation \nto remain prosperous into the next century, we need both sources of \nsupport for basic science and fundamental technology to remain strong, \neven in a time of constrained budgets.\n  There was a time when our investment in research and development \nequaled that of the rest of the world combined. But through the years, \nwe have allowed our commitment to slide, and have lost much ground \ncompared to our international competitors. Mr. President, this is not \nwhere we want to be, and I hope that the National Research Investment \nAct of 1998 will put us on the path to a better future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1307. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 with respect to rules governing litigation contesting \ntermination or reduction of retiree health benefits and to extend \ncontinuation coverage to retirees and their dependents; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           THE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nrestores employer health coverage to individuals who, throughout their \ncareers, were led to believe their retiree health benefits were secure. \nThese retirees earned their benefits through years of labor and have \nreached an age when other private coverage is difficult if not \nimpossible to find. The Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act of 1997 \nreempowers retirees whose employers renege, often without notice, on a \ncommitment they made to retiree security and health.\n  The bill I am offering today melds two measures I first introduced in \nthe 104th Congress. The goal is to restore retirees' rights and options \nwhen their former employer takes action to terminate their health \nbenefits.\n  The legislation was drafted to address a serious problem brought to \nmy attention by the retirees of the Morrell meatpacking plant in Sioux \nFalls, SD. In January 1995, more than 3,300 Morrell retirees in Sioux \nFalls and around the country were given 1 week's notice that their \nhealth benefits were being terminated.\n  Pre-Medicare retirees were offered continued health coverage for only \none year under Morrell's group plan, if the retiree assumed the full \ncost of coverage. When this option lapsed in January 1996, many of \nthese people became uninsured. These retirees, like so many who face \nthis situation, had spent years building the company and taking lower \npensions or wages in exchange for the promise of retiree health \nbenefits.\n  This problem is unfortunately not limited to the Morrell retirees. \nRecent data confirms that a declining share of employers maintain \nhealth benefits for their retirees. In fact, the percentage of large \nemployers offering such coverage has dropped by nearly 10 percentage \npoints over the last 5 years. In 1991, 80 percent of large employers \nprovided retiree benefits. As of 1996, 71 percent do.\n  Early retirees age 50-64 who lose their health benefits are \nespecially vulnerable to becoming uninsured, because health insurance \nis expensive when purchased at an older age, or unavailable as a result \nof preexisting conditions.\n  The bill I am introducing today would establish a number of \nprotections to address this alarming trend.\n  To minimize unexpected terminations of benefits, my bill would ensure \nthat benefits are terminated or reduced only when evidence shows that \nretirees were given adequate warning--before their retirement--that \ntheir health care benefits were not promised for their lifetimes. If \nthe contract language establishing retiree benefits is silent or \nambiguous about the termination of these benefits, my bill would place \nthe burden of proof on the employer to show that the plan allows for \nthe termination or reduction of retiree health benefits.\n  To help protect coverage for retirees and their families until fair \nsettlements are reached, if an employer's decision to terminate \nbenefits is challenged in court, my bill requires the employer to \ncontinue to provide retiree health benefits while these benefits are in \nlitigation.\n  To prevent early retirees and their families from being left \nuninsured, this legislation would extend so-called COBRA benefits to \nearly retirees and their dependents whose employer-sponsored health \ncare benefits are terminated or substantially reduced.\n  Broadly stated, COBRA currently requires employers to offer \ncontinuing health coverage for up to 18 months for employees who leave \ntheir place of employment. The employee is responsible for the entire \ncost of the premium, but is allowed to remain in the group policy, thus \ntaking advantage of lower group rates. This legislation would extend \nthe COBRA law to cover early retirees and their families who are more \nthan 18 months away from Medicare eligibility.\n  This bill would not prohibit employers from modifying their retiree \nhealth benefits to implement legitimate cost-savings measures, such as \nutilization review or managed care arrangements.\n  Mr. President, retirees deserve this kind of health security.\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\n  Workers often give up larger pensions and other benefits in exchange \nfor health benefits. Unfortunately, in the case of the Morrell \nemployees and far too many others, the thanks they get for their \nsacrifices is that their benefits are taken away with no notice and no \ncompensating increase in their pensions or other benefits.\n  Early retirees often have been with the same company for decades, \nperhaps all of their adult lives. They rightfully believe that a \ncompany they help build will reward their loyalty, honesty, and hard \nwork.\n  It is time for this Congress to address this victimization of \nretirees by companies that put profits before integrity and cost-\ncutting before fairness. We should not simply sit back while this \nsystem creates another population of uninsured individuals. Instead, we \nshould take this opportunity to preserve private coverage for as many \nretirees as possible and restore the financial security and freedom \nthey earned and thought they could depend upon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1307\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect as if enacted on January 1, \n     1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 1308. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \ntaxpayer confidence in the fairness and independence of the taxpayer \nproblem resolution process by providing a more independently operated \nOffice of the Taxpayer Advocate, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the taxpayer protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this afternoon, I rise to introduce \nlegislation representing, I think, a very important step in giving \nAmerican taxpayers an additional tool for them to use in solving \nproblems that they have when they are entering into a dispute with the \nInternal Revenue Service. My bill would ensure that American taxpayers \nhave someone with real authority and significant resources who will \nrepresent their interests when dealing with IRS, a true taxpayer \nadvocacy organization which will be on the side of the American \ntaxpayer and not on the side of Washington bureaucrats.\n  I want to also point out that I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \nKerrey-Grassley bill, which is a broader restructuring of the entire \nInternal Revenue Service, that came about as part of the work that the \nbipartisan commission studied for over a year's time.\n  The bill, however, that I am introducing today will strengthen the \npart of the bill dealing with the Office of Taxpayer Advocate by making \nthe advocate's office much more independent than it is now and giving \nit more muscle in representing the interests of American taxpayers.\n  Last month, our Senate Finance Committee had 3 days of hearings \nlooking at the practices and procedures within the Internal Revenue \nService. In addition to hearing from taxpayers who had been mistreated \nby the Internal Revenue Service, our committee also heard very shocking \ntestimony from both current and former IRS employees. These witnesses \nclearly underscored the importance of doing some major changes in how \nthe Internal Revenue Service operates.\n  We heard, for instance, Acting Commissioner of IRS Mike Nolan say, \n``The IRS is undergoing tremendous change.''\n  That is very encouraging and also very long overdue. My concern is \nthat there is a big disconnect between the Commissioner's office and \nover 100,000 IRS employees who work all over America, and even a \ngreater disconnect between some of these employees--not all, but some--\nand the American taxpayer. This became very painfully clear as a result \nof our 3 days of hearings.\n  I want to point out that the IRS is a very convenient political \npunching bag for many, and speeches condemning the IRS are met with \nwidespread applause at any type of a townhall meeting you want to have. \nBut this is not an issue that we should demagog. Americans want us to \nsolve the problem and not just pass the blame around and blame the \nother side for their failures.\n  As was the case with the balanced budget amendment, Republicans and \nDemocrats need to come together in a bipartisan fashion and act \nresponsibly to come up with some real changes that are going to help \naddress this problem and protect the American taxpayer.\n  Unless we don't want a national defense or a public highway system or \nschools and national parks, we have to ask ourselves, what will we have \nif we just eliminated the Internal Revenue Service? When the Department \nof Defense, I am reminded, had all of these problems buying $200 toilet \nseats and $500 hammers, we didn't do away with the Department of \nDefense, we reformed it. We gave them specific instructions on how they \nshould conduct their business. As a result, we still have a Department \nof Defense, thank goodness, but it is operating more efficiently and \nmore effectively and not making the type of mistakes that we saw in the \npast. The bottom line is we reformed it. We have to do the same thing \nwith the Internal Revenue Service.\n  There are many issues to look at when we talk about how to \nrestructure. One is IRS management, how to model a new oversight \nstructure at the IRS that would make it more responsive and accountable \nto their management problems.\n  There also is a separate issue, and that is how to strengthen the \nhand of the American taxpayer when they have to deal with the Internal \nRevenue Service and let our American taxpayers know that somewhere \nthere is someone who is on their side when they have problems with the \nFederal Government and specifically with the IRS.\n  On the first issue of management, attention has focused on who should \nsit on the board of directors that runs an IRS and what kind of \nauthority and responsibilities this board would have. I\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\nthink there is widespread agreement that the management and oversight \nof the IRS needs to improve dramatically. We need to have more private \nsector involvement in that board of directors.\n  The Finance Committee is going to have hearings on the restructuring \nquestion next week. I hope that we have a fair and open discussion \nabout what needs to be done, because that is the only way a solution \nwill be arrived at. I personally think we should try and model the \nmanagement of IRS on a real board of directors, a concept that is part \nof the bill introduced by Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley and also \nCongressmen Portman and Cardin in the House of Representatives. I am a \ncosponsor of their legislation and will be actively participating in \ngetting that done.\n  There is no reason why the Internal Revenue Service shouldn't be just \nas advanced technologically from an organizational standpoint as any \nFortune 500 company in America. Our goal should be to have an oversight \nboard that improves the IRS accountability and also their operations. A \nbetter managed IRS will translate into better customer service for \ntaxpayers.\n  But just as important, however, we need to look at ways to improve \nthe everyday outcomes when taxpayers have a problem and have to engage \nwith the IRS. An oversight board may solve some of those, but we need \nto put in place some independent group that is going to represent the \ninterests of the American taxpayer on a day-to-day basis, and that is \nwhat my legislation would do.\n  Currently, the IRS has an Office of Taxpayer Advocate whose job is to \nrepresent the American taxpayers in dealings with the IRS. The problem \nwith the current structure, however, is that this taxpayer advocate \ndoes not have enough independence. The taxpayer advocate in each \ndistrict reports directly to the district director of the IRS. \nTaxpayers need someone who will work for them and represent their \ninterests and not just be an employee of the IRS.\n  My bill would make the taxpayer advocate a great deal more \nindependent by giving it more resources, more authority and more \nresponsibilities. The American taxpayers would then have someone \nworking for them and not just working for the IRS when they need help.\n  My bill would do the following:\n  No. 1: A national taxpayer advocate would be appointed directly by \nthe President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. He or she \nwould not continue to be appointed by the IRS Commissioner. The \nnational taxpayer advocate would also not be selected from the ranks of \nthe IRS, to make sure that person is truly independent.\n  No. 2: The national taxpayer advocate will make the hiring and firing \ndecisions regarding the heads of the local taxpayer advocate office in \nthe IRS district and service centers. No longer would the local \ntaxpayer advocate be hired and fired by the district director.\n  No. 3: The initial contact between the IRS and the taxpayer will \ninclude a disclosure that the taxpayers have a right to contact their \nlocal taxpayer advocate and information on how to contact them so that \nthe taxpayer will know that this office is there and it is there to \nprotect their legitimate interests.\n  No. 4: The local taxpayer advocate office would have a separate phone \nnumber, fax number, and post office box apart from the IRS district \noffice.\n  And finally, No. 5: The taxpayer advocate would also have the \ndiscretion not to disclose taxpayer information to IRS employees, \nanother tool which could help taxpayers.\n  All of these measures are designed to give the taxpayer advocate a \nmuch stronger voice, a much stronger hand in representing American \ntaxpayers. What taxpayers in this country need is someone who is on \ntheir side, not on the Government side, who has the resources to go up \nagainst the IRS.\n  I have been working closely with Senator Kerrey and pleased he \nsupports including my provision in the overall bill that they are \nplanning to introduce. So, I think we are making progress. I think we \nought to be doing it in a continued responsible fashion, in a \nbipartisan fashion. If we can get this done, I just suggest that the \nAmerican taxpayer will now know that there is some office that is on \ntheir side representing their interests before their Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Chafee, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1309. A bill to provide for the health, education, and welfare of \nchildren under 6 years of age; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce today the Early \nChildhood Development Act with Senator Bond. I want to thank Senator \nBond for his leadership, both as a Governor who began the successful \nParents as Teachers Program and for joining together in this bipartisan \neffort to develop a real world solution to real world problems.\n  Mr. President, there is no issue more important in America than the \nurgent needs of young children. This country must rededicate itself to \ninvesting in children, an investment which will have tremendous \nreturns. Early intervention can have a powerful effect on reducing \nGovernment welfare, health, criminal justice, and education \nexpenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can significantly \nreduce later destructive behavior such as school dropout, drug use, and \ncriminal acts. A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool \nfound that at-risk toddlers who received preschooling and a weekly home \nvisit reduced the risk that these children would grow up to become \nchronic lawbreakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University \nFamily Development Study showed that providing quality early-childhood \nprograms to families until children reached age 5 reduces the \nchildren's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It's no \nwonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that 9 out of 10 \nsaid that ``America could sharply reduce crime if Government invested \nmore'' in these early intervention programs.\n  These programs are successful because children's experiences during \ntheir early years of life lay the foundation for their future \ndevelopment. Our failure to provide young children what they need \nduring this period has long-term consequences and costs for America. \nRecent scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing \nchildren's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development \nwill result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our \nNation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the \nphysical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating \nenvironment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain \ncontains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are \nstars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons \ndevelops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched \ndevelop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n  Mr. President, reversing these problems later in life is far more \ndifficult and costly. I want to discuss several examples.\n  First, poverty seriously impairs young children's language \ndevelopment, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. \nPoor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, \nanemia, and stunted growth. Of the 12 million children under the age of \n3 in the United States today, 3 million--25 percent--live in poverty.\n  Second, three out of five mothers with children younger than 3 work, \nbut one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care \ncenters serving infants provided care of such poor quality as to \nactually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development.\n\n  Third, in more than half of the States, one out of every four \nchildren between 19 months and 3 years of age is not fully immunized \nagainst common childhood diseases. Children who are not immunized are \nmore likely to contact preventable diseases, which can cause long-term \nharm.\n  And fourth, children younger than 3 make up 27 percent of the 1 \nmillion children who are determined to be abused or neglected each \nyear. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and neglect in 1995, 85 \npercent were younger than 5 and 45 percent were younger than 1.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, our Government expenditure patterns are\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\ninverse to the most important early development period for human \nbeings. Although we know that early investment can dramatically reduce \nlater remedial and social costs, currently our Nation spends more than \n$35 billion over 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or delinquent \nyouth and child welfare programs for children ages 12 to 18, but far \nless for children from birth to age 6.\n  Today we seek to change our priorities and put children first. I am \nintroducing the Early Childhood Development Act of 1997 to help empower \nlocal communities to provide essential interventions in the lives of \nour youngest at-risk children and their families.\n  This legislation seeks to provide support to families by minimizing \nGovernment bureaucracy and maximizing local initiatives. We would \nprovide additional funding to communities to expand the thousands of \nsuccessful efforts for at-risk children ages zero to 6 such as those \nsponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, and other less well-\nknown grassroots organizations, as well as State initiatives such as \nSuccess By Six in Massachusetts and Vermont, the Parents as Teachers \nprogram in Missouri, Healthy Families in Indiana, and the Early \nChildhood Initiative in Pittsburgh, PA. All are short on resources. And \nnowhere do we adequately meet demand although we know that many States \nand local communities deliver efficient, cost-effective, and necessary \nservices. Extending the reach of these successful programs to millions \nof children currently underserved will increase our national well-being \nand ultimately save billions of dollars.\n  The second part of this bill would provide funding to States to help \nthem provide a subsidy to all working poor families to purchase quality \nchild care for infants, toddlers, and preschool children. We would not \ncreate a new program but would simply increase resources for the \nsuccessful Child Care and Development Block Grant [CCDBG]. Child care \nfor infants and toddlers is much more expensive than for older children \nsince a higher level of care is necessary. Additional funding would \nalso pay for improving the salaries and training level of child care \nworkers, improving the facilities of child care centers and family \nchild care homes, and providing enriched developmentally appropriate \neducational opportunities.\n  Finally, the bill would increase funding for the Early Head Start \nProgram. The successful Head Start Program provides quality services to \n4 and 5 year-olds. The Early Head Start program, which currently is a \nmodest program funded at $200 million annually, provides comprehensive \nchild development and family support services to infants and toddlers. \nExpanding this program would help more young children receive the early \nassistance they need.\n  I was delighted to be joined earlier today by Dr. Berry Brazelton and \nRob Reiner to announce this bill. I want to thank Governor Dean of \nVermont and Governor Romer of Colorado for supporting this legislation \nand the wide range of groups who support this legislation including the \nAssociation of Jewish Family & Children's Agencies, Boys and Girls \nClubs of America, Children's Defense Fund, Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, Coalition On Human Needs, Harvard Center for Children's \nHealth, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, National Black Child \nDevelopment Institute, Inc., National Council of Churches of Christ in \nthe USA, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and Rob Reiner of \nthe I Am Your Child Campaign.\n  Children need certain supports during their early critical years if \nthey are to thrive and grow to be contributing adults. I look forward \nto working with Senator Bond and both sides of the aisle to pass this \nlegislation and ensure that all children arrive at school ready to \nlearn.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n     children begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain itself and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain will suffer. At birth, a baby's \n     brain contains 100,000,000,000 neurons, roughly as many nerve \n     cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring \n     pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children \n     who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains \n     that are 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n       (3) This scientific evidence also conclusively demonstrates \n     that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits \n     for children, families, and our Nation.\n       (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n     under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, our society \n     must change to provide new supports so young children receive \n     the attention and care that they need.\n       (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n     United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n       (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n     United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n     proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller \n     proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n       (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n     between increased violence and crime among youth when there \n     is no early intervention.\n       (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n     over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n     delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n     crisis situations which frequently could be avoided or made \n     much less severe with good early interventions.\n       (9) Many local communities across the country have \n     developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n     additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities \n     for young children.\n                 TITLE I--ASSISTANCE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN\n\n     SEC. 101.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take \n     effect on October 1, 1998.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry, to introduce the \nEarly Childhood Development Act of 1997. Let me thank all who have \nworked so hard to develop this legislation.\n  The most important thing we can do to address the many social \nproblems we face, is to recognize that the family is the centerpiece of \nour society and take steps to strengthen families and mobilize \ncommunities to support young children and their families.\n  This legislation follows up on recent scientific research showing \nthat infant brain development occurs much more rapidly than previously \nthought, and that early, positive interaction with parents plays the \ncritical role in brain development.\n  Not surprisingly parents have known instinctively for generations \nwhat science is just now figuring out: that reading to a baby, \ncaressing and cuddling him, and helping him to have a wide range of \ngood experiences will enhance his development. When children fail to \nreceive love and nurturing at home when they do not receive quality \nchild care, whether it is provided by centers, family child care homes, \nor relatives, they are far more likely to develop social and academic \nproblems.\n  Yet parents today face burdens that were unimaginable a generation \nago. Half of all marriages now end in divorce, and 28 percent of all \nchildren under the age of 18 live in a single-parent family. One in \nfour infants and toddlers under the age of 3--nearly 3 million \nchildren--live in families with incomes below the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  Many women, particularly in low- and moderate-income families, are \nessential in helping support their families financially and have \nentered the workforce in record numbers during the last generation. In \nmany families, both parents work. Each day, an estimated 13 million \nchildren younger than 6--including 6 million babies and toddlers--spend \nsome or all of their day being cared for by someone other than their \nparents. Children of working mothers are entering care as early as 6 \nweeks of age and spending 35 or more hours a week in some form of child \ncare. Whether by choice or necessity, parents must try to find quality \nchild care--which is not always available.\n  We are seeking, through this legislation, to provide families with \nsupport through early childhood education and more child care options. \nOur bill will support families--not bureaucracy--by building on local \ninitiatives that are already working for families with infants and \ntoddlers. We will help communities improve their services and supports \nto families with young children by expanding the thousands of \nsuccessful efforts for families with children from birth to 6, such as \nthose sponsored by the United Way and Boys and Girls Clubs as well as \nState initiatives such as Success by Six in Massachusetts and Vermont, \nthe Parents as Teachers programs in Missouri and 47 other States, and \nthe Early Childhood Initiative in Pennsylvania.\n  The Early Childhood Development Act will provide funds for early \nchildhood education programs for all children that emphasize the \nprimary role of parents and help give them the tools they need to be \ntheir children's best teachers. Parents are the key to a child's \nhealthy development and as we all know, we will never solve our social \nproblems unless we involve parents in the process and in their \nchildren's lives.\n  In addition, the bill will expand quality child care programs for \nfamilies, especially for infants. And we will begin the Head Start \nProgram earlier--when its impact could be much greater--at birth.\n  While Government cannot and should not become a replacement for \nparents and families, we can help families become stronger by providing \nsupport to help them give their children the encouragement, the love \nand the healthy environment they need to develop their social and \nintellectual capacities.\n  Our legislation balances the desire to provide support with the need \nto do so responsibly. I am proud that we have come together on a \nbipartisan basis to invest in programs that encourage family \nresponsibility and obligation while helping families in need to reach \nthose goals.\n  I am very optimistic that the spirit of bipartisanship will guide our \nconsideration of this legislation and move it forward. Recent polls \nhave shown that the overwhelming majority of Americans want early \nchildhood development issues to be top priorities for our country. We \nmust all work together to ensure that our most vulnerable citizens are \ngiven the care and protection they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nimprove the quality of life for all children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, on October 16, our colleague, Senator \nJoe Biden gave a very important and insightful assessment of United \nStates foreign policy with respect to Bosnia. The occasion for those \nremarks was that Senator Biden was being honored by Fairleigh Dickinson \nUniversity by being chosen as the first individual to hold a newly \nestablished chair at the university--the Fatemi University Chair in \nInternational Studies.\n  In accepting this honor, Senator Biden focused his remarks on a \ncurrent and some what daunting foreign policy challenge that looms \nbefore us in the coming months--Bosnia. As is always the case, Joe gave \nhis candid and unvarnished assessment of the current situation in \nBosnia--what's gone right and what's gone wrong. He also sets forth how \nhe believes U.S. policy should evolve over the coming months, if the \nUnited States is to enhance the prospects for fostering peace and \nstability in that war-torn country and in maintaining its leadership in \nshaping the course of world events. His comments were very thoughtful \nand very much on target from my point of view.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to take a moment to read \nSenator Biden's remarks. It would be time well spent.\n  I ask that the text of Senator Biden's remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n         Bosnia and American Foreign Policy: Finishing the Job\n\n                       (By Joseph R. Biden, Jr.)\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       It would be a very high honor under any circumstances to be \n     called to the fatemi university chair in international \n     studies here at Farleigh Dickinson University.\n       Although I'm not sure I deserve the distinction, I feel \n     honored to be the first to hold that chair.\n       This is for me, as I know it is for many of you, an extra-\n     special occasion, and an extra-special honor.\n       Not only because of the very high standing in the foreign \n     policy community the graduate institute of international \n     studies has earned for Farleigh Dickinson.\n       Not just because of the pre-eminent position Dr. Fatemi \n     occupied in the field of international studies,\n       But also because I have had the very great privilege of \n     knowing Dr. Fatemi and his family personally, through the \n     friendship of his son Fariborz. So besides an opportunity to \n     discuss foreign policy with you, this is a kind of homecoming \n     for me.\n       That's the way Dr. Fatemi and his family made even a \n     stranger feel upon entering their household, and that kind of \n     hospitality was a direct reflection of the kind of man he \n     was.\n       I knew beforehand of his record as a diplomat, as a writer \n     and teacher, and as an exemplar of the richness and integrity \n     of an ancient but still vital culture.\n       What I discovered when I met him was that the man was even \n     more impressive than his credentials. Despite his many \n     achievements, he always put his newest acquaintance instantly \n     at ease.\n       If you were his guest, he became your friend, and when he \n     was your friend, you became, eagerly and irresistibly, his \n     student. That was not just because of his learning and the \n     experience he gained over a long and productive life.\n       He became a valued friend and mentor primarily because it \n     was his nature to do so. He was undeniably bright and \n     intellectually challenging. But he was also gentle, \n     unassuming and encouraging.\n       He taught by example rather than precept; he radiated \n     wisdom and good will in equal measure.\n       It was impossible not to leave his presence wiser than you \n     arrived.\n       The breadth of his scholarship was astonishing, and simply \n     being exposed to it was an invigorating experience.\n       But it was the clarity of his insights into the maelstrom \n     of the Middle East and the passions of the islamic \n     fundamentalists that were most valuable to me.\n       The views I am about to express on Bosnia, are, of course, \n     mine alone. But if I manage to shed any light on that bloody \n     confrontation, much of the credit must go to Nasrollah \n     Fatemi, who opened his hearth, his heart and his mind to me \n     in a way I shall never forget.\n       Bosnia, of course, has significance far beyond the borders \n     of the former Yugoslavia.\n       It has turned out to be one of the most serious challenges \n     for America's foreign policy in the post-cold-war era. It has \n     produced 5 years of debate in congress. It is the centerpiece \n     of any discussion about American military intervention around \n     the world. In short, it has become a critical test of our \n     foreign policy.\n       Rightly or wrongly, whether United States foreign policy in \n     this era is viewed as a success or failure will depend in \n     large part on the success or failure of our policy in Bosnia. \n     So we better get it right.\n\n\n                 II. From ``Lift and Strike'' to Dayton\n\n       At the outset, let me state the obvious: I have cared \n     deeply about Bosnia for a long time, since the beginning of \n     the war. Some would say I bring ``historical baggage'' to the \n     issue. I care not just because of the strategic \n     implications--as Bosnia goes, so goes NATO--but for \n     humanitarian reasons.\n       Appalled by the naked Serbian aggression and genocidal \n     attacks on Bosnian civilians, in September 1992 I called for \n     a ``lift and strike'' policy. That was shorthand for lifting \n     the illegal and immoral arms embargo against the Bosnian \n     Government, which was the victim of aggression, and launching \n     air strikes against the Bosnian Serb aggressors.\n       My views were not widely shared at that time. As the war \n     escalated--with massacres, ``ethnic cleansing,'' and rapes--a \n     few other senators, including Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman, \n     joined my call for action. But it took more than two years of \n     failed diplomacy--and a quarter-million killed and two \n     million homeless--before we finally came around to the much-\n     derided ``lift and strike'' policy in the fall of 1995.\n       Guess what? The policy worked! The Serbian bullies sued for \n     peace, and under the leadership of Ambassador Dick Holbrooke \n     we were able to hammer out the Dayton accords in November \n     1995. I'm leaving out the details--all the peace plans that \n     didn't work--but in a nutshell that's what happened.\n       Honest people may disagree about the compromises that were \n     made at Dayton. I think the accords accomplished as much as \n     we could have hoped for, given the obvious reluctance of our \n     Government, and of our European allies, to get more deeply \n     involved militarily.\n       And I wish I could say that even the modest results \n     envisioned in Dayton had been achieved. But they have not. \n     It's true that conditions today are far better than the \n     bloody mayhem that existed during the war. The killing has \n     stopped.\n       But we are only halfway to the full peace envisioned in the \n     Dayton accords. The question is: ``How do we get the rest of \n     the way? How do we finish the job?\n\n\n                           III. Bosnia Today\n\n       Having returned 6 weeks ago from my third trip to Bosnia, I \n     am certainly aware of the contradictions, the ambiguities, \n     the ironies, and the uncertainties of Bosnia today. Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina might be labeled the classical land of ``yes, \n     but.''\n       Yes, there has been ongoing conflict among the various \n     religious groups in Bosnia--the Orthodox Serbs, the Catholic \n     Croats, and the Muslim South Slavs--for centuries.\n       But, for most of the time, these conflicts were kept under \n     control, usually by an outside hegemon: first the Ottoman \n     Turks, then the Austrian Habsburgs, and more recently the \n     Communists under President Tito.\n       When violence broke out in the spring of 1992, a \n     cosmopolitan society existed in much of Bosnia. Sarajevo, for \n     example, had one of the highest rates of inter-marriage in \n     all of Europe. What killed the ``live and let live'' \n     character of Sarajevo were unscrupulous, ultra-nationalist \n     politicians, many of whom were searching for a new ``-ism'' \n     to replace communism, an ideology that had been discredited.\n       Yes, there were elements of civil war in Bosnia, but there \n     was also blatant aggression from Serbia across an \n     internationally recognized border. In fact, it was through \n     the overwhelming advantage of the weaponry, the salaries, and \n     the support services furnished by Slobodan Milosevic that the \n     Bosnian Serbs perpetrated their systematic slaughter.\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\n       The ``yes, but'' dichotomy persists in Bosnia today.\n       Yes there has been considerable progress in Bosnia since \n     Dayton, but a huge amount remains to be accomplished.\n       Yes the 50 percent unemployment rate in the Bosnian Croat \n     Federation is huge, but it has come down from 90 percent in \n     only one year. Incidentally, it still hovers at 90 percent in \n     the Republika Srpska, which has been denied all but a trickle \n     of international aid because it has refused to implement the \n     Dayton accords.\n       Yes, Bosnian Serbs regularly try to paralyze many of the \n     institutions of national government created at Dayton, but \n     the Parliament has begun to meet, and even the three-member \n     presidency shows signs of life.\n       Yes, the nationalist parties representing the Serbs, \n     Muslims, and Croats are narrow-minded and corrupt, and in \n     many ways resemble the characteristics of the old Yugoslav \n     league of Communists, which they supplanted.\n       But even in this cynical Bosnian political arena there is \n     hope. In last month's municipal elections a non-nationalist, \n     multi-ethnic coalition triumphed in Tuzla, one of Bosnia's \n     largest cities.\n       A non-nationalist opposition also exists in the Republika \n     Srpska. I met with three of its leaders in Banja Luka. They \n     are confident that they--not Kardzic and his thugs from Pale, \n     not President Plavsic--are the wave of the future.\n       Yes, more than two-thirds of the indicted war criminals \n     remain at large--an international disgrace. But, ladies and \n     gentlemen, just last week, under strong pressure from \n     Washington, Croatia and the Bosnian Croats surrendered 10 \n     indicted Bosnian Croats to the Hague.\n       Virtually every observer of Bosnia believes that Dayton \n     cannot be implemented until indicted war criminals are \n     indicted and transported to the International Tribunal at the \n     Hague to stand trial.\n       The other major precondition for progress in Bosnia is the \n     return of refugees and displaced persons that was mandated by \n     the Dayton accords.\n       Yes, this will be the most difficult of all the Dayton \n     tasks to accomplish.\n       But , contrary to popular belief, even here there has been \n     noteworthy progress. As many as 150,000 refugees have \n     returned to Bosnia from abroad, and another 160,000 persons \n     who were displaced within Bosnia have returned to their \n     homes.\n       Most of these have returned to areas where their ethnic \n     group is in the majority, but an ``open cities'' program has \n     induced several towns--even a half-dozen villages in the \n     Republika Srpska--to accept returnees from other groups in \n     return for economic assistance.\n       On my last trip, I visited one of these sites in a suburb \n     of Sarajevo occupied by the Bosnian Serbs during the war and \n     returned to the federation by Dayton. The U.S. Agency for \n     International Development and its subcontractor, Catholic \n     Relief Services, are helping returning refugees to rebuild \n     their homes.\n       I was moved by the selfless dedication of the young \n     Americans and Europeans working at this important task.\n       Finally let me address the issue of security in Bosnia \n     today. In a country that has recently suffered some of the \n     worst atrocities of the 20th century, the citizens need \n     physical security. For the Muslims and Croats, who were \n     forced into an alliance in 1994 by the United States, this \n     means guaranteeing their ability to deter renewed Serbian \n     aggression in the future.\n       Toward that end, the ``train and equip'' program, led by \n     retired U.S. military officers, is molding a unified force \n     under joint command. We have supplied three hundred million \n     dollars worth of equipment. I visited the training center in \n     Hadzici (haj-eech-ee), near Sarajevo, where Muslims and \n     Croats are studying and training.\n       On the local level, in the Federation, multi-ethnic police \n     forces are being formed. Believe it or not, joint Muslim-\n     Croat police units are now patrolling Mostar, scene of some \n     of the worst warfare in 1993 and early 1994. So there is \n     progress here as well.\n\n\n                             IV. Next Steps\n\n       In citing these examples of progress, I do not want to \n     suggest for a moment that conditions in the Federation, let \n     alone in the Republika Srpska, are rosy.\n       They are not. But everyone to whom I spoke in Bosnia agreed \n     on two things: First, significant progress has been made in \n     the Federation; and second, it is absolutely essential for \n     the international military force to remain in Bosnia after \n     June 1998 to guarantee that progress will continue.\n       So what should our policy be in Bosnia in the coming \n     months? I believe we should redouble the efforts we are \n     already making.\n       Yes, I would like to see a multi-ethnic, multi-religious \n     society re-emerge like the one that existed in Sarajevo \n     before the war. But, I fear that too much blood has been shed \n     and too many atrocities committed for that to happen in the \n     near future.\n       More realistic, and politically feasible, is the \n     development of a multi-ethnic state. Most likely that will \n     mean a confederation with a good degree of de-centralization \n     in all but foreign policy and defense.\n       Am I sure that we can achieve the goal of a democratic, \n     decentralized Bosnia? No, I am not. Last year I would have \n     rated the odds 1 in 20.\n       As a result of the progress made in the last 12 months, I \n     would now estimate the odds on success at about 50-50, if we \n     stay the course.\n       But 50-50 looks mighty good compared to the probable \n     outcome if we followed the advice of those now calling for a \n     renegotiation of Dayton and a formal partition of Bosnia. \n     ``Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory'' might be a \n     slight exaggeration, but this policy prescription tends in \n     that direction.\n       Those who favor partition seem unaware of the progress \n     already made in Bosnia and blind to the calamities that would \n     result from scrapping Dayton.\n       Warfare would almost certainly erupt again, with higher \n     casualties, given the new military balance.\n       But renewed fighting would only be part of the tragedy. The \n     vile ethnic cleansers and the war criminals would see their \n     policies vindicated. Europe's remaining anti-democratic \n     rulers like Serbia's Milosevic and Belarus's Lukashenka would \n     be emboldened.\n       Moreover, if we pulled the plug on Bosnia just as \n     international efforts are beginning to bear fruit, we could \n     kiss goodbye American leadership in NATO. In fact, the plan \n     to enlarge NATO, I predict, would fail in the Senate.\n       And soon thereafter, even the future of NATO itself would \n     be cast in doubt. After all, if Bosnia is the prototypical \n     European crisis of the 21st century--and if NATO is unable to \n     solve Bosnia--then why bother spending billions of dollars on \n     NATO every year?\n       So, leaving Bosnia would be a fool's paradise. Just as \n     certainly as night follows day, an American abdication of \n     responsibility and withdrawal from Bosnia would eventually \n     cost us more in blood and treasure than we would ever spend \n     in the current course.\n       Let me sum up: the tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     although complex, ultimately boils down to old-fashioned \n     oppression. It was preventable, and, with the requisite \n     American and European steadfastness, it is solvable.\n       By continuing to lead the effort to put Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina back on its feet and guarantee its citizens a \n     chance to lead productive lives, the United States will be \n     both living up to its ideals and furthering its national \n     self-interest. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10994-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10995-S10996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NATIONAL TESTING\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you know, the Labor/HHS/Education \nconference committee is considering funding for national education \ntesting. I want to make it clear where I stand on this important issue \nand point out to my fellow conferees the task before us.\n  While I support higher standards for our schools, I cannot support \nnational testing. National testing, despite what some of its supporters \nmight say, is the first step toward a unified national curriculum. It \nis my firm belief that these decisions are better left to the States \nand locally elected school boards.\n  Some might argue that testing to a national standard would not affect \ncurriculum. However, to do well on the tests, students will have to be \ntaught accordingly. This was pointed out by Acting Secretary of \nEducation Marshall Smith who said: ``to do well in the national tests, \ncurriculum and instruction would have to change.''\n  Even the Washington Post agrees that the test would be ``a dramatic \nstep toward a national guideline for what students should be learning \nin core subjects.''\n  Mr. President, the schools of Idaho are doing well, and our students \ncontinually score above the national average in core subjects, without \nbeing told what and how to teach by Washington bureaucrats.\n  Supporters of the tests argue that a national standard would be \nacceptable because it would be based on standards developed by the \nDepartment of Education: the National Assessment of Education Progress \n[NAEP]. However, the NAEP framework is fundamentally flawed. These \nstandards are so out-of-touch that no State in 50 has adopted them. Now \nwe're being asked to force the States to teach within the NAEP \nframework.\n  Most offensive, Mr. President, is the fact that the NAEP framework \ndoes not measure basic skills or the student's ability to perform \ntasks. The NAEP framework focuses on whole language and new math \nconcepts and awards credit for more than one response, even if the \nresponse is wrong. National testing would force local school districts \nto adopt these flawed strategies.\n  I believe that the correct course for us to take is to direct \nresources to the classroom instead of forcing national standards on \nteachers and students. Let's assist local educators and our students in \nrising to the existing standards--standards set and supported by local \nand State leaders.\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate has voted on this matter once, when the \nappropriations bill was on the floor. I, along with most of our \ncolleagues, voted for the compromise offered by Mr. Gregg. This vote \nhas been interpreted by some, including many in the administration, as \nSenate support for national testing. This is not the case, and I \ncaution anyone from reading too much into that particular vote.\n  I voted for the compromise, and I do not support national testing in \nany form. The true message of the vote is the Senate's willingness to \nalter the President's proposal and its interest in the language \nincluded in the House version of the bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me publicly thank my colleague, Senator \nAshcroft, for his leadership on this issue. I am pleased to cosponsor \nhis measure, S. 1215, which would prohibit the Federal Government from \ndeveloping these flawed national tests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10995-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO RUTH BECKER\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nendorse the nomination of Dale Kimball, who has been nominated by \nPresident Clinton for the position of U.S. district judge for the \ndistrict of Utah, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I am \nacquainted with Mr. Kimball personally and know that he comes before \nthe Senate with an already distinguished record as a lawyer and \nlitigator, an individual demonstrably well qualified for the position \nof Federal district court judge.\n  After working as an associate and then as a partner with a leading \nUtah law firm, Van Cott, Bagley, Cornwell & McCarthy, for 8 years, Dale \nKimball became a founding partner, and is now the senior partner, at \nwhat has become one of my State's most distinguished firms; Kimball, \nParr, Waddoups, Brown & Gee.\n  During his 30-year career, Mr. Kimball has developed extensive \nexpertise in various areas of civil practice, particularly the \nlitigation in Federal and State court of complex business cases \ninvolving such matters as energy, antitrust, securities fraud, \ninsurance, and contracts. As an experienced litigator, Dale Kimball is \nparticularly well-qualified to serve as a trial court judge. The \nrespect Dale Kimball has earned from the Utah legal community is \nreflected in his selection as Distinguished Lawyer of the Year by the \nUtah State Bar in 1996.\n  Dale Kimball's dedication to the practice of law is matched by his \ndedication to serving his community. He has been a member of the board \nof the Pioneers Theater Co., Alta View Hospital, the Desert News \nPublishing Co., the Jordan Education Foundation, and the J. Reuben \nClark Law Society.\n  I am confident that Dale Kimball will be a worthy addition to the \nFederal district court in Utah, and I am very pleased that the Senate \nhas confirmed his nonination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10996-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10996-S10997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF WILLIAM P. CROWELL\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the National Security Agency has \nrecently lost to retirement its deputy director, William P. Crowell. As \nDavid Kahn has recently written in Newsday, Mr. Crowell has taken NSA \nand ``brought the super-secret spy organization into its public, post-\nCold War posture.'' For too long, we have been learning our cold war \nhistory from Soviet Archives. Bill Crowell set about to change that at \nthe National Security Agency. He directed the establishment of the \nNational Cryptologic Museum, which I have visited and commend to my \ncolleagues, and helped to make public the hugely important VENONA \nproject.\n  The VENONA intercepts comprise over 2,000 coded Soviet diplomatic \nmessages between Moscow and its missions in North America. The NSA and \nits predecessors spent some four decades decoding what should have been \nan unbreakable Soviet code. Led by Meredith Gardner, these \ncryptanalysts painstakingly decoded these messages word by word. They \nwould then pass on the decoded messages to the FBI, which conducted \nextensive investigations to determine the identities of the Soviet \nagents mentioned in the messages. The resulting VENONA decrypts detail \nthe Soviet espionage effort in the United States during and after the \nSecond World War.\n  We need access to much more of this type of information. Not only \ndoes VENONA allow us to learn our history, but in releasing it to the \npublic, not insignificant gaps in the government's knowledge of this \nmaterial are being filled. For instance, the identity of one of the \nmajor atomic spies at Los Alamos was recently discovered by clever \njournalists using the published VENONA messages. Joseph Albright and \nMarcia Kunstel of Cox News and, working independently, Michael Dobbs of \nThe Washington Post, identified the agent codenamed MLAD as Theodore \nAlvin Hall, a 19-year-old physicist working at Los Alamos. Hall \nprovided crucial details of the design of the atomic bomb which enabled \nthe Soviet Union to develop a replica of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.\n  Bill Crowell recognized the historic value of VENONA and played an \nimportant role in getting this material released, along with Dr. John \nM. Deutch, and with the gentle prodding of the Commission on Protecting \nand Reducing Government Secrecy. Mr. Crowell should receive a medal for \nhis work.\n  Mr. Crowell retires after a long career of government service. He \nserved as a senior executive of the National Security Agency for 17 \nyears. He was appointed Deputy Director of the agency by the President \nin 1994. In addition to his work which has already been described, Mr. \nCrowell has worked in recent years to help craft a responsible \nAdministration policy regarding encryption technology. I ask to have \nthe article by David Kahn in Newsday, which announces his retirement \nand highlights some of his accomplishments, printed in the Record. I \nsalute Mr. Crowell for his dedicated service and wish him well in his \nfuture pursuits.\n  The article follows:\n\n                      [From Newsday, Oct. 6, 1997]\n\n    National Security Official Retires--Helped Refocus Agency's Aims\n\n                            (By David Kahn)\n\n       The National Security Agency has said goodbye to its \n     retiring deputy director, who largely brought the super-\n     secret spy organization into its public, post-Cold War \n     posture.\n       William P. Crowell was the force behind the establishment \n     of the National Cryptologic Museum, which exhibits what had \n     been some of the nation's deepest secrets; the revelation of \n     the VENONA project, which broke Soviet spy codes early in the \n     Cold War; and the National Encryption Policy, which seeks to \n     balance personal privacy with national security.\n       Succeeding Crowell will be Barbara McNamara, who, like \n     Crowell, is a career employee of the agency, which breaks \n     foreign codes and makes American Codes for the United States \n     government.\n       McNamara is the second female deputy director of the \n     agency. The first, Ann Z. Caracristi, who served from 1980 to \n     1982, is the sister of the late Newsday photographer Jimmy \n     Caracristi.\n       More than 500 present and past members of the agency \n     attended Crowell's recent retirement ceremony at its glossy, \n     triple-fenced headquarters at Fort Meade, Md. They applauded \n     as he was presented with awards for his intelligence and \n     executive services and with a folded American flag that had \n     flow over the agency.\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\n       They laughed as a picture, claimed to be his retirement \n     portrait, was unveiled: It was a photograph of Crowell, \n     notorious for his love of motorcycles, astride his fancy \n     bike. During his acceptance speech, Crowell choked up when he \n     thanked his wife, Judy, a former agency employee and fellow \n     motorcyclist, for her help.\n       The agency director, Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, \n     recited some of the administrative landmarks of Crowell's \n     career.\n       Crowell, 58, a native of Louisiana, began in New York City \n     in 1962 as an agency recruiter. In 1969, when he sought an \n     assignment to operations, he became instead an executive \n     assistant to the then-director. He eventually got to \n     operations, where he rose to be chief of W group, whose \n     function remains secret, and then chief of A group, which \n     focused on the then-Soviet Union. After a year in private \n     industry, he rose through other posts to the deputy \n     directorship on Feb. 2, 1994.\n       Among his organizational accomplishments were conceiving a \n     crisis action center and linking the agency with other \n     producers of intelligence to improve information exchange.\n       His more public initiatives included the museum and the \n     VENONA disclosures, which sought to maintain public support \n     for the agency after the disappearance of the Soviet Union. \n     The National Encryption Policy seeks to enable the agency to \n     read the messages of terrorists and international criminals \n     who use computer-based, unbreakable ciphers while enabling \n     individuals to use good cryptosecurity to preserve such \n     rights as security on the Internet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10996-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GIVING CHILDREN IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL A CHANCE TO SUCCEED\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last week, a remarkable event \ntook place while Congress was in recess. Two private citizens gave \n1,000 low-income children in the District of Columbia a chance.\n  On Monday, October 13, 1997, Ted Forstmann, the newly elected \nchairman of the Washington Scholarship Fund, and John Walton, director \nof Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., each contributed $3 million for students in \nthe District to receive a quality education. The Washington Scholarship \nFund currently provides private school scholarships to 460 low-income \nDistrict students. With the contributions from Mr. Forstmann and Mr. \nWalton, the Washington Scholarship Fund will be able to provide these \nneeded scholarships to an additional 1,000 low-income students.\n  Mr. Forstmann made it very clear that this initiative is not a \npolitical statement for or against public education in the District. \nThis is simply a commitment to give children a chance to succeed. In \ndescribing the prospects of many of the District's children to William \nRaspberry of the Washington Post, Mr. Forstmann said, ``It's like being \nborn already dead. There are too many children like that, and I just \nfeel we have to do what we can for them.''\n  In praising this powerful gesture for children, my hope, Mr. \nPresident, is that corporate America will follow Mr. Forstmann and Mr. \nWalton's example. Responsible business investments include investing in \nhuman capital and the value-added impact of a quality education. There \nis no better investment than America's children. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10997-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING RAYMOND W. FANNINGS\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure and my \nprivilege to join the family, friends and colleagues of a distinguished \ncitizen of Chicago, IL, Mr. Raymond W. Fannings, in honoring him as he \nretires from the Chicago Child Care Society. Mr. Fannings served as \nexecutive director of the Chicago Child Care Society for the past 18 \nyears.\n  Raymond Fannings leaves the agency with a rich legacy. He has more \nthan 35 years of faithful and distinguished service in the field of \nchild welfare. His contributions are widely recognized and his many \ncommunity service awards serve as a testament to his compassion, \ncommitment, talent, and vision. As the first African-American Executive \nDirector of the Chicago Child Care Society, he has built bridges and \nforged interracial coalitions in behalf of the values held and goals \npursued by this renowned social service provider.\n  Under Mr. Fannings' leadership, the Chicago Child Care Society \nexpanded its mission and became a moving force in the development and \nprovision of family preservation services. Raymond Fannings also \nrecognized the importance of responding to community needs. He \ndedicated substantial resources to both develop and implement services \nin many of the economically distressed communities surrounding his \nagency.\n  During Mr. Fannings' illustrious career, he served as president of \nthe Child Care Association of Illinois and as a board member of the \nUnited Way Crusade of Mercy. He is the current president of both the \nChild Care Association of Illinois and the Black Executive Directors \nCoalition. He has served on the Child Advisory Committee, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee for United Way, and the United Way Board \nof Directors. He is also a board member of the Free People's Clinic, \npresident of the St. Mark Credit Union, and an active member of St. \nMark United Methodist Church in Chicago.\n  Mr. Raymond Fannings has distinguished himself as one of Chicago's \nmost valuable leaders, and his achievements and dedication are a \nshining example to us all. His efforts have opened avenues of faith, \nhope, and opportunity for many children and their families. As my \nneighbor and friend, I know that retirement will only be the beginning \nof a new chapter of his advocacy for children and for community. I wish \nhim all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10997-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10997-S10998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO DEAN KAMEN FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Dean Kamen of Manchester, NH. Mr. Kamen was recently \ninducted into the renowned National Academy of Engineers for his \ninvention and commercialization of biomedical devices and fluid \nmeasurement and control systems.\n  Mr. Kamen is currently the president of DEKA Research and Development \nCorp. of Manchester, NH. He studied at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, \nwhere he earned his degrees in physics and has also received an \nhonorary doctorate of science degree from Worcester Polytechnic \nInstitute as well as Daniel Webster College. Dean has more than 35 U.S. \npatents attributed to him which range from a volumetric pump with \nreplaceable reservoir assembly to an integral intravenous fluid \ndelivery device.\n  Dean's innovations and significant contributions to the field of \nengineering have strengthened the economy of New Hampshire as well as \nthe Nation. Dean is also recognized for using skills and influence to \npromote scientific inquiry at this critical time in America, a time \nwhen more young people are needed in the fields of science. Combining \nsports and scientific discovery, Dean established the FIRST robotics \ncompetition for young people. He is currently working on a science and \ntechnology museum project in Manchester, NH, which will be a valuable \naddition to the town, as well as the scientific community.\n  Entrance into the National Academy of Engineers is an extremely \nprestigious honor. In fact, it is among the highest honors with which \nan engineer can be bestowed. Engineers are nominated and then elected \nto the academy by the current membership. Becoming a member is a \nvalidation of an engineer's great contributions to science by his \npeers, and many scientists work to achieve this honor throughout their \nlives. Dean is one of 85 engineers and 8 foreign associates who was \ninducted into the academy in early October.\n  Dean's induction into the National Academy of Engineering is only one \nof the numerous honors he has received. He is a fellow with the \nAmerican Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, in addition \nto being appointed a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology.\n  Renowed the world over in various science fields for inventions and \nadvances in engineering, Dean has established a tradition of greatness \nwith his work. In 1995 he was awarded the Hoover Medal for ``innovation \nthat has advanced medical care worldwide, and for innovative and \nimaginative leadership in awakening America to the excitement of \ntechnology and its surpassing importance in bettering the lot of \nmankind.'' Dean has also received the International John W. Hyatt \nService to Mankind Award for service to humankind through the use of \nplastics.\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\n  I have known Dean for over a decade, and I am very proud of the \nimportant advances he has made in engineering. He has increased the \nquality of lives through his engineering feats not just in New \nHampshire, but also the United States and the world. He represents the \nvery best in science today: a man of great expertise, capability, and \nintegrity. The Granite State is fortunate to have Dean working in our \nState. His innovations in engineering are priceless. Both Dean, as well \nas the other members of the National Academy of Engineering, are \nnational treasures. I congratulate Dean Kamen on this distinguished \nhonor; it could not have been bestowed on a more deserving \nindividual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10997-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 1997 WALTER B. JONES MEMORIAL AND NOAA EXCELLENCE AWARDS FOR \n                 COASTAL AND OCEAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this morning the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] presented the 1997 Walter B. \nJones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards for Coastal and Ocean \nResource Management. A number of distinguished citizens, students, and \npublic servants were honored for their commitment to the protection, \nconservation, and sustainable use of our Nation's precious coastal \nresources. I would like to offer my praise and admiration to all of the \naward recipients for their hard work and dedication to this critical \narea of ecological and economic concern.\n  Over one-half of the U.S. population resides within 50 miles of the \ncoast. All of these people and the associated development and other \nactivities that accompany them place extraordinary pressure on the \necosystems, watersheds, and communities on our coasts. Coastal areas \nprovide incredible commercial, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to \nthe American people. The Walter B. Jones and NOAA awards recognize \nindividuals who have taken on the challenge of protecting these coastal \nareas and ensuring these benefits are not lost.\n  While I congratulate all of the award recipients, I would like to \nacknowledge two Washington State recipients in particular. Recipients \nof the Excellence in Coastal and Marine Graduate Study Award, Lillian \nFerguson and John Field, from the University of Washington School of \nMarine Affairs. I am honored to have these two bright graduate students \nrepresent Washington State and our commitment to the protection of \ncoastal areas.\n  Lillian Ferguson's works focuses on management of maritime \ntransportation and marine protected areas. As a summer intern (1996) \nfor the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary [OCNMS] she developed a \nprogram for documentation and analysis of vessel traffic in the \ncongested entrance and approaches to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Her \nwork formed the basis for recent implementation of the program by the \nOCNMS this year. This prototype program may be suitable for adoption in \nmany similar situations in the United States and abroad. During the \nacademic year 1996-97, Lillian is the Project Assistant for the Safe \nMarine Transportation Forum [SMART Forum]. In this capacity she \npromotes dialogue among more than 20 stakeholder interests on marine \nsafety and transportation on Puget Sound. Lillian has also contributed \nas a research assistant to the National Coastal Zone Management \nEffectiveness Study recently completed for OCRM/NOAA. Her thesis work \nanalyzes the development of interjurisditional collaboration in \nmanaging marine environments between the NMS Program and the U.S. \nNational Park Service. Lillian has made significant contributions with \nthe work she has already completed. Her thesis should be quite \ninformative and valuable in improving interjurisdictional cooperation \nbetween the NMS Program and other Federal and State entities.\n  John Field's work focuses on the initial impacts of regional climate \nchange. For approximately 2 years John has been a Research Assistant in \nthe Integrated Regional Assessment Program for the Pacific Northwest \nsponsored by NOAA through the Joint Institute for Study of the \nAtmosphere and Ocean [JISAO, Principal Investigator Ed Miles]. His role \nand responsibilities have been especially difficult to perform given \nthe scant attention to systematic monitoring of coastal impacts. John \nhas done a superb job of combining disparate data sets, anecdotal \ninformation, and informed experience to document key issues and trends \nrelevant to projected Global Climate Change scenarios. His efforts form \nthe stage on which interdisciplinary team-based integration can take \nplace. John coauthored with Marc Hershman a report on this work and is \ncurrently completing his thesis documenting and expanding somewhat on \nthe findings. This research should assist the development of coastal \nimpact scenarios under regional climate change assessments elsewhere. \nBesides this work John has been the coordinator for a very successful \njoint seminar between the School of Marine Affairs and the fishing \nindustry. In addition, John has been working during the summer on a \nseabed coring project led by Prof. Robert Francis to obtain Paleo-\nrecords of fish and shellfish abundance in the North Pacific.\n  Both of these award recipients have worked hard for the sake of our \ncoastal resources in Washington State. As they move on from graduate \nwork and enter the work force either in public service, nongovernmental \norganizations, or private industry, I know they will continue in their \ncommitment to the protection, conservation, and sustainable use of our \ncoastal resources. With students such as Lillian and John in our \ngraduate schools, I am confident about the future of our coastal areas \nas the challenges confronting these areas and those of us who care \nabout them become increasingly complex. And to Lillian and John, \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10998-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE WOMEN'S RESOURCE CENTER\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Friday, October 24, in my hometown \nof Nashville, TN, the National Association of Women Business Owners/\nNashville Chapter and the Nashville Foundation for Women Business \nOwners will recognize the establishment of an exciting and worthwhile \nproject--The Women's Resource Center.\n  The first in Tennessee, the Women's Resource Center is designed to \nfurther enhance business opportunities for women, by providing \ntechnical assistance, training, and education. I am proud that \nNashville is currently among the 10 fastest growing metropolitan areas \nfor women-owned businesses, and this center will ensure continued \neconomic growth and increase participation from women interested in \nfounding and growing their own businesses.\n  Like most visionary ideas, this one would not have happened without \ncommunity support, and women who clearly saw the need for the center \nand rose to the occasion to make their dream come true. My \ncongratulations go to all of the Nashville members of the Foundation \nfor Women Business Owners and the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, and especially to local entrepreneurs who as \n``founding mothers'' provided the initial capital to match funds from \nthe Small Business Administration.\n  When Alexis de Toqueville traveled this young Nation, he wrote, ``If \nI were asked to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of \nthe American people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply--to \nthe superiority of their women.'' His words still ring true today, and \nthe realization of the Women's Resource Center is further testimony to \nthe superiority and the achievements of these outstanding women \nbusiness owners in Nashville, TN. I am honored to serve as their U.S. \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/22/senate-section/article/S10998-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10998-S10999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE SALE OF THE FEDERAL BUILDING IN BAKERSFIELD, CA\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during Senate consideration of the \nFiscal Year 1998 Treasury Postal Appropriations bill, I submitted for \nthe Record a list of projects which I found to be low-priority, \nunnecessary or wasteful spending, that circumvented the normal, merit-\nbased prioritization process. On October 15, 1997, I forwarded this \nlist to President Clinton and recommended he use his line-item veto \nauthority to eliminate these projects. Included in this list was \nlanguage contained in the Conference Report which directed that the \nBakersfield Federal Building in California be sold.\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\n  It has been brought to my attention that this Federal building went \nthrough the proper screening process by GSA in order to ascertain if it \nwas needed for any further Federal use. No Federal Government agency \nexpressed an interest in utilizing this property.\n  Furthermore, I am informed that the sale of this property, through a \nprocess of competitive bidding, will result in a profit to the American \ntaxpayer.
