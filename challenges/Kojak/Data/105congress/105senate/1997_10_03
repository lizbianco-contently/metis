On just as important business, Mr. President, I will \naddress this morning the issue of global warming.\n  Let me first say that the more attention the media and the American \npeople pay to this issue, the better. For the global climate issue will \nhave a major impact on the future of our country, our people, and, \nindeed, the entire world. How the nations of the world address the \nglobal climate issue will be one of the most important global economic \nand environmental decisions of the next century.\n\n  There are differing opinions on the conclusiveness of global warming \nand how we should address it. But this is not a debate nor has it ever \nbeen a debate about who is for or against the environment. I have yet \nto meet any American who wants dirty air, dirty water, dirty \nenvironment or declining standards of living for their children or \ngrandchildren. We all agree on the need for a clean environment. We all \nwant to leave our children a better, cleaner, more prosperous world. So \nthe debate is not about those for or against a clean environment.\n  As my colleagues, the media and many people in America know, the \nnations of the world are currently negotiating a treaty to limit \nworldwide emissions of greenhouse gasses. This treaty will be presented \nfor signatures this December in Kyoto, Japan. Many of my colleagues and \nI fear the current treaty negotiations will shackle the United States' \neconomy--meaning fewer jobs, lower economic growth and a lower standard \nof living for our children and our future generations. This treaty \nwould do so without any meaningful reduction in greenhouse gasses \nbecause--because--it leaves out the very nations who will be the \nworld's largest emitters of greenhouse gasses, the more than 130 \ndeveloping nations including China, India, Mexico, South Korea, and \nmany others.\n  The U.S. Senate took a very strong and unequivocal stand against this \ntreaty in July when it approved the Byrd-Hagel resolution 95-0. That \nresolution states that any treaty signed by this administration must \ncome before the Senate for ratification, and the U.S. Senate has stated \nvery clearly that it will not approve a treaty that excludes the \ndeveloping nations or that would cause serious economic harm to the \nUnited States. This body is on record by a vote of 95-0, stating that \nvery clearly.\n  There is simply no way for the terms of current negotiations of the \nGlobal Climate Treaty to satisfy the conditions of the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. In fact, I was very disturbed, Mr. President, to learn this \nweek when the administration's chief negotiator on this treaty, Under \nSecretary of State Tim Wirth, briefed the Senate's global climate \nchange observer group that he said it was very unlikely that the \ndeveloping nations will be included in any treaty to be signed in \nKyoto, Japan, this December. The exemption of these nations would \nsurely bring about the treaty's defeat here in the U.S. Senate.\n  However, this is not preventing the administration from pressing \nforward with this treaty. Although its final negotiating position has \nnot yet been made public, instead of telling the Senate, the media, the \nAmerican people, exactly what the administration will be pushing for at \nKyoto in respect to exact emission levels and timetables, the White \nHouse has unleashed its typical spin campaign.\n  For example, Secretary of Interior Babbitt has been out all over \nAmerica on college campuses lecturing our young people about the dire \nand horrific consequences of global warming, while failing to mention \nthe contradicting science, the very clear contradicting science or the \nvery real economic consequences that would have a very real impact on \nthis country's standard of living--jobs, future.\n  In fact, I have to say, Mr. President, in almost unparalleled \narrogance Mr. Babbitt has gone so far as to say the following about \nthose who dare disagree with him or the administration on the issue of \nglobal warming, and who would have the audacity--can you imagine anyone \nchallenging the administration on this issue--to argue against the \ntreaty? I quote from the Secretary of Interior: ``* * * what they're \ndoing is un-American in the most basic sense.'' From the Secretary of \nInterior.\n  The Energy Department released a study which they said shows that the \nUnited States can achieve these reductions of emissions called for in \nthe Global Climate Treaty without acknowledging that what they really \nmeant to say was we could get one-third of the way to the goals under \nthe most rosy assumptions by completely shutting down a number of \nAmerican industries such as the coal industry and by increasing energy \ncosts either through taxes or regulation. They have failed to mention \nthat.\n  The administration claims that the debate over the science is over. \nThe administration said there is no debate, anymore, on the fact that \nthe globe is warming up. While newspapers across America are writing \nfront page-stories on alternative scientific explanations for the \nEarth's warming, still the administration persists.\n  I noted that the White House hosted a session this week for weather \nforecasters from across America to learn more about global warming and \nto broadcast their weather forecasts from the White House lawn. That is \nan interesting photo-op, good public relations. This is what one \nweathercaster had to say: ``I was somewhat skeptical that human beings \nwere really doing anything to affect the weather. But hearing the \nPresident and the Vice President state emphatically that the scientific \ndebate is over, well, that went a long way toward convincing me.''\n  The scientific debate is over? Oh, no. No, quite the contrary. The \nscientific debate is still very much ongoing. Perhaps the White House \ndid not read the lengthy September 23 story in the New York Times \ndescribing how a number of respected scientists and climatologists from \naround the world believe that variations in the Earth's temperature are \nthe result of changes in, imagine this, solar activity. The Sun might, \nin fact, have something to do with global climate changes. Judith Lean \nof the Naval Research Laboratory here in Washington was quoted as \nsaying, ``We figure that half the climate change from 1850 to now can \nbe accounted for by the Sun.'' Scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian \nCenter studied records of the past 120 years and determined that the \nSun is responsible for up to 71 percent of the Earth's changes in \ntemperature. Imagine that, when they added other factors into their \nresearch, that figure rose to 94 percent.\n  Perhaps the White House didn't see the ``NBC Nightly News'' in August \non a research ship funded by 23 nations that is going thousands of feet \nbelow the surface of the ocean and studying the Earth's geological \nhistory. So far, these scientists have sampled 87 miles of rock and \nsediment from all over the world. And according to one of the main \nscientists on the ship, Prof. Nicholas Christie-Block of Columbia \nUniversity, they have captured about 10 million years of the Earth's \nhistory in a single core sample of mud, sand, and rock. He said, ``The \ninformation we have to judge the modern climate is incomplete. We don't \nhave that long-term perspective.''\n\n  Studying these core samples gives the scientists information on when \nthe Earth's oceans rose and fell. They can chart the Earth's ice ages \nand hot spells. Some of these scientists believe as you look at the \nhistory--specifically the history of the climate of the Earth--that we \nare actually at the warmest point between two ice ages. The weather \nforecast from that report? ``Hot tomorrow, and 50,000 years from now, \nskiing in Texas and sledding in Florida.'' I am sorry to say, Mr. \nPresident, that prohibits skiing in Colorado.\n  Perhaps the White House has never heard from Dr. Richard Lindzen, \nprofessor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \nwho testified before the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee that, ``a decade of focus on global warming and billions of \ndollars of research funds have still failed to establish that global \nwarming is a significant problem.''\n  Perhaps the White House is unaware of the research by Dr. Patrick \nMichaels, a distinguished climatologist\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\nand professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia. \nIn a Senate hearing, Dr. Michaels noted that conditions in the real \nworld simply have not matched changes projected by some computer \nmodels. Most of the warming this century occurred in the first half of \nthe century when there was not a greenhouse gas emissions problem. He \nfurther testified that 18 years of satellite data actually show a \nslight cooling trend. These data are backed up by balloon data.\n  Even the chairman of the U.S. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, Dr. Bert Bolin, admits the uncertainty. When informed that \nUndersecretary of State Tim Wirth stated in testimony that the science \nwas settled, Dr. Bolin stated, ``I've spoken to [Tim Wirth], and I know \nhe doesn't mean it.''\n  I fear the White House Conference on Global Warming this Monday will \nbe just as one-sided. There will not be an attempt to present the \nAmerican people with a full discussion of all aspects of the global \nwarming issue. It will be a propaganda tool to spread the truth \naccording to the White House--another photo op--irrespective of \nlegitimate differing views. I fear that it will not be a serious \ndiscussion of all sides.\n  The administration underlined this attitude last week when they \nrefused to send any witnesses at all to the Senate Energy Committee \nHearing held by Senator Murkowski. I will be holding a Foreign \nRelations subcommittee hearing on this issue next Thursday, and I hope \nthe administration has changed its views about sending witnesses to \nSenate hearings.\n  The arrogance of the administration on this issue has been \nunparalleled. It does not serve the American people, nor the world, \nwhen the White House only gives them one side of an issue that will \ndirectly affect the lives of all our people and their future.\n  And the White House, Mr. President, is not alone. Yesterday, Ted \nTurner ordered that all ads opposed to this treaty be pulled from CNN. \nThis is the kind of suppression of speech we usually expect from \ntotalitarian countries. These ads were being run by American business, \nbusiness organizations, agriculture, consumer groups, and labor unions, \nwhich very much oppose the White House approach to global warming and \nhave very legitimate concerns about the impact this treaty would have \non them and the American people. Why are they running these ads? \nBecause the White House is only telling one side of the story and \nbecause it has been difficult to get the media to cover any alternative \npoints of view. Yet, Ted Turner thinks the treaty is a great idea. He \nhas spoken on it all over the world--the world is coming to an end. So \nhe unilaterally pulls the ads of those who disagree with him and \nprevents this viewpoint from being aired to the millions of Americans \nwho watch CNN. Mr. President, we have heard an awful lot about free \nspeech this week in the debate on campaign finance reform--the first \namendment, the Constitution, expressions of our people, and the very \nfoundation of America is the first amendment. Mr. Turner's action is a \nprime example of what will happen when you allow free speech to be cut \noff. This isn't even free; our people are having to buy it.\n  I am here to talk about the rest of the story--the point of view you \nwon't hear from Mr. Turner or the White House, and you surely won't \nhear it on Monday--the point of view you won't hear in many media. Mr. \nTurner's conduct is outrageous, his arrogance and disregard for the \nAmerican public and their right to express themselves on the public \nairwaves is truly unparalleled. I intend, Mr. President, to ask for a \nSenate hearing on this and get an explanation on Mr. Turner's actions.\n  I note that in this morning's Wall Street Journal, a rather \nsignificant editorial was written about Mr. Turner's actions. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                              This Is CNN?\n\n       President Clinton is intent on using television to pitch \n     his support for a United Nations treaty to curb global \n     warming. This week, he invited 100 TV weather forecasters to \n     the White House hoping they'd propagandize local viewers on \n     behalf of his crusade. Meanwhile, it appears that some other \n     backers of the treaty don't want to allow its opponents to \n     contradict them on TV. Take CNN. After running two ads \n     skeptical of the treaty for three weeks, CNN has ordered them \n     off the air. The cable-news network says it doesn't want them \n     running while they do extended coverage of the issue.\n       The ads are, or were, being run by the Global Climate \n     Information Project, a coalition of business, labor and \n     consumer groups who think the climate treaty would force the \n     U.S. to cut energy use by 20% while countries such as China, \n     India and Mexico are exempt. Project members include groups \n     such as the National Association of Manufacturers that you \n     might expect to oppose the treaty. But it also includes the \n     National Black Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business \n     Survival Committee, the Seniors Coalition and the United Mine \n     Workers and the AFL-CIO.\n       The Project's ads lay out the case that higher energy costs \n     imposed by the treaty will raise prices for U.S. consumers \n     while citizens of countries ``responsible for almost half the \n     world's emissions won't have to cut back.'' The ads began \n     running on CNN and many radio stations September 10.\n       Ben Goddard, an executive with the First Tuesday group that \n     prepared the ads, says he got a call from a CNN executive \n     yesterday morning. He was told the ads were being taken off \n     the air. When Mr. Goddard inquired, he was later told that \n     the decision had been made by Tom Johnson, CNN's chairman, \n     and CNN founder Ted Turner, now a vice chairman of the parent \n     company Time-Warner.\n       To its credit, CNN, unlike other networks, does accept \n     ``issue advocacy'' ads of this type. But as CNN spokesman \n     Steve Haworth explained, it has a policy of pulling such ads \n     ``during periods of intense media coverage of the subject \n     matter.'' He argues that inattentive viewers might confuse \n     the ads with the news coverage and vice versa. Mr. Haworth \n     says the decision was made after a ``coincidental'' complaint \n     alleging the ads were inaccurate was filed by the pro-treaty \n     Environmental Information Center. CNN executives didn't rule \n     on the Center's complaint, but decided to pull the ads \n     because CNN's coverage of the treaty was being stepped up. \n     Mr. Haworth says he ``doesn't know'' if Mr. Turner \n     participated in the decision.\n       Mr. Haworth could come up with only two other examples when \n     CNN invoked what he admitted was its ``subjective'' policy. \n     It didn't pull ads at the height of the debates over NAFTA, \n     health care reform and tort reform.\n       Let's see if we get the logic here: Insofar as CNN decided \n     not to offer live coverage of the Thompson campaign finance \n     hearings, it presumably would accept ``issues'' ads promoting \n     their importance to the public.\n       CNN of course has a right to carry or not carry any ads it \n     wishes. But its sudden reversal on the anti-climate treaty \n     ads smacks of, well, an overheated response. Treaty \n     supporters tend to become apoplectic at anyone who dares \n     suggest that the threat of global warming is theory, not \n     established fact. Last July, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt \n     lost it when he claimed that ``oil companies and the coal \n     companies in the U.S. have joined in a conspiracy to hire \n     pseudo scientists to deny the facts.'' He went on to say that \n     ``what they are doing is un-American in the most basic \n     sense.''\n       By pulling the plug on a responsible point of view in a \n     public debate, CNN is circumscribing give-and-take over an \n     international treaty of direct consequence to every American. \n     Given that media coverage is already tilted toward global \n     warming doomsayers, the public will be less informed as a \n     result. Ted Turner may now have become the world's number one \n     supporter of the United Nations, but when it comes to \n     citizens of the United States he apparently would just as \n     soon they not hear arguments against the U.N.'s pet treaty.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the fact is this treaty is not based on \nsound science. The scientific community has not definitively--even \nclose to definitively--concluded that there is global warming caused by \nhuman actions. The science is inconclusive and often contradictory. \nPredictions for the future range from no significant problem to global \ncatastrophe. The testimony of some of our most eminent scientists and \nclimatologists have made this abundantly clear. The global climate is \nincredibly complex. It is influenced by far more factors than \noriginally thought. The scientific community has simply not yet \nresolved the question of whether we have a problem with global warming. \nBut the lack of conclusive scientific data is only one of five reasons \nwhy the U.N. Global Climate Treaty is such a very, very bad idea.\n  The other four reasons are these:\n  The treaty excludes the over 130 developing nations, including the \nworld's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases over the next 15 years. \nThe treaty excludes these people, rendering the treaty's objectives \nmeaningless. It would not accomplish--even if you accepted the \nscience--what it intends to accomplish.\n  The economic impact would be devastating for the United States. We \nwould see the loss of millions of jobs,\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\nentire industries would flee to other countries, our people would face \nhigher fuel costs, higher taxes, leading to lower productivity and a \nlower standard of living. It is not because I say this. Why, Mr. \nPresident, do we have an almost unparalleled development where American \nbusiness, American industry, American agriculture, and America's labor \nunions are all united against this? There must be a reason. There is a \ngood reason. The testimony is very clear on this.\n  This also cuts to the heart of our national sovereignty. We don't \nhear much about our national sovereignty. Is that important to me? Yes, \nit is. I think it is important to every American. It cuts to the heart \nof our national sovereignty by setting up an international authority \nthat would subject U.S. businesses and industries to its authority and \npenalties. Never before in the history of this free Nation has that \noccurred. This is one U.S. Senator that will not allow it to occur.\n  And it would have a devastating impact on our national security \ninterests. There is not much talk about that either. One of the biggest \nusers of fossil fuels in America is what? The U.S. military. So are we \nreally talking about subjecting our national security and our national \ndefense to unknown environmental quests? I don't think that is smart. I \ndon't think the American people want this body of policymakers to do \nthat.\n  Even if the scientists could agree--and they don't--this global \nclimate treaty would do nothing to provide a long-term solution because \nof the first factor here, excluding the world's largest emitters of \ngreenhouse gases over the next 15 years. They don't have to sign up to \nany mandatory requirements--mandatory by the force of law, \nincidentally--that the United States and other developing nations would \nsubject themselves to. Over 130 other nations would not have to do \nthat.\n  This makes no sense, given that these nations include some of the \nmost rapidly developing economies in the world. What would that do to \nour competition? How would we be able to compete? By the year 2015, \nChina alone will be the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. \nThey are held harmless in this treaty. Mr. President, let the record \nshow that in all the negotiating sessions leading up to the Kyoto \ntreaty signing, China has made it very clear that it will never agree \nto binding limits on its emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  It is the United States and other developed nations who are already \ndoing the most to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is \nfar beyond most countries here, and we continue to be. So how could any \ntreaty aimed at reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases be at all \neffective when it excludes these other nations. The exclusion of these \nnations is a fatal flaw.\n  It should be pointed out that these treaty negotiations are being \nchaired by--and this is a particularly interesting point--a diplomat \nfrom one of the developing nations. So we have an individual who is \nchairing these negotiations, whose country will not be required to \nadhere to the treaty. Yet, he is directing the United States and other \ndeveloped nations to abide by mandatory treaties obligations. In fact, \nfour of the five U.N. working groups charged with drafting the language \nof this treaty are chaired by diplomats from developing countries who \nwould not be included in this treaty. All would be exempt from any \nbinding commitments. That doesn't make sense to me, Mr. President.\n  Third, this global climate treaty would cause a significant slowdown \nin the U.S. economy. One of the notable aspects of this issue in the \nUnited States is that it has united all the different groups that I \nmentioned. We have heard testimony from the AFL-CIO, the American Farm \nBureau, National Association of Manufacturers, noted economists, and \ndozens of other organizations that represent the rank and file, the \nworking American men and women in this country. They have all agreed on \none thing: This treaty would have a devastating affect on America. I \ncould go on and cite economic models, economic analyses, as to what \ndegree. Would we lose 3 percent, as some forecasts have said, from our \nannual growth? Would we lose 1.5 or 2 million jobs if this treaty goes \ninto effect?\n  The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the President's own \neconomic advisers are very concerned. The President's own economic \nadvisers are very concerned about the impact this treaty would have on \nthe U.S. economy. It was a large back-page story in yesterday's Wall \nStreet Journal. According to the article, some are concerned that \n``ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions * * * could trigger \neconomic upheaval greater than the 1970's oil shocks.'' Does anybody \nremember that? I do.\n  Lawrence Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury stated, ``What we \nhave to do, what we are all working to do, is find the best way to meet \nenvironmental objectives along with meeting strong economic growth.''\n  These are not the rantings and ravings of big business, or the energy \nindustries, or some bizarre group of people--these are the concerns of \nthe President's own economic advisers.\n  I have not spoken with any American who would choose to relive the \nhigh energy prices and gas lines of the 1970's--all for a treaty which \nexcludes so many nations that it wouldn't work anyway.\n  The Argonne National Labs study, commissioned by the U.S. Department \nof Energy, concluded that constraints on six large industries in the \nUnited States--pertroleum refining, chemicals, paper products, iron and \nsteel, aluminum, and cement--would result in significant adverse \nimpacts on the affected industries. They furthermore concluded that \nemissions would not be significantly reduced. The main effect of the \nassumed policy would be to redistribute output, employment, and \nemissions from participating to nonparticipating countries.\n  The fourth troubling aspect of this treaty is one which has received \nvery little discussion, but would have long-range and far-reaching \nconsequences. This treaty has the potential of bringing under direct \ninternational control virtually every aspect of our Nation's economy. \nThe power of legally binding emissions mandates in this proposed treaty \nwould control nearly all forms of a country's energy use. This kind of \ninternational authority cuts to the very heart of a nation's \nsovereignty. Do we want U.S. companies answering to an international \nauthority on how much and what kinds of fuel they can use at what cost? \nDo we ant an international body dictating energy prices in America and \nenforcing these mandates? I don't think so.\n  The fifth problem with this treaty is another which has received \nlittle discussion. America's military is one of our Nation's largest \nusers of fossil fuels. How would legally binding controls on the \nemission of greenhouse gases affect our military capabilities, military \nreadiness, flying our planes, driving our tanks, our ships?\n  This treaty could have a serious impact on the readiness of our Armed \nForces, and our ability to defend our national security interests \naround the world. Sherri Goodman, the Defense Department Undersecretary \nfor Environmental Security has said that the U.N. Global Climate Treaty \ncould have large impacts on our military. Two weeks ago Senator Inhofe \nand I wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Cohen asking him for an \nanswer to press reports that the administration was planning to adopt \ndraconian new restrictions on U.S. Government use of fossil fuels and \nasking for any studies the Defense Department had done to assess the \nimpact of forced reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Why are we rushing headlong into signing a treaty in Kyoto this \nDecember? The scientific data is inconclusive, at times even \ncontradictory. The treaty excludes the nations who will be the world's \nlargest emitters of greenhouse gases. The economic costs would be \ndevastating. This treaty would be a lead weight on America's economic \ngrowth, killing jobs and opportunities for future generations. It would \ncause U.S. companies to have to answer to an international authority. \nAnd this treaty could have dramatic consequences for America's national \nsecurity interests.\n  An additional threat to the United States on this issue is coming \nfrom the Clinton administration. According to press reports, President \nClinton is being pressured by environmental organizations to sign the \nkind of draconian\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\ntreaty that would have all of the consequences I've just described. \nSome administration officials have recommended that the President sign \na treaty in Kyoto and then withhold it from the Senate for \nratification. In the words of one participant in that meeting, \n``anything that could get through the Senate next year is probably not \nworth doing.'' Last month, Majority Leader Trent Lott and I sent a \nletter to President Clinton warning him that it ``would be a grave \nerror to go forward with this kind of strategy and treaty, with the \nexplicit intention of withholding such a treaty from the Senate for \ndomestic political considerations.''\n  Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth testified before my Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on June 19, and I specifically asked him for \nassurances that the administration would submit any agreement reached \nin Kyoto to the Senate in the form of a treaty. Undersecretary Wirth \ntestified that ``it will either be a protocol to a treaty or an \namendment to a treaty * * * (that) will have to come back up in front \nof the United States Senate.'' I expect President Clinton and the \nadministration to honor the commitment stated publicly by \nUndersecretary Wirth.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, we could go on. It is very clear that we have a \nreal concern, a real problem. Many of us in this body are taking a \nrather active role in addressing this issue. I would like to end, Mr. \nPresident, with this quote. This is a quote from a recent newspaper \narticle from Bryan Tucker of Australia, the past president of the \nInternational Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, who \nmakes one of the best arguments for why this track to Kyoto is entirely \noff base. He writes,\n\n       The impossibility of attaining the 1992 Rio targets was not \n     acknowledged at Berlin, let alone the lunacy of setting still \n     more stringent ones . . . The real trade offs were not \n     mentioned, and many new strains of hypocrisy were in evidence \n     . . . Environmental opportunists, grasping at any information \n     no matter how selective or exaggerated to foment alarm, \n     appeared completely oblivious to the downstream effects of \n     their extravagant demands.\n  This says it straight. This says it directly.\n  I know that in this body the American people will hear more about \nthis issue, as they should, and I am grateful for an opportunity this \nmorning to talk a little bit about a very, very important issue. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that the next hour is under my control or a designee of \nmy selection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/03/senate-section/article/S10308-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10311-S10315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IRS HEARINGS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to comment on the \nrevelations--that is a good word for it--the ``revelations'' of the \nhearings on the Internal Revenue Service which were chaired by the \ndistinguished Senator, Bill Roth of Delaware, chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  I think those hearings, while not of any particular surprise to most \nAmericans, nevertheless riveted the country on a confirmation, a \nratification, of one dinner discussion and one office coffee klatch \nafter another that had gone on across the country for years that \nexpresses itself in almost every public meeting I attend. Somebody \nwould say, ``What are we going to do about this IRS? When are you going \nto do something about this?''\n  So it has had the effect of emboldening the Nation as some rather \ncourageous people stepped forward and told their story publicly. \nAmerican after American said, ``Well, that is exactly what happened to \nme.''\n  It is interesting, but over the last year I have been working with a \ncitizen who made about $19,000 a year and earned an extra $1,000 \ntutoring and mistakenly thought that the check that he got for this \ntutoring was after the taxes had been taken out. That was the error. It \ntook the IRS 3 years to discover that. It happened in threats to \ngarnish the wages, letters that one might expect if they were inside a \nprison preparing to be dragged out for public scorn--threats for the \ntax on the $1,000 that they discovered wasn't collected 3 years past. \nBy the end of the day, which probably will be another 2 years or more, \nthis fellow will have paid in penalties and in fines almost $4,000. The \nfellow who makes $19,000 a year--$4,000 in fines and penalties because \nthey didn't get the tax on the $1,000. What would that be? A couple of \nhundred bucks. That is debtor's prison. That is what that is.\n  There is not a Member of Congress who cannot cite story after story \nlike that. There is just no excuse for that kind of behavior in this \ncountry.\n  It did make me think and feel that there was a growing propensity to \ngo after--I couldn't certify it--but to go after people who can't \ndefend themselves; easy pickings. This fellow could do nothing to \ndefend himself. Fortunately, at least, we were able to help keep his \nwhole life from collapsing. But this ought not to be the case.\n  I was reading an article by James Pinkerton, who was in the Bush \nWhite House, in the Washington edition of the Los Angeles Times. It is \nvery interesting. He draws several conclusions, but the first one is \nimportant.\n  His first conclusion is that power corrupts. He said, ``This is not a \nnew lesson perhaps but an enduring one, and in this particular case we \nneed to be reminded that civil liberties properly extend beyond \nprotesters and criminals to include taxpayers and small businesses.''\n  This fellow that I just talked about, no one in the country should be \ntreated that way by Government employees. They work for this fellow, \nnot the other way around. You would think there would be some feeling \nof concern about a citizen who was having a tough time anyway. You \nwould think there would be some understanding that this was no \npurposeful act, this was a mistake, and it ought to have been a simple \ncorrection; settle it. But, no. I mean, here we go rolling our way \nthrough another $3,000 or $4,000 in fines and penalties.\n  Power corrupts.\n  The second conclusion is interesting. ``IRS employees are people too, \nwhich means that when revenuers become immersed in the shackled-by-\ntheir-ankles enforcement culture of the IRS''--which is what this \nfellow had happen to him--``some become tyrants and many turn into \nincome maximizers. The IRS established its field office performance \nindex quietly flouting a 1988 law that forbade quotas on tax \ncollection.'' The law said there will not be quotas. Who over there \ndecided that the law didn't apply to them?\n  The President the other day said, ``Well, it is better than it used \nto be.'' Well, for Heaven's sake, I can't imagine what it used to be.\n  ``It turned its 33 district managers into `taxpreneurs' by offering \ncash awards to top performers.''\n  In other words, if you could get out there--it is like the old \nspeeding ticket scams that we used to read about where the officer on \nthe patrol was rewarded by how many tickets he could give.\n  I think it probably was pretty stunning to all of those who were \nwatching those hearings to know that even though there is a law that \nsays you cannot have a quota on tax collections, they did it anyway.\n  Another conclusion: ``The checks and balances system is not just \nconstitutional philosophy. It is a practical safeguard for liberty.''\n  In other words, the checks and balances that our forefathers put into \nthe American system, so that, to get at the first conclusion he made \nthat power corrupts, the understanding of that, the forefathers created \na government in which one branch was always looking over the other.\n  Here is a perfect case where the executive branch has a rogue \nsituation, doing nothing about it, and the Congress steps forward and \nfinally assimilates all of these complaints and all of these \nallegations. We have the spectacular hearings, and, lo and behold, what \ndo we find?\n  ``As so often happens in these situations, the IRS insisted that it \nhad done no wrong.''\n  There was nothing wrong over there. These are just disgruntled \ntaxpayers.\n  But we have the hearings, and what happens? The IRS apologizes, \nsaying, you are right, we have been doing this, and says it won't do it \nagain.\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\n  I see I have been joined by my good colleague from Arizona. I will \nmake one more point about this article, and then I am going to turn to \nhim.\n  The fourth conclusion was that more than two decades ago an economist \nnamed Arthur Laffer started a fiscal revolution by stating the obvious, \nthat too high rates of taxation, if you make them too high, become \ncounterproductive. You get into this maze of circumstances and a code \nthat becomes horribly complicated. ``Power corrupts. We had an \nenvironment in the agency that fostered bullyism.'' Thank Heaven, the \nforefathers had checks and balances so this could be discovered. We \nmade a mess of the Tax Code. We are getting a better, better view of \nthis thing, and there will have to be something done about it and not \nexcuses made for it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I turn to my colleague, the good Senator \nfrom Arizona, and yield up to 10 minutes, if that is sufficient.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Georgia for taking this time this \nmorning to bring to the attention of our colleagues and the American \npeople again the abuses of the Internal Revenue Service and the \nnecessity for fundamental tax reform as one of the solutions to those \nabuses.\n  I also want to commend the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, for holding the hearings last week to expose the problems \nin the Internal Revenue Service's dealings with taxpayers and to thank \nthe taxpayers and the IRS employees who had the courage to come forward \nand tell their stories. Although we all knew there were serious \nproblems, I do not think that any of us realized the extent to which \nthere are problems with the way that IRS does its business, as we \nlearned those things from the hearings.\n  As a matter of fact, as Senator Roth put it, we found that the IRS \nfar too often targets vulnerable taxpayers, treats them with hostility \nand arrogance, uses unethical and even illegal tactics to collect money \nthat sometimes is not even owed, and uses quotas to evaluate its \nemployees. It is behavior that is clearly unacceptable.\n  Obviously, I think we need to say at the outset that most IRS \nemployees are law abiding and professional. We recognize that they have \na very difficult and, indeed, thankless task of administering a Tax \nCode that is exceedingly complex, it is filled with contradictory \nprovisions and open to differing interpretations. But the IRS has \ntremendous power, power that can bankrupt families, can put people out \nof their homes, literally ruin lives, and that makes abuse of that \npower intolerable.\n  The Finance Committee has been fielding calls from thousands of \ntaxpayers all across the country with horror stories about their \nencounters with the IRS. My office has been taking calls, too, most \nfrequently from taxpayers who are so fearful of IRS retaliation that \nthey are leery of leaving their names or addresses.\n  We heard, for example, from a taxpayer who was hounded by the IRS for \noverpaying his taxes. The IRS put one constituent through the wringer \nof audits annually for 20 years and never found anything wrong. Another \nperson received a tax refund in error from the IRS. Knowing that it was \nin error, the constituent never cashed the check, yet when the IRS \ndiscovered its own error later, it demanded the refunded check back \nwith interest. One family had a lien placed on its house, worked out a \npayment plan with one of the IRS agents, only to have another IRS agent \nlater institute foreclosure proceedings.\n  What is most galling, I think, to the taxpayers is not that they have \nto pay taxes, clearly, but there is virtually no recourse when the IRS \nmakes an error. The cost of setting things right, hiring attorneys, \nCPA's, and the like can be so high that people agree to pay the taxes \nand penalties that sometimes they do not even owe. In fact, reports are \nthat the Clinton IRS has been boosting its efforts to catch people at \nthe low end of the income scale. According to IRS data, the chance of \nan audit actually quadrupled between 1990 and 1996 for people reporting \nannual incomes of less than $25,000. By contrast, the odds of $100,000-\nplus filers being hit with an audit dropped 40 percent.\n  The Clinton administration, which likes to portray itself as being on \nthe side of the little guy, has been quick to discount all of this \ntaxpayer angst. ``We shouldn't politicize it,'' the President said of \nthe IRS, despite reports that the Clinton IRS itself has been singling \nout high-profile critics of the administration for audits.\n  Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to begin \nto rein in the IRS. For example, Senators Grassley and Kerrey \nintroduced the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act here in the Senate.\n  But I do not think we should be under any illusion that an IRS bill \nalone will solve the problem. Our Nation's Tax Code as currently \nwritten amounts to more than 17,000 pages of confusing, seemingly \ncontradictory tax law provisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless \nthat reform is followed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the \nentire Internal Revenue Code, problems with collections and enforcement \nare likely to persist. If the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it is \ngoing to invite different interpretations from different people, and \nthat is where the problems with the IRS arise.\n  Replacing the existing code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would \nfacilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive \nIRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to \nlobby for complicated tax loopholes.\n  There are a variety of approaches to fundamental reform that are \npending before the Congress, including the Shelby-Armey flat-rate \nincome tax, the Shaefer-Tauzin national sales tax and the Kemp \nCommission simpler, single-rate tax. Each has a passionate advocate in \nCongress and around the country. Any one of these options would be \npreferable to the existing income tax system.\n  So why have we not settled on one of them and pressed on with the job \nof fundamental tax reform? The answer is that while there is \noverwhelming public consensus in favor of an overhaul of the Tax Code, \na public consensus has yet to emerge in favor of a sales tax or a flat \ntax or some alternative. Given President Clinton's lack of support for \nany fundamental tax reform, it is likely to take a broad public \nconsensus, the likes of which we haven't seen in recent years, to drive \nsuch a tax overhaul plan through the Congress and past the President's \nveto pen.\n  Steve Forbes made tax reform the central theme of his campaign for \nthe Presidency 1\\1/2\\ years ago. In fact, he carried the Arizona \nprimary in large part because his tax plan really resonated with the \nvoters in my State. Yet he failed to win the nomination, and neither \nBill Clinton nor Bob Dole pursued the issue with much passion or \nconviction. I think it will take a national campaign to build the kind \nof consensus that will be needed to move forward with fundamental tax \nreform, which is probably the most momentous undertaking of the \ncentury.\n\n  The Finance Committee hearings about taxpayer abuse by the IRS, the \nKemp Commission's recommendation in favor of fundamental tax reform \nlast year, new proposals to sunset the IRS Code, and the debate that \nsponsors of the flat tax and sales tax are expected to take on the road \nacross the country within the next few months, all will help to move \nthe debate forward.\n  In conclusion, we can pass an IRS reform bill to rein in the IRS and \nmake sure that it treats taxpayers fairly and reasonably and \nrespectfully. But let us not fool ourselves. The IRS cannot be faulted \nfor a tax code that is too complex and filled with contradictory \nprovisions. Until the Tax Code is simplified, problems in one form or \nanother are likely to persist. We must use this opportunity to begin \nthe debate about fundamental tax reform.\n  Again, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Georgia for taking \nthe leadership to engage in discussion today.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nhis comments today and, more importantly, for his dedication to efforts \nto improve this predicament we have gotten into here.\n  I spent the first several minutes talking about several conclusions \nthat a very thoughtful young man had put together after watching these \nhearings. I think he pretty much echoes what probably would be the \nviews of the American public, that the IRS, while there are many good \nemployees in that large institution, has endemic and very, very serious \nproblems.\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\n  So you can understand my surprise when I pick up this past Tuesday, \nSeptember 30, the Washington Times with a headline that says, ``White \nHouse Champions IRS. President Opposes Citizen Oversight.''\n  That is mind-boggling:\n\n       The White House yesterday came to the defense of the \n     embattled IRS, vowing to vigorously oppose Congressional \n     efforts to create a citizen oversight board to protect \n     Americans from agency abuses. It is a recipe for conflicts of \n     interest, and the notion that the right way to deal with \n     these problems with the IRS is to decrease accountability and \n     have part-time managers who would be themselves involved in a \n     range of financial transactions would be a serious backward \n     step.\n\n  So it is better to leave it as it is, I guess, as if the people who \ncurrently manage it are not taxpayers and are not involved with \nfinancial transactions. The current manager is the Secretary of the \nTreasury, spent his life in financial transactions.\n\n       They warned the Congress against reacting hastily by \n     legislating broad reforms that could lead to the death of the \n     agency.\n\n  Defend the status quo. Leave things the way they are. Things are \nactually improved. I wonder how many Americans believe that. How could \nanybody who watched those hearings come to the conclusion that things \nare better over there and that the Congress should sit here and sort of \nhold its hands and wait around and see if something improves.\n  I am going to take just a moment here, Mr. President, to revisit \napparently some of this the White House missed.\n\n       Msgr. Lawrence Ballweg, an 82-year-old priest from Florida, \n     told of ``devious'' IRS agents who erroneously tried to grab \n     $18,000 from a trust fund for the poor set up by his late \n     mother.\n       Nancy Jacobs, a Bakersfield optometrist's wife, broke down \n     in tears as she explained how aggressive IRS agents hounded \n     her husband for 17 years because they mixed him up with \n     another taxpayer.\n\n  Of course, we all know that they spent $4 billion--billion --\noverhauling their systems, but for 17 years they could not figure out \nthat they were chasing the wrong taxpayer--for 17 years.\n\n       Tom Savage, a Delaware small businessman, said that the IRS \n     concocted an imaginary company that he co-owned with another \n     taxpayer, and then illegally seized $50,000 to pay for the \n     other taxpayer's debts.\n       Katherine Lund, an Apple Valley, CA, woman, described how \n     the IRS could not keep track of its own records, repeatedly \n     threatening to seize her home if she did not pay a tax debt \n     left over from a former marriage. Although on three occasions \n     she sought to clear the debt, another branch of the agency \n     continued to pester her.\n       Robert S. Schriebman, a tax attorney from Rolling Hills \n     Estates, testified that in many instances IRS power is too \n     great, citing the authority of the agency to seize homes--\n\n  Take a citizen's home--\n\n     with only the signature of a district director.\n\n  How many cases are there that we all know of where the IRS has taken \na taxpayer to court on a theory about the Tax Code and lost. Of course, \nby then the taxpayer has spent hours and hours and hours, suffered \nanxiety after anxiety and lost thousands of dollars, and won in court, \nsetting a precedent on the theory being challenged, and they turn right \naround and sue another taxpayer on the same theory, paying no attention \nto the court precedent that had been set by their loss before. Maybe \nthey will win the next one and just keep repeating it.\n  I might add, the legislation I have introduced in the Senate and \nCongresswoman Dunn, from Washington State, in the House, would stop \nthat practice, stop them from paying no attention to court precedents.\n  Late in the hearing Wednesday, Jennifer Long, an IRS agent, \ntestified--this is an IRS agent, testifying before a Senate Finance \nCommittee--that the IRS had fabricated evidence--in other words, made \nit up, falsified it--in tax cases and targeted individuals who are \nvulnerable because of low income or modest education. If you remember, \nI cited a personal case, of which I have personal knowledge, of just \nthat very thing happening: Just beat up on people who virtually have \ntheir hands tied behind their backs because they have no resources \nwhatsoever with which to defend themselves. I repeat, an IRS agent \ntestified before the committee that they made up evidence and targeted \nindividuals who are vulnerable because of low income or modest \neducation.\n  I mentioned a moment ago the Apple Valley woman who drove to \nWashington with her current husband, Orange County prosecutor Jime \nHicks, because the couple could not afford to fly with their children. \n``My credit is completely destroyed,'' Ms. Lund said, ``and my \nhusband's credit is seriously damaged. We will suffer the effects of \nthe IRS collection for the rest of our lives.'' It is important to \nremember that, when you entangle the citizens in this activity, that \nyou often alter the course of their lives forever.\n  Ms. Lund laid out her story for nearly half an hour, at times \nbreaking into tears. She said her problems with the agency started when \nthe IRS assessed additional taxes of $7,000 after she had filed her \n1983 tax return. By then she had divorced her previous husband and was \nunaware of the tax assessment. It takes them years to find these things \nout, but then they levee against it all the way back to the point of \nerror, or mistake. The IRS repeatedly came after Lund to pay the bill. \nShe paid the assessment three times, but the agency would send her the \nmoney back. You begin to get a hint, if you were getting these checks, \nthat this person was trying to resolve the problem. They sent the money \nback, saying she did not owe them anything. Then another branch would \ndun her again. This is almost unbelievable. When she married her second \nhusband, Hicks, the IRS went after him, too, attempting to levy his \npaycheck from Orange County earlier this year. The couple finally filed \nfor divorce, not to escape their marriage, but to protect his check \nfrom the IRS. Lund and Hicks also nearly lost their home to an IRS \nlien. The entire snafu was caused by the IRS creating a collection \nrecord that was never noted in the master computer file, a procedure \nreflecting old equipment, and the error was corrected only after the \ncommittee took its findings to the IRS. So, from 1983 to 1997, this \nwoman and her new husband have been pounded on and pounded on and \npounded on by the IRS.\n  In the case of Savage, the Delaware businessman, an investigation by \nthe committee staff turned up evidence that the IRS had committed \nserious ethical errors. In 1993, the Justice Department warned H. \nStephen Kesselman, the agency's district counsel in Philadelphia, not \nto pursue the case against Savage because its seizure--taking--of his \ncheck was wrongful, not right in the first place. Despite the Justice \nDepartment's advice, which was not disclosed to Savage until the \nhearings, the IRS continued pressing its case against him for another--\nnow, listen--for another year and a half. They took the check \nimproperly. The Justice Department told them they took the check \nimproperly. The Justice Department warned the counsel of IRS they had \ndone something in error. And then, for a year and a half, they kept \ndoing it. Out of control.\n  Savage eventually paid the agency $50,000 to settle the matter, \nfearing that a court fight would cost him even more. And every \nbusinessman who exists has been through that, in these days. He \nestimated the episode had cost him a quarter of a million dollars in \nlost business and legal fees, forcing him to continue working 4 \nadditional years before he retired.\n  I am going to come back to what I said a moment ago. The White House \nyesterday came to the defense of IRS, and has warned the Congress not \nto act hastily. I suggest that Treasury revisit the testimony before \nthey start suggesting that the Congress should be patient, and not get \noverly concerned, things are better, and that we might act too hastily.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by my distinguished colleague from \nAlabama. I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Georgia, \nSenator Coverdell, for yielding time to me this morning, because I \nthink what we are talking about is very important to the American \npeople.\n  The hearings that the Senate Finance Committee held last week, \nregarding the problems that pervade the Internal Revenue Service, were \nvery, very important in bringing to light, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, the level of abuse taxpayers often are subject to at the hands \nof the Internal Revenue Service. This sort of activity all across\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\nthis country has affected people in every State, including my State of \nAlabama. Today I would like to just share for a few minutes one such \ninstance with you and my colleagues in the Senate, and talk about why \nwe need to do more than simply reform the Internal Revenue Service.\n  One of my constituents in Alabama, Phillip Prebeck, of Foley, AL, \nprovides an illustration of an average play-by-the-rules Alabamian, or \nwe should say American, who has had to endure the IRS harassment. His \nstory is particularly poignant because it involves his late daughter, \nMary Hunt, and it occurred during a time when he was still grieving \nover her death.\n  After Mary's death in November of this past year, 1996, Mr. Prebeck \nprepared his daughter's tax return, deceased daughter's tax return, in \nearly March of this year. And, after including a copy of his daughter's \ndeath certificate and a letter explaining the situation as well as \nother appropriate information, Mr. Prebeck filed the return.\n  In June, the IRS sent a letter to his daughter, his deceased \ndaughter, indicating that she owed $937, and that she needed to pay up. \nThink of it in this context. Mr. Prebeck phoned the IRS and informed \nthem again that his daughter, Mary, had passed away and had left no \nestate. The IRS representative, who would not give her name, informed \nhim that he was responsible for the liability nonetheless. What \nfollowed was a series of mixed messages from a slew--really, a slew of \nIRS representatives, as to whether he was responsible for his deceased \ndaughter's tax liability.\n  Mr. Prebeck was unable to work through the situation with one IRS \nrepresentative, because they refused to allow him to call them back. \nThink about it. This made it very frustrating, because he could not \ndetermine what exactly was expected of him, and he was trying to do \nwhat was right as a citizen. Eventually, Mr. Prebeck, with the help of \nmy staff, determined that he did not have to pay the IRS, despite what \nhe had been told over the phone by the IRS on several occasions. \nNonetheless, Mr. Prebeck continued to receive correspondence from the \nIRS, which had first been mailed to his deceased daughter's address, \nwarning him that the liability remained.\n  He then requested a letter from the IRS, absolving him of \nresponsibility, to provide him with some peace of mind as a parent--if \nyou can imagine--and some tangible assurance that he would not continue \nto be harassed by the Internal Revenue Service. They agreed to provide \nsuch a letter, but to this day, and this morning, they have yet to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, this type of situation that I have just related is not \nuncommon in America. It is probably not uncommon in the State of the \nPresiding Officer, Colorado. For every Phillip Prebeck there are \nhundreds, perhaps thousands of taxpayers, from Alabama, perhaps from \nyour State of Colorado, perhaps from the State of Georgia--every State \nin the Union, who contact my office or your offices with similar \nstories. There are more who have had similar problems but do not call.\n  I find the Internal Revenue Service's actions particularly appalling \nin light of the agency's inability to manage its own financial affairs. \nFor example, and I know you have heard of this because the GAO did the \nreport, in 1996 the General Accounting Office reported the following \nregarding the audit performed on the IRS. Again, I am going to repeat, \nthis was an audit on the IRS by the General Accounting Office. The \nSenator from Georgia understands it and has read it.\n  No. 1, this was in 1995, the amount of the total revenue was $1.4 \ntrillion, and tax refunds to the people and companies was $122 billion. \nBut it could not be reconciled to accounting records maintained for \nindividuals in the aggregate. There was a discrepancy of $10.4 billion; \n$10.4 billion--where? In the IRS itself. The amounts reported for \nvarious types of taxes collected--that is Social Security, income tax, \nexcise taxes, for example--cannot be substantiated by the Internal \nRevenue Service itself. The reliability, according to the General \nAccounting Office, of reported estimates of $113 billion for valid \naccounts receivable, and $46 billion for collectible accounts, cannot \nbe determined as of this day.\n  GAO found that the IRS could not document how, and I will use their \nwords, a ``significant portion'' of their $3 billion nonpayroll \noperating budget was spent. In other words, the IRS, the Internal \nRevenue Service, could not document how they spent $3 billion of \nnonpayroll operating budget. Can you imagine that anywhere in America?\n  The amounts that the Internal Revenue Service reported as \nappropriations available for expenditure of operations cannot be \nreconciled fully with the Treasury's central accounting records showing \nthese amounts, and hundreds of millions of dollars in differences have \nbeen identified.\n  Indeed, the General Accounting Office determined that because of poor \nIRS financial management, that it could not conduct a reliable audit of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Think about it. That is appalling. Mr. \nPresident, the Internal Revenue Service should have been forced to \nprovide each American with a copy of this report to read it for \nthemselves. The agency cannot account, again, for $10.4 billion in tax \nrevenue and cannot tell you or the American people how they spent $3 \nbillion. But, they can find time to hound a gentleman over his deceased \ndaughter's $900 tax liability that he is not responsible for under the \nlaw.\n  Thankfully, the Senate Finance Committee's hearings have galvanized \nsupport for reform of the Internal Revenue Service. But what I \nencourage my colleagues to keep in mind is that the complexity of the \nTax Code has created the environment that has spawned the problems that \npervade the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS's governance, financial \nmanagement and quality control problems and the Internal Revenue \nService's inability to serve the taxpayer are symptoms of a much larger \nproblem. To address only these issues without embarking upon a \ncomprehensive effort to replace the Tax Code, I believe, is to treat \nthe symptoms and not the root cause of the problems.\n  My concern, and it is a concern of a lot of my colleagues in the \nSenate, is that after possibly implementing the recommendations of the \nnational commission to restructure the IRS, some may conclude that \ntheir job is complete, but that would be a fallacy. On the contrary, I \nview these proposals only as a beginning, and nothing more than a \nshortrun solution. Earlier this year, I introduced, again, the Freedom \nand Fairness Restoration Act that proposes to abolish the Tax Code as \nwe know it and replace it with a flat tax.\n  While some reforms may offer some short-term solutions and relief to \ntaxpayers, they cannot address the larger problems which continue to \nplague the Internal Revenue Service and the underlying system itself. I \nbelieve we must have broad-based reform of the code that provides the \npublic with a simple formula to calculate their taxes without fear of \nan IRS audit.\n  Although I believe that the flat tax is the best replacement of the \ncurrent system, I am not here to trumpet its virtues this morning. I \nsimply want to remind my colleagues today that we must not forsake ever \nour broader agenda to seek comprehensive tax reform. Piecemeal reforms \nare not a substitute in any way for broad-based reform and will not \nsolve the problems that pervade the IRS. We owe it to the American \npeople to reform the Internal Revenue Service as we know it. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama. I \nthink it is particularly noteworthy that he brought to our attention \nthe audit of the IRS itself, which we have all alluded to time and time \nagain, and the badgering of our citizens, but they can't reconcile \ntheir own books.\n  Mr. President, I read a moment ago that the White House's first \nreaction to all this is it is an overheated exercise and the IRS is \nreally OK.\n  My hometown paper is often a defender of the White House. I was quite \ntaken by the Atlanta Constitution's response to the hearings with an \neditorial that led off: ``Hey, GOP: Let's End Death Next.''\n  That's supposed to be funny. ``Over the years,'' I will just read \npart of it, ``you come to expect a certain level of hypocrisy in \nWashington, a certain\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\nlevel of posturing and theatrics that you assume to be the professional \nstandard of the city,'' says the Atlanta Constitution. ``But then every \nonce in a while, the world shifts and you are treated to a performance \nof breathtaking gall that simply blows you away. There, before your \neyes, you see a new standard being set, rendering all prior examples of \npandering insignificant by comparison.''\n  In other words, this testimony that I just reread and these hearings \nwere pure hypocrisy and set a new standard of hypocrisy.\n  I don't think anybody in their right mind could have watched those \nhearings and not felt some anguish for those who suffered, and welled \nup support for those who were courageous, and an understanding that \nsomething needed to be done and soon.\n  Hypocritic pandering? I think not. I think it is a deep-seated \nproblem of public servants who thought they were not accountable and \nhad come to misunderstand, Mr. President, that their job is to serve \nthe American people.\n\n  This editorial goes on to say that, obviously, tax collectors are \ngoing to be unpopular. In other words, enforcement people are, by \nnature, going to be unpopular. Are FBI agents unpopular? Are police \nofficers unpopular? No; the Nation is not fearful of fair enforcement; \nnever has been. Are they fearful of unchecked power and intimidation \nand threats? Yes; all people are wherever they happen to be, including \nthe United States.\n  Wherever it exists, it should be rooted out. Time and time again, \nwhenever we are called upon to do so, we should make sure that all \nGovernment servants are reminded they work for the American people who \nare a free people, who are dedicated free people by our Constitution. \nAnd from the very beginning, the premise was that we will not be \nintimidated nor threatened, nor made fearful of our own Government.\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude with that. I think Senator \nLeahy wants to make a remark or two.\n  I yield whatever time is necessary for Senator Leahy to make his \nremarks and then we will move to recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, and I thank my friend from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/03/senate-section/article/S10311-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10315-S10317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A LANDMINE IS A LANDMINE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for those who are planning schedules, I do \nnot expect to take long, but I will speak about an issue that I have \ntalked about many times, the issue of landmines, something, I must \nadmit, I think about in waking hours and sometimes in my dreams.\n  There was an ad in yesterday's Roll Call newspaper. It said:\n\n       There's just one problem with President Clinton's \n     ``landmine ban.'' . . . It doesn't ban landmines.\n\n  An ad in the Hill newspaper 2 days ago asked the question:\n\n       Would a landmine by any other name be as deadly?\n\n  That may seem like a strange question because the answer is so \nobvious. Landmines are those tiny hidden explosives that kill and maim \nrandomly. They are strewn by the thousands, by the tens of millions, in \nover 100 million in over 60 countries.\n  They do things like what is shown in this photograph. They do it to \nchildren in as many foreign countries as there are States in the United \nStates. That was a healthy young child walking down a road. That child \nin a single instant was maimed, crippled for the rest of his life, if \nhe survives the surgery he will have to undergo. If he survives, he \nwill grow up in a poor country with one arm, one leg and somehow be \nexpected to make a living.\n  Imagine if something like this was happening in the United States. We \nwould call it terrorism. We would make it a Federal crime. We would do \neverything possible to stop it. At my own home in Vermont, I can walk \nthrough acres of fields and woods, I can do it easily at this time of \nthe year, in the great beauty of the fall foliage. If I was in most of \nthese other countries, I would not dare step off the traveled part of \nthe road.\n  So there should not be any question about what a landmine is. For \nhundreds of millions of people around the world, they are a daily, \ndeadly nightmare. Everyday on their way to the fields, or to gather \nwater or in school yards or on roads once safe to travel, innocent \npeople, often children, are blown to bits by these indiscriminate \nweapons.\n  A year ago at the United Nations, President Clinton called on the \nnations of the world to ban antipersonnel landmines. The President \nsaid:\n\n       The United States will lead a global effort to eliminate \n     these terrible weapons and stop the enormous loss of human \n     life.\n\n  Those were inspiring words. I commend him today for saying them; I \ncommended him at the time.\n  But today we are confronted with a question we thought had been \nanswered a long time ago: When is a landmine a landmine?\n  It is relevant today because 2 weeks ago, rather than join 89 other \nnations, including most of our NATO allies, in agreeing to sign a \ntreaty to ban antipersonnel mines, the White House resorted to \ndoublespeak. Rather than make the hard choice, the right choice, rather \nthan pledge unambiguously to do away with these weapons, they said one \nthing but then they did another. They said the United States would ban \nantipersonnel mines, but then in the same breath, they redefined what \nan antipersonnel landmine is so they wouldn't have to ban them after \nall.\n  Mr. President, some people were fooled, but not many. A September 24 \narticle in the Washington Post begins with the same question:\n\n       When is an antipersonnel landmine . . . no longer an \n     antipersonnel landmine?\n       When the President of the United States says so.\n\n  I am told that article upset some people in the Pentagon. I am not \nsurprised. When the Pentagon tried to explain that a weapon that just a \nfew months ago they called an antipersonnel landmine is no longer an \nantipersonnel landmine today--they said it was yesterday; today they \nsay it is not--it is like watching someone who is caught telling a lie \nthat even he convinced himself was not a lie, and then acting offended \nat the suggestion he tried to pull a fast one.\n  A weapon they once called a landmine, now isn't. Why do they say \nthat? So they can say ``Look, we banned landmines. Except some of them \nwe renamed so we can still use them.'' It is Orwellian at best.\n  The Pentagon thought they could come up with a nifty way to get \naround a landmine ban that they never wanted. They asked themselves, \n``How can we be part of a treaty that bans antipersonnel mines, and \nstill keep using them? We'll just call landmines something different. \nThen you don't really have to ban them, you can just say you are.''\n  If antipersonnel mines are used in the vicinity of an antitank mine, \nthen they miraculously become something different from an antipersonnel \nlandmine even though that is what they were called just a few monts \nago. Without changing in any way, shape or form or explosive \ncapability, they suddenly become a submunition, not a landmine.\n  Thank God, Mr. President, we have banned landmines from our arsenal. \nOnly now we have submunitions. I am waiting for the appropriations bill \nto come forward to pay to relabel these millions of former landmines. \nSomebody will have to paint over where it says ``landmine'' and relabel \nthem as ``submunitions.'' And since submunitions are not banned, \npresto, the United States can say it is banning landmines even though \neveryone knows we are not.\n  Unfortunately, this kind of cynical ploy is seen too often in \nWashington. That is the problem.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle and a September 19 editorial from the Rutland Daily Herald, a \nVermont newspaper that has kept up with the international campaign to \nban landmines, be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there are serious issues here. One, of course, is \nabout pretending a landmine is something else, in a last-minute attempt \nto avoid being embarrassed by being left out of an international treaty \nthat the United States called for a year ago. It is embarrassing. We \nurged other nations to negotiate a treaty, and when they did we stayed \nout of the negotiations until\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\nthe last minute and then we said we would not sign it.\n  But another serious question is what to do with certain types of \nantitank mines that the United States has in its arsenal and that are \npackaged with antipersonnel mines.\n  I fully understand how important the Pentagon considers these weapons \nto our defense. I have spoken with people in the Pentagon about this. I \ndo not intend to minimize this problem. What I am saying, though, is \nface the problem, be straight about it, do not play word games.\n  Because it is just as important that the United States support a \nlandmine ban. If we are not going to be among the 100 nations that sign \nthe treaty in Ottawa this December--and I understand that is the \nPresident's decision--then we need to find a way to remove the \nobstacles that keep us from signing, because I the United States needs \nto be part of this treaty. If that means redesigning our antitank \nmines, then that is what we ought to do.\n  We need to sign the treaty as soon as possible, because as remarkable \nan accomplishment as it is, without the United States it is never going \nto achieve the international ban that everyone, including the \nPresident, wants. No country has the ability that the United States has \nto broaden support for the treaty and obtain adherence to it. Nobody \ncan exert the leadership that the world's only superpower can exert. \nThe American people do not want the United States to use a weapon that \ndoes not belong in the arsenal of civilized nations. They do not want \nthe United States to be standing in the way of a treaty that will set a \nnew moral standard for the next century. As the most powerful Nation, \nit is time to put an end to the doublespeak and the excuses and get \nbusy solving the problem.\n  Mr. President, I said when I spoke in Oslo to the representatives of \nnations and organizations that were meeting there, I dream of a \ncentury, a new century, when armies of humanity dig up, disarm, and \ndestroy landmines and nobody--nobody--puts new landmines down. Think \nwhat a century that would be for the children and the children of the \nchildren in those countries.\n  Think what that would mean to the United States when it sends \npeacekeepers around the world, when it sends humanitarian workers, \nmissionaries, doctors, whatever. Think what it would mean if they did \nnot have to face the constant threat of landmines.\n  Think what it would mean if we could go into countries that today \nhave to spend their scarce resources to import food because their \npeople cannot go into their fields to plant or to harvest, fields that \nare death traps because of landmines. There might be only one landmine \nin a field, but if you do not know where that landmine is, there may as \nwell be a hundred.\n  Think what it would mean if we could go to countries ravaged by civil \nwar and now reaching toward democracy, to help them rebuild the \ninfrastructure they need and not have to spend money on removing \nlandmines, expending $100 to $1,000 to remove a $3 or $5 landmine.\n  Think how wonderful it would be if our country did not have to fund, \nevery year now to the tune of $5 million, the Leahy War Victims Fund \nwhich pays for artificial limbs--something that is supported, I say \nwith gratitude, by every Member of this Senate, Republican and \nDemocrat. But think if we did not have to do that. Think if we would \nnot have to see children learning to walk on crude prosthetics. Think \nwhat a different world it would be.\n  We have worked to ban nuclear testing. We have worked to ban chemical \nweapons. Far more civilians have died and been injured and maimed by \nlandmines than by nuclear weapons or chemical weapons.\n  We can find a way to protect the legitimate defense needs of the \nUnited States and to maintain our legitimate obligations around the \nworld whether on the Korean Peninsula or anywhere else. We can do that \nand still be part of the remarkable global effort to ban landmines.\n  Mr. President, I have been in many countries where I have gotten out \nof a car and been told where I should walk, to be careful, that I \nshould step only here, not a foot away. I remember in one country I was \nabout to step off the road and somebody grabbed my arm and yanked me \nback because there were landmines there.\n  These are things I remember, and they are a daily terror for people \nwho live there.\n  Mr. President, let us join together to bring that to an end.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 24, 1997]\n\n           Clinton Directive on Mines: New Form, Old Function\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       When is an antipersonnel land mine--a fist-sized object \n     designed to blow up a human being--no longer an antipersonnel \n     land mine?\n       When the president of the United States says so.\n       In announcing last week that the United States would not \n     sign an international treaty to ban antipersonnel land mines, \n     President Clinton also said he had ordered the Pentagon to \n     find technological alternatives to these mines. ``This \n     program,'' he said, ``will eliminate all antipersonnel land \n     mines from America's arsenal.''\n       Technically speaking, the president's statement was not \n     quite accurate.\n       His directive left untouched the millions of little devices \n     the Army and Defense Department for years have been calling \n     antipersonnel land mines. These mines are used to protect \n     antitank mines, which are much larger devices meant to \n     disable enemy tanks and other heavy vehicles.\n       The smaller ``protectors'' are shot out of tanks or dropped \n     from jets and helicopters. When they land, they shoot out \n     threads that attach themselves to the ground with tiny hooks, \n     creating cobweb-like tripwires. Should an enemy soldier try \n     to get close to the antitank mine, chances are he would trip \n     a wire, and either fragments would explode at ground level or \n     a handball-sized grenade would pop up from the antipersonnel \n     mine to about belly height. In less than a second, the \n     grenade would explode, throwing its tiny metal balls into the \n     soldier's flesh and bones.\n       In the trade, these ``mixed'' systems have names such as \n     Gator, Volcano, MOPMS and Area Denial Artillery Munition, or \n     ADAM.\n       These mines, Clinton's senior policy director for defense \n     policy and arms control, Robert Bell, explained later, ``are \n     not being banned under the president's directive because they \n     are not antipersonnel land mines.'' They are, he said \n     ``antihandling devices,'' ``little kinds of explosive \n     devices'' or, simply, ``munitions.''\n       Not according to the Defense Department, which has used \n     them for years.\n       When the Pentagon listed the antipersonnel land mines it \n     was no longer allowed to export under a 1992 congressionally \n     imposed ban, these types were on the list.\n       And when Clinton announced in January that he would cap the \n     U.S. stockpile of antipersonnel land mines in the inventory, \n     they were on that list too.\n       At the time, there were a total of 1 million Gators, \n     Volcanos and MOPMs, as well as 9 million ADAMs. (Only some \n     ADAMs are used in conjunction with antitank mines, and those \n     particular devices are no longer considered antipersonnel \n     land mines.)\n       The unclassified Joint Chiefs of Staff briefing charts used \n     to explain the impact of legislation to Congress this year \n     explicitly state that Gators, Volcanos, MOPMS and ADAMs are \n     antipersonnel land mines.\n       So does a June 19 Army information paper titled ``U.S. \n     Self-Destructing Anti-Personnel Landmine Use.'' So does a \n     fact sheet issued in 1985 by the Army Armament, Munition and \n     Chemical Command.\n       As does a recent Army ``Information Tab,'' which explains \n     that the Gator is ``packed with a mix of `smart' AP \n     [antipersonnel] and `smart' AT (antitank] mines.''\n       And when Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, vice chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed reporters at the White \n     House on May 16, 1996, he said: ``Our analysis shows that the \n     greatest benefit of antipersonnel land mines is when they are \n     used in conjunction with antitank land mines. . . . If you \n     don't cover the antitank mine field with antipersonnel mines, \n     it's very easy for the enemy to go through the mine field.''\n       A diplomatic dispute over the types of antipersonnel land \n     mines Ralston was describing then and arms control adviser \n     Bell sought to redefine last week was one of the main reasons \n     the United States decided last week not to sign the \n     international treaty being crafted in Oslo, Norway.\n       U.S. negotiators argued that because these mines are \n     programmed to eventually self-destruct, they are not \n     responsible for the humanitarian crisis--long-forgotten mines \n     injuring and killing civilians--that treaty supporters hoped \n     to cure with a ban, and therefore should be exempt from the \n     ban.\n       Also, because other countries had gotten an exemption for \n     the type of antihandling devices they use to prevent soldiers \n     from picking up antitank mines--U.S. negotiators contended \n     that the United States should get an exemption for the small \n     mines it uses for the same purpose.\n       Negotiators in Oslo did not accept Washington's stance. \n     They worried that other countries might seek to exempt the \n     types of antipersonnel mines they wanted to use, too, and the \n     whole treaty would soon become meaningless.\n       The administration was not trying to deceive the public, \n     Bell said in an interview yesterday, bristling at the \n     suggestion. Given the fact that the U.S. devices are used to\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\n     protect antitank mines, ``it seems entirely common-sensical \n     to us'' to call them antihandling devices.\n       Said Bell: ``This was not a case of us trying to take mines \n     and then define the problem away.''\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n            [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Sept. 19, 1997]\n\n                           Clinton's Stumble\n\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy is charitable to President Clinton in \n     his statement, printed below, about the treaty negotiated \n     this week in Oslo, Norway, banning anti-personnel land mines.\n       Leahy says he is convinced Clinton wants to see land mines \n     eliminated and that Clinton's commitment is real.\n       But his statement also contains a damning account of \n     Clinton's pusillanimous surrender to the Pentagon and his \n     incompetent, eleventh-hour effort to negotiate a compromise. \n     Leahy, a champion of the international effort to ban land \n     mines, covers up his scorn for Clinton's effort with the \n     barest fig leaf of decorum.\n       The land mine negotiations are an excellent lesson in why \n     the U.S. Constitution ensures that control of the military \n     remains in civilian hands. In a democracy, the U.S. military \n     is an instrument of the people, not a separate warrior caste. \n     Thus, it is up to the civilian government to institute the \n     humanitarian standards and the political boundaries that \n     reflect the people's values. Clinton chickened out.\n       Clinton used Korea as an excuse, but in doing so he failed \n     to make the necessary calculation; the marginal difficulty of \n     reconfiguring our defenses in Korea weighed against the daily \n     carnage the land mine treaty is designed to prevent.\n       About 100 nations have signed on to the treaty, which \n     forbids them to use, produce, acquire, store or transfer \n     anti-personnel land mines. They have also agreed to destroy \n     current stocks and to remove any mines they have in place. \n     Further, they have agreed to assist in the care of land mine \n     victims.\n       The treaty represents an extraordinary response, outside \n     the usual bureaucratic channels of the United Nations, by the \n     governments of the world to a popular demand for change.\n       U.S. participation is necessary, however, if the ban is to \n     become a true worldwide ban. That's because there is no \n     chance those nations who have not signed will join the ban \n     until the United States does. These include China, Russia, \n     India, Pakistan and Israel, all of which could continue to \n     serve as sources for land mines for terrorist organizations.\n       Thus, Leahy is holding to his goal of making the United \n     States a signatory of the treaty. A bill of his that has 60 \n     co-sponsors would have established a ban on use of land mines \n     by the United States in 2000. The prospect that that bill \n     might pass goaded the Clinton administration into joining the \n     Oslo talks in the first place.\n       Now Leahy plans to consult with participants in the Oslo \n     talks, including the Canadians who have led the treaty \n     movement, plus Clinton and members of Congress, to determine \n     how best to move the United States toward signing the treaty. \n     Pushing the Leahy-Hagel bill, which includes an exception for \n     Korea under some circumstances, is one option.\n       It is clear Clinton needs to be reminded he was elected by \n     the people, not by the Pentagon, and that the people believe \n     progress in ending use of this barbaric weapon is important. \n     Leahy scoffs at the notion that the most powerful nation in \n     the world requires this primitive weapon to protect itself. \n     The message to policymakers in Washington must be that it is \n     shameful the United States has failed to join a worldwide \n     effort to make the world a safer and more civilized place.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to remark on the \npassing of a valued friend of the U.S. Senate, Michael Gutowski, a \nspecialist in private health insurance issues at the General Accounting \nOffice. Michael died suddenly and unexpectedly on September 23 at the \nage of 53. He was stricken during a meeting with Labor Department \nofficials while gathering information for a report on the \nimplementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct that I requested.\n  Over the past 10 years, Michael directed a remarkable series of \nstudies, almost 50 in all. Many focused on gaps in private health \ninsurance coverage, gaps that make affordable coverage under reasonable \nterms unavailable to many groups and individuals. Michael's reports \nwere remarkable in a number of ways. First, they succeeded in keeping \nthe Congress up-to-date on the evolution of the private health \ninsurance market. Second, the reports, while based on thorough and \noften innovative data collection techniques, were not just a tabulation \nof statistics. Michael had a remarkable gift for weaving data into a \nclear and articulate story, one that was immediately comprehensible and \ncompelling.\n  During my tenure as chairman, the reports, testimony, and briefings \nMichael developed for the Labor and Human Resources Committee have \nconsistently informed our deliberations on health care policy. We have \nbenefited from the research he led regarding employer strategies in \npurchasing health insurance, children's health insurance, the role of \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act and State insurance \nregulation, and the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act of 1996. In all these areas, he drew on his wide \nknowledge of the real world insurance marketplace. I know that his \ncontribution to other congressional committees and Members on a diverse \nrange of housing, health policy, economic, and workers compensation \nissues both at GAO and the Congressional Budget Office have been \nequally valued. In 1995, Michael received the Assistant Comptroller \nGeneral's award for studies related to health care reform.\n  Michael was an economist by training but a humanitarian by heart, \nwarn and generous with an unquenchable sense of humor. Michael was very \ndevoted to his wife Lois, and his children Laura and David. In \nextending condolences to his family, I want them and his colleagues at \nthe General Accounting Office to know that we, too, in the Senate will \nmiss him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of GAO reports by \nMichael Gutowski be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n

A bill to allow depository institutions to offer negotiable \norder of withdrawal accounts to all businesses, to repeal the \nprohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                 the small business banking act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Banking Act of 1997. I'm joined in this effort by my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is the \nprincipal cosponsor of this important legislation.\n\n  Passage of this bill will remove one of the last vestiges of the \nobsolete interest rate control system. Abolishing the statutory \nrequirement that prohibits incorporated businesses from owning interest \nbearing checking accounts will provide America's small business owners, \nfarmers, and farm cooperatives with a funds management tool that is \nlong overdue.\n  Passage of this bill will ensure America's entrepreneurs can compete \neffectively with larger businesses. My experience as a businessman has \nshown me, firsthand, that it's extemely important for anyone trying to \nmaximize profits to be able to invest funds wisely for maximum \nefficiencies.\n  During President Ronald Reagan's first term, one of his early actions \nwas to abolish many provisions of the antiquated interest rate control \nsystem the banking system was required to use. With this change to the \nlaws, Americans were finally able to earn interest on their checking \naccounts deposited in banks. Unfortunately, one aspect of the old \nsystem left untouched by the change in law was not allowing America's \nbusinesses to share in the good fortune.\n  Complicating matters is the growing impact of nonbanking institutions \nthat offer deposit-like money accounts to individuals and corporations \nalike. Large brokerage firms have long offered interest on deposit \naccounts they maintain for their customers.\n  While I support business innovation, I don't believe it's fair when \nany business gains a competitive edge over another due to government \ninterference through overregulation. This is exactly the case we have \nwith banking laws that stifle bankers, especially America's small \ncommunity bankers, and give an edge to another segment of the\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\nfinancial community. The Small Business Banking Act of 1997 seeks to \ncorrect this imbalance and allow community banks to compete fairly with \nbrokerage firms.\n  I'm pleased to say our bill has the strong support of America's \nCommunity Bankers and the American Farm Bureau Federation. In my home \nState of Nebraska, this bill has the support of the Nebraska Bankers \nAssociation and the Independent Bankers Association. These important \norganizations represent a crosscurrent of the type of support Senator \nReed and I have for our bill. Senator Reed and I also have the support \nof the Federal regulators. In their 1996 Joint Report, ``Streamlining \nof Regulatory Requirements'', the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, stated they believe the statutory prohibition against \npayment of interest on business checking accounts no longer serves a \npublic purpose. I heartily agree.\n  Mr. President, this is a straightforward bill that will do away with \nan unnecessary regulation that burdens American business. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nHagel in introducing the Small Business Banking Act of 1997, \nlegislation that eliminates a Depression-era Federal law prohibiting \nbanks from paying interest on commercial checking accounts. This \nlegislation represents an important victory for small business and the \nbanking industry because it eliminates a costly and burdensome Federal \nprohibition that has outlived its usefulness.\n  The prohibition against the payment of interest on commercial \naccounts was originally part of a broad prohibition on the payment of \ninterest on any deposit account. At the time of enactment, it was the \npopular view that payment of interest on deposits created an incentive \nfor rural banks to shift deposits of excess funds to urban money center \nbanks that made loans that fueled speculation. Moreover, it was \nbelieved that such transfers created liquidity crises in rural \ncommunities. However, a number of changes in the banking system since \nenactment of the prohibition have called into question its usefulness.\n  First, with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulatory \nand Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress allowed financial \ninstitutions to offer interest-bearing accounts to individuals--a \nchange which has not adversely affected safety and soundness. Second, a \nnumber of banks have developed complex mechanisms called sweep accounts \nto circumvent the interest rate prohibition. Because of the costs \nassociated with developing sweep accounts, however, large banks have \nbecome the primary offerors of these accounts. As a result, many \nsmaller banks are at a competitive disadvantage with larger banks that \ncan offer their commercial depositors interest-bearing accounts. Most \nimportant, the vast majority of small businesses cannot afford to \nutilize sweep accounts because the cost of opening these accounts is \nrelatively high and most small businesses do not have a large enough \ndeposit base to justify these costs.\n  In light of these developments, it has become clear that the \nprohibition on interest-bearing commercial accounts is nothing more \nthan a relic of the Depression era that has effectively disadvantaged \nsmall businesses and small banks, and led large banks to dedicate \nsignificant resources to circumventing the prohibition. I am, \ntherefore, pleased to cosponsor this legislation that will eliminate \nthis prohibition and level the playing field for small banks and small \nbusiness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Burns, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 1250. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\nthe national aeronautics and space administration fiscal years 1998 and \n                         1999 authorization act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the authorization bill \nfor the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal years \n1998 and 1999. I would like to thank the cosponsors of this bill, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, and Senator Stevens, as well as \nothers who support this bill, for their hard work and dedication to \nmaking this bill a possibility.\n  NASA's unique mission of exploration, discovery, and innovation has \npreserved the U.S. role as both a leader in world aviation and as the \npreeminent spacefaring nation. It is NASA's mission to: Explore, use \nand enable the development of space for human enterprise; advance \nscientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth, the Solar System, \nand the Universe and use the environment of space for research; and \nresearch develop, verify and transfer advanced aeronautics, space and \nrelated technologies.\n  This bill, which authorizes NASA for $13.6 billion in fiscal year \n1998 and $13.8 billion in fiscal year 1999, provides for the continued \ndevelopment of the international space station, space shuttle \noperations and safety and performance upgrades, space science, life and \nmicro gravity sciences and applications, the Mission to Planet Earth \nProgram, aeronautics and space transportation technology, mission \ncommunications, academic programs, mission support, and the office of \nthe inspector general.\n  With this authorization the committee puts in place a sound plan \nunder which NASA can provide assurances to the Congress that the cost \nand schedule difficulties of the international space station have been \ncontained. In addition, the bill has been crafted to protect to the \nmaximum extent possible the balance between manned and unmanned flight \nas well as the balance between development activities and science.\n  Therefore, I, along with my cosponsors urge the Members of this body \nto support this bill and allow NASA to continue its mission of support \nfor all space flight, for technological progress in aeronautics, and \nfor space science.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the NASA \nauthorization bill for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, introduced by \nSenator Frist, chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and \nSpace and Senator Rockefeller, the ranking minority member. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to thank both Senator Frist and Senator \nRockefeller for helping to craft a bipartisan bill which balances the \ngoals and missions of our space agency within fiscal responsibility.\n  This bill authorizes the full $1.4 billion requested by NASA for \nMission to Planet Earth. As many of you know, I'm a strong supporter of \nthis program because it is about using satellite technology to help \naverage citizens in their everyday activities. The goal of this program \nis to provide farmers, land planners, foresters, scientists and others \nwith cost-effective tools to help them do their work. This program \nprovides the scientific foundation for weather forecasting on a year-\nto-year basis, land-use management, and to protect people, property, \nand the environment from natural disasters. To accomplish this goal, \nMission to Planet Earth supports scientists in Montana and in other \nU.S. States, to carry out the experiments necessary to expand our \nfrontier of understanding Earth.\n  This bill also provides authorization for $10 million for the \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR] \nProgram. This funding will allow NASA to carry out a new competition to \nhelp NASA develop a stronger presence in the vital academic research \nprograms in institutions in rural States like Montana.\n  Finally, I would like to note that the bill contains a new provision, \nsection 317, which provides insurance, indemnification and liability \nfor coverage for the X-33 and X-34 experimental aerospace vehicle \ntests. It draws upon provisions in the Space Act as well as the \ncommercial Space Launch Act to provide the necessary coverage to \ncontinue innovative research and technology development in aerospace. \nIt also provides the infrastructure needed to allow NASA to work with \nindustry to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The X-33 program \npartners NASA with industry to develop a single-stage-to-orbit reusable \nlaunch vehicle. The goal is to decrease the cost of getting to space \nwhile making it safer and\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\nmore accessible. I'm proud that Montana is part of this program. \nMalmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls has been selected as one of \nthe preferred landing sites for the X-33 prototype. Landing at \nMalmstrom will be the longest flight for this 136-ton wedge-shaped \nprototype. Knowledge from these tests will be used to create the next \ngeneration launch vehicle.\n  I believe that we have a bill that provides NASA with the funding \nauthorization and policy direction it will need to maintain our world \nleadership in space and aeronautics.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1251. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the amount of private activity bonds which may be issued in \neach State, and to index such amount for inflation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   private activity bonds legislation\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Breaux, to introduce long overdue legislation to \nincrease the private activity tax-exempt bond cap to $75 per capita or \n$250 million, if greater, and index the cap to inflation. The current \ncap, which has not been adjusted in over a decade--not even to account \nfor inflation--is severely restricting the ability of States and \nlocalities to meet pressing housing, economic development, and other \nneeded investments in their citizens and communities.\n  This cap, imposed in 1986, is now $50 per capita or $150 million, if \ngreater. It applies to issuers of tax-exempt bonds for affordable \nsingle and multifamily housing, redevelopment of blighted areas, \nstudent loans, manufacturing, municipal service, and hazardous waste \ndisposal facilities.\n  Cap growth is limited to State population increases, but not \ninflation. As a result, inflation has severely eroded capped bonds' \npurchasing power. The 1987 bond cap, adjusted for the current limit, \nwould have been $14.3 billion. Ten years later, the 1997 cap is $15 \nbillion a mere 5-percent increase--due to population--over a period of \nfar greater inflation.\n  Mr. President, Congress never intended to restrict the growth of this \nprogram. In fact, Congress never intended the cap to shrink at all. It \nallowed the cap to grow with State populations and imposed the cap in \nthe same legislation, the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which terminated by 1989 \nthe two heaviest cap users: mortgage revenue bonds [MRB's] for housing, \nand industrial revenue bonds [IDB's] for manufacturing. That left \nplenty of room for the remaining capped bonds. Congress then extended \nMRB's and IDB's several times past the 1989 expiration dates and \nfinally made them permanent in 1993.\n  What Congress did not do at that time was adjust the cap to \naccommodate these additional uses. Accordingly, demand for capped bonds \nnow exceeds supply in most States. One example is the overwhelming \ndemand in many States for MRB's, issued primarily by State Housing \nFinance Agencies [HFA's] to finance modestly-priced first-time homes \nfor lower income families. In 1996, State HFA's issued almost $8 \nbillion in MRB's for nearly 100,000 mortgages, according to the \nNational Council of State Housing Agencies [HCSHA].\n  Since January 1, 1995, the State of New York Mortgage Agency [SONYMA] \nhas financed more than 1 billion dollars' worth of affordable first-\ntime home mortgage loans with MRB's. SONYMA's Construction Incentive \nProgram has allocated $250 million in MRB funding which will create \n2,400 new homes and 6,000 full-time jobs in New York.\n  The State of New York also relies heavily on tax-exempt bond \nauthority for multifamily housing. In 1997 alone, the New York State \nHousing Finance Agency expects to finance $420 million worth of \nmultifamily mortgage loans with multifamily housing bonds. \nThis investment will create, 2,150 new, privately owned and managed \napartments, 430 of which will be affordable to low-income families. In \naddition to providing desperately needed housing, this investment will \npromote economic integration in many neighborhoods.\n\n  Unfortunately, home ownership and a decent apartment remain out of \nreach for thousands more families whom the MRB and multifamily housing \nbond programs could serve better than any other. State HFA's could have \nused an estimated additional $2.4 billion in bond cap authority in \n1996, according to NCSHA. SONYMA could have used another $100 million \nlast year.\n  The private activity volume cap also includes tax-exempt bond \nauthority to assist small and midsized companies finance the expansion \nof manufacturing facilities. These companies often do not have \nreasonable access to the capital markets and cannot easily finance \nconstruction of manufacturing facilities. I used these bonds in my \ncapacity as town supervisor of Hempstead to allow existing businesses \nto grow and to attract new business. Without this financing, these \ncompanies, and their employees, would not be in New York State. \nNationwide, over $2.612 billion of tax-exempt manufacturing bonds were \nissued in 1996. In 1996 alone, New York State issues over $96 million \nof tax-exempt bonds for manufacturing facilities. The Council of \nDevelopment Finance Agencies reported that bond issuance increased 32 \npercent in 1996 from the prior year. In New York, demand for this low-\ncost financing greatly exceeded the almost $100 million of bonds \nissued. The Empire State Development Corp., a public agency, reported \nthat demand for tax-exempt bonds to support manufacturing was about 30 \npercent higher than the over $96 million of bonds actually issued in \n1996.\n  Over the years, these bonds created literally thousands of \nconstruction and permanent jobs in my home State, and tens of thousands \nnationwide. It is critical to raise the bond cap to facilitate job \ncreation by small and midsized manufacturing companies. In many cases, \nthese companies cannot obtain reasonable financing to expand, but for \ntax-exempt financing.\n  Mr. President, nationwide, demand for all bonds under the cap \noutstripped supply by almost $7 billion last year, according to NCHSA. \nNew York alone faced unmet demand of more than $1 billion for all the \ninvestments strangled by the cap.\n  The Nation's Governors have adopted a policy calling for a cap \nincrease. The Nation's State treasurers, National Association of \nCounties, and Association of Local Housing Financing Agencies [ALHFA] \nalso support raising the cap.\n  One-third of the House Ways and Means Committee and nearly 100 House \nMembers overall already have cosponsored companion legislation--H.R. \n979--to increase the bond cap $75 per capita or $250 million, if \ngreater, and index the cap to inflation.\n  The current cap is severely restricting the ability of States and \nlocalities from making much-needed investments in their citizens and \ncommunities. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Breaux and me in a \nbipartisan effort to increase the bond cap.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1251\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today with my \ncolleague, Senator D'Amato, an important bill that will assist States \nand localities in working with private industry to foster economic \ndevelopment and provide home ownership opportunities to low-income \nAmericans. Specifically, our bill will increase the private activity \ntax-exempt bond cap to $75 per capita or $250 million, if greater, and \nindex the cap to inflation. Congress created the private activity-\nexempt bond decades ago to apply to mortgage revenue bonds and other \nbonds for multifamily housing, redevelopment of blighted areas, student \nloans, manufacturing, and hazardous waste disposal facilities. However, \nCongress unintentionally restricted the growth of this program by \nimposing a cap on the bond volume of $50 per capita or $150 million, if \ngreater, which has meant States cannot meet the demand for these bonds.\n  Tax-exempt bonds are issued by State and local governments to provide \nbelow market interest rates to fund authorized programs and projects. \nRevenue bond investors accept lower interest from these bonds because \nthe interest income is tax-exempt. Mortgage revenue bonds are issued to \nhelp lower income working families buy their first homes with low \ninterest loans from private investment in State and local bonds, \nsignificantly lowering the cost of owning a home.\n  In my own State, the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency has issued over \n$1.1 billion in mortgage revenue bonds for almost 16,000 affordable \nhome mortgages since the program began. In 1996 alone, the agency \nissued over $112 million in mortgage revenue bonds for nearly 1,200 \nhome loans. That's 1,200 Louisiana families who now know the pride of \nowning their own home--Louisiana families that earned, on average, less \nthan $28,000 last year. The Louisiana Housing Finance Agency estimates \nthat it alone could have used another $50 million in bond authority. \nNationwide, States could have used an additional $7 billion in bond cap \nfor mortgage revenue bonds, student loan bonds, industrial revenue \nbonds, pollution control bonds, and other worthy investments.\n  Student loan bonds are issued to raise a pool of money at tax-exempt \ninterest rates to fund college loans at lesser interest rates. In my \nState, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority has issued $745 \nmillion in student loan bonds since 1984. These bonds have funded over \n80,000 college loans for deserving Louisiana students--students who \notherwise might not have been able to afford to attend college.\n  In Louisiana, the roughly $40 million of remaining 1997 volume cap \nwill not come close to fulfilling the $330 million of demand for these \nbonds. The total 1997 volume cap for Louisiana was $217,500,000. After \nfunding minimal housing and student loan needs, little volume cap \nremains available for industrial development bonds for manufacturing \npurposes. Many of the industrial and manufacturing facilities create \nsubstantial employment opportunities that are not possible due in part \nto a deficiency in volume cap.\n  Our bill will correct this woeful situation and improve the ability \nof States and localities to provide home ownership opportunities to \nlow-income families throughout the United States, to help fund student \nloans for college students and to help finance industrial and \nmanufacturing facilities. These facilities will, in turn, increase \nemployment and the tax base of local governments. I urge my colleagues \nto join me and Senator D'Amato in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1252. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the amount of low-income housing credits which may be \nallocated in each State, and to index such amount for inflation; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT CAP ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Graham of Florida, to introduce long overdue \nlegislation to increase the cap on State authority to allocate low-\nincome housing tax credits--housing credits--to $1.75 per capita, and \nto index the cap to inflation. The current cap of $1.25 per capita has \nnot been adjusted--not even to account for inflation--since the program \nwas created over a decade ago. This cap is strangling a State's \ncapacity to meet pressing low-income housing needs.\n\n  Annual cap growth is limited to the increase in State population, \nwhich has only been 5 percent nationwide over the past decade. During \nthe same time period, inflation has eroded the housing credit's \npurchasing power by approximately 45 percent, as measured by the \nConsumer Price Index.\n  Mr. President, as you may know, housing credits are the primary \nFederal-State tool for producing affordable rental housing across the \ncountry. Since 1987, State agencies have allocated more than $3 billion \nin housing credits to help finance nearly 900,000 apartments for low-\nincome families, including 75,000 apartments in 1996. In my own State \nof New York, the credit is responsible for helping finance 44,000 \napartments for low-income New Yorkers, including 4,450 apartments in \n1996.\n  Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office issued a \ncomprehensive report giving the housing credit a clean bill of health. \nThat report documents that the program in fact exceeds a number of \nimportant congressional objectives. For example, though the law allows \nhousing credit apartment renters to earn up to 60 percent of the area \nmedian income, GAO documented the average tenant's income at just 37 \npercent, and found that more than three out of four renters have \nincomes under 50 percent of the area median income. GAO also found that \nrents in housing credit apartments are well below market rents, up to \n23 percent less than the maximum permitted, and 25 percent below HUD's \nnational fair market rent.\n  The GAO report also documents that States are giving preference to \napartments serving low-income tenants longer than the 15 years the law \nrequires. In fact, two-thirds of the apartments GAO studied were set \naside for low-income use for 30 years or more.\n  A second major assessment of the credit has been objectively \ncompleted by Ernst & Young, reiterating many of the positive findings \nof the GAO report, demonstrating a tremendous need for additional \naffordable housing, and documenting the devastating effect of the \ncurrent cap on States' ability to finance this critically needed \nhousing.\n  Despite the success of the housing credit in meeting affordable \nrental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep \npace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, \nabandoned, or converted to market rate use each year. Increasing the \nhousing credit cap, as Senator Graham and I propose, would allow States \nto finance approximately 25,000 more critically needed low-income \napartments each year.\n  Nationwide, demand for housing credits outstrips supply by more than \n3 to 1. In 1996, States received applications requesting more than $1.2 \nbillion in housing credits--far surpassing the $365 million in credit \nauthority available to allocate that year.\n  In New York, the New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal \nreceived applications requesting more than $104 million in housing \ncredits in 1996--nearly four times the $29 million in credit authority \nit already had available. When I think of the immense need for \naffordable housing within my State, I can only characterize this \ndecade-old limit on State credit authority as an overwhelmingly lost \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, in 1993, Congress made the housing credit permanent \nwith unprecedented, overwhelmingly bipartisan cosponsorship. In \naddition, the Nation's Governors have adopted a policy calling for an \nincrease in the housing credit cap.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator D'Amato \nas we introduce legislation to increase the amount of low income \nhousing tax credits allocated to the States and to index the low-income \nhousing credit for inflation.\n  In a time of fiscal austerity, housing credits encourage private \ninvestment in economically sound, privately owned, affordable homes for \nlow-income working families in all 50 States. By helping families that \nget up and go to work every day to earn their rent and mortgage \npayments, the low-income housing credit provides families with an \nimportant stake in maintaining self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, the low-income housing tax credit was created in the \n1986\n\n[[Page S10323]]\n\ntax reform bill in the wake of decreasing appropriations for federally-\nassisted housing and the elimination of other tax incentives for rental \nhousing production. The housing credit encourages the construction and \nrenovation of low-income housing by reducing the tax liability placed \non the developers of affordable homes. The credit is based on the costs \nof development as well as the percentage of units devoted to low-income \nfamilies or individuals.\n  The current formula used in determining a State's housing credit \nallocation is $1.25 multiplied by the State's population. Unlike other \nprovisions in the Tax Code, this formula has not been adjusted since \nthe credit was created in 1986. During the same period, inflation has \neroded the credit's purchasing power by nearly 45 percent, as measured \nby the Consumer Price Index.\n  The bipartisan bill Senator D'Amato and I introduce today proposes to \nincrease the annual limitation on State authority to allocate low \nincome housing tax credits to $1.75 per capita and index the cap for \ninflation. By freeing the 10-year-old cap on housing credits from its \ncurrent limitation, as requested by the Nation's Governors, our bill \nwill liberate States' capacity to help millions of Americans who still \nhave no decent, safe, affordable place to live.\n  A brief look at the history of the housing credit provides ample \nevidence of why our legislation is needed. In the State of Florida, for \nexample, the LIHTC has used more than $187 million in tax credits to \nproduce approximately 42,000 affordable, rental units, valued at over \n$2.2 billion. Tax credit dollars are leveraged at an average of $18 to \n$1. Nevertheless, in 1996, nationwide demand for the housing credit \ngreatly out paced supply by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1. In Florida, \ncredits are distributed based upon a competitive application process \nand many worthwhile projects are denied due to a lack of tax credit \nauthority.\n  This spring, the U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO], Congress' main \ninvestigative agency, released a national audit of the Low-Income \nHousing Tax Credit Program. The GAO found that the average housing \ncredit apartment renter earns only 37 percent of the local area median \nincome. Further, surveyed properties--more than 450--appeared to be in \ngood condition and well-maintained. Additionally, the GAO reported that \nhousing credit properties ``overwhelmingly comply with statutory and \nregulatory requirements.''\n  Mr. President, I'd like to draw attention to one example of how the \nlow-income housing tax credit has benefited American families. I am \nreferring to the Holly Cove housing community developed by Vestcor \nEquities near Jacksonville, FL. Vestcor provides clean, safe and \naffordable living environments for low- to moderate-income residents by \ndeveloping, renovating, and operating multifamily communities.\n  In addition to affordable housing, Vestcor, through developments such \nas Holly Cove provides community services to improve the quality of \nlife of their residents. Through counseling, education, and resident \ninvolvement, Vestcor energizes its community and provides residents \nwith the tools they need for success. Activities and educational \nprograms offered include: budgeting and credit counseling, resume \nwriting assistance, GED classes, substance abuse counseling, and after \nschool homework assistance. In short, with the help of the low-income \nhousing tax credit, Vestcor Equities strengthens the community by \ninvesting in children and families.\n  Vestcor Equities provides first-hand evidence of the important role \nthe low-income housing tax credit offers as a catalyst of private \nsector investment in our communities.\n  Mr. President, as we struggle to balance the budget and restore \nfiscal responsibility in Washington, the housing credit allows \nbureaucrats to step aside and let the free market fill an important \nneed in America's communities. I hope my colleagues will embrace this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1253. A bill to provide to the Federal land management agencies \nthe authority and capability to manage effectively the Federal lands in \naccordance with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          THE PUBLIC LANDS MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  S. 1254. A bill to provide a procedure for the submission to Congress \nof proposals for, and permit upon subsequent enactment of law, \nassumption of management authority over certain Federal lands by States \nand nonprofit organizations; to encourage the development and \napplication to Federal lands of alternative management programs that \nmay be more innovative, less costly, and more reflective of the \nneighboring communities' and publics' concerns and needs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              THE FEDERAL LANDS MANAGEMENT ADJUSTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this week marked the 21st anniversary of \nthe congressional passage of the 1976 National Forest Management Act. \nIt is, therefore, a particularly appropriate time to discuss revisions \nto modernize NFMA and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act also \npassed in 1976. Today, I am introducing a revised version draft of a \nlegislative proposal I first circulated for comments and review last \nDecember.\n\n  Actually, as I will explain shortly, I am introducing two bills \ntoday. The first bill, called the Public Lands Improvement Act of 1997, \nprovides a series of reforms to the management programs of the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management. The second bill, called the \nFederal Lands Management Adjustment Act of 1997, provides an \nopportunity for the States or other parties to seek certain management \nresponsibilities for Federal, multiple-use lands.\n  These two bills were bound together as one proposal in my December \ndraft. But they have changed significantly as a consequence of six \nworkshops sponsored by the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land \nManagement, as well as a foot-thick pile of comments provided by \nindividuals and groups who took the time and effort to review the \nDecember proposal, offer us their views, and suggest many helpful \nchanges.\n  The proposal that I am introducing today has been shared with the \nClinton administration. We reviewed the proposal with them earlier this \nweek. In the very near future, we will hear their formal comments on \nthe proposal. But I think it is fair to say that, at this point, the \nadministration still embraces the proposition that no statutory changes \nare needed to the confusing and conflicting mandates that govern the \nForest Service and BLM. A number of serious observers and students of \nthese two agencies--most notably the General Accounting Office in a \nseries of research efforts conducted on behalf of myself and Senator \nMurkowski--disagree strongly.\n  Nevertheless, the administration's present posture is to inveigh \nagainst any changes to the law. This position makes it very difficult \nfor this bill, or any bill, to be introduced with the kind of \nbipartisan support that will be needed to eventually secure passage of \nlegislation in this area. Consequently, I am introducing this bill \nalone, even though there are numerous Senators on our side of the aisle \nwho would like to be cosponsors. I have asked the full committee \nchairman, Senator Murkowski, to join me.\n  I point out this reality not to pick a fight with the administration. \nRather, I want to make it clear that I am introducing it by myself--\nwithout political cover--so that a spirit of bipartisan cooperation can \nhave a chance to grow as we move into the formal hearings process. Any \nsignificant changes in this area of law will, by both design and \nnecessity, be the product of bipartisan collaboration between the \nCongress and the administration. I not only accept this--I welcome it.\n  At the same time, if you look closely at the Interior and related \nagencies appropriations bill reported by the Senate, you will see a \nnumber of instances where Senator Gorton and I have made it clear to \nthe administration that--absent clarifying legislative changes to \nconfusing and expensive statutory mandates--we are not prepared to \ncontinue to spend money to no particular end. At this point, we are \nsending good money after bad.\n  These existing statutes--NFMA and FLPMA--are 21 years old. Their \nimplementation today conjures the image of\n\n[[Page S10324]]\n\na sullen 21-year-old without a job, that's moved back home, is cleaning \nout the refrigerator and is draining cash without contributing much to \nthe family. In my single year as a member of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I have seen how many exceptionally worthy efforts are \ndenied funds. I cannot, in good conscience, condone further spending \nfor things like the RPA Program and NFMA plan revisions.\n\n  I hope the administration takes the message here seriously, but \nconstructively. That is the fashion in which is being sent. And, \nobviously I hope that they will review the proposal that we shared with \nthem last week, and provide us their ideas on the statutory changes \nthat should be made.\n  With that, I would like to highlight a few of the changes that we \nmade in response to reviewers that have provided us their comments \nsince last December.\n  First and foremost, as I indicated, I am introducing two bills today. \nWe have separated title VI of the December draft and made it a separate \nbill dealing with increased opportunities for the State--and now \nothers--to take on a larger role in Federal land management. I will \ntreat this idea separately as we move through the hearing process. I'm \ndoing this because a number of middle-of-the-road groups and thoughtful \nindividuals suggested that it is impossible to focus on Federal land \nlaw reform if we are simultaneously, that is, in the same piece of \nlegislation, looking at alternatives to Federal land management. \nConsidering alternatives to Federal management of nationally owned \nlands is an intellectual ``bridge too far'' for many. It became an \nimpediment to their participation and, I hope, ultimately their support \nfor Federal land management reform.\n  I can accept this, even though it does suggest a certain timidity of \nspirit. I will note that the most timid of spirit, by far, were those \ninterest groups, which self-identified by their rhetoric, that \nvigorously opposed all discussion of this concept in any form.\n  At the same time, I remain convinced that we ought to be looking at \nalternatives to Federal land management in a thoughtful and organized \nway. That is why I have introduced both bills today. We may take up the \nbills at somewhat different times as we move forward. But we will \neventually pursue them both.\n  The former Chief of the Forest Service, Jack Ward Thomas, and the \nGeneral Accounting Office felt that both the BLM and the Forest Service \nneed a much clearer statement of mission. Our December draft focused \nlargely upon improved procedures. The GAO emphasized that any attempt \nto change resource management procedures would not, by itself, be \nsufficient to cut through the morass of confusion that currently \ninfects Federal agency management. Therefore, we have included a \ndiscrete mission statement for both the BLM and the Forest Service in \nthe new proposal.\n  Additionally, over the past 9 months we have heard a lot from locally \nbase, consensus groups working of Federal land management problems. I \nhave become convinced that we ought to encourage these efforts. \nTherefore, this bill provides greater opportunity and encouragement to \nlocal consensus groups. Also, we provide a greater opportunity for the \nForest Service and BLM to seek out local advice from interested \nelements of the public. I am optimistic that, if we can forge consensus \nat the local level, many of the national land management conflicts can \nbe diminished in their intensity.\n  In response to numerous comments, we have also made some significant \nchanges to part B of title I dealing with administrative appeals and \njudicial review of Forest Service and BLM decisions. We still codify--\nfor the first time--an administrative appeals process for the Forest \nService. The existing appeals process is without statutory basis, and \ncould be eliminated by administrative fiat.\n\n  We have, however, removed the provision allowing the executive \nagencies the opportunity to dismiss and penalize frivolous appeals. In \nthe December draft, we tried to use existing jurisprudential standards \nfor discouraging frivolous legal action. Many reviewers were, however, \nuncomfortable with the notion of providing this authority to the \nexecutive branch agencies under any standard.\n  We also removed a provision in the December draft which stated that, \nupon injunction of a land and resource management plan, the previous \nplan would apply. As with frivolous actions, we will now leave to the \njudiciary the case-by-case determination of an appropriate course of \naction after the issuance of a broad-scale injunction.\n  One of the more contentious issues in the December draft was whether \nthe land managing agencies should assure their own compliance with \nsection 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Many groups were unwilling to \ntrust the Forest Service and the BLM to do this on their own. Here, we \nwere guided by the thoughtful comments of the Wildlife Management \nInstitute. The Institute suggested that, with some review and \ncertification of their program capabilities, the land managing agencies \ncould be so trusted. Therefore, this provision has been modified to \nallow the land managing agencies to do their own section 7 compliance, \nbut only after their programs have been certified by the Fish and \nWildlife Service--in consultation with the National Marine Fisheries \nService--as competent to carry out this responsibility.\n  You may recall that, in title IV of the December draft, we created \nsome new funding streams to increase land management activities. We \nreceived a number of comments that allowing resource managers to keep \nthese funds locally could create perverse incentives that would result \nin more intensive land management--whether or not such management is \nappropriate in individual circumstances. At the same time, we heard \nfrom GAO and others that one of the most crying needs for additional \nfunding is monitoring of plan implementation. The GAO emphasized that \nthis is where the Forest Service and BLM often fall short.\n  In response to both sets of concerns, we are retaining these new \nfunding streams, but channeling any additional revenues into increased \nmonitoring activity. It is our hope that, with better monitoring, we \nwill get more effective plan implementation, and more projects \naccomplished on the ground.\n  During the past few months as we have worked on this proposal, we \nhave also been captivated by a separate discussion underway between the \nadministration and groups who wish to bid on timber sales for the \npurpose of preserving--rather than harvesting--the trees. To date, the \nadministration has correctly interpreted existing law as not providing \nthe authority to entertain such bidders. Section 14(c) of the National \nForest Management Act is specific that the purpose of timber sales is \nto promote the orderly harvesting of the timber.\n  At the same time, where the sale is for the sole purpose of disposing \nof a commodity, we believe that the taxpayers should be afforded the \nbest price--whether it is being offered by someone who wants to \nharvest, or someone who wants to preserve the trees. Therefore, we have \nadded a provision in title IV of the bill which provides the \nadministration authority which it now lacks, to allow nonharvesting \nbidders to participate in the auction of commodity timber sales that \nhave no land stewardship function associated with them.\n\n  Now let me spend a few moments on the second bill dealing with \ntransfer of management responsibilities for Federal lands. As I \nindicated, this has been split into a separate bill to accommodate \nthose who could not consider alternatives to Federal management at the \nsame time they were proffering their views about how to make Federal \nmanagement more effective. With regard to the State transfer bill, it \nis in many respects similar to title VI of our December draft. We do, \nhowever, clarify that nothing in the transfer of management \nresponsibility is designed to infringe on Indian tribal or treaty \nrights.\n  Additionally, we have been moved by the views of a number of free \nmarket environmentalists and scholars who have argued that there should \nbe an opportunity for nonprofit trusts to assume a larger role in \nFederal land management. We have added this concept to the transfer \nbill.\n  These are a few of the changes that we made. As I indicated, the \nchanges are numerous and substantive. My staff indicated that, at last \ncount, we had made some 80 changes in the December\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\ndraft. It's now time to review these changes, and continue a \nconstructive discussion on how this bill can be improved further.\n  In that regard, I want to thank a number of individuals and groups \nwho have been instrumental in providing us ideas for the improvements \nthat we have already made. First and foremost, I want to thank former \nChief, Jack Ward Thomas, for his advice and participation in our \nworkshops. I also would like to thank a group of retired Forest Service \nDeputy Chiefs and Regional Foresters led by George Leonard for their \nthoughtful and detailed comments.\n  I appreciate the assistance provided by a number of professional \nsocieties and other middle-of-the-road conservation groups who assisted \nus by forming committees made up of their members to review the bill \nand offer us formal comments. These groups include, among others, the \nWildlife Management Institute, the Society of American Foresters, the \nNational Association of State Foresters, and the Association of State \nLand Commissioners. In each case, their participation has been \ninstrumental in guiding us toward some of the changes I have described.\n  Now I suppose the next question is: where we will head from here? We \nwill try to convene a first hearing before we recess this session of \nCongress. At this hearing, I hope to hear from those groups that have \ntaken the extra step of forming committees of their members to review \nthe December proposal. I would like to hear from them how responsive \nthey think we have been to their constructive suggestions.\n  Then, when we reconvene next year I will hold additional hearings to \nreceive testimony from national interest groups, as well as from the \nadministration. I will endeavor to be as inclusive as possible in \nsoliciting testimony from as wide a range of groups as are interested.\n  I hope that, by early next year, the administration will see its way \nclear to sit down with us and suggest constructive changes to this \nproposal. I would welcome the opportunity to work with them to see if \nthere is a list of changes that we can agree are necessary and \nmeaningful to pursue.\n  With or without the administration's cooperation, I will nevertheless \nendeavor to produce a third version of this bill to have ready for \ncommittee markup sometime next spring.\n  I urge all groups involved in reviewing this legislation to take the \ntime to: first, read it; second, reflect on it; third, come in and \ndiscuss it with us if they wish; and fourth, commit themselves to \nmoving forward to work with us to develop a land management planning \nprocess that is equitable, efficient, and sensitive to environmental, \neconomic, and fiscal concerns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSection-by-Section Description--Public Lands Management Improvement Act \n                                of 1997\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title: table of contents. This legislation--\n     ``Public Lands Management Improvement Act of 1997''--provides \n     new authority and gives greater responsibility and \n     accountability to the Forest Service, Department of \n     Agriculture, and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Department \n     of the Interior, for planning and management of federal lands \n     under their jurisdiction. The two statutes governing the \n     agencies' land planning and management--National Forest \n     Management Act (NFMA) and Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act (FLPMA)--are now more than two decades old; this \n     legislation preserves those laws' policies and requirements \n     while it updates those laws to reflect the agencies' \n     subsequent performance and experience.\n       Sec. 2. Findings. This section contains numerous findings \n     which explain the need for this legislation. The findings--\n       Note the widespread public support for the twin principles \n     of federal land management--multiple use and sustained \n     yield--imposed on Forest Service lands in NFMA and on BLM \n     lands in FLPMA.\n       Recognize that NFMA and FLPMA, enacted in 1976, established \n     resource management planning processes as the means to apply \n     these land management principles to the federal lands.\n       State that, in the 2 decades since the enactment of NFMA \n     and FLPMA, fundamental flaws in the planning processes have \n     been exposed, to the dissatisfaction of all stakeholders.\n       Find that these flaws threaten the planning and \n     decisionmaking processes and undermine the agencies' ability \n     to fulfill their statutory land management responsibilities \n     and accomplish management that is well grounded in science.\n       Note that Congress' desire for planning to be completed \n     within discrete time frames and to provide secure management \n     guidance has not been achieved.\n       Describe how planning has yet to be completed 2 decades \n     after the enactment of NFMA and FLPMA, and how the Forest \n     Service and BLM are now engaged in an apparently perpetual \n     planning cycle that deprives both the agencies and the public \n     of stable and predictable management of federal lands.\n       State that the two levels of planning contemplated and \n     required by NFMA and FLPMA have been expanded by the agencies \n     and the courts to include various planning exercises on \n     multiple, often conflicting planning levels that in many \n     cases are focused narrowly on only one resource, are \n     conducted without the procedural and public participation \n     safeguards in the planning required by statute, and result in \n     guidance that conflicts with the planning that is conducted \n     in accordance with statutory direction.\n       Find that the procedures and requirements of NFMA and FLPMA \n     often are not compatible, and even conflict, with procedures \n     and requirements of other, more generally applicable \n     environmental laws. The result is often the de facto transfer \n     of planning and management decisionmaking authority from the \n     land management agencies--the Forest Service and BLM--to \n     other environmental agencies--the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, etc.--that do not possess comparable land management \n     expertise.\n       Find ``without doubt'' that Congress has failed to \n     reconcile the procedures and requirements of other \n     environmental laws with the planning and management processes \n     established by NFMA and FLPMA.\n       Describe how, even when the Forest Service and BLM retain \n     planning and management authority, they are often paralyzed \n     by an escalating number of administrative appeals and \n     lawsuits.\n       Note that existing law does not recognize, nor integrate \n     into planning, important new land management concepts such as \n     ecosystem management and adaptive management which are being \n     imposed or incorporated in federal land planning and \n     management without statutory authority.\n       State that new processes developed by stakeholders to \n     better participate in federal land planning and \n     decisionmaking, such as the community-based collaborative \n     deliberations of the Quincy Library Group and Applegate \n     Partnership, are not recognized or encouraged by NFMA and \n     FLPMA.\n       Find that these flaws in planning and plan implementation, \n     including the administrative and judicial challenges, have \n     escalated Forest Service and BLM land management costs and \n     thereby reduced land management capability.\n       State that these flaws in planning and subsequent inability \n     to secure plan implementation have injured--both \n     environmentally and economically--all stakeholders, but \n     particularly local resource-dependent communities which have \n     no protection nor recourse under NFMA and FLPMA.\n       Find that NFMA, FLPMA, and their implementing regulations \n     provide much guidance on planning, but virtually none on plan \n     implementation, thereby devaluing the term ``Management'' \n     common to both Act's titles.\n       Report the finding of the United States General Accounting \n     Office that the statutory flaws and public distrust discussed \n     in these findings have contributed to, and been compounded \n     by, the agencies' lack of a clear mission statement.\n       And find that additional statutory direction for planning \n     and plan implementation is needed to secure stable and \n     predictable federal land management and to free the Forest \n     Service and BLM to exercise fully their professionalism in \n     making management decisions.\n       Sec. 3. Definitions. This section defines the terms used in \n     this legislation. For the purpose of this section-by-section \n     description only two terms need definitions. ``Federal \n     lands'' means all federal lands managed by the BLM (excluding \n     Outer Continental Shelf lands) and Forest Service (including \n     national grasslands). The four ``Committees of Congress'' are \n     the authorizing committees with jurisdiction over the Forest \n     Service and BLM: the Committee on Resources and Committee on \n     Agriculture in the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources and Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry in the United States Senate.\n       Sec. 4. Supplemental authority. This section makes clear \n     that this legislation supplements the NFMA, FLPMA, and other \n     applicable law. It also provides that, except for units of \n     the National Wilderness Preservation, National Wild and \n     Scenic Rivers, and National Trails Systems, this legislation \n     will prevail whenever it is in conflict with other applicable \n     law. On the other hand, the laws governing those Systems will \n     prevail whenever this legislation conflicts with them.\n       Sec. 5. Transition. This section makes clear that existing \n     plans, policies, and other guidance concerning the federal \n     lands that are in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     legislation remain valid until they are revised, amended, \n     changed, or terminated in accordance with this legislation.\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\n   title i--ensuring the effectiveness of federal land planning and \n                             implementation\n\n       Sec. 101. Purposes. The purposes of Title I are to provide \n     a mission statement for the Forest Service and BLM and \n     provide Congressional direction to those agencies on the \n     preparation and implementation of resource management plans \n     for, and the planning of management activities on, the \n     federal lands. This mission and direction are intended to \n     avoid the environmental, economic, and social injuries caused \n     by the existing flaws and past absence of mission and \n     direction in federal land planning. Most importantly, this \n     mission and direction are expected to achieve stable, \n     predictable, timely, sustainable, and cost-effective \n     management of federal lands.\n\n                           Part A. In general\n\n       Sec. 102. Mission of the land management agencies. This \n     section provides a new mission for the Forest Service and \n     BLM. It is to manage the federal lands to furnish a \n     sustainable flow of multiple goods, services, and amenities \n     while protecting and providing a full range and diversity of \n     natural habitats of native species in a dynamic manner over \n     the landscape.\n       Sec. 103. Scientific basis for Federal land decisions. To \n     ensure that federal land planning and management is well \n     grounded in science, this section requires the Forest Service \n     and BLM to use in all federal land decisions the best \n     ``scientific and commercial data available.'' This standard \n     for scientific data is adopted from the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973.\n\n      Part B. Resource management and management activity planning\n\n       Sec. 104. Levels of planning. To reduce the proliferating \n     number of federal land planning exercises, this section \n     limits the levels of Forest Service and BLM planning to two--\n     multi-use resource management planning for designated \n     planning units and site-specific planning for management \n     activities. The two agencies are given complete discretion to \n     designate planning units of whatever size and number they \n     consider appropriate in which to conduct the resource \n     management planning.\n       The agencies may also conduct analyses or assessments for \n     geographical areas other than the planning units (including \n     ecoregion assessments as provided in Title III). However, the \n     results of these analyses or assessments can be applied to \n     the federal lands only by amending or revising the applicable \n     resource management plans.\n       This section establishes a 3-year deadline for amending or \n     revising existing resource management plans to include \n     policies developed in planning conducted outside of the two \n     prescribed planning levels. That non-complying planning will \n     no longer apply to the federal lands at the end of the 3-year \n     period.\n       Sec. 105. Contents of planning and allocation of decisions \n     to each planning level. To eliminate redundant planning that \n     is time-consuming and costly, this section assigns specific \n     analyses to the two levels of planning established in section \n     104 and clarifies that the analyses may not be repeated \n     elsewhere in the planning process. This section requires that \n     resource management plans contain 4 basic elements: (1) \n     statement of management goals and objectives; (2) allocation \n     of land uses to specific areas in the planning unit; (3) \n     determination of outputs of goods and services from the \n     planning unit; and (4) environmental protection policies. The \n     agencies are admonished to tailor the environmental \n     protection policies, to the maximum extent feasible, not to \n     be prescriptive requirements generally applicable to the \n     entire planning unit but rather to provide guidance for \n     determining specific requirements tailored to identified \n     sites during the planning of individual management \n     activities.\n       Additionally, the resource management plans are required to \n     contain: (1) a statement of historical uses, and trends in \n     conditions of, the resources covered by the plans; (2) a \n     schedule and procedure for monitoring plan implementation, \n     management of the covered federal lands, and trends in the \n     covered resources' uses and conditions as required by section \n     115, and (3) criteria for determining when circumstances on \n     the covered federal lands warrant adaptive management of the \n     resources as required by section 115.\n       This section requires the agencies to assign by a notice-\n     and-comment rulemaking specific analyses and decisions to \n     each of the two planning levels. The agencies may not conduct \n     or reconsider those analyses or decisions in the planning \n     level to which they are not assigned. This section also makes \n     a number of analyses and decision assignments. In addition to \n     the 4 basic elements discussed previously in this section, \n     assigned to resource management planning are resource \n     inventories, cumulative effects analyses, discussion of \n     relationship to State and local plans, identification of \n     federal lands which might be exchanged or otherwise disposed \n     of, and decisions on wilderness, unsuitability of lands for \n     certain uses (e.g., coal mining as required by section 522 of \n     the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and timber \n     harvesting as required by section 6 of the National Forest \n     Management Act), and visual objectives. Assigned to \n     management activity planning are analyses of site-specific \n     resources and environmental effects, and decisions concerning \n     the design of, and requirements for, the activity, including \n     decisions related to water quality, method for harvesting \n     forest products, revenue benefits and a schedule and \n     procedures for monitoring the effects of the activity.\n       Sec. 106. Planning deadlines. To break the cycle of \n     perpetual planning, this section would set deadlines for \n     conducting the two-level planning. These deadlines are: (1) \n     for resource management planning--30 months for plan \n     preparation, 12 months for amendments defined as significant \n     by regulations, 9 months for amendments defined as non-\n     significant by regulations, and 24 months for revisions; and \n     (2) for management activity planning--9 months for planning \n     significant activities and 6 months for planning non-\n     significant activities.\n       Sec. 107. Plan amendments and revisions. This section \n     ensures that the 4 basic elements of the resources management \n     plans are accorded equal dignity and that one element is not \n     arbitrarily sacrificed or ignored to achieve another. It \n     prohibits the Forest Service and BLM from applying a policy \n     to, or making a decision on, resource management plan or a \n     management activity which is inconsistent with one of the \n     basic elements. Instead, this section requires that the \n     resource management plan must be awarded to alter or \n     reconcile conflicting basic elements. This decision to amend \n     would be made whenever the inconsistency is discovered, \n     usually during either the planning for a specific \n     management activity or the monitoring of plan \n     implementation required by section 115. The agencies are \n     given the authority to waive an inconsistency without \n     amending the resource management plan on a one-time basis \n     for a single specific management activity if the \n     inconsistency does not violate a nondiscretionary \n     statutory requirement and the determination is made that \n     the waiver is in the public interest.\n       This section also requires that any change in federal land \n     management that is imposed by new law, regulation, or court \n     order or that is warranted by new information must be \n     effected by amending or revising the appropriate resource \n     management plans. Further, unless the agency determines that \n     the law or court order requires otherwise and publishes that \n     determination, the change in management does not become \n     effective until the amendment or revision is adopted.\n       This section directs, that when resource management plans \n     are revised, all provisions of those plans are to be \n     considered and analyzed in the environmental analysis \n     (environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental \n     assessment (EA)) and decision documents. This ensures that \n     the agency does not consider only those portions of the plans \n     that are particularly important to the most vociferous \n     advocates for a particular land use or management policy or \n     are of particular interest to the officials involved in the \n     planning exercise.\n       Finally, this section clarifies that, while a resource \n     management plan is being amended or revised, management \n     activities are to continue and not be stayed in anticipation \n     of changes that might be made by the amendment or revision. \n     Exceptions to this stay prohibition include whenever a stay \n     is required by this Act, court order, or a formal declaration \n     by the Secretary (without delegating the authority). However, \n     the agencies can stay particular activities for purposes that \n     are unrelated to the purpose or the likely effect of the \n     amendment or revision. To ensure that de facto stays do not \n     occur, this section provides that, except as described above, \n     a plan amendment or revision may not become effective until \n     final decisions on management activities that are scheduled \n     to be made during the plan amendment or revision process have \n     been made.\n       To avoid tunnel-visioned decisionmaking that focuses on one \n     issue to the exclusion of all others, this section directs \n     the agencies to consider in the environmental analysis \n     documents on any amendment or revision of a resource \n     management plan what effect the amendment or revision may \n     have on the 4 basic elements required for each plan by \n     section 105. The decision document on the amendment or \n     revision must include a discussion of the reasons why the \n     effect is necessary and what steps were taken in the planning \n     process and decisionmaking, or will be taken thereafter, to \n     ameliorate any adverse economic or social consequences which \n     will or could result from the effect.\n       Sec. 108. Disclosure of funding constraints on planning and \n     management. To ensure that planning decisions are not based \n     on overly optimistic funding expectations and are not \n     rendered irrelevant by enactment of differing appropriations, \n     this section requires that the EIS or EA on each resource \n     management plan, or plan amendment or revision, contain a \n     determination on how the 4 basic elements (goals and \n     objectives, land use allocations, outputs of goods and \n     services, and environmental protection policies) will be \n     implemented within a range of funding levels (with at least \n     one level which provides less funds annually, and one level \n     which provides more funds annually, then the level of funding \n     for the fiscal year in which the EIS or EA is prepared).\n       Sec. 109. Consideration of Federal lands-dependent \n     communities. This section requires that, in preparing, \n     amending, or revising each resource management plan, the \n     Forest Service and BLM must consider if, and explain whether, \n     the plan will maintain to the maximum extent feasible the \n     stability of any community that has become dependent on the \n     resources of the federal lands to which the plan applies.\n       The procedure for meeting this mandate is to include in the \n     EIS or EA on the plan,\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\n     amendment, or revision a discussion of: the impact of each \n     plan alternative on the revenues and budget, public services, \n     wages, and social conditions of each federal lands-dependent \n     community; how the alternatives would relate to historic \n     community expectations; and how the impacts were considered \n     in the final plan decision.\n       This section defines a federal lands-dependent community as \n     one which is located in proximity to federal lands and is \n     significantly affected socially, economically, or \n     environmentally by the allocation of uses of one or more of \n     the lands' resources. The Secretaries are to consult with the \n     Secretaries of Commerce and Labor in establishing by \n     rulemaking criteria for identifying these communities.\n       Sec. 110. Participation of local, multi-interest \n     committees. To encourage local solutions to federal land \n     management issues developed by neighboring citizens of \n     diverse interests, this section provides for the \n     establishment of two types of local, matter-interest \n     committees. The first is the ``independent committee of local \n     interests'' established without the direction, intervention, \n     or funding of the agencies and including at least one \n     representative of a non-commodity interest and one \n     representative of a commodity interest. Prototypes for this \n     type of committee are the Quincy Library Group and Applegate \n     Partnership. This section encourages these independent \n     committees to prepare planning recommendations for the \n     federal lands by imposing the requirement on the agencies \n     that they include those recommendations as alternatives in \n     the EISs or EAs which accompany the preparation, amendment, \n     or revision of resource management plans. If more than two \n     independent committees are established and submit planning \n     alternatives for the same federal lands, the Forest Service \n     or BLM will include the alternatives of the two committees it \n     determines to be most broadly representative of the interests \n     to be affected by the plan, amendment, or revision, and will \n     attempt to consolidate for analysis or otherwise discuss the \n     other committees' alternatives. Finally, the section \n     authorizes the Forest Service and BLM to provide to any \n     independent committee whose planning alternative is adopted \n     sufficient funds to monitor the alternative's implementation. \n     These independent committees would be exempt from the Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act.\n       Second, the agencies are empowered to establish local \n     committees corresponding to the federal land's planning \n     units. The membership of these committees must be broadly \n     representative of interests affected by planning for the \n     planning units for which they were formed. The agencies must \n     seek the advice of the committees prior to adopting, \n     amending, or revising the relevant resource management plans \n     and provide the committees with funding to monitor plan \n     implementation.\n       Sec. 111. Ecosystem management principles. This section \n     ensures that the relatively new ecosystem management concept \n     is incorporated into planning in a fashion which does not \n     supersede other statutory mandates. It requires that the \n     Forest Service and BLM consider and discuss ecosystem \n     management principles in the EISs or EAs for resource \n     management plans, amendments, and revisions. It also states \n     that these principles are to be applied consistent with, and \n     may not be used as authority for not complying with, the \n     other requirements of this legislation, FLPMA, NFMA, and \n     other environmental laws applicable to resource management \n     planning.\n       Sec. 112. Fully allocated costs analysis. To ensure that \n     the costs of all uses are revealed, this section directs the \n     Forest Service and BLM to disclose in the EISs and EAs on \n     resource management plans, amendments, and revisions the \n     fully allocated cost including foregone revenues, expressed \n     as a user fee or cost-per-beneficiary, of each non-commodity \n     output from the federal lands to which the plans apply.\n       Sec. 113. Citizen petitions for plan amendments or \n     revisions. Section 116 establishes deadlines for challenging \n     resource management plans, amendments, and revisions. This \n     section provides a procedure for citizens who believe a plan \n     has become inadequate after the deadlines have passed to seek \n     change in the plan and, if unsuccessful in obtaining change, \n     to challenge the plan. This section authorizes any person to \n     challenge a plan after the deadline solely on the basis of \n     new information, law, or regulation. The mechanism for \n     challenge is a petition for plan amendment or revision. The \n     Forest Service or BLM must accept or deny the petition within \n     90 days of receiving it. If the agency fails to respond to or \n     denies the petition, the petitioner may file suit immediately \n     against the plan. If the agency accepts the petition, the \n     process of amending or revising the plan begins immediately. \n     The agency's decision to accept or deny the petition is \n     subject to the consultation requirement of the Endangered \n     Species Act, but not subject to the environmental analysis \n     requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n       Sec. 114. Budget and cost disclosures. To better relate the \n     agencies' planning process with Congress' appropriations \n     process, this section requires that the President's budget \n     request to Congress include an appendix that discloses the \n     amount of funds that would be required to achieve 100% of the \n     annual outputs of goods and services in, and otherwise \n     implement fully, each Forest Service and BLM resource \n     management plan.\n       In the face of escalating planning costs, particularly \n     those associated with ecoregion assessments, this section \n     also requires the agencies to submit to Congress each year \n     an accounting of the total costs and cost per function of \n     procedure for each plan, amendment, revision or assessment \n     published in the preceding year.\n       Sec. 115. Monitoring and maintenance of planning. This \n     section contains several procedures intended to ensure that \n     the resource management plans are implemented. First, each \n     agency is required to include in each decision on a \n     management activity a statement that the decision contributes \n     to, or at a minimum does not preclude, achievement of the 4 \n     basic elements (goals, land allocations, outputs, and \n     environmental protection policies) of the applicable resource \n     management plan.\n       Second, this section requires use of funds from the \n     Monitoring Funds established by section 502 to monitor the \n     implementation of each resource management plan at least \n     biennially. The monitoring is to ensure that no goal, land \n     allocation, output, or policy of the plan is constructively \n     changed through a pattern of incompatible management \n     activities or of failures to undertake compatible management \n     activities. Whenever the agency finds such change has \n     occurred, it must take corrective management actions to \n     restore compliance with the plan, or amend or revise the plan \n     to accommodate the change. The monitoring also is to \n     determine whether circumstances or the federal lands have \n     changed and warrant adaptive management. If so, the agencies \n     are required to undertake the adaptive management--\n     immeidately if no elements would be changed thereby or after \n     amending or revising the plan if any element would be \n     changed.\n\n                     Part C. Challenges to planning\n\n       The purposes of this part are to ensure that challenges--\n     both administrative and judicial--of resource management \n     plans and management activities are brought more timely and \n     by those who truly participate in the agencies' processes. It \n     does not eliminate challenges or insulate agency decisions \n     from challenges.\n       Sec. 116. Administrative appeals. This section directs the \n     Forest Service and BLM to promulgate rules to govern \n     administrative appeals of decisions to approve resource \n     management plans, amendments, and revisions, and of decision \n     to approve, disapprove, or otherwise take final action on \n     management activities. While allowing the agencies \n     considerable discretion in rulemaking, this section does \n     provide that the rules must: (1) require that, in order to \n     bring an appeal, the appellant must have commented in writing \n     during the agency process on the issues or issues to be \n     appealed; (2) provide that administrative appeals of plans \n     may not challenge analyses or decisions assigned to \n     management activities under section 105 and administrative \n     appeals of management activities may not challenge analyses \n     or decisions assigned to plans under section 105; (3) provide \n     deadlines for bringing the administrative appeals (not more \n     than 120 days after a plan or revision decision, 90 days \n     after an amendment decision, and 45 days after a management \n     activity decision); (4) provide deadlines for agency \n     decisions on the appeals (not more than 180 days for appeal \n     of a plan or revision, 120 days for appeal of a plan \n     amendment, 90 days for appeal of a management activity, with \n     possible 15 days extension for each) and bar additional \n     levels of administrative appeal; (5) provide that in the \n     event of failure to render a decision by the applicable \n     deadline, the decision on which the appeal is based is to be \n     deemed a final agency action which allows the appellant to \n     file suit immediately; (6) require the agency to consider and \n     balance environmental and/or economic injury in deciding \n     whether to issue a stay pending appeal (or petition); (7) \n     provide that no stay may extend more than 30 days beyond a \n     final decision on an appeal of a plan, amendment, or revision \n     or on a petition or 15 days beyond a final decision on a \n     appeal of a management activity; and (8) establish categories \n     of management activities excluded from administrative appeals \n     (but not lawsuits) because of emergency, time-sensitive, or \n     exigent circumstances. This section is more comphrensive than \n     the section of the Fiscal Year 1993 Interior Appropriations \n     Act which concerned appeals only of management activities \n     (not management plans, amendments, and revisions) of the \n     Forest Service (not BLM). As this section supplants that more \n     limited provision, it repeals that provision when the new \n     Forest Service appeals rules required by this section become \n     effective.\n       Sec. 117. Judicial review. This section establishes venue \n     and standing requirements in, sets deadlines for, and \n     otherwise governs lawsuits over resource management plans, \n     amendments, revisions, and petitions and management \n     activities.\n       The venue for plan-related litigation is the U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the lands (or the \n     largest portion of the lands) to which the plan applies are \n     located. The venue for litigation over a management activity, \n     or petition for plan amendment or revision is the U.S. \n     District Court in the district where the lands (or the \n     largest portion of the lands) on which the activity would \n     occur or to which the plan applies are located.\n       This section also clarifies that standing and intervention \n     of right is to be granted to the fullest extent permitted by \n     the Constitution. This means those who are economically \n     injured cannot be barred by the non-constitutional, \n     prudential ``zone of interest''\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\n     test developed by the judiciary. This section also limits \n     standing to those who make a legitimate effort to resolve \n     their concerns during the agency's decisionmaking process and \n     do not engage in ``litigation by ambush'' by withholding \n     their concerns until after the agency decision is made. \n     Specifically, this section requires that the plaintiff must \n     have participated in the agency's decisionmaking process and \n     submitted a written statement on the issue or issues to be \n     litigated, and must have exhausted opportunities for \n     administrative review.\n       Deadlines for bringing suit are 90 days after the final \n     decision on the administrative appeal of a resource \n     management plan, amendment, or revision, and 30 days after a \n     final decision on the administrative appeal of a management \n     activity or final disposition of a petition for plan \n     amendment or revision. If the challenge involves a statute \n     (e.g., Endangered Species Act or Clean Water Act) which \n     requires a period of notice before filing a citizen suit, the \n     notice must be filed by the applicable deadline and suit must \n     be filed 7 days after the end of that notice period.\n       This section bars suits brought on the basis of new \n     information, law, or regulation until after a petition for \n     plan amendment or revision is filed and a decision is made on \n     it.\n       This section also clarifies that suits concerning resource \n     management plans and management activities are to be decided \n     on the administrative record.\n\n\n  TITLE II--COORDINATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS\n\n       Sec. 201. Purposes. The purposes of this title are to \n     eliminate primarily procedural conflicts among, and \n     coordinate, the various land management and environmental \n     laws without reducing--indeed enhancing--environmental \n     protection.\n       Sec. 202. Environmental analysis. This section describes \n     how compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act \n     (NEPA) will occur in resource management planning and \n     planning for management activities. It requires that an EIS \n     be prepared whenever a resource management plan is developed \n     or revised. (Plan amendments may have either an EIS or EA \n     depending on their significance.) This section also provides \n     that, for management activities, an EA ordinarily is \n     prepared. The EA for the management activity is to be tiered \n     to the EIS for the applicable resource management plan. The \n     agency may prepare a full EIS on a management activity if it \n     determines the nature or scope of the activity's \n     environmental impacts in substantially different from, or \n     greater than, the nature or scope of impacts analyzed in the \n     EIS on the applicable resource management plan.\n       Sec. 203. Wildlife protection. This section addresses the \n     relationship of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to federal \n     land planning and management. First, it provides a \n     certification procedure by which the Forest Service and BLM \n     can become certified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     conduct the consultation responsibilities normally assigned \n     to the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine \n     Fisheries Services by section 7 of the ESA. If they are \n     certified, the two land management agencies will have the \n     authority to prepare the biological opinions under the ESA \n     just as they now prepare EISs under NEPA.\n       Second, this section addresses situations in which the \n     resource management plan may have to undergo consultation \n     because of a new designation of an endangered or threatened \n     species or of a species' critical habitat, or new information \n     about an already designated species or habitat. This section \n     requires that a decision be reached as to whether \n     consultation is required on the plan within 90 days of the \n     new designation, and that any amendment to or revision of the \n     plan be completed within 12 or 18 months, respectively, after \n     the new designation. It also allows individual management \n     activities to continue under the plan while it is being \n     amended or revised, if those activities either separately \n     undergo consultation concerning the newly designated species \n     or habitat or are determined not to require consultation.\n       Sec. 204. Water quality protection. This section addresses \n     the relationship of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to federal land \n     planning and management. It provides that any management \n     activity that constitutes a non-point source of water \n     pollution is to be considered in compliance with applicable \n     CWA provisions if the State in which the activity will occur \n     certifies that it meets best management practices or that \n     functional equivalent. The agency, however, may choose not \n     to seek State certification and satisfy the separate \n     applicable CWA requirements.\n       Sec. 205. Air quality protection. This section addresses \n     the relationship of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to federal land \n     planning and management. It provides that, when a Forest \n     Service forest supervisor or BLM district manager finds that \n     a prescribed fire will reduce the likelihood of greater \n     emissions from a wildfire, and will be conducted in a manner \n     that minimizes impact on air quality to the extent \n     practicable, the prescribed fire is deemed to be in \n     compliance with applicable CAA provisions.\n       Sec. 206. Meetings with users of the Federal lands. This \n     section addresses the relationship of the Federal Advisory \n     Committee Act (FACA) to federal land planning and management. \n     It clarifies that the agencies may meet without violating \n     FACA with one or more: holders of, or applicants for, federal \n     permits, leases, contracts or other authorizations for use of \n     the federal lands; other persons who conduct activities on \n     the federal lands; and persons who own or manage lands \n     adjacent to the federal lands.\n\n\n            title iii--development of ecoregion assessments\n\n       Sec. 301. Purpose. The purpose of this title is to \n     authorize the new practice of preparing ecoregion \n     assessments, and to prescribe how those assessments will be \n     integrated into federal land planning and management.\n       Sec. 302. Authorization and notice of assessments. This \n     section authorizes the Forest Service and BLM to prepare \n     ecosystem assessments, which may include non-federal lands if \n     the Governors of the affected States agree. It requires the \n     agency to give the four Committees of Congress 90 days \n     advance notice before initiating an ecoregion assessment. The \n     notice must include: (1) a description of the land involved; \n     (2) the agency officials responsible; (3) the estimated costs \n     of and the deadlines for the assessment; (4) the charter for \n     the assessment; (5) the public, State, local government and \n     tribal participation procedures; (6) a thorough explanation \n     of how the ecoregion was identified and the attributes which \n     establish the ecoregion; and (7) detailed reasons for the \n     decision to prepare the assessment.\n       Sec. 303. Status, effect and application of assessment. \n     This section provides that the assessments must not contain \n     any decisions concerning resource management planning or \n     management activities. It then provides a procedure for \n     applying information or analysis contained in ecoregion \n     assessments to such planning and activities. It directs the \n     relevant agency to make a decision within 6 months of \n     completion of an ecoregion assessment whether any information \n     or analyses in the assessment warrants amendments to, or \n     revisions of, a resource management plan for the federal \n     lands to which the assessment applies. If the decision is \n     made for an amendment or revision, no management activity on \n     federal lands may be delayed or altered on the basis of the \n     assessment while the amendment or revision is prepared. \n     Finally, no federal official may use an assessment as an \n     independent basis to regulate non-federal lands.\n       Sec. 304. Applicability of other laws. As the ecoregion \n     assessments are nondecisional, this section provides that \n     they will not be subject to the consultation requirements of \n     the Endangered Species Act or the environmental requirements \n     of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n       Sec. 305. Report to Congress. This section directs the \n     agencies to report biennially to the four Committees of \n     Congress on ecosystem assessments, their implications for \n     federal land management, and any resource management plan \n     amendments or revisions based on assessments. The report also \n     must include the agencies' views of the benefits and \n     detriments of, and recommendations for improving, ecosystem \n     assessments.\n       Sec. 306. Pacific Northwest forest plan review. This \n     section provides for an independent review of the basis for, \n     and implementation of, President Clinton's Pacific Northwest \n     Forest Plan. It authorizes the appropriation of $5 million \n     for the Consortium of Regional Forest Assessment Centers, \n     through the University of Washington, to conduct the reviews \n     over a 6-month period. The review must include: (1) \n     assessments of the scientific information, assumptions, and \n     modeling both used and not used in the preparation of the \n     Plan; (2) an evaluation of whether the Plan will achieve both \n     its resource protection and resource production purposes, \n     goals, and objectives; (3) a review of the operational and \n     cost effectiveness of the Plan and any alternative \n     approaches; and (4) any recommendations for administrative or \n     legislative changes in the Plan. The Consortium's review is \n     to be submitted to the four Committees of Congress, without \n     submission (of it or any Consortium testimony) to any \n     federal officer or agency for prior approval, comments, or \n     review.\n\n\n    title iv--development of a global renewable resources assessment\n\n       Sec. 401. Purposes. The purpose of this title is to replace \n     the Renewable Resource Assessment and Renewable Resource \n     Program administered by the Forest Service under the Forest \n     and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 with a \n     Global Renewable Resources Assessment administered by an \n     independent National Council on Renewable Resources Policy.\n       Sec. 402. Global renewable resources assessment. This \n     section emphasizes the vital importance of renewable \n     resources to national and international social, economic, and \n     environmental well-being, and of the need for a long-term \n     perspective in the use and conservation of renewable \n     resources. To achieve that perspective, this section directs \n     that a Global Renewable Resources Assessment be prepared \n     every 5 years. The Assessment must include: (1) an analysis \n     of national and international renewable resources supply and \n     demand; (2) an inventory of national and international \n     renewable resources, including opportunities to improve their \n     yield of goods and services; (3) an analysis of environmental \n     constraints and their effects on renewable resource \n     production in the U.S. and elsewhere; (4) an analysis of the \n     extent to which the renewable resources management programs \n     of other countries ensure sustainable use and production of \n     such resources; (5) a description of national and \n     international research programs on renewable resources; (6) a \n     discussion of policies, laws, etc. that are\n\n[[Page S10329]]\n\n     expected to affect significantly the use and ownership of \n     public and private renewable resource lands; and (7) \n     recommendations for administrative or legislative \n     initiatives.\n       Sec. 403. National Council on Renewable Resources Policy. \n     This section establishes the National Council on Renewable \n     Resources Policy. Its functions are the preparation and \n     submission to Congress of the Global Renewable Resources \n     Assessment and the periodic submission to the Forest Service, \n     BLM, and four Committees of Congress of recommendations for \n     administrative and legislation changes or initiatives.\n       The Council has 15 members, 5 each appointed by the \n     President, President pro tempore of the Senate, and Speaker \n     of the House. The Chair is to be selected from the members. \n     This section has typical provisions for filling vacancies, \n     appointment of an Executive Director, compensation of the \n     members and the Executive Director, appointment of personnel, \n     authority to contract with federal agencies, and rulemaking \n     and other powers of the Council.\n       This section strives to ensure the independence of the \n     Council in two ways. First, it requires that the Council \n     submit its budget request concurrently to both the President \n     and the Appropriations Committees of Congress. Second, it \n     requires concurrent submission of the Assessment, analyses, \n     recommendations, and testimony to Executive Branch officials \n     or agencies and the four Committees of Congress. Finally, it \n     prohibits, and requirees the reporting of, any attempt by a \n     federal official or agency to require prior submission of the \n     Assessment, analyses, recommendations, or testimony for \n     approval, comments, or review.\n       Sec. 404. Repeal of certain provisions of the Forest and \n     Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act. This section \n     repeals those provisions of the Forest and Rangeland \n     Renewable Resources Planning Act that direct the Forest \n     Service to prepare a Renewable Resource Assessment and \n     Renewable Resource Program.\n\n\n                        title v--administration\n\n                           Part A. In general\n\n       Sec. 501. Confirmation of the Chief of the Forest Service. \n     This section provides for Senate confirmation of appointments \n     to the office of Chief of the Forest Service, thereby \n     establishing the same appointment procedures as those \n     applicable to the Director of the BLM. This section also sets \n     certain minimum qualifications for the appointee: (1) a \n     degree in a scientific or engineering discipline that is \n     revelant to federal land management; (2) 5 years or more \n     experience in decisionmaking concerning management, or \n     research concerning the management, of federal lands or other \n     public lands; and (3) 5 years or more experience in \n     administering an office or program with a number of employees \n     equal to, or greater than, the average number of employees in \n     national forest supervisors' offices.\n       Sec. 502. Monitoring funds. To encourage effective \n     management of the federal lands and provide a supplemental \n     funding source for important monitoring activities, this \n     section establishes a Public Lands Monitoring Fund for BLM \n     lands and Forest Lands Monitoring Fund for Forest Service \n     lands. The Funds would receive all monies collected from \n     federal lands in any fiscal year that are in excess of \n     federal land revenues projected in the President's baseline \n     budget (minus the State's and local government's share as \n     required by law). The monies in the Funds may be used, \n     without appropriations, to conduct the monitoring required by \n     section 115 or to fund the monitoring of the local, multi-\n     interest committees under section 110.\n       Sec. 503. Interagency transfer and interchange authority. \n     This section authorizes the BLM and Forest Service to \n     transfer between them adjacent lands not exceeding 5,000 \n     acres or exchange adjacent lands not exceeding 10,000 acres \n     per transaction. These transactions are: (1) to occur without \n     transfer of funds; (2) to be effective 30 days or more after \n     publication of Federal Register notice; (3) not to affect any \n     legislative designation for the lands involved; and (4) \n     subject to valid existing rights.\n       Sec. 504. Fees for processing records requests. To \n     discourage inordinately broad ``fishing expedition'' requests \n     under the Freedom of Information Act that severely tax agency \n     funding and personnel, this section prohibits the waiver or \n     reduction of fees under that Act for any records request to \n     the Forest Service or BLM that will cost in excess of $1000 \n     for a single request or for multiple requests of any one \n     party within a 6-month period.\n       Sec. 505. Off-Budget study. This section tasks the U.S. \n     General Accounting Office with the responsibility to conduct \n     a study for Congress of the feasibility of making the Forest \n     Service and BLM self-supporting by taking the agencies off-\n     budget (no appropriated funds) and returning to them all \n     revenues generated on federal lands (with mineral revenues \n     from national forest lands allocated to the Forest Service), \n     except revenues which by other laws are paid to States and \n     local governments.\n\n                       Part B. Non-Federal lands\n\n       This part seeks to increase the timeliness and cost \n     efficiency of Forest Service and BLM decisionmaking which \n     directly affects private lands.\n       Sec. 506. Access to adjacent or intermingled non-Federal \n     lands. This section establishes procedures for processing \n     applications for access to nonfederal land across federal \n     land as guaranteed by section 1323 of the Alaska National \n     Interests Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). First, this \n     section requires that the application processing be completed \n     within 180 days and, if it is not, the access be deemed \n     approved. It sets a 15-day deadline for notifying the \n     applicant whether the application is complete. This section \n     makes clear that the analyses conducted under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act are to \n     consider the effects of the construction, maintenance and use \n     of the access across the federal lands and not the use of the \n     nonfederal lands to be accessed. Finally, it clarifies that \n     any restrictions imposed on the access grant pursuant to \n     section 1323 of ANILCA may limit or condition the \n     construction, maintenance, or use of the access across the \n     federal lands, but not the use of the nonfederal lands to be \n     accessed.\n       Sec. 507. Exchanges of Federal lands for non-Federal lands. \n     This section establishes procedures for exchanges under, and \n     amends, section 206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976. As any management activity on any \n     federal lands or interests in lands newly acquired under an \n     exchange will be required to undergo full National \n     Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act review, \n     this section provides that on the exchange itself an EA \n     satisfies the environmental analysis requirements of section \n     102(2) NEPA and any consultation required under ESA will be \n     completed within 45 days instead of the 90-day period \n     provided by section 7 of ESA. Further, this section provides \n     that any exchange mandated by Congress requires no NEPA \n     documentation. This section also explicitly states that no \n     management activity may be undertaken on the newly acquired \n     federal lands or interests in land until NEPA and ESA are \n     fully complied with and, if necessary, the applicable \n     resource management plan is amended or revised. This section \n     requires that processing of the exchange must be completed \n     within one year of the date of submission of the exchange \n     application. Further, the nonfederal land or interests in \n     land in the exchange are to be appraised without restrictions \n     imposed by federal or State law to protect an environmental \n     value or resource if protection of that value or resource is \n     the very reason why the land is being acquired by the federal \n     government.\n       This section also allows the Forest Service and BLM to \n     offer for competitive bid the exchange of federal lands or \n     interests in land that meets certain conditions. It also \n     authorizes the agencies to identify early or ``prequalify'' \n     federal lands or interests in land for exchange. Further, \n     when an exchange involves school trust lands, the agency is \n     excused from conducting a cultural assessment under section \n     106 of the National Historic Preservation Act if it enters \n     into an agreement with the State that ensures State \n     protection after the exchange of archeological resources or \n     sites to the maximum extent practicable. Further, this \n     section authorizes the Forest Service to exchange federally \n     owned subsurface resources within the National Forest System \n     or acquired under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937.\n       This section establishes special funds with a cap of \n     $12,000,000 for the agencies to use, subject to \n     appropriations, for processing land exchanges (including \n     making cash equalization payments where required to equalize \n     values of exchange properties). Finally, the maximum value of \n     lands in an exchange which may be undertaken on the basis of \n     approximately equal value (rather than strictly equal value) \n     is raised from $150,000 to $500,000.\n\n                      Part C. The forest resource\n\n       This part contains 3 sections concerning sales of forest \n     products on federal lands, expediting and linking such sales \n     to forest health management activities.\n       Sec. 508. Forest health credits in sales of forest \n     products. This section provides the Forest Service and BLM \n     with an optional approach to undertaking forest health \n     management activities that would be impractical for the \n     agencies to accomplish under existing procedures or within \n     existing programs. Modelled on the provision for road \n     construction credits for purchasers of forest products sales \n     in the National Forest Roads and Trails Act (16 U.S.C. \n     535(2)), this approach permits the agencies to include new \n     provisions in the standard contract provisions for any \n     salvage sale of forest products or any sale of forest \n     products constituting a forest health enhancement project \n     under section 509. These new provisions would obligate the \n     purchaser to undertake certain forest health management \n     activities which could logically be performed as part of the \n     sale. In return, the purchaser receives ``forest health \n     credits'' to offset the cost of performing the activities \n     against the purchaser's payment for the forest products. \n     These forest health management activities are subject to the \n     same contractual requirements as all other harvesting \n     activities. Sale contracts with these forest health credits \n     provisions are to have terms of no more than 3 years.\n       Before forest health credits provisions can be included in \n     a contract of sale of forest products, the agency concerned \n     has to identify and select the specific forest health \n     management activities. Forest health activities would be \n     eligible for forest health credits if the agency concerned \n     finds that: (1) they would address the effects of the \n     operation of the sale or past sales, or involve vegetation \n     management within the sale area;\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\n     and (2) they could be accomplished most effectively when \n     performed as part of the sale contract, and would not likely \n     be performed otherwise. Forest health management activities \n     are defined to include thinning, salvage, stand improvement, \n     reforestation, prescribed burning or other fuels management, \n     insect or disease control, riparian or other habitat \n     improvement, or other activity which has any of 5 purposes: \n     improve forest health; safeguard human life, property, and \n     communities; protect other forest resources threatened by \n     adverse forest health conditions; restore the integrity of \n     ecosystems, watersheds, and habitats damaged by adverse \n     forest health conditions; or protect federal investments in \n     forest resources and future federal, State, and local \n     revenues.\n       Once the determination is made to add forest health \n     management activities requirements to a sale of forest \n     products, the specific activities are identified, and their \n     costs are appraised, the required activities and the forest \n     health credits assigned to those activities are identified in \n     the sale's advertisement and prospectus. (After the sale, the \n     agency, with the concurrence of a sale purchaser, can alter \n     the scope of the forest health management activities or \n     amount of credits when warranted by changed conditions.) This \n     section provides that sales with forest health credits need \n     not return more revenues than they cost and are not to be \n     considered in determining the revenue effects of individual \n     forest, Forest Service region, or national forest products \n     sales programs.\n       Appropriated funds can be used to offset the costs of \n     forest health management activities prescribed in a forest \n     products sale contract (typically when the total cost of such \n     activities would otherwise exceed the value of the offered \n     forest products materials or likely dampen competitive \n     interest in the sale), but only if those funds are derived \n     from the resource function or functions which would directly \n     benefit from the performance of the activities and are \n     appropriated in the fiscal year in which the sale is offered. \n     The amount of any appropriated funds to be paid for forest \n     health management activities under a sale contract also \n     must be announced in the sale's advertisement and \n     prospectus.\n       In order to provide for a smooth introduction of sale \n     contracts with forest health credits provisions, the agencies \n     are urged to employ, wherever feasible, the already developed \n     and tested Forest Service procedures and requirements for \n     sales of forest products providing purchaser credits for road \n     construction under the National Forest Roads and Trails Act. \n     However, unlike those road construction credits, the forest \n     health credits issued under this section could not become \n     ineffective. All forest health credits earned by the \n     purchaser are redeemable. Earned forest health credits can be \n     transferred to any other sale of forest products held by the \n     purchaser which is located in the same region of the Forest \n     Service or same jurisdiction of the BLM State office, as the \n     case may be. The credits are considered ``earned'' when the \n     purchaser satisfactorily performs the forest health \n     management activity to which the credits are assigned in the \n     sale advertisement. If the purchaser normally would be \n     required to pay for all the forest products materials prior \n     to completion of a forest health management activity or \n     activities assigned forest health credits, the purchaser \n     could elect to defer a portion of the final payment for the \n     harvested materials equal to the forest health credits \n     assigned to the activity.\n       This section sunsets in 5 years, but previously awarded \n     contracts for sale of forest products with forest health \n     credits provisions remain in effect under the terms of this \n     section after that time. To assist the Congress in \n     determining whether this section should be reenacted, the \n     Forest Service and BLM are required to monitor the \n     performance of sales contracts with forest health credits and \n     submit a joint report to Congress assessing the contracts' \n     effectiveness and whether continued use of such contracts is \n     advised.\n       Sec. 509. Special funds. This section gives permanent \n     status to funds for salvage sales of forest products of the \n     Forest Service and BLM and expands their purposes to allow \n     use of the fund monies for a full array of forest health \n     enhancement projects.\n       Sec. 510. Private contractors. To ensure that processing of \n     sales of forest products is accomplished in a timely manner \n     in an era of severe budget and personnel constraints, this \n     section encourages that the agencies, to the maximum extent \n     possible, use private contractors to prepare the sales. To \n     ensure the integrity of sale decisionmaking, this section \n     also requires the agencies to review the contract's work \n     before making any decisions on the sales and bars the \n     contractors from commenting on or participating in the sales' \n     decisions.\n       Sec. 511. Non-harvested forest product sales. This section \n     eliminates statutory barriers to those who wish to bid on \n     sales of forest products with the intention of preserving the \n     trees in place instead of harvesting them. For those opposed \n     to particular sales, this provides another avenue besides \n     litigation to challenge them.\n       Any sales of forest products may be purchased by parties \n     who elect not to harvest the trees (``election sales'') \n     except sales involving forest health credits under section \n     508, sales funded under the Special Funds established by \n     section 509, and sales which have as their primary purpose \n     ``vegetative management of lands management other than the \n     disposal of forest products,'' as defend by regulation. In \n     other words, when sales are offered in situations where \n     removal of trees is necessary for environmental protection \n     reasons, the purchaser must not have the option to leave the \n     trees in place; but, in situations where the sales are \n     offered principally for commodity purposes, that option \n     should be available.\n       The length of term of an election sale will correspond to \n     the expected silvicultural rotation in a sale designed to \n     generate even-aged stands or the period prior to the next \n     schedule entry for a sale designed to develop and maintain \n     uneven-aged stands. Upon payment of the prorata share of the \n     purchase price, with interest, the Forest Service or BLM can \n     terminate an election sale contract during the contract term \n     if the trees subject to the sale are substantially damaged by \n     fire, windthrow, disease, insect infestation, or other \n     natural event and the determination is made that harvesting \n     is necessary to avoid damage to adjacent areas.\n       The sale notice must notify prospective bidders if the sale \n     qualifies as an election sale and any bidder who intends to \n     elect non-harvesting must notify the Forest Service or BLM \n     with the bid submission. To ensure that all bids in an \n     election sale that has specifications for road construction \n     or reconstruction are equivalent for purposes of determining \n     the winning bidder, the Forest Service or BLM must deduct \n     from any bid which contains a non-harvesting notice the \n     estimated cost of such construction or reconstruction.\n       Sec. 512. Exemption from strict liability for recovery of \n     fire suppression costs. Section 504 of FLPMA directed the \n     Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations governing \n     liability of users of rights-of-way granted under that Act. \n     The subsequent regulations imposed liability without fault \n     for, among other things, the recovery of fire suppression \n     costs of up to $1 million (43 C.F.R. Sec. 2803.1-5). This \n     section would amend section 504 to relieve non-profit \n     entities, particularly entities that use the rights-of-way \n     for electrical transmission to parties who own equity \n     interests in the entities, from strict liability for such \n     costs. This provision does not relieve these entities from \n     liability for fire suppression costs when they are at fault.\n\n\n                        title vi--miscellaneous\n\n       Sec. 601. Regulations. This section requires the Forest \n     Service and BLM to promulgate rules to implement this \n     legislation within a year and a half of its enactment.\n       Sec. 602. Authorization of appropriations. This section \n     authorizes appropriations to implement this legislation for \n     10 fiscal years after enactment. It also sunsets at the same \n     time all other statutory authorizations for appropriations to \n     the Forest Service and BLM for management of the federal \n     lands.\n       Sec. 603. Effective date. This section provides that this \n     legislation will take effect upon its enactment and \n     admonishes that no decision or action authorized by this \n     legislation is to be delayed pending rulemaking.\n       Sec. 604. Savings clauses. This section ensures that \n     nothing in this legislation conflicts with the law pertaining \n     to the BLM's O lands in Oregon. Further, this section bars \n     construing any provision of this legislation as terminating \n     any valid lease, permit, right-of-way, or other right or \n     authorization of use of the federal lands, including any \n     Native American treaty right, existing upon enactment. \n     Finally, this section provides that all actions under this \n     legislation are subject to valid existing rights.\n       Sec. 605. Severability. This final section contains the \n     standard severability clause.\n\nSection-by-Section Description--Federal Lands Management Adjustment Act\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title. The short title of this bill is \n     ``Federal Lands Management Adjustment Act.''\n       Sec. 2. Purposes. The bill has two purposes. The first is \n     to encourage the development of alternative management \n     programs for federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) and Forest Service that are more innovative, \n     less costly, and more reflective of neighboring communities' \n     and publics' concerns and needs than the agencies' current \n     programs. The second purpose is to provide a procedure that \n     would grant authority to the States and nonprofit \n     organizations to implement those alternative management \n     programs on certain of those federal lands.\n       Sec. 3. Definitions. This section defines the terms used in \n     this legislation. For example, ``Committees of Congress'' \n     means the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Resources and Committee on \n     Agriculture of the House of Representatives.\n       Most important are the definitions of ``federal lands'' and \n     ``eligible federal lands'' for which temporary management \n     authority may be granted under procedures established by this \n     legislation. ``Federal lands'' are defined as lands managed \n     by the BLM (other than Outer Continental Shelf lands) and \n     lands in the National Forest System (including national \n     grasslands) managed by the Forest Service. All ``federal \n     lands'' are eligible for temporary management by nonprofit \n     organizations under applicable federal laws. Only \n     ``eligible federal lands'' are eligible for temporary \n     management by the States under State law. ``Eligible \n     federal lands'' are defined to include federal lands \n     within the National Wilderness Preservation System, \n     National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and National \n     Trails System, but only if they are\n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\n     managed in accordance with the federal laws establishing \n     those systems. To prevent fragmented management or \n     ``cherry picking'' of only the most economically \n     remunerative of federal lands by the States, this \n     definition excludes from ``eligible federal lands'' any \n     area that constitutes less than all the federal lands \n     within a BLM district or national forest and any BLM \n     district or national forest which generates the most \n     revenues in a State (unless the State has less than 2 BLM \n     districts or 2 national forests, or chooses to assume \n     jurisdiction over all BLM-managed federal lands or all \n     Forest Service-managed federal lands in the State).\n       Sec. 4. Transfer of management authority to States. This \n     section authorizes the transfer of temporary management \n     authority for eligible federal lands under the conditions, \n     and in accordance with the procedures, established in this \n     legislation.\n       Sec. 5. State application. This section provides the \n     procedure by which the States may initiate the process of \n     transferring temporary management authority over eligible \n     federal lands. The governor of a State (or, if another State \n     entity has authority under State law to acquire and convey \n     State land, then that agency, after consultation with the \n     governor) may submit an application to manage all or certain \n     eligible federal lands within the State to the four \n     Committees of Congress, to the Secretary of the Interior (for \n     BLM lands) and/or Secretary of Agriculture (for Forest \n     Service lands), and to any affected Indian tribes. Each State \n     is limited to one application every 2 years because, once the \n     State has submitted an application, it is prohibited from \n     submitting another application during the 2-year application \n     review period established by section 6. After the review \n     period is completed, however, the State can submit another \n     application regardless of whether the first application was \n     approved or denied by Congress in accordance with section 6. \n     The application must describe the eligible federal lands for \n     which management authority is sought, provide a summary and \n     the text of State laws under which the lands would be \n     managed, and describe the personnel and funding available for \n     managing the lands (including procedures to identify and \n     employ Forest Service or BLM personnel who are knowledgeable \n     about the specific lands and may seek employment if the \n     management authority is transferred).\n       Sec. 6. Procedures for granting State management authority. \n     This section provides the procedures to be performed by the \n     federal government to grant State management authority over \n     eligible federal lands. First, within 10 days of receiving a \n     State application, the Secretary or Secretaries must publish \n     notice of availability of the application in the Federal \n     Register. Second, within 90 days of receiving the \n     application, the Secretary or Secretaries must submit to the \n     four Committees of Congress and any affected Indian tribe an \n     advisory report on the application which assesses the \n     adequacy of the State law to manage the lands, the \n     qualifications of the State personnel assigned to manage the \n     lands, the adequacy of the State funding for managing the \n     lands, and any effect State management may have on Indian \n     tribes. The report must also provide any recommendations \n     which the Secretary or Secretaries have concerning the \n     application. Any affected Indian tribe is invited to submit \n     its own advisory report on the application within 60 days \n     after the submission of the Secretarial advisory report.\n       This section also makes it clear that no State can assume \n     temporary management authority over eligible federal lands \n     without an act of Congress. It further states that, if \n     Congress does not enact a law authorizing a State to assume \n     management authority over eligible federal lands identified \n     in a State application within 2 years from the date of \n     receipt of the application by the four Committees of \n     Congress, the application is deemed denied.\n       Sec. 7. State management of Federal lands. This section \n     provides the minimum general condition for State management. \n     (Of course, the individual acts authorizing State assumption \n     of management authority may contain further conditions.)\n       This section declares that the eligible federal lands are \n     to be managed by the State subject to valid existing rights \n     in accordance with applicable State law, the federal law \n     authorizing transfer of management authority, and other \n     federal law applicable to State (not federal) lands. The \n     exception is lands within the National Wilderness \n     Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, \n     and National Trails System; those lands must be managed in \n     accordance with the federal laws which established those \n     Systems. The State assumes all rights and responsibilities of \n     the United States under and for federal grazing permits, \n     mineral leases, contracts for sale of forest products, and \n     other authorizations for use of the affected federal lands in \n     existence on the date the management authority is \n     transferred. Those use authorizations will continue under \n     their provisions and applicable federal law until the end of \n     their terms (except the revenues will be paid to the States). \n     At the end of the term of the use authorization it will not \n     be extended or renewed; instead, the holder will be given \n     right-of-first-refusal for the issuance of an authorization \n     for the same use under State law.\n       Valid existing mining claims, however, remain under federal \n     authority until the mining claims are patented, abandoned, \n     declared invalid, or, at the election of the claimants, \n     converted to State leases or other disposition under State \n     law. The BLM and Forest Service must consult with the States \n     on federal minerals management decisions concerning valid \n     mining claims, and the States have authority to manage the \n     surface estate and dispose of rights and collect any revenues \n     from other minerals and rights.\n       The State would collect the revenues and fees that were \n     previously imposed by federal law from those federal permits, \n     licenses, etc., which remain in effect after State assumption \n     of management authority over eligible federal lands. \n     Otherwise, the State is free to impose its own revenue and \n     fee collection requirements for those lands under State law. \n     The State also may determine how the revenues and fees are to \n     be used and distributed in accordance with State law.\n       Other federal land law that continues to apply to the \n     eligible federal lands under State management is the access \n     provisions of section 1323, and the Alaska subsistence use \n     provisions of Title VIII, of the Alaska National Interests \n     Lands Conservation Act. Federal land law that ceases to apply \n     is the Payment In Lieu of Taxes Act and any other law that \n     provides payments to State or local governments to offset \n     declining revenues from federal lands.\n       Sec. 8. Authorization for transition appropriations. To \n     facilitate the transfer of management authority, this section \n     provides that amounts may be appropriated to a State which \n     has assumed management authority in the first, second, and \n     third fiscal years of State management equal to 75%, 50%, and \n     25%, respectively, of the appropriated funds expended in \n     managing the lands in the last fiscal year of federal \n     management. These funds must be reimbursed by the State to \n     the federal Treasury within 7 years after the State receives \n     them.\n       Sec. 9. Transition. This section provides for the transfer \n     of federal records, federal personal property, and unexpended \n     balances of federal appropriations and other funds to the \n     State upon enactment of a management authority transfer law. \n     It also authorizes the detailing to the State of federal \n     personnel for a year or less.\n       Sec. 10. Term of the State management. This section defines \n     the temporary nature of any transfer of management authority \n     for eligible federal lands to the States. It limits the term \n     of transfer to 10 years, unless provided otherwise in the \n     specific management authority transfer law. A State may seek \n     management authority for additional 10-year terms by filing \n     new applications which would be processed in accordance with \n     section 5. The State also may apply for ownership of eligible \n     federal lands after the initial 10-year management period. \n     The application for either continued State management or \n     State ownership of the eligible federal lands must include a \n     detailed report on the State's management performance on \n     those lands during the terminating 10-year period. Congress \n     would have to enact a law for ownership to pass, and this \n     legislation provides no guidance for that process.\n       Sec. 11. Return to Federal management. This section \n     provides guidance and procedures for the transfer of \n     management authority for federal lands back to the federal \n     government whenever a State chooses not to apply for, or \n     Congress fails to grant, continued management authority. The \n     guidance and procedures for reassumption of federal \n     management authority are the mirror-image of the guidance and \n     procedures provided in sections 7 and 9 for the transfer of \n     management authority to the States.\n       Sec. 12. Transfer of management authority to nonprofits. \n     This section provides authority to transfer temporary \n     management authority over federal lands to nonprofit \n     organizations. The conditions and procedures for transfer to \n     nonprofits are similar to those established in prior sections \n     for transfer to States, but with three significant \n     differences: First, all federal lands (not ``eligible \n     federal lands'' as in the case of the States) are eligible \n     for nonprofit management, with three limitations (not less \n     than all federal lands in any BLM district or national \n     forest, and not more than three BLM districts or three \n     national forests in the same general area). Second, the \n     applicable law remains federal law (not State law as in \n     the case of transfer to the States). The nonprofit, \n     however, need not comply with federal agency regulations \n     or policies if it otherwise complies with the applicable \n     federal laws. Furthermore, in its application for \n     management authority transfer, the nonprofit may identify \n     any provisions of federal law which it desires an \n     exemption or exception. And, if Congress grants the \n     exemption or exception in the legislation authorizing \n     transfer, the nonprofit need not adhere to those \n     particular provisions. Third, no opportunity to assume \n     ownership of federal lands is offered to nonprofits.\n       To qualify as a nonprofit organization which may submit a \n     management authority transfer application, the organization \n     must be a corporation or other entity that is organized under \n     the laws of the State in which all or a majority of the \n     relevant federal lands is located, has as its express purpose \n     the managing those lands, and is described in section \n     501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       The application for transfer must describe the federal \n     lands for which management authority is sought, document the \n     nonprofit's eligibility to submit an application and \n     qualifications to manage those federal lands, identify the \n     federal law exemptions or exceptions sought by the nonprofit, \n     describe the relationship the nonprofit intends to have\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\n     with BLM and Forest Service personnel then managing those \n     federal lands, and identify any personnel changes the \n     nonprofit expects to make in the first year it has management \n     authority. In addition to the entities to which the State \n     application must be sent, the nonprofit's application must \n     also be submitted to any affected local government.\n       As in the case of the States, Secretarial advisory reports \n     and Congressional enactment of legislation are required \n     before transfer of management authority occurs. If the \n     legislation is not enacted within two years of the submission \n     of the application, the application is deemed denied.\n       This section provides for payment to each nonprofit in the \n     first 3 years it manages the federal lands of 75%, 50%, and \n     25% of the funds that were appropriated for management of \n     those lands by the federal agency in the last fiscal year \n     prior to transfer. Although section 8 provides for identical \n     payments to States which have assumed management authority, \n     the State payments are authorized while the nonprofit \n     payments are required.\n       The nonprofit receives all revenues and fees from the \n     federal lands over which it has management authority. The \n     nonprofit will make all employment and compensation \n     decisions, subject to applicable federal law, concerning BLM \n     or Forest Service personnel who manage those lands. Personnel \n     from either agency on the date of transfer or newly employed \n     from either agency after the date of transfer will remain \n     federal employees. Additional personnel employed from outside \n     either agency after the date of transfer will be employees of \n     the nonprofit.\n       The provisions for length of management term, renewal for \n     another term, and return to federal management are \n     substantively the same as for the States.\n       Sec. 13. Venues. This section sets the venues for \n     litigation related to transfer of federal land management \n     authority under this legislation. Any litigation concerning \n     any action, other than actions concerning valid mining \n     claims, on eligible federal lands for which a State has \n     assumed management authority must be brought in the \n     appropriate State court. Any litigation concerning the \n     validity or Constitutionality of this legislation must be \n     brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of \n     Columbia and any litigation concerning any law transferring \n     management authority to either a State or a nonprofit \n     organization enacted pursuant to section 6 or section 12 must \n     be brought in the U.S. District Court for the district in \n     which all or a majority of the lands to which the law applies \n     is situated. This litigation must be brought within 60 days \n     of the date of enactment of this legislation or the \n     management authority transfer law, or be barred.\n       Sec. 14. Effect on other laws. This section makes it clear \n     that State or nonprofit assumption of management authority \n     over federal lands will not trigger changes in federal \n     policies, resource management plans, etc. applicable to other \n     federal lands in the State or region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/03/senate-section/article/S10319-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n  At the request Mr. Inouye, the names of the Senator from Washington \n[Mr. Gorton] and the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 623, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to \ndeem certain service in the organized military forces of the Government \nof the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts to \nhave been active service for purposes of benefits under programs \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                                S. 834.\n\n  At the request Mr. Harkin, the name of the Senator from New York [Mr. \nD'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 834, a bill to amend the Public \nHealth Service Act to ensure adequate research and education regarding \nthe drug DES.\n\n\n                                S. 836.\n\n  At the request Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch] was added as a cosponsor of S. 836, a bill to offer small \nbusinesses certain protections from litigation excesses.\n\n\n                                S. 852.\n\n  At the request Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. \nAkaka] and the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] were added as cosponsors \nof S. 852, a bill to establish nationally uniform requirements \nregarding the titling and registration of salvage, nonrepairable, and \nrebuilt vehicles.\n\n\n                                S. 953.\n\n  At the request Mr. Shelby, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 953, a bill to \nrequire certain Federal agencies to protect the right of private \nproperty owners, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 980\n\n  At the request Mr. Durbin, the name of the Senator from North Dakota \n[Mr. Dorgan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 980, a bill to require the \nSecretary of the Army to close the U.S. Army School of the Americas.\n\n\n                                S. 1096\n\n  At the request Mr. Kerrey, the names of the Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nReid] and the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1096, a bill to restructure the Internal Revenue \nService, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n  At the request Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Pennsylvania \n[Mr. Specter] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1115, a bill to amend \ntitle 49, United States Code, to improve one-call notification process, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n  At the request Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Virginia [Mr. \nRobb] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1173, a bill to authorize funds \nfor construction of highways, for highway safety programs, and for mass \ntransit programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1195\n\n  At the request Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. \nKerrey] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1195, a bill to promote the \nadoption of children in foster care, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1204\n\n  At the request Mr. Coverdell, the names of the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. Ford], the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne], the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Grams], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], and \nthe Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] were added as cosponsors of S. \n1204, a bill to simplify and expedite access to the Federal courts for \ninjured parties whose rights and privileges, secured by the U.S. \nConstitution, have been deprived by final actions of Federal agencies, \nor other government officials or entities acting under color of State \nlaw;

Mr. President, last week witnessed a crucial \ndevelopment in United States-Japan relations: the new guidelines for \ndefense cooperation between the United States and Japan were \npromulgated. This development will require further action before it \nbecome meaningful, however, as the Japanese Diet must pass legislation \nto make the guidelines operational.\n  The United States and Japan have maintained a strong and vital \nsecurity relationship for a half century. Since 1960, the Treaty of \nMutual Cooperation and Security has been at the center of that \nrelationship. That treaty also forms the core of our overall security \nstrategy for the Asia Pacific region.\n  For historical reasons, and reasons having to do with constitutional \ninterpretation, however, Japan's precise role in a regional crisis has \nbeen left largely undefined. With the end of the cold war and with \nraised tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the room for such ambiguity \nhas narrowed significantly. A scenario in which American and Korean \ntroops suffer casualties in a second Korean war while Japan debates \nwhat it could and could not do to assist in the effort would be a sure \nrecipe for a collapse in the United States-Japan relationship.\n  Therefore, I am pleased that the new defense guidelines provide us a \nclearer understanding of Japan's role in the event of a regional \ncrisis. Still, Japan must enact authorizing legislation to implement \nthe guidelines. In addition, I believe Japan should move to resolve \nproblematic constitutional issues having to do with collective self-\ndefense to ensure even greater clarity in the country's security role. \nAs I often said, the drafters of Japan's Constitution held that the \ndocument in no way undermined Tokyo's ability to participate in \nregional security arrangements or U.N. activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/03/senate-section/article/S10333-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING DR. HENRY BEECHER HICKS, JR.\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the times in which we live, \nand the challenges we face, require a special type of courage and \nvision to capture the attention of those we would lead into the next \nmillennium. As never before, leadership is being tested in the crucible \nof social and family crises. We have witnessed the virtual implosion of \nthe family unit. Violence encroaches on front yards and in school-\nyards. The most vulnerable among us--the aged, the infant, the ill--are \nall impotent in the battle to survive downsizing, right-sizing, and the \nbudget ax. Yet, the bull rush is on.\n  To be sure, enormous problems demand imaginative, visionary, and \ncourageous answers. Where do these answers come from? In the case of \nthe Nation's Capital--from behind the pulpit has stepped a champion for \nthe people--Henry Beecher Hicks, Jr. The citizens of the District of \nColumbia, and surrounding environs, are fortunate to have among them an \nextraordinary man whose vision is focused, and whose commitment to the \nuplifting of America is unequivocal.\n  By title, Dr. H. Beecher Hicks, Jr., is the senior minister of the \nMetropolitan Baptist Church. By practice, he is a relentless advocate \nfor the poor, consistent proponent of self-determination for the \nDistrict of Columbia, champion for children and quality education, \nhaven for the homeless, Samaritan for the sick, and a preacher's \npreacher who stands behind a pulpit adorned with a dove.\n  As an author and a teacher, he is respected in academic circles \nacross the Nation. Never compromising excellence, he demands rigorous \nstudy and mental acuity from his students. He is at home wherever he \nplaces his bible--from the ivy covered walls of a New England cathedral \nto a revival tent pitched on the muddy shores of the Mississippi. Dr. \nHicks is revered by those in front and behind the pulpit. Academically \ngrounded and oratorically gifted he is one of the Nation's foremost \npreachers.\n  On October 18, individuals from around the Nation, as well as those \nhe mentors and pastors, will gather in Washington, DC, to pay tribute \nto his 20 years of service as senior minister of the Metropolitan \nBaptist Church. I take this opportunity to join them in saluting this \noutstanding pastor and preacher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/03/senate-section/article/S10333-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CELEBRATING THE CITY OF HOLLAND'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I stand today to proudly recognize \nthe city of Holland's sesquicentennial anniversary. One hundred and \nfifty years ago this unique city was founded by a group of Dutch \nsettlers who envisioned a town similar to their native Holland. Today, \nthe city's rich Dutch heritage is still evident and continues to be a \nsource of great pride for residents.\n  The State of Michigan is home to not only Dutch ancestry but a wide \narray of different cultures and ethnicities. I strongly believe this \nmulticulturism serves Michigan well as a useful learning tool which \nlinks our communities together. Holland has built upon this notion by \nfully embracing its distinct ancestry and showcasing their Dutch \ntraditions for all to experience and enjoy.\n  On its 150th anniversary, Holland has pulled out all the stops to \nensure this special occasion does not slip away unnoticed. Befitting of \nthis celebration is a visit from Her Royal Highness Princess Margrite \nof the Netherlands whose presence will serve as a capstone to the \nfestivities. This momentous visit by the Princess and other dignitaries \nof The Netherlands offers a fine tribute to Holland and highlights the \ncity's strong Dutch roots.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to pay tribute to the city of Holland on \nits 150th anniversary, and extend my congratulations to Mayor McGeehan \nand the residents of Holland on this auspicious occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/03/senate-section/article/S10333-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10333-S10338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                      U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR TRAVEL FROM JAN. 11 TO JAN. 21, 1997                                                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Ted Stevens:                                                                                                                                                                            \n    Morocco................................
