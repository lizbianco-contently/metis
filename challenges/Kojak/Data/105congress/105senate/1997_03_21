A bill to amend chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, \nrelating to identity fraud, and for other purposes.\n\n\n        THE IDENTITY THEFT AND ASSUMPTION DETERRENCE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with increasing frequency, criminals are \nusing the Social Security numbers and other personal information of \nlaw-abiding citizens to assume their identity and take their money. \nIdentity fraud can be more serious than a criminal picking someone's \npocket and lifting cash or a credit card. Identity theft involves \ncriminals--who may have ties with international criminal syndicates--\nobtaining enough information on another person that they can open up \nnew credit card accounts in the law-abiding person's name. Some call \nidentity theft high-technology bank robbery. But law-enforcement \nofficials say committing identity fraud is easier than robbing a bank.\n  Identity fraud is one of the fastest growing financial crimes. An \nalarming 2,000 cases occur each week. Credit-card fraud losses--the \nmajor financial loss in personal-identity thefts--may amount to as much \nas $2 billion a year.\n  The statistics don't reveal the hardship these crimes can cause. \nImagine the anxiety of knowing that a criminal has been able to gain \nhold of your most personal identification information to open credit \ncards or apply for loans in your name. Even when fraudulent charges are \ncleared from a victim's financial records, he or she cannot be sure \nthat the perpetrator of the crime\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\nwon't strike again. Moreover, thousands can be spent to repair a \ntarnished credit rating. As the victim attempts to untangle the mess \ncaused by an identity thief, phone service may be disconnected or a \nvictim may face difficulty in securing a mortgage.\n  I would like to discuss the case of a constituent, Bob Hartle, who \nhas spent many hours working with my staff on the identity-theft \nproposal. Mr. Hartle served as the inspiration for an Arizona State law \nwhich, like the bill I am introducing, makes it a felony to steal \nanother person's identity. I thank Mr. Hartle for all of his help.\n  Bob Hartle's experience with an identity thief illustrates the \nseriousness of these crimes. The man who victimized Mr. Hartle was \nsentenced to 17 months in Federal prison for using false names--not Mr. \nHartle's; the criminal had misappropriated other law-abiding citizens' \nnames--in order to buy a gun and open up a credit card account. The \ncriminal possessed enough information to have a driver's license and \ncredit cards issued in Mr. Hartle's name. With these credit cards, the \ncriminal made purchases under Mr. Hartle's name that exceeded $100,000. \nWhile trashing Mr. Hartle's credit, and carrying a license as Mr. \nHartle in his wallet, the identity thief was busy committing serious \ncrimes. Mr. Hartle has spent over $10,000 trying to clear his good name \nand credit. He did not receive a restitution payment. The assistant \nU.S. attorney who prosecuted the case was quoted in a 1995 news story \nas saying that, ``Hartle may never get his full share from the courts. \n* * * All we can do is prosecute this under the powers given to us by \nlaw.''\n  Restitution was not available to him because, although many of the \nactions attendant upon identity theft do violate Federal law--that is, \ncredit card fraud, using false names--the actual assumption of \nanother's identity does not. Consequently, individual victims of these \noffenses are not entitled to restitution.\n  The criminal who ripped off Mr. Hartle's identity committed several \nsuch crimes throughout the United States before he was finally \napprehended. Acting alone, he caused great damage and hardship. But a \nnew breed of identity-fraud criminal has emerged that poses an even \ngreater threat to citizens. Sophisticated international criminal \nsyndicates, some of which have penetrated the Social Security \nAdministration and other agencies or companies with access to private \npersonal information, are engaging in identity-fraud scams of a \nmagnitude unimaginable a few years ago.\n  For example, the New York Post reported on December 29 that ``A \nbrazen city-based ring of con artists has been lifting personal \ninformation about hundreds of New Yorkers and using it to get credit \ncards and run up huge bills.'' This ring of Nigerian nationals applies \nfor credit cards with banks ``after snatching identifying data about \nunsuspecting victims.'' Identity-fraud syndicates such as these obtain \nSocial Security numbers and other personal information to perpetrate \ntheir scams in myriad ways: stealing mail; collecting credit-card \nreceipts; running license plates through DMV records; posing as a loan \nofficer and ordering a credit report; purchasing information from \ncorrupt governmental and private employees with access to personal \ninformation.\n  One of the reasons I elected to chair the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government \nInformation was to ensure that the law keep pace with technology. The \nSecret Service, which is responsible for investigating financial fraud \ncrimes, believes Federal fraud laws could be improved, to better \nprotect people like Mr. Hartle, and I thank the agency for all of its \nhelp in drafting the bill. Rather than amend the Federal fraud laws, my \nproposal creates a separate statute for identity-fraud offenses, which \nI am told will make this crime easier to investigate and prosecute. \nWhen the fraud laws were drafted, the law-enforcement community was \ncontending with counterfeiters who manufactured, distributed, and used \nID's that were pieces of paper. Identity-fraud schemes were not nearly \nas prevalent in that pre-electronic era as they are today.\n  As mentioned above, individual victims of fraud offenses--who, like \nMr. Hartle, are generally not eligible for restitution under current \nlaw--could receive restitution under my proposal. Additionally, the act \nallows law enforcement to seize equipment--contraband--used to produce \nfalse documents. Penalties are scaled to reflect the number of victims, \nnot just the dollar amount of the fraud.\n  Moreover, the proposal requires the Secret Service to collect \nstatistics on identity fraud offenses. Statistics on identity fraud are \nrough; we need to know more about the extent of the problem.\n  And finally, the bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nChairman of the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a comprehensive \nstudy of: the nature, extent, and causes of identity fraud; the threat \nposed by identity fraud to financial institutions and payment systems; \nand the threat to consumer safety and privacy. The results of the study \nwill be submitted to Congress with specific recommendations for \nlegislation to address the problem of identity theft. This study is \nvery important. Access to confidential information facilitates credit-\ncard identity assumption scams. With identity fraud rising, we must \ncontinually reevaluate statutes regulating consumer privacy.\n  This is the other side of the coin when it comes to deterring this \nkind of fraud. We need to go after criminal activity when it occurs, \nbut we also must prevent the careless circulation of personal \ninformation to begin with.\n  In fact, action has already been taken by Congress to better protect \nprivate identity information. In September, the Driver's Privacy \nProtection Act of 1994 goes into effect to restrict release and use of \ncertain personal information from State motor vehicle records. Other \nefforts are underway. In August, the FTC--responding to suggestions \nthat Social Security numbers were easily available on the Internet--\nheld a staff meeting to exchange information on consumer identity \nfraud, and following the meeting suggested that Congress consider \nlegislation to tighten restrictions on the release of private identity \ninformation.\n  The bill I am introducing today is targeted at the criminals: those \nwho perpetrate identity theft crimes. Congress will need to consider \nother measures seeking the assistance of the custodians of personal \nidentity information to make identity theft crimes more difficult to \ncommit. I believe that my bill represents a solid first effort to \ncombat identity theft, and I request that my colleagues support the \nIdentity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Bond, and Mr. \n        Bennett):\n  S. 513. A bill to reform the multifamily rental assisted housing \nprograms of the Federal Government, maintain the affordability and \navailability of low-income housing, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n THE MULTIFAMILY ASSISTED HOUSING REFORM AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, on behalf of \nSenators D'Amato, Bond, and Bennett, the Multifamily Assisted Housing \nReform and Affordability Act of 1997. This bill is a serious effort to \nreform the Nation's assisted and insured multifamily housing portfolio \nin a responsible manner that balances both fiscal and public policy \ngoals. This legislation will save scarce Federal subsidy dollars while \npreserving the affordability and availability of decent and safe rental \nhousing for lower income households.\n  About 20 years ago, the Federal Government encouraged private \ndevelopers to construct affordable rental housing by providing mortgage \ninsurance through the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and rental \nhousing assistance through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's [HUD] project-based section 8 program. In addition, tax \nincentives for the development of low-income housing were provided \nthrough the Tax Code until 1986.\n  This combination of financial incentives resulted in the creation of \nthousands of decent, safe, and affordable housing properties. However, \nflaws in the section 8 rental assistance program allowed owners to \nreceive more Federal dollars in rental subsidy than were necessary to \nmaintain the properties as\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\ndecent and affordable rental housing, and we are beginning to pay the \nprice for excessive rental subsidies. A recent HUD study found that \nalmost two-thirds of assisted properties have comparable rents greater \nthan comparable market rents, in some cases almost 200 percent of area \nmarket rents.\n  In addition, like the severely distressed public housing stock, some \nof these section 8 projects have become targets and havens for crime \nand drug activities. Thus, in some cases, taxpayers are paying costly \nsubsidies for inferior housing. We believe that a policy that pays \nexcessive rental subsidies for housing is not fair to the American \ntaxpayer, nor can it be sustained in the current budget climate.\n  It is widely understood that there is a funding crisis in the renewal \nof HUD's expiring section 8 rental assistance contracts. Indeed, HUD \nSecretary Cuomo has called the section 8 contract renewal problem ``the \ngreatest crisis HUD has ever faced.'' The contract renewal problem \ninvolves all of HUD's section 8 inventory, both project-based and \ntenant-based--in all more than 3 million units of low-income housing. \nThe new budget authority needed to renew expiring contracts at current \nlevels will grow from $3.6 billion in the current fiscal year to almost \n$10 billion in fiscal year 1998 to an estimated $18 billion in fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  Over the next several years, a majority of the section 8 contracts on \nthe 8,500 FHA-insured properties will expire. If contracts continue to \nbe renewed at existing levels, the cost of renewing these contracts \nwill grow from about $2 billion in fiscal year 1998 to $5.2 billion in \nfiscal year 2002 and more than $7.7 billion 10 years from now. Thus, \nthe project-based section 8 inventory, which is addressed in this \nlegislation, is a significant part of the overall section 8 renewal \nproblem.\n\n  The implications of not renewing project-based section 8 contracts \nare potentially devastating. Without renewals, most of the FHA-insured \nand section 8-assisted multifamily mortgages--with an unpaid principal \nbalance of $18 billion--will default and result in claims on the FHA \ninsurance funds. This could lead to more severe actions, such as \nforeclosure, which will adversely affect residents and communities.\n  Federally assisted and insured housing serves almost 1.6 million \nfamilies with an average annual income of $7,000. About half of the \nhouseholds are elderly or contain persons with disabilities. Many of \nthese developments are located in rural areas where no other rental \nhousing exists. Some of these properties serve as anchors of \nneighborhoods where the economic stability of the neighborhood is \ndependent on the vitality of these properties.\n  The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act \naddresses the problem of expiring section 8 project-based assistance \ncontracts through a new, comprehensive structure that provides a wide \nvariety of tools to address the spiraling costs of section 8 assistance \nwithout harming residents or communities. The bill will reduce the \nlong-term ongoing costs of Federal subsidies by reducing rents to a \nlevel that more closely approximates market area rents and \nrestructuring the underlying debt insured by the FHA. The bill also \ncontains a provision that will minimize the potential adverse tax \nconsequences to owners that result from debt restructuring.\n  The bill also recognizes that HUD lacks the staffing capacity and \nexpertise to oversee effectively its portfolio of multifamily housing \nproperties or to administer a debt restructuring program. Indeed, one \nof the principal problems with developing a portfolio restructuring \nproposal has been the lack of good information on the characteristics \nor the condition of the properties in FHA's multifamily mortgage \nportfolio. Accordingly, the bill would transfer the functions and \nresponsibilities of the restructuring program to capable State and \nlocal housing finance agencies, who would act as participating \nadministrative entities in managing this program.\n  The bill provides incentives to administering entities to ensure that \nthe American taxpayer is paying the least amount of money required to \nprovide decent, safe, and affordable housing. Any amount of incentives \nprovided to State and local entities would only be used for low-income \nhousing purposes.\n  Owners who clearly violate housing quality standards would no longer \nbe tolerated. The bill screens out bad owners and managers and \nnonviable projects from the inventory and provides tougher and more \neffective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of FHA \ninsurance and assisted housing programs.\n  Last, the bill provides tools to recapitalize the assisted stock that \nsuffers from deferred maintenance. It provides the opportunity for \ntenants, local governments, and the community in which the project is \nlocated to participate in the restructuring process in a meaningful \nway. Residents would also be empowered through opportunities to \npurchase properties.\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize how important it is to \naddress this issue this year. Delays will only harm the assisted \nhousing stock, its residents and communities, and the financial \nstability of the FHA insurance funds. I would add that, as we face an \nexplosion in the cost of section 8 contract renewals, we cannot afford \nto pay more than is reasonable to renew expiring contracts. There is \nstrong support on both sides of the aisle to renew all expiring section \n8 contracts next year. But to an extent, the future credibility of the \nsection 8 program, which is so important to 3 million families, depends \non our ability to control costs today.\n  This legislation will protect the Federal Government's investment in \nassisted housing and ensure that participating administrative entities \nare held accountable for their activities. It is also our goal that \nthis process will ensure the long-term viability of these projects with \nminimal Federal involvement. It is a sincere effort to reduce the cost \nto the Federal Government while recognizing the needs of low-income \nfamilies and communities throughout the Nation.\n  In closing, I also want to express my hope that the administration \nwill begin to play an active and constructive role in dealing with this \nsection 8 issue. For the last 2 years, we have waited for a concrete \nadministration proposal for portfolio restructuring, but we have \nreceived nothing but a series of concept papers and statements of \nprinciples. We cannot wait much longer for the administration to come \nto the table with a serious proposal to deal with a critical budget \nproblem that could affect all of HUD's programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, it is \n     estimated that--\n       (A) the insured multifamily housing portfolio of the \n     Federal Housing Administration consists of 14,000 rental \n     properties, with an aggregate unpaid principal mortgage \n     balance of $38,000,000,000; and\n       (B) approximately 10,000 of these properties contain \n     housing units that are assisted with project-based rental \n     assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act \n     of 1937;\n       (3) FHA-insured multifamily rental properties are a major \n     Federal investment, providing affordable rental housing to an \n     estimated 2,000,000 low- and very low-income families;\n       (4) approximately 1,600,000 of these families live in \n     dwelling units that are assisted with project-based rental \n     assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act \n     of 1937;\n       (5) a substantial number of housing units receiving \n     project-based assistance have rents that are higher than the \n     rents of comparable, unassisted rental units in the same \n     housing rental market;\n       (6) many of the contracts for project-based assistance will \n     expire during the several years following the date of \n     enactment of this Act;\n       (7) it is estimated that--\n       (A) if no changes in the terms and conditions of the \n     contracts for project-based assistance are made before fiscal \n     year 2000, the cost of renewing all expiring rental \n     assistance contracts under section 8 of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 for both project-based and tenant-based \n     rental assistance will increase from approximately \n     $3,600,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to over $14,300,000,000 by \n     fiscal year 2000 and some $22,400,000,000 in fiscal year \n     2006;\n       (B) of those renewal amounts, the cost of renewing project-\n     based assistance will increase from $1,200,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 1997 to almost $7,400,000,000 by fiscal year 2006; and\n       (C) without changes in the manner in which project-based \n     rental assistance is provided, renewals of expiring contracts \n     for project-based rental assistance will require an \n     increasingly larger portion of the discretionary budget \n     authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     in each subsequent fiscal year for the foreseeable future;\n       (8) absent new budget authority for the renewal of expiring \n     rental contracts for project-based assistance, many of the \n     FHA-insured multifamily housing projects that are assisted \n     with project-based assistance will likely default on their \n     FHA-insured mortgage payments, resulting in substantial \n     claims to the FHA General Insurance Fund and Special Risk \n     Insurance Funds;\n       (9) more than 15 percent of federally assisted multifamily \n     housing projects are physically or financially distressed, \n     including a number which suffer from mismanagement;\n       (10) due to Federal budget constraints, the downsizing of \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and \n     diminished administrative capacity, the Department lacks the \n     ability to ensure the continued economic and physical well-\n     being of the stock of federally insured and assisted \n     multifamily housing projects; and\n       (11) the economic, physical, and management problems facing \n     the stock of federally insured and assisted multifamily \n     housing projects will be best served by reforms that--\n       (A) reduce the cost of Federal rental assistance, including \n     project-based assistance, to these projects by reducing the \n     debt service and operating costs of these projects while \n     retaining the low-income affordability and availability of \n     this housing;\n       (B) address physical and economic distress of this housing \n     and the failure of some project managers and owners of \n     projects to comply with management and ownership rules and \n     requirements; and\n       (C) transfer and share many of the loan and contract \n     administration functions and responsibilities of the \n     Secretary with capable State, local, and other entities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to preserve low-income rental housing affordability and \n     availability while reducing the long-term costs of project-\n     based assistance;\n       (2) to reform the design and operation of Federal rental \n     housing assistance programs, administered by the Secretary, \n     to promote greater multifamily housing project operating and \n     cost efficiencies;\n       (3) to encourage owners of eligible multifamily housing \n     projects to restructure their FHA-insured mortgages and \n     project-based assistance contracts in a manner which is \n     consistent with this title before the year in which the \n     contract expires;\n       (4) to streamline and improve federally insured and \n     assisted multifamily housing project oversight and \n     administration;\n       (5) to resolve the problems affecting financially and \n     physically troubled federally insured and assisted \n     multifamily housing projects through cooperation with \n     residents, owners, State and local governments, and other \n     interested entities and individuals; and\n       (6) to grant additional enforcement tools to use against \n     those who violate agreements and program requirements, in \n     order to ensure that the public interest is safeguarded and \n     that Federal multifamily housing programs serve their \n     intended purposes.\n\n     SEC. 102.

or\n       (3) the project has an expiring contract under section 8 of \n     the United States Housing Act of 1937 but does not qualify as \n     an eligible multifamily housing project pursuant to section \n     102(2) of this title.\n\n     SEC. 105.

During the period in which the \n     first mortgage remains outstanding, no payments of interest \n     or principal shall be required on the second mortgage. The \n     second mortgage shall be assumable by any subsequent \n     purchaser of any multifamily housing project, pursuant to \n     guidelines established by the Secretary.

The owner shall \n     begin repayment of the second mortgage upon full payment of \n     the first mortgage in equal monthly installments in an amount \n     equal to the monthly principal and interest payments formerly \n     paid under the first mortgage.

If the owner \n     does not agree to extend the contract, tenant-based \n     assistance will be made available to tenants.\n       Each mortgage restructuring and rental assistance \n     sufficiency plan is intended to: (1) restructure project-\n     based rents; (2) require the owner to submit a housing needs \n     assessment; (3) require the owner to provide or contract for \n     competent management of the property; (4) require the owner \n     to rehabilitate, maintain adequate reserves and to maintain \n     the project in decent and safe condition; (5) require the \n     owner to maintain project affordability for 20 years; and (6) \n     meet subsidy layering guidelines established by HUD.\n       Rent levels. Projects with subsidy contract rents above \n     fair market rent would be restructured in a manner that would \n     reduce the rents by restructuring the underlying debt. Rents \n     would be ``marked'' to comparable market rents where \n     comparable properties exist or at least 90 percent of fair \n     market rents (FMR) if comparable properties do not exist.\n       In some cases (such as properties that provide special \n     services to elderly and disabled households or because of \n     local market rent conditions), even if the debt is \n     restructured, setting rent levels at 90 percent of FMR or \n     comparable market levels may be inadequate to cover the costs \n     of operation. In such cases, rent levels can be set at up to \n     120 percent of FMR. In any fiscal year, a PAE may approve \n     exception rents on not more than 20 percent of all units in \n     its geographic jurisdiction. The 20 percent level may be \n     increased, subject to a waiver from HUD.\n       Restructuring tools. An approved mortgage restructuring and \n     sufficiency plan may include one or more of the following: \n     (1) full or partial payment of claim; (2) refinancing on all \n     or part of the debt on a project; (3) mortgage insurance (FHA \n     insurance, reinsurance or other credit enhancement \n     alternatives); (4) credit enhancement; (5) compensation of \n     PAEs; (6) residual receipts; (7)\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\n     rehabilitation requirements; and (8) mortgage restructuring.\n       Tax issues. Debt restructuring results in an event that \n     reduces the outstanding mortgage that is owed by owners and \n     investors. This reduction in the mortgage amount will result \n     in a tax liability referred to as ``cancellation of \n     indebtedness,'' or COD. COD is generally treated as ordinary \n     taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code. The bill \n     addresses this problem by bifurcating the existing mortgage \n     into two obligations. The first piece would be determined on \n     the amount of the mortgage that could be supported by the \n     rental income stream. Payment on the second piece--the \n     difference between the first mortgage and the mortgage \n     balance--would be deferred until the second mortgage is paid \n     off.\n       Rehabilitation. Up to $5,000 in rehabilitation costs for \n     each project-based unit can be included within the \n     restructuring. The owner must contribute a minimum of 25 \n     percent of the amount of rehabilitation assistance received.\n       Troubled properties and noncompliant owners. Nonviable \n     housing projects and owners not meeting basic program \n     requirements would be ineligible to participate in the \n     renewal and debt restructuring process. Potential \n     alternatives in such instances could include demolition or \n     change of ownership to other entities, including nonprofits \n     or residents. Alternative housing would be provided to \n     affected residents in the case of demolition.\n       Tenant and community participation and capacity building. \n     Procedures will be established by HUD to provide opportunity \n     for tenants, local governments and community in which the \n     project is located to participate in the restructuring \n     process. Such participation can include timely access to \n     relevant information and the opportunity to analyze such \n     information and provide comments to the PAE or to HUD on all \n     aspects of the portfolio restructuring agreement. In \n     addition, HUD is authorized, subject to appropriations, to \n     provide up to $10 million annually to fund tenant groups, \n     nonprofits and public entities for capacity building and \n     technical assistance.\n       Enforcement Authority. The bill will minimize the incidence \n     of fraud and abuse of Federally assisted programs through: \n     (1) expanding HUD's ability to impose sanctions on lenders; \n     (2) expanding equity-skimming prohibitions; and (3) \n     broadening the use of civil money penalties.\n       Regulations. Interim regulations are to be developed within \n     six months of passage of this Act: final regulations are to \n     be developed within one year of enactment.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the Multifamily \nAssisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. This bill is \nvirtually identical to S. 2042, which was introduced in the last \nCongress and goes a long way toward developing a constructive and \ncomprehensive section 8 mark-to-market contract renewal program for \nreducing the costs of expiring project-based section 8 contracts, \nlimiting the financial exposure of the FHA multifamily housing \ninsurance fund for FHA-insured section 8 projects, and preserving, to \nthe maximum extent possible, the section 8 project-based housing stock \nfor very low- and low-income families. This legislation builds on a \ndemonstration enacted as part of the VA/HUD Fiscal Year 1997 \nappropriations bill which provided HUD with flexible authority to \naddress the costs and the housing issues posed by this stock.\n  I congratulate Senators D'Amato, Mack, and Bennett for their \ncontribution and commitment to this comprehensive legislation, as well \nas their commitment to finding a bipartisan approach to the many \ndifficult issues associated with the renewal of oversubsidized section \n8 project-based contracts. This legislation is a meaningful step in \ndeveloping a reasonable policy toward the concerns raised by these \nexpiring section 8 project-based contracts.\n  Over the last 25 years, a number of HUD programs were established for \nthe construction of affordable, low-income housing by providing FHA \nmortgage insurance while financing the cost of the housing through \nsection 8 project-based housing assistance. Currently, there are some \n8,500 projects with almost 1 million units that are both FHA-insured \nand whose debt service is almost totally dependent on rental assistance \npayments made under section 8 project-based contracts. Most of these \nprojects serve very low-income families, with almost 50 percent of the \nstock serving elderly and disabled families.\n  The crisis facing this housing stock is that the section 8 project-\nbased housing assistance was initially budgeted and appropriated \nthrough 15- and 20-year section 8 project-based contracts that are now \nexpiring and for which contract renewal is prohibitively expensive. For \nexample, at least 75 percent of this housing stock have rents that \nexceed the fair market rent of the local area.\n  Since current law generally prohibits HUD from renewing these section \n8 contracts at rents above 120 percent of the fair market rent, in many \ncases, the failure to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts \nat existing rents will leave owners without the financial ability to \npay the mortgage debt on these projects. This means that owners likely \nwill default on their FHA-insured mortgage liabilities, resulting in \nFHA mortgage insurance claims totaling some $18 billion and \nforeclosures. HUD would then own and be responsible for managing these \nlow-income multifamily housing projects. This bill is intended to avoid \nthis potential crisis through a fiscally responsible and housing \nsensitive strategy.\n  In addition, the cost of the section 8 contracts on these projects \nreemphasizes the difficult budget and appropriation issues facing the \nCongress. In particular, according to HUD estimates, the cost of all \nsection 8 contract renewals, both tenant-based and project-based, will \nrequire appropriations of about $3.6 billion in Fiscal Year 1997, $10.2 \nbillion in Fiscal Year 1998, and over $16 billion in Fiscal Year 2002. \nIn addition, the cost of renewing the section 8 project-based contracts \nwill grow from $1.2 billion in Fiscal Year 1997 to almost $4 billion in \nFiscal Year 2000, and to some $8 billion in 10 years.\n  Since the HUD appropriations account cannot sustain these exploding \ncosts, this legislation is intended to be a comprehensive response \nwhich will reduce the financial cost and exposure to the Federal \nGovernment and preserve this valuable housing resource. The Senate bill \nwould generally preserve this low-income housing by using various tools \nto restructure these multifamily housing mortgages to the market value \nof the housing with resulting reductions in section 8 costs.\n  I also am troubled by some of the other section 8 mark-to-market \nproposals being promoted, including the position which has been taken \nby HUD in the past which, in general, opposes preserving this housing \nas FHA-insured or as assisted through section 8 project-based \nassistance, including the elderly assisted housing, in favor of \nvouchers. This position is very questionable, and I emphasize that it \nis widely opposed by the housing industry and tenant groups and \nadvocates. I emphasize that we want to work with HUD on these issues, \nand that in appropriate circumstances vouchers may be the right \ndecision if we can balance this decision by ensuring that by \nrestructuring a mortgage to the market level that we also can require \nlong-term affordablility of this housing for very low- and low-income \nfamilies. This could mean more choice for low-income families and the \navailability of more affordable, low-income housing. I believe that a \nnumber of creative and positive approaches will need to be reviewed as \nthis legislation is considered.\n\n  I highlight the underlying principles of the bill which would \nauthorize the establishing of participating administrative entities \n[PAEs] which would generally be a public agency, with a first \npreference that a PAE be a State housing finance agency or, second, a \nlocal housing agency. These entities would be contracted by HUD to \ndevelop work-out plans in conjunction with owners of FHA-insured \nprojects with expiring, oversubsidized section 8 contracts. Each PAE \nwould develop mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency \nplans as work-out instruments to reduce the section 8 subsidy needs of \nprojects through mortgage restructuring.\n  The basic tool provided in the draft bill, and the likely key to any \nsuccessful strategy to preserve this housing, is to authorize the \nrestructuring of the mortgage debt on these oversubsidized section 8 \nmultifamily housing projects. In particular, the bill would allow the \nrestructuring of these high-cost mortgages with a new first mortgage \nreflecting, generally, the market value of a project, and a soft second \nmortgage held by HUD or financed by the private sector, with interest \nat the applicable Federal rate, covering the remainder of the original \nmortgage debt and payable upon disposition or upon full payment of the \nfirst mortgage. This provision will reduce the cost of section 8 \nassistance and minimize any loss to the FHA\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nmultifamily insurance fund. In addition, this approach ensures that \nthere is no taxable event by virtue of the mortgage restructuring.\n  I also think it would be beneficial to look at some kind of exit tax \nrelief to encourage owners, especially limited partners, to divest \ntheir interest in these properties, to encourage new investment in and \nthe revitalization of these properties. I am hopeful that the \nadministration will help craft some form of tax relief that balances \nthe need of the Government to preserve this housing for low-income use \nat an affordable and reasonable cost to both the Government and low-\nincome families.\n  Finally, I emphasize that the time to act is now. I sponsored a \nsection 8 mark-to-market demonstration which was included in the VA/HUD \nFiscal Year 1997 appropriations bill which is similar to this \nlegislation and represents an interim approach to the section 8 mark-\nto-market contract renewal issue. I am disappointed that HUD has failed \nto implement this demonstration because we need the information to \ncontinue to make informed policy decisions with regard to this issue. \nNevertheless, the appropriation language indicates my strong belief \nthat we can no longer afford, as a matter of housing policy and fiscal \nresponsibility, to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts at \nthe existing, over-market rents. I strongly believe that section 8 \nreform legislation should be acted on by the authorizing committees \nbefore the end of the fiscal year, with the full benefit of hearings \nand discussion on these very difficult policy issues.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the legislation and \nhope that the Housing Subcommittee and Banking Committee can act in an \nexpeditious manner on this measure. I emphasize the need to work \ntogether and I look forward to moving this legislation through Congress \nand onto the desk of the President.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Multifamily \nAssisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. This important \npiece of legislation will address a serious affordable housing crisis \nby restructuring the Department of Housing and Urban Development's \n[HUD] Federal Housing Administration [FHA] insured and section 8 \nassisted multifamily housing portfolio.\n  I wish to thank my friend and colleague Senator Connie Mack, chairman \nof the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and Community \nOpportunity, for his extraordinary leadership in crafting this measured \nand thoughtful legislative initiative which deals with a vexing and \ncomplicated issue--the approaching crisis in HUD section 8 contract \nrenewals.\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Kit Bond, the chairman of the \nVA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, who has also played a critical role \nin the development of this bill. I commend him for the significant \ncontributions he has made in addressing this crisis. In addition, I \nwould like to express my appreciation to Senator Robert Bennett for his \ndiligence in confronting this complex issue.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is very similar to S. 2042, \nintroduced by Senators Mack, Bond, Bennett, and myself in August 1996. \nThis bill constitutes a major step toward reducing the costs of the \nSection 8 Program, and will allow for existing residents to be fully \nprotected and for contracts to be renewed.\n  HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, in recent testimony before the House \nGovernment Reform and Oversight Committee's Human Resources \nSubcommittee, described the increasing costs of renewing expiring \nsection 8 contracts as, ``the greatest crisis HUD has ever faced.'' I \nmust concur with Mr. Cuomo. Let me briefly describe some of the growing \ncosts associated with this program. In fiscal year 1997, Congress \nappropriated $3.6 billion for the renewal of expiring section 8 \ncontracts. Large numbers of long-term section 8 contracts, which were \nwritten as long as 5 to 20 years ago, will expire this year.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's latest estimates, the \nbudget authority required to renew these contracts will increase to \n$10.2 billion in fiscal year 1998. Within the next 5 years, renewal \nneeds will increase further until they consume nearly all of HUD's \ncurrent budget of approximately $19.5 billion. These cost increases \nwill occur without the adoption of a single new unit of section 8 \nhousing. In addition, many of these expiring contracts cover units \nwhich are subsidized at rates significantly above the surrounding local \nmarket rents. Also, many contracts affect units which have serious \nrepair and rehabilitation needs.\n  These escalating costs, in budget authority and outlays, must be \nreduced in order to avoid resident displacement and reduced funding of \nimportant and needed housing and community development programs.\n  Mr. President, millions of needy Americans depend on section 8 \nhousing to provide them with affordable shelter. The average income of \npersons assisted with section 8 is similar to that of persons living in \nFederal public housing--approximately 17 percent of the local area \nmedian income. In addition, over 35 percent of these persons are \nelderly. Many more are disabled and single parents with limited work \nexperience or education. It is imperative that we protect our needy and \nvulnerable residents.\n  Importantly, this bill will protect existing residents through the \nrenewal of project-based contracts. The legislation will allow the \nmortgages of the affected projects to be refinanced and restructured, \nthereby reducing debt service costs. As a result, the projects will be \nable to continue to operate with correspondingly reduced rent levels \nwithout experiencing significant hardship. This restructuring will \nprotect the FHA insurance fund from increased risk of default which \nwould occur if section 8 payments were reduced without any \ncorresponding reduction in debt service payments.\n  Mr. President, our legislation will also maintain the existing stock \nof decent, safe, and affordable housing because it provides for the \nrenewal of section 8 contracts as project-based assistance. Our \nlegislation recognizes the enormous investment we have made in this \nportfolio and reaffirms our commitment to maintaining it as a stock of \naffordable housing which will be available for people of modest means \nfor years to come. It also fulfills our obligation to the American \ntaxpayer to ensure that our Federal expenditures serve vital public \ninterests in a cost-effective manner.\n  In addition, the bill contains important new enforcement tools for \nHUD to employ to crack down on fraud, waste, and abuse within the \nprogram by unscrupulous landlords. Other provisions within the bill \nwill help recapitalize projects with deferred maintenance needs. The \nbill also recognizes that there is a portion of this portfolio which is \nseriously distressed and has deteriorated to such a point that it is no \nlonger financially possible to continue as project-based housing. In \nthis relatively small number of cases, residents would be protected \nwith section 8 vouchers to enable them to continue to live in \naffordable housing.\n  While the bill will refocus HUD's efforts on enforcing rules against \nfraud and waste, it also recognizes HUD's admitted lack of capacity. \nTherefore, while HUD's staff management will be refocused on \nenforcement, the bill will place primary responsibility for conducting \nmortgage workouts with State and local housing finance agencies \n[HFA's]. A preference would be provided to qualified HFA's to oversee \nmortgage workouts.\n  By encouraging the involvement of the HFA's, the bill will build on \nthe existing financial and housing management expertise which already \nexists at the State and local level. The HFA's are already accountable \nto the public interest and have extensive experience in working with \nthis portfolio.\n  Also, residents of affected properties would be provided with an \nopportunity for input in a communitywide consultation process, and will \nbe provided adequate notice, access to information, and an adequate \ntime period for analysis and comment.\n  Mr. President, during the 104th Congress, the Banking Committee held \na number of hearings and discussions with all interested parties on \nthis issue. This legislation represents the culmination of that \nimportant effort. A general consensus of support has developed behind \nthe committee's legislative framework.\n  As the committee continues its deliberations on this bill, there will \nbe a\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\ncontinuing opportunity for input from residents, owners, housing and \nfinance experts, State and local governments, and HUD. I thank all \nmembers of the Banking Committee for their efforts on behalf of \naffordable housing and look forward to continuing our bipartisan \ncommitment to resolving the HUD section 8 crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/21/senate-section/article/S2741-9", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 311, a bill to \namend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve preventive \nbenefits under the medicare program.\n\n\n                                 S. 389\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Lott] was added as a cosponsor of S. 389, a bill to \nimprove congressional deliberation on proposed Federal private sector \nmandates, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 494\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Alabama [Mr. \nShelby] was added as a cosponsor of S. 494, a bill to combat the \noverutilization of prison health care services and control rising \nprisoner health care costs.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 6\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Alabama [Mr. \nShelby] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 6, a joint \nresolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates to protect the rights of crime victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/21/senate-section/article/S2753-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NCAA DIVISION III MEN'S INDOOR TRACK AND FIELD CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, yesterday, the Budget Committee \nwalked through an analysis of the President's budget prepared by the \nRepublican committee staff. And in anticipation of that meeting, I \nasked the Democratic staff of the committee to prepare an analysis of \nthe Republicans' budget, or at least what we know of the Republican \nbudget.\n  So far, we know that the Senate Republican leadership has proposed as \ntheir first two bills--S. 1 and S. 2--legislation that would provide \n$200 billion worth of tax breaks over the next five years.\n  Some Republicans have raised the possibility that those tax breaks \nmight be deferred until after an initial budget agreement.\n  But Senator Lott, Speaker Gingrich, Senator Roth, Congressman Armey, \nand others all seem very committed to large tax breaks.\n  And that means that sooner or later--perhaps as part of an initial \nagreement, or perhaps later--they would have to pay for those tax \nbreaks.\n  The analysis prepared by the Democratic staff of the Budget Committee \nsimply explains in a very straightforward, objective way what that \nwould mean.\n  And, not surprisingly, it's devastating.\n  In the year 2002, 300,000 children would be denied participation in \nHead Start; because of cutbacks at the Justice Department, 11,000 \nadditional criminals would be left free on the streets; a college \neducation would be less attainable for as many as half a million \nstudents; 3.5 million children could be denied reading and math \nassistance; 2.75 million households would find themselves without \nheating assistance; 50 of the most hazardous toxic waste sites wouldn't \nget cleaned up; 250 VA medical and counseling centers could close; and \n2,400 border patrol agents could be laid off.\n  The list goes on and on. And it really makes the case against large \ntax breaks for the rich.\n  Now, let me be clear that I remain very hopeful that we can move \ntoward a bipartisan agreement to balance the budget.\n  But I hope that when the information included in this report becomes \nknown, many of my Republican colleagues will rethink their tax breaks \nfor the rich.\n  I ask that the text of the special report by the Senate Democratic \nBudget Committee staff be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The report follows:\n\n     Marauding the Middle Class--Republican Tax Breaks for the Rich\n\n\nAn analysis of the gop tax scheme and its impact on national priorities\n\n(A Special Report of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee Democratic Staff, \n                             Mar. 19, 1997)\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       In January, the Senate Republican leadership introduced two \n     bills that provide massive new tax breaks, primarily for \n     higher-income Americans. The leadership made enactment of S. \n     1 and S. 2 top priorities for the 105th Congress.\n       In the first five years, the tax breaks in these measures \n     cost $200 billion. Over the next five years, costs rise by 60 \n     percent for a ten-year total of $525 billion. In the \n     subsequent ten-year period, the revenue loss increases \n     dramatically, to more than $760 billion.\n       Not a single dime of these Republican tax breaks is paid \n     for in the bills themselves, or in an overall budget plan for \n     1998. As a result, the Republican tax scheme would \n     dramatically increase the budget deficit. If the Republican \n     tax bills were enacted, deficits would rise from $121 billion \n     in 1997 to $251 billion in 2002.\n       Since Republicans assert that they support balancing the \n     budget by fiscal year 2002, providing tax breaks of this \n     magnitude would require extreme cuts in programs that are \n     critical to middle class Americans. These cuts would be far \n     deeper than those proposed by the President in his balanced \n     budget plan. Until now, however, there has been no discussion \n     of these potential cuts. The Republican leadership has failed \n     to offer a budget or to explain the reductions they intend to \n     use to pay for their tax breaks. The American people have \n     been kept in the dark about what the GOP tax scheme would \n     mean for them.\n       In stark contrast, President Clinton has proposed a budget \n     that balances in 2002, based on estimates by the \n     Congressional Budget Office. The President's budget includes \n     several tax cuts targeted to the middle class. However, by \n     rejecting the Republicans' massive tax breaks for the \n     wealthy, the President is able to protect important national \n     priorities in education, environment, Medicare and Medicaid.\n       This analysis explains the depth of the cuts that would be \n     required to pay for the Republican tax breaks and examines \n     their impact on ordinary Americans. The report explores the \n     kind of spending cuts Republicans are likely to make to pay \n     for these massive tax breaks and still balance the budget in \n     2002. Under this scenario, the Republican tax breaks would \n     result in cuts of up to one-third in areas such as education, \n     environmental protection, crime prevention, transportation, \n     and health care research. These cuts would dramatically \n     reduce economic and other opportunities for ordinary \n     Americans, and reduce the quality of life for the middle \n     class.\n       In the coming months, the American people will have the \n     opportunity to choose between the President's budget and the \n     Republican proposal. We hope that this report will help \n     Congress and the public make informed judgments about these \n     competing approaches.\n\n\n                              Methodology\n\n       This report calculates the impact of the Republican tax \n     breaks using the approach proposed by Senator Robert Dole \n     during his presidential campaign in 1996. Senator Dole \n     advocated the enactment of extensive tax breaks paid for \n     nearly exclusively through cuts in nondefense discretionary \n     programs. Under Senator Dole's plan, nondefense discretionary \n     programs would have been cut by nearly 40 percent.\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\n       This report evaluates the additional cuts that would be \n     required in nondefense discretionary programs to offset the \n     costs of the tax breaks included in the GOP tax scheme. Our \n     focus is on the final year of a five-year budget agreement, \n     in which the budget will be balanced.\n       To arrive at the appropriate figures, we have started with \n     the baseline produced by the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO), which anticipates the amount of spending that would be \n     expected if current policies are continued. Using that \n     baseline, outlays for nondefense discretionary programs are \n     expected to total $321 billion in fiscal year 2002.\n       To achieve balance in 2002, President Clinton has proposed \n     cuts in nondefense discretionary spending totaling $26 \n     billion. This would represent an 8 percent reduction from the \n     amounts required to maintain current policies. However, the \n     President's budget provides a set of additional policies to \n     ensure that the budget actually balances in that year, should \n     economic or other conditions vary from the President's \n     projections. The President does not believe that these ``fail \n     safe'' policies will be needed, and recent economic data \n     support that conclusion. However, if CBO's estimates prove \n     correct, nondefense discretionary spending would be reduced \n     by an additional $10 billion in 2002, for a total cut of $36 \n     billion. This would amount to a reduction of 11 percent.\n       A comparison of the Republican tax breaks and the \n     President's own revenue proposals shows that the additional \n     tax breaks would lead to a deficit $67 billion larger than \n     under the President's plan. The $67 billion figure is based \n     on estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Assuming \n     that these additional costs would be offset through cuts in \n     nondefense discretionary programs, as Senator Dole proposed, \n     the total cuts in these programs would amount to $103 billion \n     in 2002. This represents a cut from current policy of 32 \n     percent. These cuts are far deeper than a freeze or even last \n     year's Republican budget. These cuts are 24 percent deeper \n     than those made by the President in his alternative budget. \n     These nondefense discretionary paths are shown in the table \n     below.\n       This report explains what a 32 percent cut would mean for a \n     range of domestic programs of importance to ordinary \n     Americans. The 32 percent figure represents an average of the \n     cuts that would be needed. Of course, Congress could propose \n     higher levels for particular programs; however, any such \n     increases would have to be offset by even deeper cuts in \n     other programs.\n\n          NONDEFENSE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN FISCAL YEAR 2002\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Real\n                                                  Spending    reduction\n                                                   level         \\1\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------(percent)-\nCBO uncapped baseline..........................       $321            0\nPresident's budget.............................        294           -8\nPresident's alternative........................        285          -11\nFreeze at 1997 level...........................        272          -15\nLast year's Republican budget..................        245          -24\nRepublican plan................................        217          -32\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Reductions from CBO's uncapped baseline of March 1997, which\n  represents the 1997 enacted level adjusted for inflation in each\n  subsequent year.\n\n           Impact of a 32 percent Cut on Domestic Priorities\n\n       Nondefense discretionary spending includes programs that \n     rely on funding through annual appropriations. These include \n     programs for education and training, environmental \n     protection, law enforcement, transportation, and health \n     research, among others.\n       In 1996, nondefense spending totaled $267 billion, or about \n     17 percent of total Federal spending. Measured as a share of \n     the economy, nondefense spending has fallen from 5.2 percent \n     in 1980 to its current low level of 3.5 percent. A reduction \n     of 32 percent would reduce this component of the budget to \n     2.2 percent of GDP, the lowest level since at least 1940.\n       A reduction of this magnitude would require a dramatic \n     reduction in public investments that promote economic growth. \n     These investments are primarily in the nondefense \n     discretionary part of the budget, and include expenditures \n     for major capital investment, research and development, and \n     education and training programs. Deep cuts in these programs \n     could harm our Nation's economy in the future.\n       State and local governments are also likely to be hit hard \n     by these reductions. Some discretionary programs viewed as \n     ``essential Federal functions'' will be spared deep cuts. \n     These include funds for operating Social Security and \n     veterans programs. To the extent that these programs are cut \n     less than 32 percent, other programs will have to be cut more \n     deeply. State and local grants are likely to bear a larger \n     share of the cuts since they are not tied to the central role \n     of the Federal government. These cuts--on top of those in \n     last year's welfare reform bill and perhaps further cuts in \n     Medicaid--would be difficult for States and localities to \n     handle without reductions in crucial public services, or tax \n     increases.\n       Federal grants help State and local governments finance \n     programs covering most areas of domestic public spending. \n     Federal grant outlays were $228 billion in 1996, or 15 \n     percent of total Federal outlays, and are estimated to \n     increase to $291 billion by 2002. Reducing the Federal \n     commitment by a third would make it more difficult for States \n     and localities to provide critical domestic services, such as \n     public education, law enforcement, roads, water supply, and \n     sewage treatment.\n\n\n                   Denying Educational Opportunities\n\n       Head Start. A 32 percent cut ($1.4 billion) in Head Start \n     in 2002 would deny about 300,000 children aged 3-5 the \n     opportunity to benefit from this effective pre-school \n     program, which provides comprehensive child development, \n     education and nutrition services.\n       Education of the Disadvantaged. A 32 percent cut for the \n     Title I program would eliminate reading and math assistance \n     to about 3.5 million poor children. This is  likely to lead \n     to reduced academic performance and fewer economic \n     opportunities for many of these children.\n       Children with Disabilities. A 32 percent cut in the Special \n     Education program would reduce critical educational services \n     that are now provided to 6 million children with \n     disabilities. It also would make it impossible for the \n     Federal government to meet its statutory goal of sharing 40 \n     percent of the costs of special education. Today, the Federal \n     government is providing only 8 percent of these costs, a \n     level Senate Republicans have sharply criticized as \n     irresponsible. But under a 32 percent discretionary cut, the \n     Federal share would be reduced even further--to 6 percent or \n     less by 2002.\n       Pell Grants. A 32 percent cut in the Pell Grant program \n     could make a college education less attainable for as many as \n     a half a million students by substantially reducing the value \n     of the grants.\n       Job Corps. A 32 percent reduction in the successful Job \n     Corps program could lead to the closure of about 40 job \n     centers, thus denying job training opportunities to an \n     estimated 20,000 disadvantaged youths. Nearly 64,000 people \n     are currently enrolled at 115 centers. This type of cut could \n     mean that there would be fewer Job Corps centers in 2002 than \n     there were in the late 1970s.\n\n\n                       the republican tax breaks\n\n       The Republican tax plan, as embodied in S.1 and S.2, would \n     increase the deficit by $200 billion over the next five \n     years. In contrast to the President's budget, the Republican \n     plan includes no proposals to offset any of these costs.\n       The Republican tax breaks greatly increase the deficit in \n     the first five years and then the costs explode in future \n     years. In fact, these tax breaks will swell to $325 billion \n     from 2003 to 2007, a 60 percent increase. The Republican tax \n     package will cost more than the tax breaks contained in the \n     final version of the Contract with America budget that \n     President Clinton vetoed in the last Congress.\n       A large component of the Republican tax plan is geared \n     toward the very wealthy. The capital gains tax break would \n     provide a windfall to persons with large holdings. In \n     addition, the estate tax break would benefit those who \n     inherit estates from the top 1 percent of wealthy \n     individuals. This tax break would provide a windfall for \n     people inheriting estates up to $21 million. The IRA tax \n     break included in the Republican proposals is similar to the \n     President's proposal, but is more geared to those with higher \n     incomes.\n\n\n                  weakening environmental protections\n\n       Toxic waste clean up. A 32 percent cut in the Superfund \n     program would postpone new cleanup activities at more than 50 \n     of the most hazardous toxic waste sites and delay the \n     completion of cleanups at more than 20 additional sites in \n     2002. These delays would subject communities to additional \n     health risks, and impede economic development that could \n     create many jobs.\n       Clean water. A 32 percent cut in Clean Water programs could \n     eliminate more than 250 loans to municipalities across the \n     country to ensure that our lakes, streams and rivers are \n     clean and safe. The likely would be dirtier water, and \n     perhaps additional health hazards.\n       Inspection activities. A 32 percent cut in environmental \n     enforcement could result in a reduction of more than 13,000 \n     enforcement actions. This could prevent EPA from halting \n     unlawful pollution, lead to worsening environmental \n     conditions, and let many wrongdoers off the hook. Activities \n     that could be affected include: asbestos inspections in \n     public/commercial buildings, compliance with Clean Air Act \n     standards, and the monitoring of the Nation's drinking water.\n       National Parks and Refuges. A 32 percent cut in the NPS \n     could eliminate maintenance at 90 national parks, while the \n     U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service could eliminate funding for \n     more than 100 wildlife refuges. This cut could also lead to \n     increased entrance and activity fees.\n\n\n                        cutting law enforcement\n\n       Prosecuting Criminals. A 32 percent reduction in funding \n     for the U.S. Attorneys' office would mean that at least \n     19,000 fewer persons accused of violent crime, drug \n     smuggling, and organized crime activity would be prosecuted \n     and 11,000 criminals who otherwise would be serving prison \n     sentences would instead be free citizens.\n       Prisons. A 32 percent cut in prison funding could reduce by \n     42,000 the number of prison cells available to hold serious \n     offenders. This would mean that thousands of criminals would \n     be left on the streets. By contrast, the President's \n     budget provides full funding for the Federal prison system \n     by the year 2002.\n       Controlling Illegal Immigration and Drug Trafficking. A 32 \n     percent cut in the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     would require the dismissing of 2,400 Border Patrol Agents. \n     Since the preponderance of these Agents are deployed along \n     the Southwest\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\n     Border, it is likely that illegal immigration along the \n     California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas perimeter would \n     rise.\n       Byrne Grants. A 32 percent reduction could mean that 1,500 \n     fewer formula grants would be made by states from the Edward \n     Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance \n     program. These grants give states broad assistance with the \n     functioning of their criminal justice systems--with emphasis \n     on violent crime and serious offenders--and with the \n     enforcement of Federal drug laws.\n\n\n                 reducing investment in transportation\n\n       Federal-aid Highways. A 32 percent cut in this program \n     would eliminate $6.7 billion in federal assistance to the \n     states for highway projects and improvements in 2002. In \n     addition, to achieve a 32 percent cut in outlays in 2002, \n     tight caps on obligations would have to be set by the \n     Congress in the preceding years. Already, all levels of \n     government are spending approximately $15 billion less than \n     the level necessary to maintain our highway system at its \n     current level of performance. In addition, since the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation estimates that each $1 billion \n     spent on transportation creates 40,000-50,000 jobs, a cut of \n     this magnitude could result in the loss of approximately \n     300,000 jobs in 2002 alone.\n       Federal Transit Administration. A 32 percent cut in FTA \n     funding would reduce the amount available for key mass \n     transit programs by about $1.5 billion. This could adversely \n     affect many of our nation's public transportation systems, \n     particularly the smaller and medium-sized systems that depend \n     more heavily on federal assistance and have fewer resources \n     at their disposal. Transit agencies would have to either \n     raise fares or reduce service, or both, to try to deal with \n     reduced federal assistance. In addition, funding for the \n     purchase of buses and rail vehicles would decline \n     significantly, and transit new starts would be delayed or \n     abandoned. Congestion and air pollution in major urban areas \n     would increase because, as transit service is reduced, \n     commuters would revert to automobiles.\n       FAA operations. A 32 percent cut would severely harm FAA's \n     ability to maintain safe skies. Airline traffic is expected \n     to increase over the next few years, so FAA's increased \n     workload will require more federal funding, not less. A cut \n     of more than $1 billion could result in a staff reduction of \n     10,000 employees, including many safety personnel \n     (controllers, technicians, and inspectors). Efforts to \n     modernize the air traffic control system could be harmed. \n     The result could be much less frequent and less \n     comprehensive inspections of aircraft and an insufficient \n     number of controllers to handle current and projected \n     volumes of air traffic.\n\n\n                  cutting science and energy research\n\n       National Science Foundation. A 32 percent cut in NSF would \n     be $1.2 billion in 2002, and would result in the elimination \n     of more than 6,000 research and education grants in science \n     and engineering to universities and other research \n     institutions.\n       Department of Energy. A 32 percent cut in the DOE would \n     mean that civilian research-related activities performed at \n     more than 20 Department of Energy's labs located throughout \n     the country would be but by more than $900 million.\n\n\n                   harming other domestic priorities\n\n       National Institutes of Health. A 32 percent cut in NIH in \n     2002 would mean a $4.5 billion reduction in funds for medical \n     research from a projected level of $14.6 billion. This would \n     be $2.8 billion below the Fiscal Year 1997 appropriated \n     level. The $4.5 billion cut is equivalent to the entire \n     budget of the National Cancer Institute.\n       Veterans Medical Care. A 32 percent cut in the Veterans \n     Administration could result in closing more than 250 VA \n     medical facilities and counseling centers, could deprive more \n     than 800,000 veterans access to VA medical care and could add \n     more than 3 weeks to the waiting time for a service-connected \n     compensation benefit claim.\n       Housing. The Section 8 program provides basic housing \n     assistance for America's poor, disabled, and elderly. A 32 \n     percent cut in this program translates into more than 800,000 \n     fewer housing units. That means approximately 2.2 million \n     people would lose housing assistance, including approximately \n     760,000 elderly and disabled Americans.\n       CDBG. Community Development Block Grants are used by cities \n     to help finance housing rehabilitation, economic development, \n     and large-scale physical development projects. On average, \n     every dollar spent for CDBG leverages $2.31 in private and \n     other investment. A 32 percent CDBG cut would bring funding \n     down to $3.5 billion in 2002, 27 percent less than 1997. For \n     many communities, that would be a substantial cut.\n       Drug Elimination Grants. A 32 percent cut would mean that \n     these grants, which are used to fight drugs and crime in \n     public housing, would be reduced by $107 million to $224 \n     million in 2002.\n       Special Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, Infants and \n     Children (WIC). WIC would be cut by $1.4 billion under this \n     scenario. Nearly 2.5 million fewer women, infants and \n     children would receive benefits. WIC provides supplemental \n     coupons for specialized foods to low-income families as well \n     as nutritional, educational and health care referrals. \n     Studies show that the WIC program improves birth outcomes and \n     has reduced the incidence of childhood anemia.\n       Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program. A 32 percent \n     cut in LIHEAP could mean that about 2.75 million households \n     could find themselves without heating assistance. The LIHEAP \n     program serves low income families and senior citizens who \n     otherwise might not be able to afford heating in winter.\n\n\n           alternative ways to pay for republican tax breaks\n\n       As explained above, this study has calculated the effect of \n     the Republican tax breaks using the approach adopted by \n     Senator Robert Dole in last year's presidential campaign. \n     Senator Dole offset most of the costs of his proposed tax \n     breaks by cutting nondefense discretionary spending. This \n     approach seems likely to be adopted again, especially given \n     strong public opposition to past Republican proposals for \n     cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and other mandatory programs. \n     However, considering their record in the past, it remains \n     possible that the Republicans would choose other methods to \n     pay for their large tax breaks.\n       To help explain an alternative scenario for offsetting GOP \n     tax breaks, the table below shows the relative contribution \n     of different categories of spending to the spending cuts in \n     last year's budget resolution.\n\n        DISTRIBUTION OF SPENDING CUTS IN REPUBLICAN BUDGET: 1996\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Last Year's GOP\n                                                           Budget\n                                                   ---------------------\n                                                      Amount    Percent\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiscretionary.....................................      -$233         34\nMedicare..........................................       -158         24\nMedicaid..........................................        -72         11\nOther mandatory...................................       -195         30\n                                                   ---------------------\n    Total.........................................       -657        100\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  If Republicans chose to distribute the additional cuts to these \nprograms, in addition to nondefense discretionary, both Medicare and \nMedicaid cuts would increase dramatically from the levels proposed by \nthe President. Medicare would receive nearly one-quarter of any \nadditional cuts, and Medicaid cuts would increase by 14 percent. The \ntable below shows how dramatically the cuts in the President's budget \nfor Medicare would rise under this scenario, over a five- six- and \nseven-year period.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING CUTS TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, BASED\n                      ON PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN BUDGET\n                        [In billions of dollars]\nMedicare:\n  President's budget...........................................      -88\n  President's plus Republican cuts:\n    5-year ($200)..............................................     -138\n    6-year ($256)..............................................     -181\n    7-year ($290)..............................................     -239\n \nNote: President's budget cuts assume alternative policies that achieve a\n  balanced budget under CBO assumptions.\n\n       With the additional cuts, the cumulative reductions in \n     Medicare would grow from the $88 billion in the President's \n     balanced budget to $138 billion over five years. Over six \n     years, cuts would increase to $181 billion and the seven-year \n     total would reach $239 billion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/21/senate-section/article/S2753-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2755-S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REV.

Dr. Edgar \nLeo Vann, Jr. On April 13, 1997, Reverend Vann will be celebrating his \n20th anniversary as pastor of the Second Ebeneezer Baptist Church in \nDetroit, MI.\n  Reverend Vann has been a longtime champion of civil rights and social \njustice. He serves on the executive boards of numerous Michigan civic \norganizations, including the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, the \nDetroit Empowerment Zone Corp., the Michigan Commission of Human \nRights, and the Detroit Urban League.\n  As a member of the National Baptist Convention USA and the President \nof the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity, Reverend \nVann is widely recognized as a religious leader. He currently ministers \nto more than 2,000 people at two consecutive Sunday services. Under his \nleadership, the Second Ebeneezer Baptist Church maintains more than 50 \nactive ministries.\n  One of Reverend Vann's most noted achievements in recent years was \nthe purchase of a new home for his congregation. The new sanctuary was \npurchased in 1993 and, after extensive renovations, held its grand \nopening less than one year later.\n  A religious and civic leader, Rev. Dr. Edgar L.

In November of 1974, however, Ms. \nStevens found her calling and the WHMO, in turn, discovered an \ninvaluable and faithful staffer. She has been there ever since, working \ndiligently to perpetuate the idea that the men and women of our Armed \nForces are indeed important and have a discernible voice in our \ngovernment that must be heard.\n  Also noteworthy is the fact that Ms. Stevens has, for more than two \ndecades, been the single point of contact for the thousands of \nPresidential condolence letters to the next-of-kin of active duty \npersonnel who have tragically died in military related accidents. \nPaying tribute to America's fallen warriors is an obligation that \nbegins with the leadership of this country. It is hard to imagine the \nresponsibility and burden Ms. Stevens' has ultimately shouldered on \nbehalf of a grateful nation.\n  In recognition of her efforts and devotion, Ms. Stevens was recently \nawarded the Secretary of Defense Public Service Medal. It is clear Ms. \nJoan Stevens will be missed dearly. Still, as a fellow Virginian, the \nState Ms. Stevens has called home for over 26 years, I am truly honored \nto have the opportunity today to congratulate her on a remarkable \ncareer and salute her commitment to the President, the Armed Forces of \nthe United States, and most importantly, to the American people. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that you join me, our colleagues both here and in the \nWhite House, and the family and friends of Ms. Joan K. Stevens, in \nexpressing our heartfelt gratitude to this exemplary public \nservant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/21/senate-section/article/S2756-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MS. ARLENE DeSEMONE\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a proud member of \nthe Rhode Island community, Ms. Arlene DeSemone, who, sadly, passed \naway on March 11, 1997.\n  A leader in the insurance industry, Ms. DeSemone served as president \nof the Rhode Island Life Underwriters Association in 1992. She was \npresident of the National Association of Insurance Women of Rhode \nIsland from 1988 to 1990 and was named professional woman of the year \nby this organization in 1994. Ms. DeSemone received the R. Kelly \nSheridan Award in 1996, as the outstanding life insurance professional \nof the year. In addition, Ms. DeSemone received the Lloyd Saunders \nAward for professional dedication to her clients and the industry, and \nserved on numerous committees, including the first Rhode Island \nDepartment of Business Regulation Continuing Education Advisory Board.\n  Perhaps the greatest of Ms. DeSemone's contributions was her work in \nthe fight against breast cancer. Despite her own personal struggle with \nthe disease, Ms. DeSemone led the way in encouraging research efforts \nto find a cure for breast cancer. Ms. DeSemone cofounded the Rhode \nIsland Breast Cancer Coalition in 1993, an organization whose \ninitiatives received national praise and were recognized by President \nClinton and the First Lady. The coalition continues to benefit from her \nefforts to raise consciousness about breast cancer.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Ms. \nArlene DeSemone for her many contributions to Rhode Island and selfless \ndedication to helping others. Certainly, Ms. DeSemone embodied the \nstrength and determination we all seek to find in ourselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/21/senate-section/article/S2756-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF BILL BREW\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to note the impending \nretirement of Mr. William E. Brew, who currently serves as the minority \ngeneral counsel of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. As of April \n4, his retirement date, Bill will have served 19 years and 1 day as a \nloyal and dedicated staff member of the U.S. Senate.\n  A veteran of the Vietnam war, Bill has held increasingly important \npositions of responsibility on the staff of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee. Since he was hired by Senator Alan Cranston in 1978, \nBill has served as associate counsel, associate general counsel, \nminority counsel, deputy general counsel, general counsel, and most \nrecently, minority general counsel to the committee.\n  Through the many political changeovers in the administration and \nCongress in his nearly two decades on Capitol Hill, Bill provided \ninstitutional continuity, serving as a source of reliable information \nand wise advice on legislation, policy, and procedure for Members of \nboth parties.\n  Bill was closely involved in developing all of the major veterans \ninitiatives that were enacted by Congress during this period. Among his \nmajor accomplishments are legislation relating to agent orange \ncompensation, establishment of judicial review of veterans claims, \nestablishment of the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals, and creation of \nprograms relating to the readjustment needs of Vietnam and post-Vietnam \nveterans.\n  In addition to these special accomplishments, Bill worked hard to \nbecome the Senate's foremost authority on veterans health care matters. \nHe served as an invaluable resource to members of the committee on the \nmedical needs of the diverse, 27 million-strong veterans population as \nwell as on the legal, administrative, and structural nuances of the \nhundreds of Department of Veterans Affairs' hospitals, outpatient \nclinics, nursing homes, and domiciliaries.\n  Bill is well known for his logical, analytical, and deliberative \nmind. His patience and fairness are legendary, and few have been as \nadept at working in the heated, give-and-take atmosphere of the \nlegislative process. His adherence to the very highest personal and \nprofessional standards has been a credit to the U.S. Senate. In short, \nBill has been the veteran's veteran, that special individual whom \nSenators, professional staffers, administration officials, and veterans \nadvocates have trusted to render an objective assessment on any \nparticular veterans issue or to undertake any worthy cause in behalf of \nthose who served.\n  Mr. President, I believe that I have a special insight into the \nqualities of this outstanding individual. In the days and months \nimmediately following my appointment to the U.S. Senate in 1990, Bill \nBrew was one of the experienced hands who helped indoctrinate me in the \ncomplexities of veterans policy and the doings of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. Since then, I and my staff have relied on him for advice on \nissues major and minor. Whatever success I have had in the way of \nveterans legislation is in great measure due to his assistance.\n  Indeed, no one worked longer or harder to improve the condition of \nHawaii's 120,000 veterans than Bill Brew. It was his experience and \nenergy that fueled a series of committee investigations revealing VA's \nhistorical neglect of the Aloha State's veterans. As a consequence of \nthese inquiries, VA established four new primary care clinics and \nreadjustment counseling centers in Hawaii; tripled the size of the \nHonolulu outpatient clinic; began preparations to construct a VA \nmedical center on Oahu; and, established a unique residential treatment \ncenter for Pacific-area veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I extend Bill a \nfond farewell. I offer him my deep gratitude for the service he has \nrendered me and other members of this body over the last two decades. \nNo one has worked harder to advance the public interest than this \nstellar public servant. I wish him well in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/21/senate-section/article/S2756-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2757-S2758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING\n\n Mr. WARNER.
