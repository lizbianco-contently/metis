OPINSKY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after a distinguished 40-year career with \nthe U.S. Postal Service and its predecessor the Post Office Department, \nmy good friend Robert J. Opinsky is retiring.\n  Bob traveled to Alaska in 1956 for a summer vacation. By the time the \nvacation was over, Bob was ready to become a full-time Alaskan.\n  He began working with the Post Office Department in Anchorage that \nyear in 1956. By 1970, having served in almost every capacity at the \nPost Office, he was named Anchorage Postmaster.\n  When the Anchorage Division was created in 1986, Bob became Division \nManager. He was the top Postal Service official in our state, \nresponsible for the delivery and retail operations of all 209 post \noffices in Alaska.\n  There have been tremendous challenges during Bob's career, and he's \nmet them with his characteristic quiet efficiency.\n  One example is how he managed to keep the mail flowing after Alaska's \n1964 earthquake, which I remind the Senate measured 9.2 on the Richter \nscale.\n  Bob was foreman of delivery and collection at that time.\n  He worked around the clock and kept the mail moving, even though much \nof what we call southcentral Alaska was brought to its knees by the \ndisaster.\n  As our population increased after North Slope oil was discovered and \nproduction began, Bob led a team which built and updated more than 50 \npost offices in a hurry to keep up with the growing number of Alaskans.\n  In his quiet manner, Bob made sure the task was accomplished quickly \nand efficiently.\n  Bob has also ensured that distinguished postal officials learn about \nAlaska.\n  Hosting several Postmasters General, the entire Postal Service Board \nof Governors and members of the Postal Rate Commission on their visits \nto Alaska, Bob has given them a firsthand view of the beauty of our \nState, and also an awareness of our unique problems.\n  I have traveled with Bob to postal functions all over our State: post \noffice dedications, stamp ceremonies, or town meetings to discuss new \nfacilities.\n  Everywhere we have gone together, it has been obvious how well-liked \nand respected Bob Opinsky is. He is an Alaskan's Alaskan, with a real \ncan-do spirit.\n  While working his way up the ladder at the Post Office, Bob put \nhimself through college. He worked hard to become the best manager in \nthe Postal Service, and he has succeeded.\n  Many awards have come his way over four decades, but perhaps the \nrecognition he most treasures is the Postmaster General Award for \nExecutive Achievement, presented to him in 1991 by Postmaster General \nTony Frank.\n  Bob is married to a lifelong Alaskan, the former Edith Jordet--Edie \nto many of our friends. They have raised three great children, William, \nJohn, and Celine.\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\n  Bob's Opinsky's kindness is legendary. His knowledge of the Postal \nService is absolutely incredible. His gentleness has earned him the \nspecial respect of coworkers, neighbors, and friends. His unassuming \ndemeanor masks a true competitor--a man who works to make sure that he \nand his people are at the top.\n  Retirement may mean that Bob's golf game may get a little better, and \nthat he and Edie may have a chance to seek some sunshine during the \nwinter months.\n  Best of all for me, Mr. President, Bob is my friend. Retirement won't \nchange that.\n  On behalf of all Alaskans, whose lives have been enriched through the \ngreat postal services Bob has ensured for them through the years, I \ncommend Bob Opinsky for a job well done, and wish him well as he \nexplores new horizons.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back any time I might have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6289-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6290-S6299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum until \nthe floor leader arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 428\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Harkin \namendment No. 428.\n  The amendment (No. 428) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 444\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now what is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Gramm amendment No. 444.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding there is 1 minute on each side \nbefore it is voted upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We don't need the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief. I don't think this \namendment is controversial anymore. We had a technical drafting error \nin the welfare bill last year where, after the conference had \nconcluded, the staff added words that, in essence, made the work \nrequirement discretionary with the Secretary. We were going to correct \nit in the welfare bill. However, Senator Bob Graham raised some \nlegitimate concerns about giving flexibility for regional recessions \nand for natural disasters. We have corrected that in this technical \namendment. I submit it to my colleagues, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute in opposition?\n  Mr. GRAMM. There is no opposition that we know of.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield back the \nremainder of the time on the other side and ask for adoption on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 444.\n  The amendment (No. 444) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 445\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Reed amendment No. 445. \nThere is a motion to waive the Budget Act, and there is a request for \nthe yeas and nays. There will be 1 minute for debate to a side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Dominici raised a budget point of \norder that the Reed amendment violated the Budget Act. This Reed \nsubstitute proposes to strike the Medicare age increase, means testing, \ncopayment and adds balanced billing provisions and eliminates the \nmedical savings accounts. The vote will occur on that point of order, \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the motion to waive, that is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there 1 minute on the other side?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. My amendment is simply the \nFinance Committee amendment with the correction of several factors: \nremoval of the Medicare eligibility age, striking the home health care \ncopayment, adds provisions for balanced billing, eliminates the means-\ntesting provisions and also eliminates the medical savings accounts. \nThis is a vote for solvency of the system, restoring those cuts \nnecessary to maintain the system is solvent but rejecting those \nissues----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Can we please have conversations cease so the \nSenator can be heard?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask his 1 minute start over again. \nNobody could hear because there wasn't order.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for his graciousness. Mr. President, my \namendment would take the Finance Committee bill with its cuts to \nMedicare of about $115 billion and simply remove several provisions \nwhich I think jeopardize the long-term well-being and health of the \nMedicare system.\n  These provisions are: raising the age limit to 67; striking the home \nhealth care payment; it would add my amendment, the Medicare balanced \nbilling protection; my amendment would also eliminate the provisions \nthat means tests Medicare; and finally, it would eliminate the medical \nsavings account.\n  This amendment would allow the Senate to vote for solvency of the \nMedicare system but not engage in some of these experiments that are in \nthe Finance Committee bill, experiments which I think will weaken the \noverall system by driving healthy seniors away from Medicare and \nleaving the Medicare system to deal with very sick seniors, which is \nnot a way to run a proper insurance program.\n  This measure, I believe, will restore solvency and allow a more \ncomprehensive review of the Medicare system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I raised a \nbudget point of order that the Reed amendment violates the Budget Act. \nThe Reed substitute proposes to undo everything we did yesterday. It \nproposes to strike the Medicare age increase, means testing, copayment, \nadds balanced billing provisions and eliminates medical savings \naccounts.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I yield back whatever time I have \nremaining.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act \nwith\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\nrespect to amendment No. 445.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the remainder of the \nvotes in the stacked sequence including final passage be limited to 10 \nminutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want the Senators to know, and I am \nnot sure they will all come up, we have 55 amendments that have been \nfiled with numerous second degrees. We have a list here if anybody is \ninterested. We have a few extra copies if Senators want to know what \nthe agenda is.\n  What I would like to do, I say to Senator Lautenberg, Senator Chafee \nis negotiating and working on amendment No. 448. I would like to set it \naside temporarily and move to the Durbin food stamps benefiting \nimmigrant children.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no problem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Durbin \namendment is not germane.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I have a unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent \nMichelle Prejean, a member of my staff, be allowed floor privileges \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make a point of order that the Durbin amendment No. \n450 is out of order, is not germane.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object to that.\n  First, I make a unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anne Marie Murphy be \nallowed privileges of the floor during the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is the Senator from Illinois moving to waive?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am moving to waive the provisions of the \nBudget Act for consideration of this amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays after the debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I might say to my colleagues in the Senate \nthis amendment seeks to right a wrong. It seeks to provide food stamp \ncoverage for the children of legal immigrants to the United States. The \nwelfare reform bill cut off food stamp protection for children--\ndeserving qualified children--and really relegated over 200,000 \nchildren across the United States into a position where they do not \nhave adequate nutrition.\n  It does not do our Nation a bit of good to deny these children food \nat a moment in their lives when it is important to their development. \nThese kids are likely to become American citizens. They are likely to \nbe our neighbors. They are likely to be our future workers.\n  Let us resolve that although we are trying to eradicate welfare as we \nknow it, we will not take it out on the kids. The money that is used to \npay for the food stamps for the children of these legal immigrants is \nan offset that comes from the administrative costs sent to the States. \nThis is money that should be dedicated for the better purpose of \nfeeding hungry, deserving children.\n  I ask my friends, regardless of your position on welfare reform, to \nmake sure that we are dedicated in America to healthy children, not \nhungry children. I hope you will consider voting to waive the \nprovisions of the Budget Act and approval of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the agreement that was put together with \nthe President contains some food stamp changes. They have been adopted \nby the committees. We have never agreed on this one. In fact, it was \nnot even brought up by the administration.\n  This amendment amends the welfare reform bill of last year by \nrequiring food stamp benefits to child immigrants, paid for with State \nadministrative moneys.\n  I yield remaining time on our side.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nSenator Durbin to waive the Budget Act for the consideration of \namendment No. 450.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, will Senator D'Amato yield for a moment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\n                     Amendment No. 476, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would like to move to amendment No. 476, the Kerrey \namendment, because we are going to accept that. We like to do that from \ntime to time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, we will move to the Kerrey \namendment.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. This amendment deals with FCC auctions of spectrum. They \nhad an action about a month ago where they auctioned off spectrum for \nabout a dollar. Some of these spectrums went for that. This amendment \nestablishes that the FCC shall have a floor, and the suggestion was \nthat we modify it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be modified to allow the \nFCC to establish a floor, unless it is in the national interest not to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 476), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE PRICE.\n\n       In any auction conducted or supervised by the Federal \n     Communications Commission (hereinafter the Commission) for \n     any license, permit or right which has value, a reasonable \n     reserve price shall be set by the Commission for each unit in \n     the auction, unless the Commission determines it not to be in \n     the public interest. The reserve price shall establish a \n     minimum bid for the unit to be auctioned. If no bid is \n     received above the reserve price for a unit, the unit shall \n     be retained. The Commission shall re-assess the reserve price \n     for that unit and place the unit in the next scheduled or \n     next appropriate auction.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection. It is cleared by the Commerce \nCommittee on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 476), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 451\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now we can return to the D'Amato amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President on behalf of Senator Harkin, myself, \nSenators Mack, Jeffords, Specter, and Rockefeller, we offer an \namendment that will fulfill this Chamber's commitment, a commitment \nthat it made on January 21 when it voted 89-0 to double the amount of \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health to provide medical \nresearch. Everybody says we need more money for cancer research, heart \nresearch, and for Alzheimer's and diabetes. We say we are going to do \nit and we never do it.\n  This amendment says that any excessive funds that are saved, over and \nabove that anticipated by this budget resolution, by Medicare and \nMedicaid, certified by the CBO, will then be utilized to meet these \nfunctions. Only after CBO has certified that there are excess savings \nwill those savings be placed in this account.\n  Mr. President, that is keeping our commitment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, are there 10 seconds left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment, I regret to say, should \nbe defeated. It creates a new overbudget trust fund for medical \nresearch. It is based on estimates. The biggest argument against it is \nif we save more money in Medicare than we expect under the budget \nagreement, it ought to go to Medicare. It ought not go to be used in an \nappropriated account.\n  Essentially, this says, if we save more money than was agreed upon by \nthe White House and the Congress in Medicare, the extra money goes to a \ntrust fund for NIH. I believe it ought to stay right where it is and be \nused by the Finance Committee for Medicare and other purposes.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order has already been made.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive The Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to the D'Amato amendment No. 451.

On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Murkowski amendment No. 455.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would ask on behalf of Senator Akaka, \nwho wants to discuss it with us, that the Murkowski amendment be set \naside and we proceed to the Abraham-Levin amendment, which will be a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 456\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate now is on \nagreeing to the Abraham-Levin amendment No. 456.\n  The amendment (No. 456) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMINICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the Helms \namendment No. 459, 1 minute equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  The Senate will please come to order.\n  The Chair now recognizes the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMINICI. Could I have a quorum for just 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 455\n\n  Mr. DOMINICI. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to go to the \nMurkowski amendment No. 455, which will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. With reluctance, I ask support of this amendment, and \nobviously it has been done. But I want to make the point that the \nprovision in the current bill is one that we have all committed to, and \nthat is of having the strategic petroleum reserve and the reality that \nwe are addressing it with the crisis on the budget. That is not the \npurpose. The Akaka amendment provided a purchase mechanism after 2002.\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\n  I think it is the right policy for this Nation, and we are only \ntalking about $13 million a year. I think that is a small price to pay \nfor energy security, but nevertheless recognizing the circumstances, \nwhy, I reluctantly ask support.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank Senator Akaka for his role in encouraging the \nsupport of the strategic petroleum reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  The Senate will please come to order. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. According to the Energy Committee, in the reconciliation \nproposal, this was supposed to be for 5 years. The committee is now \nrecommending that it be extended to 10 years. My reason for keeping it \nat 5 years would be to have the other 5 years to be used for purchasing \nexcess oil, and for that reason I am opposing this. But I am not \nobjecting to it because Chairman Murkowski is supporting this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 455) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMINICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 459 withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I, in behalf of Senator Helms, withdraw amendment No. \n459.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 459) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMINICI. Now, I believe, according to the regular order, the \nLautenberg amendment No. 475 on legal immigrants is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The question before \nthe Senate is on agreeing to the Lautenberg amendment No. 475. Time is \nevenly divided.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                            Amendment No 458\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I made a mistake. If Senator Lautenberg \nwould permit me to correct it. In withdrawing the Helms amendment, I \nfailed to then proceed to take up the amendment that he has that \nremains, and that is No. 458.\n  Could we make that in order right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 458 is in \norder.\n  The question before the Senate is on agreeing to Helms amendment No. \n458.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in 1993, Stanly Memorial Hospital in \nAlbermarle, NC, was reclassified as a rural instead of an urban \nhospital, resulting in a loss of $1.3 million each year in Medicare \nreimbursement.\n  Stanly County is the only county in North Carolina, and, I believe, \nin the Nation, that is touched by four different urban counties and two \ndifferent Metropolitan Statistical Areas. SMH's primary competitors are \nin the adjacent large urban MSA's which include Davidson, Rowan, \nCabarrus, and Union Counties.\n  By a purely bureaucratic decision, Stanley Memorial has been put in a \nposition of having to compete with all of the Charlotte hospitals in \nrecruitment of employees, managed care contracts, and doctors.\n  But since Stanly Memorial is not included in the Charlotte MSA, it \nreceives 20 percent less for the very same Medicare services as \ndelivered by competing hospitals in surrounding areas.\n  This amendment will correct this inequity by deeming Stanly County as \npart of the large urban area of Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, NC/SC.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This amendment has been worked out on both sides, and \nit is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 458) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, under the regular order, would we return to \nLautenberg 475?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now before the Senate is on \nagreeing to the Lautenberg amendment No. 475.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I need 2 minutes for a quorum to discuss this. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator will suspend. The Senate will please come to order. \nSenators will please carry their conversations to the cloakrooms.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 499 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment No. 49 regarding \nthe subject matter of the Lautenberg amendment. It is amendment 499, \nexcuse me. It is 49 on our list. No. 499.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 499) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 475\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have agreed to accept the Lautenberg amendment and \ntaking it to conference. We think it is the best way to resolve this \nissue which is between the two Houses and the White House. We all have \ndifferent versions. And we agree to accept the amendment. I yield to \nhim now for his minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for accepting this.\n  The purpose of the amendment is very simple. It is to provide \nfairness for people who come to this country legally, who paid their \ntaxes in good faith and played by the rules, and then perhaps suffer \nfrom a serious disability caused by an accident or a serious illness.\n  Whatever the cause, they are here at our invitation, left unable to \nwork and unable to support themselves. And so, Mr. President, the \nbudget agreement includes a very specific provision to ensure that \nthese people get help. Unfortunately, the bill before us provides \nfunding for only 1 year of these benefits. I hope we will be able to \nhold this amendment. It is very important. I think it establishes our \nattitude about those who have come here at our invitation, and we say, \npay your taxes, do your work, and then we want to take them out of the \nprotection stream.\n  So I hope that this amendment, which will restore them personally, \nwill take care of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 475) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 460\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McCain \namendment No. 460.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment allows several States to go \nforward with some of the most innovative work being done in health care \nin America--in Senator McCain's State and my own, several others. This \namendment is budget neutral, but in our home State of Oregon, through \nthe Oregon Health Plan, we have been able to serve upwards of 100,000 \nlow-income families with an innovative approach. The administration \nsupports these efforts. It is a chance to go forward in innovative \nhealth care, a critically important issue at this time.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this budget-neutral measure. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me talk with Senator Wyden for a minute about this. \nI understand from the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee \nthat the McCain-Wyden amendment, with reference to statewide Medicaid \nwaivers, is in the chairman's, the\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\nmanagers' amendment which will be offered and accepted. And based on \nthat, we would ask the Senator if he would withdraw the amendment. He \ncan leave it on the list pending the adoption of that, if he would \nlike.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with that assurance of the chairman of the \nfull committee, Mr. Roth, and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. \nDomenici, who have been very helpful to Mr. Smith and myself on behalf \nof our State, we are very pleased with this, and with that assurance, I \nam pleased to withdraw the amendment at this time and look forward to \nvoting for the managers' amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 460) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 478\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now before the Senate is the \nRockefeller amendment No. 478. Time is equally divided.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I make a point of order that section 5001, \ncreating section 1852(a)(5)(B), section 5001 creating section \n1852(k)(2), and section 5001 creating section 1854(e)(3) of the pending \nbill are extraneous under section 313(b)(1)(A).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor? The Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't really understand where we are. \nWe thought the Senator was calling up an amendment, No. 478, requiring \nbalanced billing protection for individuals enrolled in fee-for-service \nplans. Did the Senator call that amendment up? That is the order, the \nregular order.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am making a point of order against the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia made two points \nof order. Those points cannot be made while an amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which amendment is pending, No. 478?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is No. 478, Senator \nRockefeller's amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Chair state the ruling again, please? It is \nhard to hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those points of order cannot be made while \nthis amendment is pending.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nin lieu, then, of a point of order I would like to make a point of \norder against the balanced billing portion of the FFS section of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand. Is what you are suggesting that you want \nto withdraw your amendment and in lieu thereof make a point of order?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator call that to the attention of the \nChair that that is what he would like to do?\n  On behalf of Senator Rockefeller, I ask his amendment be withdrawn \nand it be in order for him to make a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 478) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now we need a clarification of what the point of order \nis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from West Virginia send the \npoint of order to the desk?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It is on its way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, and ask the \ndistinguished Senator if he would accommodate us, that we set aside his \npoint of order for just a moment and go to the next amendment while we \nwork on it. The next amendment is going to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 461\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The amendment we are going to is amendment No. 461, the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Might we proceed to amendment 461? We have just received a unanimous \nconsent to set this aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is going to be accepted. This \namendment will reclassify certain Amerasian immigrants as refugees to \nexempt them from the restrictions on receiving benefits under the \nwelfare reform bill. It costs about $1 million and has been accepted on \nboth sides.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we cannot hear the explanation by the \ndistinguished manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate be in \norder.\n  The Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I was saying we have no objection. We \nought to move on, move this along.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We yield any time we have.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator repeat the \nstatement? There is so much noise and confusion that I for one could \nnot understand what Senator Domenici was saying.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This McCain amendment would reclassify certain \nAmerasian immigrants as refugees. Thus, they would be entitled to \nbenefits of people similarly situated. The amendment costs about $1 \nmillion per year, and those on our side who handle these matters have \nindicated they are willing to accept it. I understand the minority is \nwilling to accept it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no objection.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 461) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 479\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Dodd amendment, No. \n479. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope this amendment will be agreed to. \nThis is an amendment I think all of our colleagues can support. I am \noffering it on behalf of myself and the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad. It will preserve the Medicaid coverage for some 30,000 \nchildren who, if we do nothing else, are going to lose it. These are \nthe most severe disabled children in the country. This was a slip, more \nthan anything else, I think, when we passed the welfare reform law last \nyear. We learned these children might lose their Medicaid coverage as a \nconsequence of losing their SSI. Since then there has been a broad \nagreement we should step in and try to preserve health care for the \nmost needy of all children. In fact, the bipartisan budget agreement \ncalled for continued Medicaid coverage for these children. So, this \namendment merely plugs that gap that we had all agreed on. It simply \nhonors the agreement. Its cost is modest. It is about $100 million over \n5 years.\n  I can argue if we can find $16 billion to provide insurance for kids \nwho lack it, surely we could set aside a fraction of that to provide \ninsurance for children who stand to lose it. That is what we are faced \nwith. If we do not do this, these 30,000 severely disabled children \nwould be cut off.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\nrestore Medicaid coverage for children who were removed from the SSI \nrolls in last year's welfare bill.\n  Mr. President, last year's welfare bill significantly restricted the \ntypes of disabilities that enable a child to qualify for the \nSupplemental Security Income Program. In some cases, the same \ndisability that will qualify an adult for SSI now will be insufficient \nto quality a child. Among the children most likely to lose benefits are \nthose who suffer from multiple problems, no one of which is severe \nenough to meet the more restrictive legal criteria, but the combined \neffect of which is substantial.\n  The Social Security Administration estimates that 135,000 low-income \ndisabled children will be removed from the SSI as a result of the new \nlaw. Others put the number much higher.\n  In any case, since SSI eligibility is linked to Medicaid eligibility, \nmany of these children will be terminated from the Medicaid Program, \nunless they qualify on other grounds. The administration believes that, \nin the end, about 30,000 disabled children from low income families \nwill lose Medicaid coverage.\n  Mr. President, the loss of Medicaid coverage is likely to create \nserious problems for these families. Private insurance will be very \ndifficult to find And even it it's available, the costs will reflect \nthe conditions that these children have.\n  Compounding matters, these families also will be suffering large \nincome losses because of the loss of their children's SSI benefits.\n  Mr. President, these families had low incomes even before these \nbenefits were withdrawn. And now they are facing severe financial \nhardships. Allowing these to keep Medicaid coverage is the right thing \nto do. Otherwise, we are likely to see even more children become \nuninsured.\n  Mr. President, one of the core principles of the bipartisan budget \nagreement was to provide health care coverage for as many as 5 million \nuninsured children. And it was my understanding that the budget \nnegotiators agreed to restore Medicaid for these roughly 30,000 SSI \nkids. Not as part of the $16 billion child health initiative, but as a \nseparate, binding commitment. That is clearly the understanding of the \nadministration, as well.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, Senator Domenici has a different \nrecollection of what was agreed to, and I know he holds that view in \ngood faith. So we have an honest disagreement.\n  But regardless of whose recollection is more accurate, Mr. President, \nI would urge my colleagues to protect these vulnerable children and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I know that Senators on both sides of the aisle share \na commitment to covering all of America's children. And so I hope that \nthis amendment will win broad support.\n  Keep in mind that that these children don't just come from low-income \nfamilies. They are disabled, even though they don't meet the new \neligibility standards for SSI. And many of them will be become \ncompletely uninsured if we do not correct this problem.\n  I also want to make sure that Senators understand that this amendment \nwould not restore any SSI benefits. All it would do is restore Medicaid \ncoverage for these children. But that would greatly ease the hardships \nfacing many of these families, and reduce the number of children who \notherwise would join the ranks of the uninsured.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will stand with these 30,000 \ndisabled children and their families, and will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all let me say it is the \nposition of the committee of jurisdiction that these children are \ncovered under the $16 billion child care provisions of the bill. Since \nthat is the case, I first would ask the Senator if he would like to \nwithdraw the amendment and confirm that. If not, I would make a point \nof order against the amendment and he would have to get 60 votes to \npass it.\n  Mr. DODD. I realize we are running out of time. Let me, on the \nSenator's time--I raised this earlier, I say to the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee. We are not convinced that is the \ncase. I understood that was the argument made to me and that has not \nbeen confirmed. So we are running the risk here, if it is not the case. \nI would rather adopt the amendment. If it turns out it is OK, then we \nprotected these children. If you do not do it, it's not part of the $16 \nbillion, 30,000 disabled children lose their Medicaid benefits. We have \nto do it by law, and I would rather err on that side than err on the \nother side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do greatly respect the Senator. I respect all \nSenators. But we really are operating on a 1-minute rule for each side. \nI think if we are going to speak longer we ought to get consent of the \nSenate to do that, and I do not address that just to Senator Dodd.\n  We contend they are covered. I make a point of order under section \n310 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to waive that.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive The Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act, section 310. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 49, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 118 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 49, the nays are \n51. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I have the attention of the Senate for just a \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask the clerk, how long have we been taking in \nterms of time on the rollcalls on the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Votes are taking approximately 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are on 10-minute rollcall votes, I say to the \nSenators. The longer we take for these, the longer we go into the \nevening tonight. I really urge you to do your best to get here quickly \nso we can wrap them up in 10 minutes. I understand 10 to 11 is \nsufficient. I thank the Senate.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 462, 465, and 466, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, we can dispose of a number of amendments now. I ask \nunanimous consent, on behalf of Senator Chafee, that amendment No. 466 \nbe withdrawn; on behalf of Senator Jeffords that amendment No. 462 be \nwithdrawn.\n  On behalf of Senator Allard, are you going to withdraw your \namendment, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Is the chairman going to make a point of order on my \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have to, yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. OK. I appreciate the chairman, Mr. President, giving me \nan\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\nopportunity just to speak a minute or two about this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this time to discuss this \namendment that would give families with uninsured children the \nopportunity to obtain proper health coverage.\n  My amendment would allow families with uninsured children to deposit \nmoney in a medical savings account to use for health care services. I \nbelieve it is critical to provide lower income families with the option \nto establish medical savings accounts. MSA's allow consumers to pay for \nmedical expenses through affordable tax-deductible plans that are most \nsuited to their needs.\n  Americans want choice in health care. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to listen to the American people and make medical savings \naccounts an available option. Medical savings accounts are a viable \nfree-market approach to ensuring greater access to affordable health \ncare coverage for the uninsured.\n  I believe our efforts need to be focused on providing uninsured \nchildren with accessible health care services. My amendment would give \nthese families the opportunity of setting aside MSA funds, especially \nbenefiting those who are self-employed, between jobs, or employed where \nhealth coverage is not available.\n  I am hopeful that in the 105th Congress, we will be able to expand \nthe availability of medical savings accounts.\n  My amendment is one step to achieving the goal of decreasing the \nnumber of uninsured children by providing families with the option to \nreceive much needed health care coverage. By making more MSA's \navailable, we can make it easier for parents to finance their \nchildren's health care; afterall, the health of our Nation's children \nis at stake.\n  I understand the position of the chairman having to raise this point \nof order. I just hope that the Finance Committee takes a closer look at \nmedical savings accounts and the problem we have with uninsured \nchildren.\n  With that, I will go ahead and withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Have they been withdrawn?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are prepared to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, is amendment No. \n465, included in the package of amendments to be withdrawn?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is; 466, 462, and 465\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 462, 465 and 466) were withdrawn.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 463, 480, and 481, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now we are prepared to accept, en bloc--the Senators \nwill use a minimum of time--amendment No. 480, Senator Murray's \namendment; amendment No. 463, Senator Jeffords on child health; and \n481, Senator Dodd's amendment regarding transfers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to agreeing to the \namendments en bloc?\n  Mr. DODD. Do you want to explain them or not?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would feel very good if you did not explain them. But \nif you want to, it would be great. We can keep the three of you to 1 \nminute combined.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I waive explanation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, will you waive explanation?\n  Mr. BYRD. Could we have an explanation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The first amendment is amendment No. 480 offered by the \nSenator from Washington [Mrs. Murray].\n  Mr. BYRD. Could we have an explanation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. She is going to do that right now.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering simply clarifies that \nthey can waive victims of domestic violence from the Welfare Act. This \nwas an amendment that was unanimously accepted in the fiscal year 1998 \nbudget resolution and in the welfare reform bill.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his work \non this issue and appreciate the acceptance by the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my amendment tells Governors that they \nshould report how well their child health development grant that we \ngave them--the block grant--how well it is working. That is basically \nwhat it does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is very important to the \nhospitals across the country. Under the law, the first hospital that \ncannot provide care would have its fees reduced if the patient is sent \nto a second hospital that can provide acute care. That is a good idea. \nWhat happens, however, is that patients that are moved from the first \nhospital to a home setting, no longer needing acute care, the fees of \nthe first hospital are also reduced. We did not intend that to be the \ncase. This amendment corrects that mistake. This is broadly supported \nby every hospital across the country.\n\n  My colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, is my cosponsor on this, \nalong with Senator Leahy. We hope it will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to considering the \namendments en bloc?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question occurs on amendments 463, 480, and 481 en bloc.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have an explanation of the other two \namendments?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have had all three explained.\n  Mr. BYRD. All three have been explained?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All three amendments were explained.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Murray has a freestanding amendment. She \nexplained it. Senator Jeffords' is freestanding; and Senator Dodd.\n  The amendments (Nos. 463, 480, and 481) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 483, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have another amendment to withdraw, Senator Wyden's, \nNo. 483.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, because of its inclusion in the managers' \npackage, that is appropriate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to withdrawing the \namendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 483) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we could try one other one to see if we \ncould dispose of it before we have a debate on the Levin amendment.\n  Senator Grassley has an amendment that I would ask, is it acceptable \non the other side, long-term care? It has to do with religious choice.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are looking at that, Mr. President. If we can just \ndefer for a few minutes, if it is all right with Senator Grassley, and \ngo on to some other business and come back to it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right.\n  Regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 482\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Levin amendment No. \n482.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the National Governors' Association \nstrongly supports allowing vocational education training to count \ntoward meeting the work requirement under the welfare law. The current \nlaw allows a 12-month limit. The old requirement was 24 months. The \nGovernors argue and the community colleges argue--and I think it is \nvery persuasive--that being in vocational education should count toward \nthat work requirement. There is no cost to the Treasury.\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\n  It will help people to complete a community college education and to \ncount that toward the work requirement under the welfare bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont. He is a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I support the amendment and have no problems with it \nbeing in our jurisdiction. Senator Chafee also supports it. He asked me \nto inform the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who wishes to speak in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the time in opposition to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we had this debate during the welfare \nreform bill in the last session of Congress. We said we wanted people \nwho are on welfare to work, not to go into more education and training. \nThere is a time for that. We allow for education and training, but at a \ncertain point in time we are going to require people to go to work.\n\n  Now, what this amendment says is, no, you do not have to go to work; \ncontinue education and training. This is a weakening of the work \nrequirement. This is not going to get people into the workplace to \nlearn the skills necessary to be competitive and to get good jobs and \nto improve their future.\n  This is more of the same what we have been doing here in Washington \nprior to the welfare reform bill. The President did not request this \nchange. It is not in the budget agreement. It was not anything that \nanyone advocated. It should be defeated.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \namendment violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 468\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention, \nthis is amendment No. 468, designed to correct a technical corrections \nproblem which ironically arose out of the Medicare Technical Act of \n1994.\n  To describe it, you have been going to your doctor for 50 years. He \nsays you need something done.\n  You say, ``OK, do it.''\n  He says, ``Wait a minute, aren't you 65 years old now?''\n  You say, ``Yes.''\n  And he says, ``I am sorry, I cannot treat you anymore.''\n  ``Why not?''\n  ``Well, I don't treat Medicare patients.''\n  ``You do not have to submit the bill to Medicare. I will not submit \nthe bill to Medicare. Let me pay you like I always have.''\n  Sorry, HCFA says we cannot do that.\n  Mr. President, this is very simple. It allows for those 9 percent of \nthe physicians who do not treat Medicare patients to continue to treat \ntheir patients as they always have. Those parties do not make a claim \nto Medicare, Medicare does not pay it, they simply go ahead and pay the \ndoctor like they always have. This is not what was intended in the 1994 \nact, but because of the way HCFA's regulations have interpreted it, we \nneed to make this technical correction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the change.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Kyl amendment would allow \nsomething that is similar to balanced billing. It is, frankly, quite \ncontroversial. It does not belong, in my view, on a fast-track \nreconciliation bill. I hope we will oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that the amendment is not germane. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to move to waive the point of \norder. I wanted to indicate that this amendment has the support of \nsponsors, such as Senator Lott, Senator Domenici, Senator Roth, and \nothers on our side. I hope we can do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Does the Senator wish to make a motion?\n  Mr. KYL. I move to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity in morning \nbusiness to talk briefly about an issue that I know a number of Members \non both sides of the aisle care very much about.\n  Yesterday in the House of Representatives a resolution which would \nhave opposed or ended America's most-favored-nation status relationship \nwith the People's Republic of China was defeated. But in the wake of \nthat defeat, I think we still have an obligation to examine closely the \npolicies of the Chinese Government and to not simply criticize those \npolicies in word but also act with respect to those policies indeed. To \nthat end, I urge my colleagues to begin the examination process of \nwhat, separate from acting in the context of most-favored-nation \nstatus, we might do as a matter of American policy.\n\n  The concerns that many of us have with respect to human rights abuses \nin China, ranging from coercive family planning practices to religious \npersecution, to the events that occurred in Tiananmen Square just a few \nyears ago, combined with a variety of other things, such as the \nactivities in this country of certain Chinese companies that operate \nunder the auspices of the People's Liberation Army--most recently the \nincidence in which AK-47 assault rifles were on their way to street \ngangs in Los Angeles, and happily that was prevented from occurring--\nbut a variety of actions that I think demand a response from this \ncountry that goes beyond rhetoric.\n  To that end, I recently introduced legislation here in the Senate, \nthe China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act. I ask my \ncolleagues to take a look at that legislation. Now that it is clear \nthat the most-favored-nation status debate is over for this year, I \nthink we should be looking at other options.\n  I believe this legislation embodies a variety of very targeted \nresponses to the things that have gone on in the People's Republic of \nChina that Americans are concerned about. It would, among other things, \ndeny visas to those high-ranking Government officials who have engaged \nin some of the policies and practices that we deplore. It would upon \nthe United States to vote ``no'' with respect to votes on loans to \nChina by international multilateral development banks so that we will \nnot have American taxpayers subsidizing the Chinese Government.\n  It would identify those Chinese companies who are operating in this \ncountry and take specific sanctions against those who have been \nidentified as having engaged in inappropriate and illegal activities.\n  It would attempt to deal in a very specific way with the issues of \nthe proliferation of weapons technologies that has gone on between the \nGovernment of China and nations such as Iran.\n  It has a wide array of components to it.\n  I ask that all Members who are concerned about the actions of the \nChinese Government look at this legislation. This Senator is anxious to \nlook at other ideas, because I think a response is warranted beyond the \nMFN debate itself.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after listening to some of the debate on \namendments that are being offered and having the opportunity to come to \nthe floor and defend what we did last year on the welfare reform bill, \nyou would think by all of the amendments that are being discussed and \nby all of the gnashing of teeth that is going on here in the U.S. \nSenate today, that we have a welfare reform bill--the bill that passed \nthis Congress last session and implemented by the States' 50 \nGovernors--that we are having an abject failure; that horrible things \nare happening out there in the area of welfare\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\nthat we have to now come back and save all of these people. I hate to \ndisappoint anybody's party here. But the fact of the matter is that \nthings are not all that bad. In fact, things are doing very, very well \nin the area of welfare. I will point to a couple of things as \nillustrations.\n  First, I have not seen one major newspaper write one bad article or \neditorial on the devastating effects of welfare reform passed by the \nlast Congress. I assure you that if there were any devastating stories \nto be told, they would be telling them because of all these papers that \nwere against the welfare reform bill that went through. The fact that \nwe have not heard of horror stories and that we have not heard any \ngnashing of teeth from the media about what is going on is certainly a \npositive sign that things are actually going well.\n  I might also add that none of the press has come and said, ``Gee, we \nwere wrong.'' Welfare in Wisconsin--50 percent of the people have been \ndropped off the rolls, and are working. Across the country the average \nis 20 percent of welfare rolls have been reduced, and people are \nworking--in case after case after case.\n  I spend at least one visit a week when I am back in the State of \nPennsylvania going in and talking to people in education and training \nprograms, homeless shelters--you name it--talking to the people who are \nintersecting with the welfare programs. And almost unanimously what I \nhave gotten as feedback is, ``This program is a program I wish you had \npassed earlier. I wouldn't be here today working. I wouldn't be here \ntoday getting the education and training I need, succeeding, and \nfeeling better about myself had this bill not passed.''\n  We have an unmitigated success in welfare. We threw the ball up in \nthe air. The Governors of the 50 States jumped. They caught it, and \nthey are running with the ball. They are doing positive things for the \npoor and for the disadvantaged all across America. I just think that we \nneed to take some time here today in the midst of all of these \namendments that says all of these people are being hurt. The fact of \nthe matter is a vast majority are being helped tremendously by what \nwent on in welfare reform.\n\n  I hope Members--frankly, those who supported welfare reform and those \nwho did not--I hope that they will come to the floor and say, ``Look, \nthis program is working.'' From any objective criteria, people are \nworking; people are going in and getting education and training that \nthey never would have had before because, frankly, they needed that \nlittle shove. We are giving it to them. We are supplying them, and the \nGovernors, with the child care that they need.\n  We have a lot of work to continue to do on that front and on some \nother fronts in the area of Medicare and other kinds of health \ncoverage. But the Governors are working on that. They are taking this \nresponsibility that we have given them--this flexibility that we have \ngiven them--very seriously and are doing a terrific job.\n  So I just want to set the record straight here on a day that might \notherwise be seen as a day where welfare reform came under attack here \nin the U.S. Senate. What we are seeing in reality outside of Washington \nDC, outside of the Senate Chamber, where we continue to think of the \nwelfare of the past and look to the future--go out there in those \ncommunities and find out the success stories, the wonderful, heartfelt \nstories of people who needed this piece of legislation and who needed \nthis change in the welfare culture.\n  I think probably the most dramatic thing that I heard from someone \nwho is not on welfare but someone who worked in the system is from two \npeople who had been in the welfare casework role for 25 years in New \nCastle, PA. They came to me and said, ``I can't thank you enough for \nchanging the law to let me do what I wanted to do 25 years ago but \nnever had the chance''--that is, help people get off welfare, help \npeople actually use their ability and get the respect for themselves \ninstead of just passing out checks and creating dependency. The person \nwas actually thanking me, almost in tears, thanking us for giving him \nthe opportunity to do what 30 years of welfare policy wouldn't let him \ndo--that is, get people off of welfare, give them the incentive and the \ntools to make it off the dependency of the Government instead of \nensuring that they would never leave by creating a meal ticket forever \non welfare.\n  So I just want to reiterate one last time that anyone in this Chamber \nwho believes that welfare reform is in bad shape and we need to go and \nrewrite the welfare bill because of all the terrible things that are \ngoing on out there, I suggest you go out there and you talk to the \nNation's Governors, you talk to the people who are working in the \nsystem, you talk to the people who are going through the system, and \nyou will hear a very different story than what you are hearing here \ntoday in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. I would like to respond to my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania.\n  I voted for the welfare reform bill, and I thought it was long \noverdue. The welfare system in America definitely needs to be changed, \nreformed, and in many areas just plain abandoned. It was a system which \nhad sustained many families, but it also captured many families and \nensnared them in welfare dependency, and we knew it. And that is why on \na bipartisan basis we voted for welfare reform. But I do not believe \nthat it is accurate to assess the success of welfare reform strictly on \nthe wisdom of that legislation.\n  Fortunately, we live in a time of an expanding economy that is \ncreating jobs, creating opportunities for small businesses, for new \nhousing starts. We are seeing the lowest controlled inflation in a \nlong, long period of time. We are seeing the deficit come into control. \nAnd I have to say to my friend, the Republican from Pennsylvania, I \ndon't think you can take any credit for that because, unfortunately, \nnot a single Republican Member of this Senate at the time supported the \nPresident's plan for deficit reduction. It passed with all Democratic \nvotes and the vote of the Vice President and passed by a scant margin \nin the House of Representatives with no Republican support. And because \nof the President's plan, we have had 5 straight years of deficit \nreduction and economic expansion, something the other party speaks of a \nlot but something the Democrats delivered.\n  And so when we talk about opportunities to come off welfare, what \nopportunity would there be if we were in a recession with fewer jobs \nfor people who are searching for that first-time job opportunity. I am \nafraid very, very few. And I also have to take exception to the idea \nthat this welfare reform was somewhere hammered into marble, Holy Writ, \nthat should not be changed or addressed. The success of a man like \nFranklin Roosevelt as President of the United States was his \nrecognition that he was not perfect. He would come up with good ideas \nand he would try to implement them. Some turned out to be wildly \nsuccessful, like Social Security, others fell on their face. He had at \nleast the good sense to come forward and say there are times when you \nshould abandon a program or change it. The same is true when it comes \nto welfare reform.\n  I might remind my colleague from Pennsylvania that even this year the \nRepublican leadership in the House and Senate acknowledged the \nshortcomings of our welfare reform bill, particularly when it came to \nthose who are legal immigrants to the United States. That was a very \nunfair provision, to force people off of disability income because they \nwere here strictly on the basis of being legal immigrants. These are \nnot illegals but legally here in the United States. I offered an \namendment today. I tried to correct another failing, as I see it, in \nthe welfare reform bill and it relates to food for children, food \nstamps for children. These are children of legal immigrants living in \nthe United States who were cut off their food stamps in April of this \nyear. I will tell the Senator from Pennsylvania the decision of this \nChamber today I think was the wrong one, to deny food stamps to these \nchildren. It is one that we will pay for over and over and over again. \nA hungry child in this country without appropriate nutrition is a child \nwho is likely to have more medical problems,\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\nlikely to fall behind in school, more likely to become a future welfare \nor crime statistic.\n\n  I cannot understand why this Congress, like so many businesses, and I \nguess so many people, cannot look ahead beyond the next budget. We live \nin a country where the biggest growth industry is the construction of \nprisons. There are 19 cities in my home State of Illinois competing \nright now not for a new business but for the latest prison to be built \nby our State. We have more people under lock and key in America than in \nany country other than Russia. Why?\n  Is it because we are just more violent, more prone to criminal \nactivity? I think it is a much deeper question. It goes to our \nchildren, whether or not some of these kids can be rescued, can be \nsaved, can be put on the right path in their lives. It involves a \ncommitment. Yes, I believe in three strikes you're out, but I also \nbelieve in taking the necessary action to avoid the first strike. Give \na child a chance with prenatal nutrition, with appropriate infant \nnutrition, with Head Start, with education, with mentoring, the kind of \ncommunity support that counts. And yet this body I am afraid considers \nthat to be squandering of national assets. We have all the money in the \nworld to build a prison. We do not have all the money in the world to \nimprove our schools. When my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, \ncomes forward with the crumbling schools proposal that says let us make \nsure the schools our kids attend are safe, that they have appropriate \ncare for the children there, we find out that there are many people \nparticularly on the Republican side of the aisle who say that is \nsomething that our Government should not worry about. I disagree. The \nshiniest new building in many cities across America is a prison; the \none that is crumbling down is a school. What message does that send to \nchildren, to families and to our Nation?\n  When this Senate decided today to defeat my amendment not to send \nfood stamps to these children, I am afraid it is a decision we will pay \nfor for years to come. These kids are likely to become citizens of the \nUnited States. They are likely to be our neighbors, kids seeking jobs \nin the future. We are penny-wise and pound-foolish when we do not \nprovide the basic necessities of life like food and health care and \neducation for children.\n  So, yes, I supported welfare reform. I think the economy has \nsustained the kind of growth which has given welfare reform an \nopportunity to flourish but, for goodness sakes, why aren't we \ninvesting in our children? Why has this become so partisan and so \nstrident that when we stand up with the Levin amendment and talk about \nmore time for vocational education so that kids can get off welfare and \ngo to work, it becomes a partisan vote? The Republicans say no; the \nDemocrats say yes. Nothing happens. For the kid, the young man, the \nyoung woman who needs a chance at education, that was an important \nvote. And this Senate said no. That does not make sense. End welfare \nbut end it responsibly. Make an investment in America's kids, an \ninvestment that will pay off for many generations to come.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to quickly respond, if I could, to just a \ncouple of comments. I hope we will not stand here and say that the \nwelfare program, the changes that we made in the last Congress have \nbeen a failure. They have been a great success. Look in my home State \nof Kansas where welfare rolls have gone down 30 percent. And, yes, we \nhave had a strong economy, but in the past we have had a strong economy \nwhen the welfare rolls have gone up. You have to change the incentives \nin the program. That is what we did in the last Congress. It was a \npositive step to move forward. So I hope that we do not make something \na failure when it has been a strong success and people are working now \nrather than receiving payments from the Government and they are having \nmore self-confidence themselves.\n  I think this is good for people, too, because with the past system \nthe people on welfare, along with the people that paid for welfare, \nthought it was a horrible failure and a horrible system. We have \nchanged the dynamics, and we have changed the incentives in this \nprogram to where the people are incentivized to work. And they feel \ngood about it. They feel better about it. And this is a program that is \ngoing to work.\n  I think there are a lot of things we could spend money on that might \nwell be good, but we have tended to do a lot of that in the past, to \nthe point we are over $5 trillion in the hole. So that we just cannot \nkeep voting for everything to be able to do it or else we are not going \nto get in balance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6299-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MOST-FAVORED-NATION STATUS FOR CHINA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the comments \nof the Senator from Michigan where he was addressing a foreign policy \nconcern, and that is China.\n  Yesterday, the House voted on most-favored-nation status and extended \nthat status toward China even though we are having a great deal of \ndifficulty in that country, and I do think we need to take additional \nsteps in addressing this issue of China and our relationships back and \nforth.\n  We have had problems with that nation expanding weapons of mass \ndestruction, selling them to some of our enemies that we have around \nthe world, particularly Iran. We have had problems with religious \npersecution, with forced abortion in that nation, and I think we need \nto step up and pass the issue of MFN.\n  The Senator from Michigan has a start in his bill when he is talking \nabout some different areas where we can put pressure on that nation in \nour relationship there to encourage more religious freedom taking place \nand to discourage things like weapons proliferation.\n\n\n                         Religious Persecution\n\n  On Monday of this week, Senators Joe Lieberman and Robert Bennett, \nalong with myself, hosted a forum on religious persecution around the \nworld. We found this was not just a problem in China. It is in the \nMiddle East. It is in Africa. And we are talking about an issue that \ngoes beyond just certain levels of discrimination, all the way to the \npoint of slavery, to murder that is taking place in those countries.\n  A number of us came forward with solutions. Let's create a register \nof those people who are being persecuted around the world, and let's \nstart to highlight it. Let's start a commission in areas of the Middle \nEast, in Africa, focusing on this issue of the need for religious \nfreedom. It is a founding principle of this country. People came here \nseeking freedom, seeking religious freedom. We are and we always will \nbe best as a nation when we talk about principles. This is a guiding \nprinciple that we need to continue to move forward beyond this debate \nof MFN and focus nationally on this issue of what is taking place \nthere. Create the register, create the commissions, focusing on this \narea. And I look forward to working with my colleagues, Senator \nLieberman and many others. I hope it will begin in us talking about \nsomething that is so basic to America, religious freedom. We need to \nimplement that and move those around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in behalf of Senator Grassley, I submit \na modified amendment, No. 467. It has been cleared on both sides. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 467, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 689, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) Religious choice.--The State, in permitting an \n     individual to choose a managed care entity under clause (i) \n     shall permit the individual to have access to appropriate \n     religiously-affiliated long-term care facilities that are not \n     pervasively sectarian and that provide comparable non-\n     sectarian medical care. With respect to such access, the \n     State shall permit an individual to select a facility that is \n     not a part of the network of the managed care entity if such \n     network does not provide access to appropriate faith-based \n     facilities.

I yield any time we have on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. If there be no \nfurther debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 467), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 473, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in behalf of Senator Hutchison, I seek \nthe withdrawal of amendment No. 473. I ask it be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 473) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 493\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kennedy has an amendment, No. 493, Kennedy-\nLautenberg. Senator Lautenberg introduced it for Senator Kennedy, to \nexempt severely disabled aliens from the ban on receipt of supplemental \nincome. It is at the desk. I indicate from our side that there is no \nobjection. I understand from the Democratic side there is no objection.\n  Senator Kennedy, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct. I thank the chairman of the committee \nfor his consideration. It is a serious issue and a heartrending issue \nfor many different individuals. The willingness to accept this \namendment is something we are very, very appreciative of. If I might \njust say a few words about it.\n  Under the budget reconciliation bill, legal immigrants who are \nalready in this country can keep their SSI benefits. But for those who \ncome in the future, SSI is only for citizens. They have to become \ncitizens to qualify in the future, so your sponsor must take care of \nyou until then.\n  This amendment creates a small exception to that rule. It enables \nimmigrants who are too disabled to qualify for citizenship to retain \ntheir SSI eligibility.\n  Some immigrants and refugees--though not many--become too disabled to \nqualify for citizenship. Under this bill, their sponsors have to care \nfor them for life. If they don't have sponsors, they have nowhere to \nturn.\n  One example is Vien Vu. His family fled Vietnam after years of \nserving side-by-side with the United States Armed Forces. But Vien Vu \nhas Downs syndrome. He is 34 years old. The rest of his family has \nbecome American citizens but Vien will never qualify for citizenship. \nHis family needs SSI to care for him for the rest of his life.\n  Mendel Tsadovich is a Latvian Holocaust survivor who is too mentally \nretarded to qualify for naturalization. In 1992, he and his family \nescaped as refugees from the anti-Semitism of the former Soviet Union. \nHe is now 61 and living in New York. He is the only surviving member of \nhis family, and depends on SSI for assistance. He has no sponsor.\n  Vien and Mendel are the lucky ones. They arrived before passage of \nlast year's welfare law. So the reconciliation bill will continue their \nSSI coverage. But what about the Viens and Mendels who arrive in the \nfuture?\n  With the passage of the Lautenberg amendment this morning, my \namendment costs almost nothing. CBO scores it as having little budget \nimpact. So, we can help all those like Vien and Mendel and still \nbalance the budget by 2002.\n  The number of immigrants this amendment affects is small, perhaps \nonly a few thousand people a year. But these immigrants often depend on \nSSI benefits for their survival. If they do not have the ability to \nbecome citizens, Congress should not deny them the SSI benefits they \nneed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a couple of seconds. I want to \nsay, some may ask why I accepted this. Actually, it's a very tiny group \nof people. It covers those who are so seriously disabled that the \ndisability disqualifies them from completing their naturalization \nprocess. Therefore, they cannot become citizens. They are noncitizens, \nbut legal. As a result, they are denied benefits described in the \nKennedy amendment for only that reason. So I agree to accept that.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 493) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 469\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the next amendment in order is by Senator \nSpecter, No. 469. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Santorum, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, \nand Senator Campbell. It would ensure that $1.5 billion over 5 years of \nMedicare premium subsidies is provided to the low-income elderly with \nannual incomes up to $12,000 through expansion of the existing Medicaid \nProgram, instead of what is in the current bill, to add $1.5 billion \nthrough a new State block grant program.\n  This amendment is preferable, by doing it on an existing program \ninstead of setting up a new bureaucracy. It is necessary because the \npremium increases in the bill are permanent, but there is no guarantee \nof permanent subsidies for the 3.2 million poor senior citizens covered \nunless this amendment would be adopted.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I point out that this amendment would \nhelp seniors making, on an annual basis, between $9,500 a year and \n$11,900 a year. It would simply take the principles of the Medicaid \nProgram and carry them forward, and simply say those folks deserve to \nget help in the Medicare payment because they are so desperately poor. \nThis is well established in Medicaid. We are now applying it to a new \narea and saying, rather than 120 percent of poverty, we are saying 120 \npercent of poverty to 150 percent of poverty. It is very sensible. It \nhelps people.\n  This program is going to sunset in 5 years, but their costs are not \ngoing to sunset in 5 years. We think it is an amendment which both \nsides are willing to vote for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I make a point of order that the \namendment is not germane.\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to waive.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yesterday we provided $1.5 billion in \nnew funds to assist Medicare beneficiaries between 120 and 150 percent \nof the poverty line with their part B premiums. That was expected under \nthe agreement that we entered into with the White House. We provided \nthese funds as a State program, providing maximum flexibility to reach \nthese individuals in the greatest need. We do not need this additional \nprogram, which would create a new entitlement, which we can't afford. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, or to support the point of \norder.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania to waive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted, yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 121 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That vote took 17 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the leader will be--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, I ask that there \nbe order in the Chamber and that Members wishing to pursue discussions, \nand especially staff wishing to pursue discussions, take those \ndiscussions to the Cloakroom. We are not going to proceed until there \nis order so the Senator from New Mexico can be heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I repeat my question. How much time did \nthe last vote take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last vote took approximately 17 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are operating on a unanimous-consent agreement that \nsays we will take 10 minutes for rollcall votes. I understand the \nleader will be along shortly and indicate we that will go to the 10-\nminute rule. But I am not going to hold Senators to that unless the \nleader comes and confirms it. But 17 minutes, that is an extra hour for \npeople today; it seems like to me maybe longer.\n\n  We have a little business we can conduct at this point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 495\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are willing to accept a Conrad amendment dealing \nwith the nurse aide registry.\n  I ask the Senator, are you willing to accept that on your side?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We yield back any time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 495) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSpecter's next amendment, which is 470, that it be temporarily set \naside. And the Senator would like 30 seconds to explain why he is \nagreeing to that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an amendment related to \ndisproportionate share. Some States have been hit very hard because \nsome of the funds have been used for mental health facilities. There \nhas already been substantial improvement; illustratively, for \nPennsylvania, which had been on the books to sustain a loss of $1.7 \nbillion, it is down to $750 million. And the managers are now \nconsidering an amendment which would improve that situation materially.\n  So I agree with my distinguished colleague from New Mexico to set it \naside temporarily with the hope we may be able to work it out, and \nultimately have it withdrawn if a satisfactory resolution can be \narrived at.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is set aside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask one further unanimous consent, \nthat Senator Mikulski's amendment No. 489 follow Senator Specter's \namendment, which he will proceed with now, which is amendment 471.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with \nregard to the point of order under the Byrd rule which was raised on \nthe balanced billing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point of order is the regular \norder.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask, how is the Chair going to \nrule? Parliamentary inquiry. Can't do that? I withdraw the question.\n  I move to waive the point of order and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have some explanation what we are \nabout to vote on?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I urge my colleagues to vote no, against the motion \nto waive the Budget Act, so that we protect patients in these sorts of \nvery special Medicare Choice programs who, unless we give them the \nprotection, unless we vote no, doctors are going to be able to charge \nwhatever they want. Everybody else under Medicare is under something \ncalled balanced billing. Balanced billing means you can only charge 15 \npercent more than what Medicare pays for it. This was agreed to in 1989 \nwhen we did a massive Medicare reform.\n  We should not be able to take a sort of special fee for service part \nof the new Medicare Choice and suddenly say that the doctor can charge \nthem anything they want. They have no protection from balanced billing \nrules which protects all other people who are under Medicare. And it is \nthe law of the land. It is a very important principle, a very important \npoint. And since we have\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\ndone this in 1989, since we have put a cap on the balanced billing, \nwhich the other side would have us let go, seniors have saved $2 \nbillion since 1989.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 40 seconds of that to Senator \nGramm. I will use 20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, by giving a broad range of choices to our \nseniors, we have given them the ability to opt into a private fee-for-\nservice health insurance policy.\n  Now, if we come along and start restricting the way that a private \nhealth insurance policy can function, and tell them how they are to \nbill for physician services, we take away the whole competitive nature \nof what we are trying to create. I know some people do not like the \nidea of expanding choices for seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. But that is what we have done, and we need to preserve the \nability of these mechanisms to function. It is important we waive the \npoint of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, essentially this amendment will gut \nMSA's and private fee-for-service programs that come into this bill \nwhich permits seniors a wide array of options.

Mr. President, the Democratic leader and I have talked \nabout the necessity to try to complete votes in the time prescribed. We \nhave been warning and urging Members to stay in the Chamber to do these \nvotes. It has taken about 50 minutes to do two votes. We did cut that \nlast vote off with one Member missing. This is the final warning. From \nhere on in after 10 minutes we are going to turn in the vote.\n  So please stay in the Chamber. Let's vote. We can save ourselves an \nhour or more if we do that. Please do that. Please cooperate with us \nand we can get our work done and get it done an hour or so earlier.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe under the rule, Senator \nSpecter is up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 471\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the cuts on \nindirect grants in medical education. In 48 States there are 1,085 \nteaching hospitals which perform very, very valuable services. In \naddition to teaching professionals, they give basic health services, \ncustomarily in the inner cities. With a disproportionate share coming \ninto effect, their financing is very, very important.\n  Beyond that, they give highly specialized patient care so that if you \nhave some really extraordinary medical problem, where you go is to \nthese graduate medical educational institutions.\n  These cuts would be crippling. I suggest that as a matter of priority \nthey be eliminated from this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 40 seconds of the 1 minute to \nSenator Roth.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. Simply put, \naccording to most experts, Medicare today overpays for indirect medical \neducation, which is a special Federal subsidy for training new doctors. \nWe have substantially but responsibly reduced those payments in our \nbill, and, indeed, these payments will remain very generous. This \namendment is not needed and would prevent us from meeting our budget \ninstructions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment will cost us $5.6 billion \nin this bill alone. The explanation given by the distinguished chairman \nseems to me to indicate we are going to be more than fair with \nreference to the indirect payment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe I have 7 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. President, this will not require a waiver of the Budget Act, and \nalthough the sum is not insignificant, this is really important for \nAmerica.\n  I ask that Senator D'Amato be listed as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Some Senators might wonder why it is not subject to a \npoint of order when it cuts $5.6 billion. That is because it is a \nmotion to strike, and motions to strike are in order under the Budget \nAct regardless of their impact.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 494) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 489\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. On behalf of Mr. Wellstone and \nmyself, we have an amendment at the desk that will strike the committee \naction and restore something called the Boren amendment. The Boren \namendment was passed and signed by President Reagan in 1981 to ensure \nadequate access to health care services for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n  The Boren amendment simply stated that payment rates for hospitals \nand nursing homes must be reasonable and adequate to meet the cost of \noperating the facilities. That is reimbursements by Medicaid. Now, \nunder the committee action, we would take that away. We would give \npermission to States to further reduce payment rates to nursing homes \nat this time. This would have a devastating affect on quality care, and \nit would have a devastating affect on access to care for beneficiaries.\n  The simple fact is that Medicaid payment rates to nursing homes does \naffect quality and our ability to meet the standards that are mandated \nfor health and safety. Nursing homes have stopped taking Medicaid \npatients. Because of that, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds of my minute to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are always looking for bipartisanship. \nThe President is in favor of repealing the Boren amendment. The \nNational Governors' Association is in favor of repealing the Boren \namendment. The amendment of the Senator from Maryland will raise the \ndeficit and reduce our savings by $1.2 billion. How does anybody know \nwhat is reasonable and adequate? The Boren amendment has produced \nendless lawsuits. States want to negotiate with hospitals and get the \nbest rate they can. Repealing the Boren amendment takes it out of the \ncourts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we negotiated a balanced budget with \nthe President and the Governors, the administration regularly said, \n``We want to provide flexibility.'' What is flexibility? Get rid of the \nBoren amendment. That is what they kept saying. Provide flexibility \ninstead of the rigidity brought on by lawsuits. The Boren amendment \nshould be dead. The President is not for it. Now someone wants to put \nit back in, and it will cost $1.2 billion to put something back in that \ndidn't work.\n  I move to table the Mikulski amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  On rollcall vote 124, I voted ``no.'' It was my intention to vote \n``yes.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nchange my vote. This will in no way change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 488\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order is the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, No. 488.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  We can move this along if Members in the room would withdraw their \nconversations to the Cloakroom, and if the staff will reserve their \nconversations.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could just say to you, I am not \ngoing to start, if I could ask for order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, we are not going \nto proceed until the Senator from Minnesota can be fairly heard. The \nstaff will reserve their conversations. It will help to move this \nalong.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is hard in this process because \npeople want to talk. But these amendments have consequences for \npeople's lives.\n  I would like to wait until we have order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we can't hear.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have people talking all around me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is correct.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment with Senator Mikulski. We just \nrepealed the Boren provision, which was an effort to make sure that \nthere was reasonable and adequate rates of reimbursement. This was for \nnursing homes, children's hospitals, group care for people with \ndisabilities.\n  What we do in this amendment is a compromise, colleagues. We just \nsimply require that States provide assurance to the Secretary that the \nrates will be actuarially sufficient to ensure adequate care.\n  We don't have any vague standard. This is an actuarially sufficiency \nstandard. We are just saying to States, let's have some standard that \nyou can say you have had an independent analysis done and that you are \nproviding the resources so the children's hospitals and nursing homes \nand group\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\nhomes can provide adequate care to very vulnerable seniors, children \nand the disabled.\n  Please vote for this compromise. We can't wipe out all of these \nstandards.\n  Other than that, I do not feel strongly about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would Senator Roth like some time on this?\n  I will give you half the time.\n  Mr. ROTH. All right. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this \namendment. It raises again the same questions that were raised in \nrespect to the Boren amendment. The history of the Boren amendment is a \nclassic example of unintended consequences as its been used to increase \ncosts of the program rather than control costs. The Governors are in \nopposition as well as the administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate has just overwhelmingly \nagreed we do not need the Boren amendment back on the horizon, and I \nview this as a new, similar burden on trying to get reasonably priced \ncare. Perhaps it will be known in the future not as the Boren amendment \nbut the Wellstone amendment. But believe you me, it will be just as \negregiously antiefficient as the previous one, for there will be many, \nmany court interpretations of the language that is now going to be \ninserted as a test of whether or not the charges are fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make a point of order that amendment violates section \n310 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to waive that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Baucus has an amendment, No. 491, regarding \ncost-sharing provisions. We are prepared to accept that amendment at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the chairman of the committee has \nadequately described the amendment. I very much appreciate that he will \naccept the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 491) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the motion to reconsider is \nlaid on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 490\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now I believe amendment No. 490 by Senator Kennedy is \nnext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We shall not proceed to it until we have \norder. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say for Senators' benefit, it looks like there \nare only three to four amendments left. So, if you can bear with us for \njust a little longer, I know this has been an ordeal. The only \nremaining thing after that would be the points of order, if any, that \nthey might have on the Democrat side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have a few.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If we could get the attention of the Senate \nagain. If we could have conversations removed to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 40 seconds, 20 seconds to \nmy colleague, Senator Dodd. We offered this together.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Council on Education and \nvirtually all of the higher education agencies and organizations, as \nwell as the student organizations. Effectively, it will reduce tuitions \nby $1.4 billion over the next 5 years, and it is fully paid for by the \nreduction in terms of the guarantees to the guaranty agencies from 98 \nto 95 percent of the loans.\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n There are offsets there. The process that we have done in terms of the \noffsets is virtually identical to what was done by the Republican \ninitiative in the reconciliation bill. I hope it will be successful. It \nwill reduce student tuitions by at least $70.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are $26 billion outstanding in student \nloans. This amendment has two parts. It does away with the \nautomatically required administrative cost allowance, which is \nunnecessary. That can be dealt with in the higher education bill. And \nit cuts in half the origination fees, 4 percent to 2. It is a very big \nissue for families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kennedy]. Briefly, this \namendment would rewrite title VII of the reconciliation bill, which \nincludes the student loan provisions reported by the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources by a vote of 17 to 1.\n  I have two major reasons for opposing this amendment. First, it will \nharm students by destabilizing the guaranteed loan program; and, \nsecond, it addresses issues which belong in the debate of \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act--not the budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  Let me be clear. Adoption of the Kennedy amendment will harm \nstudents--not help them. No one in the Senate is more committed to \nimproving educational opportunities than I am. I have worked to \nstrengthen student loan programs for over 22 years. If I honestly \nbelieved that this amendment was in the best interests of students, I \nwould support it. It is precisely because of my commitment to the well \nbeing of students, however, that I so strongly oppose this amendment.\n  I want to take a few minutes to explain exactly why this amendment is \nnot in the best interests of students or their families and why it was \nrejected when it was considered by the Labor Committee.\n  First of all, it is important to understand that the proposal which \nwas approved by the committee was carefully crafted to preserve two \nviable student loan programs--the Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL] \nProgram, guaranteed loans, and the Federal Direct Loan Program. This \nproposal respects the so-called truce between the two programs which \nwas reflected in the portion of the budget agreement calling for a fair \ndistribution of savings between the two programs.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts breaks this truce. In \nthe name of helping students, this amendment would drain such a \nsubstantial portion of funds from guaranty agencies that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate of the amendment assumes the \nfailure of many of these agencies.\n  The provisions approved by the committee already recapture $1 billion \nin guaranty agency reserve funds over the next 5 years. The recall of \nthese funds is conducted in such a way that guaranty agencies with low \nreserves--Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, \nMinnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, \nWashington, and Wisconsin--will not be forced to close their doors to \nthe students who depend upon them.\n  The Kennedy amendment would nearly double the savings expected from \nguaranty agencies--calling for an additional $960 million reduction \nover 5 years. Because the amendment eliminates any assurance that \nguaranty agencies will receive an administrative cost allowance [ACA] \nfrom section 458 funds, the reductions absorbed by guaranty agencies \ncould well be even higher.\n  The guaranteed student loan program serves 80 percent of the \ninstitutions of higher education in this country and provides over 60 \npercent of total student loan volume. Yet, the Kennedy amendment makes \nno provision whatsoever for mitigating the severe disruption to student \nborrowers which will occur when agencies inevitably fail. If the goal \nis to enhance the direct loan program by crippling the guaranteed \nprogram, this amendment will be remarkably effective. However, if the \ngoal truly is to help students, we should be working together in the \nappropriate forum--which is reauthorization, not reconciliation.\n  Moreover, I would note that the proposed reduction in the loan \norigination fee charged to students would not take effect until July \n1998. There is no compelling reason to consider this provision outside \nof the current effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.\n  Before closing, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the \nproposal that was approved by the Labor Committee and provide the \nhistory and context for this debate.\n  The budget agreement approved by the Senate reflects the strong \nbipartisan support for education. The agreement provides for $35 \nbillion in education related tax provisions, and assumes increased \nFederal support for special education, Head Start, and funding for \nliteracy programs. The budget agreement supports providing an \nadditional $7.6 billion for Pell grants allowing the maximum grant to \ngrow from $2,700 to $3,000.\n  In addition, the subsidy for student loans is assumed to grow from \n$3.9 billion in 1998 to $4.1 billion in 2002. This will support growth \nin Federal student loan volume from $28.8 billion in 1998 to $35.8 \nbillion in 2002. These provisions provide an unprecedented level of \nsupport for educational opportunity for students at all levels of \neducation.\n  In order to accommodate this unprecedented level of support for \nstudents, the Senate budget resolution requires $1.792 billion in \nsavings over 5 years from mandatory spending under the jurisdiction of \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n  The savings required by the agreement and submitted by the committee \nwill not increase costs, reduce benefits, or limit access to loans for \nstudents and their families. In accordance with the budget agreement, \nthis proposal attempts to maintain an equitable balance in the savings \nthat are taken from the Federal Family Education Loan Program [FFEL] \nand the Federal Direct Lending Program [FDLP].\n  The budget submission approved by the committee achieves the required \nsavings by recalling $1.028 billion in excess guaranty agency reserves, \neliminating the $10 direct loan origination fee, and reducing the \nDepartment of Education's entitlement for the administration of the \nFederal direct lending program by $604 million. This language preserves \na very delicate balance--it achieves major savings and preserves the \nviability of both loan programs, so that students will not be at risk \nof losing access to loans. The key provisions of title VII as reported \nby the Committee on Labor and Human Resources include:\n\n\n     A. Elimination of the Direct Lending Loan Origination Payment\n\n  This proposal repeals the provision authorizing the Federal payment \nof $10 per loan to schools and/or alternate originators who make direct \nloans. This repeal will provide five-year savings of $160 million.\n\n\n              B. Recall of Excess Guaranty Agency Reserves\n\n  The committee proposal requires the recall of $1.028 billion in \nreserves and requires each guaranty agency to deposit its share of the \ntotal excess reserves into a newly created restricted account in annual \npayments over the next five years.\n\n\n               C. Reductions in Section 458 Expenditures\n\n  Section 458 of the Higher Education Act provides funds to the \nSecretary of Education for the administrative expenses associated with \nthe direct lending program as well as the administrative cost allowance \npaid to guaranty agencies for administration of FFEL programs. The \ncommittee proposal reduces section 458 expenditures in conformity with \nthe budget agreement resulting in savings of $603 million over 5 years. \nThe Department will continue to receive over $3.3 billion in this \naccount over the next 5 years.\n  In order to ensure that these reductions are not redirected from \ndirect lending to the FFEL program and to ensure that an equitable \nbalance in savings is maintained between the two programs, the \ncommittee included a provision that reaffirms the Department of \nEducation's obligation to continue to pay the administrative cost \nallowance to the guaranty agencies. This authority is capped at $170 \nmillion in each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and at $150 million in \nfiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n  In summary, these provisions reflect a commitment to preserving two \nviable student loan programs. Second, they reflect the belief that \nsubstantive\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nchanges in student aid policy should not be included within \nreconciliation but should be fully and carefully considered as part our \ncomprehensive effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. \nConsistent with these principles, our proposal meets our budget \ninstruction, preserves two loan programs, and retains the framework of \nthe budget agreement. It deserves the support of the full Senate.\n  Finally, let me say that we are here today due to the budget \nagreement reached between the President and the leadership of the House \nand Senate. Whatever the disagreements may be about specific details, \nthere is broad support for this agreement and its objectives. That is \nillustrated by the 17-to-1 vote for the Labor Committee's submission \nand by the similar margins of support for the proposals reported by \nother committees.\n  Certainly, the agreement is a series of compromises. Implicit in \ncompromise is the fact that neither party got everything it wanted. In \nthe student loan area, the core compromise was that a truce was to be \ndeclared in the battle between the Federal Family Education Loan \nProgram--guaranteed loans--and the Federal Direct Loan Program. The \napproximately $1.8 billion in savings was to be equitably divided \nbetween the two programs.\n  The proposal reported by the committee honors that compromise: 57 \npercent of the savings are made in the guaranteed loan program and the \nremaining 43 percent come from direct lending. The amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts would destroy that balance.\n  When filling in the detail of a broad compromise, there is always the \nurge to push further toward one's preference. What the Senator is \nattempting to do is therefore understandable. But, we need to recognize \nthe amendment for what it is. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator, the chairman of the committee on \nLabor, Health and Human Resources. The chairman opposes this.\n  Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment is a substitute to the Labor \nCommittee's title. It violates the bipartisan agreement that we made \nwith the President and with Democrats and Republicans. It is not \ngermane to this bill before us. It violates the Byrd rule because it \nincreases spending in the year 2002 and thereafter without any offsets. \nThe Kennedy amendment reduces the student loan origination fees, and is \noffset by significant reductions in revenues to the lenders and \nguaranty agencies participating in student loan programs.\n  With that, I make a point of order that the Kennedy amendment is a \nviolation of the Budget Act and the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to waive.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 490\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to address my vote on the Kennedy-\nDodd amendment regarding savings to be generated from direct and \nguaranteed loan programs. Although, I have ardently supported efforts \nto increase Pell grants and improve the ability of millions of American \nfamilies to afford a college education for their children, the Kennedy-\nDodd amendment would have disrupted the guaranteed student loan program \nsubstantially. It would have upset the balanced approach in the budget \nagreement to derive savings equitably from both direct and guaranteed \nloan programs.\n  I am advised that the Kennedy-Dodd amendment would create undue \nhardship on student borrowers by adversely impacting guaranteed \nlenders, which would lose part of their loan origination fees.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, \nand Senator Dodd as the Senate considers these issues in the context of \nthe Higher Education Act reauthorization later in the 105th Congress.\n\n\n                Motion to Waive the Budget Act Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that the motion of the Senator \nfrom Texas to waive the Budget Act with respect to the point of order \nlodged by Senator Conrad last night be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Conrad had lodged the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the amendment by Senator \nMcCain.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have to complete business on this. We have withdrawn \nthe waiver.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I make a point of order that section 5822 \nof the bill violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And the amendment falls?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 474\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe the next order of business is \nSenator McCain's amendment. That is amendment No. 474. That is McCain-\nLott-Domenici.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 474, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to modify \nthat amendment by adding just the following words: ``. . . including \nemergency auto service by nonprofit organizations, that . . .'' I send \nthe modification to the desk, and I understand the minority has no \nobjection to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.

It has been approved by the \nCommerce Committee on both sides, Democrat and Republican, and there is \nno objection from the minority side with reference to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n474, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 474), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I ask the minority, there is a D'Amato amendment we \nare asking if you can clear. We are getting close to the end here.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will accept that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 502\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the D'Amato amendment No. 502, Medicare \nantiduplication provisions, be called up. We have agreed with the \nminority and they with us that this is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 502) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, according to our records, we have four \namendments, but they are all waiting to see what the managers' \namendment includes in it. If it includes the proper subject matter, \nthen there will not be a presentation of those four amendments. So I \nthink the managers are working on that, and maybe we need a little bit \nof time while they finish it, and the four Senators can look at it to \nsee if it takes care of their concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Kennedy amendment No. \n492.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, that is correct.\n  Senator Kennedy desires to withhold his amendment to see what the \nmanagers' amendment does; is that correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kerry's amendment No. 496. I gather that you \nwant to wait.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Senator Kerry wants to wait and see what the \nmanagers' amendment does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And Senator Rockefeller's amendment No. 503, we believe \nthe same holds, and Senator Kennedy's amendment regarding part B.\n  Might I discuss a few matters with the ranking minority member? I \nbelieve when we finish this, we will be finished with amendments. The \nonly thing I can imagine left would be points of order to be lodged by \nanyone. We have none on our side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have five in total that we will be \nhappy to show the majority. I think Senator Murray has a point of \norder, and then we have the four remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the time would be best spent if you let us \nsee those. Maybe we can dispose of those and maybe agree we not have \nany votes, depending on what they are.\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 506\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that the chairman of the Finance Committee \nis ready with the managers' amendment, and I yield the floor. The \namendment is numbered 506.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 506\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n506, the managers' amendment, be called up, and I send a modification \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under a previous order, the Senator has a right to modify his \namendment, and the amendment is so modified.\n  The modification follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       On page 774, strike lines 13 through 15, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) for fiscal year 1999, 92 percent;\n       ``(B) for fiscal year 2000, 85 percent; and\n       ``(C) for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, 80 percent.\n       On page 775, strike lines 21 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(C) States with state 1995 dsh spending amounts above 3 \n     percent.--In the case of any State with a State 1995 DSH \n     spending amount that is more than 3 percent of the Federal \n     medical\n       On page 779, line 10, strike ``2000'' and insert ``2001''.\n       On page 779, line 11, strike ``2001'' and insert ``2002''.\n       On page 779, line 10, strike ``2002'' and insert ``2003 and \n     thereafter''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the managers' amendment with the \nmodification has been approved on both sides of the aisle. I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, could someone explain what is in the \nmanagers' amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I am happy to explain to my distinguished friend from \nWest Virginia. It includes two Medicare hospital-related provisions. \nThe first is a modification to the Medicare PPS, exempt hospital \npayments, and the second is a hospital wage index classification.\n  The second makes three additions to the Medicaid provisions. These \ninclude a Grassley amendment that was adopted in committee on the \neffect of managed care on individuals with special needs, a \nclarification on the definition of provider taxes, and continuation of \ncertain 1115 waivers. There are four provisions on welfare, \nclarification of the language on SSI, and Medicaid benefits of certain \nIndians. It makes a conforming amendment on work activities, and it \nconfirms the maintenance-of-effort requirement to the existing welfare \nblock grant. It also requires that half of the payments for job \nplacement be provided after an individual has been placed in the work \nforce for at least 6 months.\n  Finally, the modification to the managers' amendment also modifies \nthe formula for achieving savings in the Disproportionate Share \nHospital Program. The amendment provides a smoother transition for the \nStates and delays the restrictions on payment to mental health \nfacilities.\n  As I said, Mr. President, all these amendments have been cleared by \nboth sides of the aisle. I urge their adoption.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I simply affirm the statement of the \ndistinguished chairman. These are agreed to on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment as \nmodified?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am not on the Budget Committee, I am not \non the Finance Committee, but I do have a right to have a little \nknowledge of what we are voting on. By my not being a member of those \ncommittees--it might very well be stated as to what we are voting on--I \nmay yet not understand it, but there are Senators in this body who can \nunderstand. It seems to me we are going a little fast.\n  Is this amendment divisible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment \nwould be divisible.\n  Mr. BYRD. How many divisions would there be?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There would be numerous divisions because the \namendment hits the bill in a number of diverse places. We are \nattempting to assert the exact number.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I say to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, I think you have been in this position and the position of \nthis chairman many, many times. I do not know whether we ever have a \nchance to be in exactly this position when we have a reconciliation \nbill like this.\n  I might say, I think this amendment fits together a lot of concerns \nand fulfills a lot of concerns about the bill by many, many Senators. I \nhope the Senator would not ask for its division, but rather ask us to \nspend more time discussing it, which I believe, even though the consent \nagreement says a minute on a side, I think you might be clearly within \nyour rights to say: This is a managers' amendment. Could we have some \nadditional time? Certainly I would not object.\n  I objected one time in my life to giving the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia additional time when time had run out, and I vividly \nremembered that for at least 5 years. It seemed like every time you \nlooked at me it was reminding me that I had jumped up and objected to \nyour getting time, additional time. I have never done that again, so I \nwould not do it now.\n  I just wonder if that makes any sense to my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me attempt to respond to the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  I have a sense of what my responsibility is. I do not know what is in \nthe managers' amendment. I have understood, in listening here, that \nthere are various Senators who have amendments which are qualified and \nwhich are listed that they will call up unless the managers' amendment \nis satisfactory to them in respect to their several amendments.\n  Now, if each amendment is called up, we at least get 2 minutes for an \nexplanation. We get no explanation here of what is in this managers' \namendment. It is not my desire to hold up action on this measure. It is \nsomewhat embarrassing to me to have to stand and admit that I don't \nknow what is in this amendment. I have voted on amendments today that I \nhad very, very slender knowledge as to what I was voting on.\n  I am not blaming anyone for this. I am not saying this to be critical \nof anyone. But I am concerned that here we are, before the American \npeople, and it should be obvious to anyone who is viewing these actions \nthat we are taking that many of us do not know what we are doing, what \nwe are voting on, and these are very complex amendments. This is a very \ncomplex bill.\n\n  We are at a great disadvantage because we have only 20 hours on a \nreconciliation measure. I tried last year to get 50 hours on a \nreconciliation bill, and I believe I got a majority of votes, but I \nbelieve I lost because it ran afoul of the Byrd rule. Therefore, it \nrequired 60 votes. Thank heavens for the Byrd rule.\n  But, Mr. President, I do have a duty to my own conscience, if to no \none else, and I am pretty sure I have a great duty to my constituents, \nto try to find out what's in the amendment we are about to vote on. In \ndoing so, I am holding up the measure, I am delaying action on this \nmeasure. I am very well aware of it.\n  I know the burdens that are upon the leadership, the joint \nleadership. I know the burdens that are on the managers of this bill. \nI, at least, have some idea. They have done well. They have had heavy \nburdens. They have spent hours, they have spent hours when I was at \nhome with my wife, Lady Byrd, and my little dog, Billy Byrd. But they \nhave spent hours. I saw them working here last night. I cannot \nunderstand a great deal in watching that tube as to what is at issue \nhere.\n  So I am considering asking for a division here. I think we have to \nshock this Senate one way or another into a realization that we have to \nchange the rules with regard to reconciliation so that Members will \nhave more time\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nthan we have. Here we are, we have run out of time, yet Senators have \namendments that they want votes on. It is by unanimous consent that we \nhave 2 minutes of explanation between each amendment. That is no way to \noperate.\n  I cannot help it, Mr. Domenici cannot help it, Mr. Lautenberg cannot \nhelp it, the two leaders can't help it. That's the rule, 20 hours.\n  There are Senators who insist on having votes on their amendments, \nand I think they have a right to have votes on their amendment. We are \nconstrained by a rule here that just does not make sense. It may have \nmade sense at one time. It does not anymore. We are living at a \ndifferent time when we are under severe budget constraints and when the \nadministration and the leadership enter into some kind of agreement of \nwhich I am not a part and about which I know little, other than what I \nread in the newspaper.\n  So I have taken the floor here today to call attention to this very \nsad situation in which we are expected to vote on something without \nknowing what we are voting on. As I say, we are caught on the horns of \nthe dilemma, and I do not feel right within myself about raising these \npoints of concern.\n  Now, the distinguished manager of the measure has suggested that we \nhave an explanation of the amendments. That is all I am seeking in this \ninstance. But I think we ought to get our collective heads together and \ntry to work out some change in the rules whereby we will not be caught \nin this kind of situation.\n  The American people would be ashamed of us. I think they would be \nvery disappointed, and disappointed in me, too. They sent me up here to \nrepresent the people of West Virginia, and I don't know what I am \nvoting on here. Who can blame me? My staff can't find out overnight. \nThis morning when I came in, some of my staff stayed late into the \nevening hours. When I came in this morning, they didn't have the \namendments available. They hadn't been printed. We just can't operate \nwisely and with any kind of solid judgment in that fashion.\n\n  So I won't take more of the Senate's time now. But I do raise the \nspecter of asking for a division, and a request for a division under \nthe rules means that we vote on every divisible provision in that \nmeasure. And if I understood the Chair in response to my parliamentary \ninquiry, there must be scores of provisions which would be subject to \ndivision.\n  I am not going to put the Senate through that today, but I warn the \nSenate that we had better do something about this because, otherwise, \nsome Senator is going to feel conscience-stricken enough one day to \nstand up and use the rules, and there are some Senators who know \nsomething about the rules. So I raise that question here just to put \nSenators on notice that one Senator--one Senator--can cause all \nSenators to sit back and realize what we are doing and the way we are \ndoing it is not good, not good for the Senate, not good for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I could not agree with the Senator more. \nBut I think we have followed the rules--the general rules of the Budget \nAct, plus the Byrd rule interpretations--as best we can. I think \neveryone should know that one of the problems on any reconciliation \nbill is that when the time has run, people can still offer amendments. \nThat is written right into the statute. It says that when the time has \nrun, you can send amendments to the desk, and I assume one could stay \nforever--I don't mean literally--and they shall be voted on then and \nthere. I believe it says there is no time on the amendment. We have \ngone from allowing 1 minute to 2 minutes to 3 minutes per amendment. We \ndecided we would allow Senators to offer their amendments last night, \nthinking they would stay and offer them. We got caught in a trap \nbecause Senators started walking up to me and Senator Lautenberg and \ngiving us their amendments and asking us, as managers, to introduce \nthem for them. I guess I could have said no, and the literal \ninterpretation would have been that if you are not going to be around \nhere, you are not going to offer them.\n  That was the genesis of what happened this morning. We put them all \nin order and tried to encapsulate them so you could understand them, \nand there were 64 of them, plus a couple of points of order. So we have \ndone the best we could. As a matter of fact, I am very grateful. I \nwould guess that more than 30 amendments were withdrawn--maybe 35. \nOthers were clearly very simple amendments, and maybe in adopting them \nwe should have used a little more words of explanation than we did. If \nthat is the case, as to any Senator or anybody listening, we will just \ntry to do better. But that situation is the law.\n  Now, the law is, as you say it also. You can still divide those \namendments and have that minute on every one, I assume. You know the \nrules better than I. I have learned them a little bit now. But I \nbelieve, from this point on, we only have a few left. We would be very \nglad on this one--I asked the chairman, and he would be glad to explain \nit now as much as you would like and answer any questions. I understand \nwe would only have a few more, and three or four points of order, and, \nfinally, this ordeal will be behind us. Again, you have reminded us of \nour responsibility. I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't need to remind the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico of his responsibility or any other Senator of \nhis or her responsibility. As I said earlier, I am not complaining \nabout anyone. I sympathize and empathize with the managers of the \nmeasure. They have done the best they could. You can't do any better. \nWe have all been caught in this situation. It is not to our liking. But \nthe distinguished manager, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nsought to explain to me a minute ago, in 2 minutes, what was in this \nmanagers' packet. I didn't know anything, and when he completed, I \ndidn't know any more than when he started. As a matter of fact, I was \nprobably more confused. I think we would have had a little better \nexplanation if we had a division and had each amendment explained.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will yield, I would like to make a \ncomment. When Senator Byrd makes a statement, talks about a rule, talks \nabout the process, I think it is kind of like the investment banker's \nadvertising slogan that ``when they talk, everybody listens.'' When \nSenator Byrd speaks here, everybody listens, and much of the country at \nthe same time, because of the experience and knowledge that he brings \nto this body and the concern that he has for being forthright with our \nconstituents.\n  I would just like to say this to the Senator. There was a degree of \ndiligence--excessive haste, I agree. I will say one thing. I think that \nwe appropriately learned a lesson about the process of stacking votes. \nI even suggested to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia that \nperhaps another Byrd rule could be put into place. I don't have the \ncourage to offer it in my own name. But another Byrd rule might say \nthat no more than 5 amendments, or 4 or 5 votes, or something like \nthat, could be stacked at any time so that we would not get ourselves \ninto this mad dash not to deceive and not to obscure, but rather to \naccommodate this very complicated process.\n\n  As the Senator from West Virginia knows, the Senator from New Mexico \nand I spent roughly 2 months, almost every day, reviewing and \nnegotiating the points in the budget agreement. We tried--I speak for \nmyself, and I am sure the same situation occurred on the Republican \nside of the aisle--to keep our members on the committee informed \nbecause, as the distinguished former chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee knows, it is very hard to conduct an honest negotiation and \ndebate when there are 20 people in the room. So what we tried to do is \nconsolidate a consensus view and do it that way. So we met with the \ncommittee members and then we met with the members of the Democratic \nCaucus, because there were questions that arose.\n  So I have to say this to the distinguished Senator. In my 15 years \nhere, I honestly don't think that there has been a tighter review of \nmatters related to the budget resolution than I have seen, because I \nhave been on the Budget Committee almost all of the time that I have \nbeen here. We kept learning\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\neach year. I found the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, good to work with. We had lots of different views, but \nthe one thing that we didn't differ on is that the other person had a \nright to respect, a right to offer their opinion, and we did it that \nway. It got tedious at times, especially when one could not listen to \none's self. On the other hand, we did gain, seriously, a lot of \nknowledge during that period.\n  I would say this. As I look around the room, we have experts in \nspecific areas. If you want to talk about health, you know you would be \ntalking quickly to the Senator from Massachusetts, and others on \ndifferent matters of concern. And these matters were reviewed, not \nperhaps as thoroughly as we would have liked because we were committed \nto a time constraint overall. But, last night, I was here with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee until past 10 o'clock--\nabout 10:30--and we were hung up on a single amendment, reviewing it \nand trying to get into a position that we felt would satisfy our \nrespective constituencies in the Senate, and back home, and across the \ncountry, as well. So the effort was put in.\n  I think there is a mistake in the process, or a fault in the process, \nthat needs to be corrected. I thank the Senator for raising the issue \nbecause, in these last hours, I have heard complaints from other \nMembers of the Senate, as well, about this being too quick, too rushed. \nBut we had a commitment. This is an unusual budget, a budget committed \nto a goal of zero deficit in 5 years. A lot was packed into it. The \nnegotiations included members of the administration. It has been a very \ncomplicated, very tedious process, but no one, in my view shirked their \nresponsibility.\n  I hope that, from this point forward, we will remember another Byrd \nlesson. I remember many of them. Despite my white hair, I feel like I \nam going to ``professor'' Byrd's class when I do attend appropriations \nmeetings or other meetings. I would say this, ``professor\": I don't \nknow what kind of a report card I have gotten, but I hope that it is \nbetter than a failing one and that you will say, OK, go forward and \nlearn from this and next time I want to see a better performance. Thank \nyou very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't propose to have the answer to this \nproblem. But it just seems to me that we are always caught up against a \nholiday, where we have a break the next week. And here we have this \nbill, and we will have the tax portion of the reconciliation process \nthat will follow after that. And we are asked to cut a little of the \ntime off here, cut a little off there. It would seem to me that if we \ncould get started on these measures earlier, we would not be faced with \na situation in which the managers have to stay here far into the \nevening hours, while other Senators go home. It seems to me that if we \nhad been able to get to this measure earlier, we could have had more \ntime. But here we are, and it seems to work out this way upon every \noccasion, where we are backed up to a wall of some kind, where there is \nthe attempt to cut 20 hours down to 15, 12, or 10, or an attempt to cut \n50 down to 40 on the budget resolution. We always get the question, \n``Would you be willing to cut some time off of the 40 hours, cut it \ndown to 30?'' ``Would you be willing to go home and come back Monday \nand say that 15 of the hours, or 10 hours, or 20 hours have been \nconsumed?'' So I suppose these situations could be avoided.\n  Let me get down to the point. Would someone explain what is in this \namendment? As I explained, four or five Senators had amendments that \nthey wanted to call up, but they were waiting to see what was in the \nmanagers' amendment. Those amendments must have been pretty important; \notherwise, if they weren't in the managers' amendment, there would be a \nvote on each, some kind of vote, a vote by voice, a vote by division, \nor a vote by rollcall. There would be a vote and an explanation. \nPerhaps if we knew what was in those four or five major amendments, \nthat would help.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say this to my friend from West Virginia and to the two \nmanagers of the bill. Speaking from my perspective only, I think that \nthe explanations that have been given in 1 minute have been quite good. \nI am glad that the Senator from West Virginia asked for that, because I \nfelt pretty comfortable voting on each amendment. I say this to my \nfriend from West Virginia. If we look down the road to making this \nprocess better, we are not going to improve it by adding hours; we are \ngoing to improve it by making sure that amendments are offered before \nwe finish the debate. If we have 50 hours, people are still going to \noffer all of these amendments at the end, if you have a loophole like \nthis. I look forward to improving the system, but that we do it in \nwhatever hours we have, and amendments should be offered during that \ntime.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we are all speaking here at the \nindulgence of the managers of the bill because there is no time left on \nthis bill. I will not delay it for long.\n  First, I want to say that I have never been as happy with my decision \nnot to seek reelection as I have been today. I have been voting on \namendments that involve billions of dollars today with only a \nsuperficial or cursory knowledge of what I was voting on. I would not \nlike to go home--and I don't speak for the rest of you but I expect I \nam speaking for the rest of you, too--I would hate to have to go home \nand explain to people what was involved in all of these amendments, \nparticularly this one which I do not have a clue about.\n  But we must not lose sight of the point that the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia made in the opening part of his statement a \nmoment ago. That is, it is the rule that is the tyrant here with 20 \nhours to debate this part of the reconciliation bill and 20 hours to \ndebate the tax portion of it, which is monumental and most probably \nwill be the most significant important legislation we will deal with \nall year--20 hours. We will wind up at the end of that 20 hours \nprecisely the way we have with this one. There will be a long list of \namendments down there. Maybe we will have another unanimous-consent \nagreement where you are allowed 60 seconds to explain a bill that \ninvolves $10 billion.\n  We are not doing the people of this Nation a service as long as we \nallow this kind of a rule to put us in this kind of a straitjacket \nwhere we have to get up and openly confess that this system is not \nworking as it ought to.\n  So, I applaud the Senator from West Virginia for his comments. He is \nright on target. Fifty hours ought to be a minimum for the \nconsideration of a reconciliation bill.\n  I thank the Senator for making everybody aware of our shortcomings on \nthis day.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to hold the floor longer. I apologize to \nthe managers of the measure for imposing on them.\n  Is there some way that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico or \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey can enlighten Senators as to \nwhat is in this managers' amendment--particularly, if I may say, with \nreference to the four or five amendments that have qualified and were \nbeing held back to see if the managers' amendment took care of those \namendments?\n  As I understood it, Mr. Kennedy had one amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On those four amendments we will try, if the chairman \nof the Finance Committee will explain, we will try to ask the Senators \nthe relationship. It is not obvious on two of them that they are \nrelated at all, from what I could see. I think they were just trying to \nsee how these major health matters are going to get clarified here, \nwhich is not in this amendment. I don't believe they are even in this \namendment. So we will find that out, and before we vote, we will try to \nhave an explanation.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the chairman like to explain in the best way \npossible what is in the amendment?\n  Is that what we would like to do next?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is what I would like.\n  May I say to the distinguished leader that he is frustrated with this \nprocess also. He said to me earlier today that we have to find some \nbetter way.\n  I do not want to be a part of a problem. I am hoping we can at least \nget some response from those who understand what is in the amendment so\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\nthat the rest of us will at least go home feeling we did our best in \nunderstanding it and that we at least made it clear that something is \nwrong with the way the process is working.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to yield all of the time to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. But I do want to make one statement.\n  My friend from Arkansas said, I guess, that today made him happy that \nhe would soon stop being a Senator.\n  Let me make sure, if there are only six people listening on \ntelevision, that this Senator would like to say that it makes me very \nproud what we are doing here. I am very proud of this bill. I am very \nproud of the balanced budget. I am very proud of how we got here and \nwhat we are doing here.\n  Frankly, if things keep going as well as this, I may break all \nlongevity and stay here for a lot longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if I may say so, I am encouraged very \ngreatly by the news that the Senator from New Mexico will stay as long \nas possible, as does our distinguished friend and leader from West \nVirginia.\n  I say to my good friend from West Virginia, as he well knows, in \nevery major piece of legislation there are a lot of technicalities and \ncomplexities involved in the legislation. In the efforts to draft them \nand put them in final shape, it becomes necessary to have a number of \ntechnical modifications at the end.\n\n  I would also say that in developing this legislation, it has been my \nintention to work with everyone, both in committee and on the floor. We \nhave tried to include everybody--Republican, Democrats, senior Members, \nand junior Members.\n  So I think the process has been all-inclusive. Basically, what we \nhave here in the so-called managers' amendment is sort of a cleanup of \na number of matters that had to be modified to make them technically \ncorrect to take care in some cases of some of the concerns of \nindividual Members. Each of these have been reviewed very carefully by \nthe technicians who understand it.\n  I think part of the problem is that these are very complex matters \nthat aren't easy to explain or even to understand. But let me point \nout, for example, that in the managers' amendment, the first section \nthat deals with what is known as ``PPS-exempt'' hospital changes, it \ndeals with technical changes as to how they are reimbursed.\n  For example, the first says strike the update formula and substitute \nwith a zero; update for fiscal years 1998, 2001, and market basket, \nminus 3 percent in 2002.\n  In trying to reach the $115 billion savings that we are supposed to \nmake in Medicare, we reduce payments to the providers. Normally the \nreimbursement each year reflects the cost-of-living or inflation. But \nin this particular case, in order to make savings and because the \nhospitals are doing reasonably well, we are reducing the reimbursement.\n  It is that kind of technical change that much of this deals with.\n  In another situation, we are--again in efforts to save money--\nreducing what is known as disproportion payment and we have based the \nrecommendations on what an independent commission has recommended, and \nI might say that is what the administration has recommended as well. \nThese, again, are all basically very technical.\n  But going back to the reduction of the disproportion, because both \nDemocrat and Republican Members were concerned about reducing as much \nas was recommended by this independent board, we have slowed that \nphase-in a little bit to make it easier for those organizations to \nadjust.\n  So essentially I would say it is this kind of technical change that \nwe are trying to deal with here rather than major policy.\n  I assure you that we have dealt with both managers--the Republican \nmanager, the Democrat, and, of course, I might say that we have been \nworking very closely with my good friend and colleague, Pat Moynihan.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. You most assuredly have, sir.\n  Mr. ROTH. So I don't have any disagreement with our distinguished \nfriend and leader as to the whole process, but we have in good faith \ntried to deal with the process and meet the time schedules that \neverybody has wanted us to achieve.\n  I could go on and read all of these, if you like, sir. But I will say \nthey are highly technical.\n  The first one, I might point out, included two Medicare hospital-\nrelated provisions. As I said, the first is a modification as to how we \nreimburse what are called Medicare PPS-exempt hospitals. A PPS hospital \nis paid on a prospective payment basis. That was a means that was \nadopted many years ago to try to gain better control of expenditures \nthan you have when you have cost reimbursements. The hospital knows \nthat for a certain kind of function, they will be able to receive so \nmuch money--say, $1,000. And they know they have to live within that. \nSo they have an incentive to try to keep those costs down. But now we \nare cutting because we have to make greater savings. The hospitals, \naccording to our independent panel, are doing relatively well, and we \nare trying to cut it more.\n  The second is a hospital wage index classification and reimbursement. \nWe deal or address the wage index, and a highly technical modification \ntakes place there.\n  So, as I say, they are this kind of technical change basically in an \neffort to make legislative language accurate and achieve the goals that \nwere intended by the policy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator is certainly doing \neverything that he can in the best of faith to try to explain some \nthings about this amendment. I am sure this could go on quite a long \ntime. It is not that kind of detail that this Senator is seeking.\n  Let me say again that I am not accusing anyone of acting in bad \nfaith. Everybody is acting in good faith.\n  May I ask the distinguished manager of the bill: What were the four \namendments that I understood Senators were holding back on to see what \nwas in the managers' amendment? If we could have some indication of \nwhat they were about, that would be satisfactory with me.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, to the Senator from West Virginia that \nthere was a Hutchison amendment. It had to do disproportionate share of \npayments to hospitals, and there is a modification of that which had \nadversely affected Texas that is apparently somewhat ameliorated there. \nSenator Specter had the exact issue, and he had a disproportionate \nshare of payments amendment. He is part of this overall agreement that \nis in this managers' amendment.\n  Then there was a Bob Kerrey abortion amendment that had nothing to do \nwith this amendment. But I asked him to wait for the managers' \namendment before he did something on it.\n  I assume that Senator Murray is going to make the point of order on \nthat issue. But I am not certain of that.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is close enough. There was actually a modification \nthat requires me to wait before I offer my amendment. Otherwise I will \nhave to offer it twice.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. Unless he waits for that, he will have to offer it \nagain.\n  Then there was a Senator Kennedy uninsured children's amendment that \nalso seems unrelated. But he indicated that he would like to wait and \nsee what happened to this amendment.\n  That was the four that I mentioned.\n  I think that is the full stint of those amendments and the stories \nbehind them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators, particularly the \nmanagers of the bill, the Senator from Delaware, and also the \ndistinguished Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan]. I thank them all. I \nthank all of them.\n  I don't have any other questions to raise. I will not ask for a \ndivision. Senators have certainly done the best they could to go as far \nas they could in answer to this Senator's frustration. That is what we \nare talking about. We are all frustrated. It is the rule, and we ought \nto try to find some way to change it. I don't have any quarrel with any \nSenator in particular.\n  I thank all Senators.\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the amendment, as \nmodified, No. 506.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 506), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, do we have the child health \namendment ready?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I believe we are all set with a colloquy \nthat has clarified the language.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to proceed with that. We are very, very \nclose to having no amendments left except a Murray point of order and a \nKennedy point of order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if is agreeable with the floor manager, I \nwould call up our Medicare home health benefit transfer from part A to \npart B and proceed with that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I was trying, if I could, to get \none amendment before you, but if it is not ready, we will go right to \nyou.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is all right. We are here so we will accommodate \nwhatever.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the amendment, which is a product of \nmany Senators on both sides, with reference to child health is not \nready. Therefore, we would like to move to the point of order either by \nSenator Murray or Senator Kennedy.\n  Is Senator Murray ready?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I make a point of order that section \n1949(a)(2) of this act violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, as an appropriator, I object to the language included \nin this legislation by the Finance Committee that would make permanent \na prohibition against Medicaid managed care funds being used for \nabortion services except in the cases of rape, incest, or where the \nwoman's life is in danger. This is, for all intents and purposes, a \npermanent extension of the so-called Hyde amendment that has been \nincluded in every Labor-HHS and education appropriations bill since \n1987. A reconciliation bill is not the proper vehicle for major \nabortion policy decisions. This is not how Congress has traditionally \ndealt with such decisions, and this is not how we should begin to deal \nwith such decisions.\n  I know that some of my colleagues disagree----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, this place \nis not in order. It is terribly unfair to the Senator. Her voice is \nsoft, and we ought to make sure that we can hear it. She has an \nimportant message for all of us, and I resent the fact that people are \ntalking and laughing and doing what they are doing.\n  Please, Mr. President, let us get order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Before the Senator from Washington proceeds, \nlet me ask all Senators, if they would, to please take their \nconversations to the Cloakroom and give the Senator from Washington the \ncourtesy of everyone hearing her remarks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum is suggested. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might explain to the Senators the reason for the \ndelay and the quorum call is that we are discussing with Senator \nMurray, with reference to a point of order, we are discussing exactly \nwhat it means and what it doesn't mean, and she has requested that we \nset it aside pending further discussion. So I so propose a unanimous-\nconsent request to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The point of order will be set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 504\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Kennedy has two remaining \namendments. One has to do with home health care and the trust fund. I \nbelieve he is going to take that up now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if we could have the attention of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment would speed up the agreed-\nupon transfer of a portion of the Medicare home health benefit from \npart A to part B. This acceleration would extend the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund by 2 years. It would not affect the deficit or \nseniors' premiums. We have maintained in our amendment that the \npremiums that have been agreed to would be maintained, or it would not \naffect the total amount of the benefit ultimately transferred.\n  It is strictly a bookkeeping transaction, but it will help save \nMedicare. It extends the solvency of the Medicare Program by 2 years. \nIt was in the President's budget. It is a desired outcome for those who \nare interested in the financial security of the Medicare trust fund. We \ndebated the stability and the security of the Medicare trust fund at \nlength yesterday. This is a way of extending it by 2 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield time in opposition to Senator Roth, chairman of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object to the amendment. We are \ntransferring, over 7 years, home health care to part B, but we want to \ndo it in seven segments because it is agreed that the beneficiaries \nshould continue to pay 25 percent of the cost of the part B services. \nWe do not want to put it all over the first year because we do not want \nto raise the premiums that rapidly.\n  So in order to be consistent, what we provide in the legislation is \nthat the home health care will be transferred over 7 years. Each year \nan additional seventh will be included in the cost of the premium, so \nthat will make the phasein much lower.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I have any further time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Both sides have used their allotted time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Kennedy \namendment violates the Budget Act in that the amendment is subject to \nthe Byrd rule.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order as \nmade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the point of order. All those in favor say yea.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 38, nays 62, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 127 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--38\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--62\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 504\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain my \nviews concerning the Kennedy amendment 504, which would have \nimmediately transferred to Medicare part B the home health benefits \ncurrently paid for under the Medicare part A trust fund.\n  Payment for home health care is made from the part A trust fund for \nhome health services such as part-time or intermittent nursing care \nprovided by or under the supervision of a registered nurse or home \nhealth aide.\n  To protect the solvency of the part A trust fund, the bill shifts \nsome of the home health costs on a 7-year phased-in basis from part A \nto part B.\n  The budget reconciliation bill reflects a careful compromise on \nprotecting the solvency of the part A trust fund for all seniors \nwithout unduly burdening the taxpayers. Under the Kennedy amendment \nsome of the bill's fiscal protections would have been dropped, and \ntaxpayers would have effectively funded 100 percent of the home health \nservices in fiscal year 1998, which would be unprecedented under \nMedicare. In my judgment that goes too far and adversely affects the \npresent preferable balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, throughout the day I have been working with \nSenator Chafee and others with regard to amendments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May we have order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Senate will \nplease come to order.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been working with Senator Chafee and \nothers, including Senator Jeffords, on a number of amendments that were \noffered last night as first- or second-degree amendments. I think we \nhave worked out a process, now, that we are all comfortable with. Let \nme enter this unanimous-consent request and then we will have a brief \ncolloquy also.\n  I ask unanimous consent the following amendments be withdrawn: Chafee \namendment No. 448, Chafee amendment No. 500, Chafee amendment No. 501, \nLott amendments Nos. 505, 507, 508, 509, Rockefeller amendment No. 510 \nand the Roth amendment No. 513;\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the Roth \namendment No. 511, and that all between lines 23 on page 22 and line 3 \non page 23 be stricken;\n  I further ask the Senate then call up the Chafee amendment No. 512 to \nthe Roth amendment No. 511, as modified, that the Chafee amendment be \nagreed to, and the Roth amendment, as amended, then be agreed to;\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the committee amendment to \nS. 949, the Taxpayer Relief Act, is before the Senate, Senator Roth be \nrecognized to offer an amendment which is the text of the Roth \namendment No. 511, as modified and amended, and the text of the Kennedy \namendment, No. 492, if adopted by the Senate, to S. 947, to the \nlanguage regarding the children's health initiative, and the amendment \nbe agreed to;\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order during the \npendency of S. 949 to offer further amendments or motions regarding \ntitle XXI of the Social Security Act, except amendments regarding \nrevenues and outlays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator from Delaware----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont will suspend. The \nSenate is not in order. Senators please take their conversations off \nthe Senate floor. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If the chairman of the Finance Committee would give me \nhis attention, as I read the unanimous consent request, States would \nnot be able to use the new funds under the children's health insurance \ninitiative to provide health care coverage under either the block grant \nor to provide Medicaid for children over 200 percent of poverty.\n  This creates a real problem for a number of States. Vermont is \ncurrently covering all children aged 18 that have family incomes of 225 \npercent of poverty through its Medicaid Program. I would like to be \nassured that we will work to address this concern in the conference so \nthat States have the ability to use the new funds to provide health \ncare coverage for children over 200 percent of poverty. There are \nchildren above this level that need the help badly.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Vermont, he has my \nassurance that we will discuss this concern in the conference \ncommittee. It is not my intent to penalize those States that have done \na good job in covering their low-income children or to exclude needy \nchildren from coverage.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to address this, Mr. President, if I might, \nto the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. It is also my \nunderstanding that a State would be able to use any new funds to \nprovide health coverage for children under 200 percent of poverty and \nuse existing State dollars, normally used for this purpose, in order to \nprovide health care coverage for children over 200 percent of poverty.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, section 2102 allows for the use of existing \nState funds to provide additional health care coverage for children \nover 200 percent of poverty.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the chairman for that. I also extend my thanks to \nthe distinguished majority leader for helping us reach this unanimous-\nconsent agreement. I believe the resolution of this problem has been a \nvery good one. I thank, as I say, the majority leader and the chairman \nof our Finance Committee and other Senators who have worked on this, \nparticularly on our side, Senator Jeffords.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the practical effect of this amendment that there will \nonly be two options available now to States: One would be to put the \nchild in Medicaid, and the other would be to use a Blue Cross/Blue \nShield standard option plan with hearing and eyeglasses?\n  Mr. ROTH. No; the choice is not limited to that. Under the option, \nthe States must provide benefits that are the equivalent of a Blue \nCross standard plan. But I emphasize the word ``equivalent,'' because \nit means considerable flexibility. I should point out, it also includes \nvision and hearing services.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right. The State can use its own funds. If it has \nbeen using its funds for other types of services, they can continue \nusing their State funds for those other types of services.\n  Mr. GREGG. Further reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire further \nreserves the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. The practical effect of this then is that the programmatic \nactivities are specifically mandated as being either a Medicaid Program \nor a\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nBlue Cross/Blue Shield equivalent program, is that not correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have very serious reservations about this. I presume the \nleaders worked hard on reaching this agreement, and I presume that \nthere is going to be further consideration of this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, if I can respond to the \nSenator's reservation, I noted when I read through this that there were \na series of amendments that had been offered in a variety of ways \naffecting this particular area: Three by Senator Chafee, four by \nmyself, one by Senator Roth, one by Senator Rockefeller. So this is \nquite a laboriously worked-out process.\n  The Senator from Vermont, as a matter of fact, is not particularly \nhappy with some provisions still remaining, and he had an amendment \nthat would have tried to change that. A number of others--Senator \nNickles of Oklahoma--I believe, had something. But this unanimous-\nconsent agreement was worked out in a way that a number of Senators \ndecided not to go forward with their objections.\n  I personally don't agree with this, but it is the best way that we \ncould work through about six or eight amendments that were pending in a \nreasonable and fair way, and it certainly will have another day in \ncourt.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, on that representation, I won't object, but I have \nserious reservations, I must say.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I think the \nmajority leader is exactly right, and I congratulate him, as well as \nSenator Roth and his excellent staff, as well as Senators Chafee, \nJeffords and many others who worked on it.\n  As the majority leader has indicated, it has been a very laborious, \nlong process in which things sort of just gradually, tectonically moved \ntogether, but very, very slowly.\n  The point is that we can say now children are going to have good \nbenefits, and that doesn't mean that they have to pick a particular \nplan. There is not a mandate in this that they have to pick this plan \nor that plan, but they will be able to get the kinds of benefits that \nwe have as Senators, as Federal workers.\n  I think, frankly, we have an obligation to make sure our children \nhave plans. Preventive care, hospital care, doctor care, prescription, \nvision and hearing is in this. That is very important for early years, \npreventive care.\n  So I think, frankly, it has been extremely complicated, it has taken \na long time, but I think it is a good compromise, a good agreement, and \nI congratulate those who brought it together.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, also, before I renew my unanimous-consent \nrequest, Senator Breaux was also involved in this exercise and was \nhelpful. I express my appreciation to him.\n  I renew my unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, for his help in this. As he \nmentioned, this has been a very long, long difficult process. He has \nbeen very helpful.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if it is agreeable with the floor \nmanagers, I am prepared to move ahead with my amendment dealing with \nchildren's benefits.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe that is the last amendment, except the three \npoints of order that are going to be submitted by the Democratic floor \nleader en bloc.\n  Mr. KERREY. I still have my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sorry, I forgot. I thought that was going with Senator \nMurray when she withdraws her point of order. It is different?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we recognize Senator Murray for a moment? She \nintends to speak to the Senate with reference to her previous point of \norder.\n\n\n                       Point of Order, Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I withdraw my previous point of order, \nbut I want this body to know that I object to the language in this bill \nthat essentially makes Hyde permanent and affects those States whose \nmanaged care plans now cover medically necessary abortions. \nUnfortunately, the way the language was cleverly drafted, my point of \norder would have unintended consequences.\n  I go back to what my colleague from West Virginia said to all of us a \nfew minutes ago. I think as we move toward final passage, I hope we all \nunderstand the severe consequences of the many different arenas in this \nbill.\n  I withdraw my point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to withdraw her point \nof order. The point of order is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 492\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up our amendment dealing with the \nspecial health needs of children. I call up the amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Harkin.\n  First of all, I commend the Senators for getting us where we are in \nterms of the new health benefits package for children, but there are \nsome very critical needs for children, children with disabilities, \nchildren who are developmentally delayed and children with special \nneeds.\n  Those needs are not attended to, and that is why this amendment is \nsupported by the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Retarded Citizens \nand the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.\n  This will ensure that, in those particular areas, the children will \nreceive what is medically necessary. The Federal employees program is \ntargeted to adults and not toward children. This recognizes that there \nare special needs for children in these areas, and it permits what is \nmedically necessary. It is a limited program, but it is vital in terms \nof the special needs of those children. I hope that it will be agreed \nto.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 40 seconds of our time to Senator Roth, and I \nwill use 20 seconds.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Kennedy amendment. As we have \njust been discussing, we have carefully crafted and negotiated the \nissue of the benefits package for the new children's health initiative. \nThis amendment would break that agreement by requiring additional \nbenefits. It does the very opposite of what we want to do. We want to \nprovide flexibility to the States, and this would be a major step in \nthe wrong direction.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this would change a bipartisan \ncompromise in the committee and make a long list of benefits mandatory. \nThus, it would fly in the face of reform and make it more difficult for \nthe States to deliver quality care for less money. In essence, it is \napt to produce less quality care under the rubric of supplying all of \nthe specifics, even if you could get better care with less specifics.\n  I move to table the Kennedy amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 492. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 496, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \noriginally filed amendment since the managers' amendment changes the \nlanguage that my amendment seeks to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 496), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in section 2106, as added by \n     section 5801, strike all matter related to ``use limited to \n     State Program Expenditures'' and insert the following:\n       ``(d) Use Limited to State Program Expenditures.--Funds \n     provided to an eligible State under this title shall only be \n     used to carry out the purposes of this title.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there is language in the bill that imposes \nwhat has been imposed typically in the appropriations process, \npermanently imposing a restriction on the use of Federal money for \npayment for abortions. I know it is very controversial, a lot of fun to \ndebate. But by putting it in permanent law, we are doing something \nentirely different than has been done before.\n  Second, I would say to my colleagues, this affects only low-income \nteenagers. That is basically what we are doing, saying to low-income \nteenagers that we are not going to allow taxpayer money to be used for \nabortions.\n  Third, I would say, for those who say, ``Well, that's right, we don't \nwant to use taxpayer money for abortions,'' we do not have a similar \nrestriction on our salaries, we do not have a similar restriction on \nany other Federal employee's salary. If we have income coming to us, \nthat is taxpayer income.\n  If you want to be consistent here, you want to say you are going to \ntreat low-income teenagers the same as our teenagers are treated, then \nyou would have to put restrictions on how we can spend our salaries as \nwell.\n  I hope that this amendment will pass and we will strike this \nlanguage. If you want to bring the Hyde amendment up, I think it is \nmuch more appropriate to do so not on appropriations bills.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield time in opposition to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nSenator Kerrey. We put in language in this bill to make sure in this \nnew program--we created a new program for health care for kids, for \nteenagers. What we are doing in this amendment is saying this health \ncare program should not include abortion or money for elective \nabortion.\n  We basically said no public funds would be used for abortion --only \nif the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother or in cases \nof rape or incest. That is consistent with the Medicaid Program. That \nis consistent with Federal health care policies that we have for \nFederal employees right now, and we certainly should not create a new \nprogram that says, ``Oh, you can have abortion on demand, paid for by \ntaxpayers.'' We will spend billions of dollars. We should not be saying \nthose billions are eligible for teenagers for elective abortion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am just waiting for the minority \nmanager to make a point of order, and we will be ready to go to final \npassage.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I make a point of order that the following \nsections of the pending bill are extraneous to the reconciliation \ninstructions of the respective committee of jurisdiction: section 5713, \nsection 5833, and section 5987.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair sustains the points of order.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 947, the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. I'm pleased that we've come together in a \nbipartisan way--both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Capitol, and \nboth ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--to craft a plan that brings us a step \ncloser to fiscal sanity.\n  The good news, Mr. President, is that the bill before us realizes \nroughly $137 billion in savings over the next 5 years. And that's good \nnews for our country and for our children and our grandchildren.\n  S. 947 provides additional years of solvency to the Medicare hospital \ntrust fund, reforms payment methodologies for skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health, and outpatient entities, and includes greater \nchoice--and expanded preventive benefits--for millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries. As a cosponsor of the original Chafee-Rockefeller child \nhealth bill, I'm delighted that this bill contains $16 billion to \nexpand access to health care for America's children, most of whom live \nin the home of an American worker.\n  Someday, our children will be grateful for the $16 billion we \ninvested in their health care, Mr. President. And they will be grateful \nthat we succeeded today in saving $137 billion in future debt--debt we \nwill not ask them to pay.\n  But our children will not be grateful if we don't take this \nopportunity in this budget to tackle long-term entitlement reform in a \nsystemic way.\n  We all know the statistics. While entitlements and interest on the \nnational debt represented just 30 percent of our budget in l963, they \nwill absorb 70 percent by the year 2002. And even more alarmingly, if \nwe don't make changes in the way we do business around here, \nentitlements and interest on the debt will absorb the entire Federal \nrevenue base by the year 2012. How then can we responsibly invest in \nour children? How can we sustain the transportation infrastructure \nneeded to support a thriving economy in the next century? How do we pay \nour soldiers, repair our subs and carriers, and invest in the \ntechnology we need to remain the last great superpower on Earth?\n  Mr. President, despite the fact that the vast majority of economists \nhave told us that we need to adjust the consumer price index to \naccurately reflect inflation, we have no legislative CPI adjustment in \nthis package. Opponents say that since we don't need a legislative CPI \nadjustment to balance the budget in 5 years, it's not in this plan. But \nwhat about when the baby boom generation retires, Mr. President, when \njust three workers--and then two--will support each Social Security \nbeneficiary?\n  The Finance Committee had the courage to include a provision in this \nbill to gradually increase the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 \ntoday to 67 by the year 2027. This provision has been under assault--\nand will continue to be--from many sides. Some who oppose it argue that \nthis is not the time. And while I'm committed to identifying methods to \nprovide access for those who may encounter a lapse in coverage--and \nthis bill creates a bi-partisan commission that will look at the \nfeasibility of a Medicare buy-in program--when will the time be right? \nWe had a good vote in support of this eligibility increase in the \nSenate and we have to fight to retain it in conference.\n  Finally, the home health copay and the affluence testing for wealthy \nseniors which were included in the committee mark and which were \nsupported by the majority of the Senate during two rollcall votes held \nyesterday will likely not survive conference as well, Mr. President. \nThese provisions are in danger even though we all know we have to find \nresponsible ways to reduce the Federal cost of Medicare. While \naffluence testing of part B premiums is a political lightning rod, it \nis good public policy. It is simply indefensible to require lower \nincome families, many who cannot afford health insurance for their own \nchildren today, to continue to help subsidize 75 percent of the \nMedicare premiums of wealthy seniors.\n  We have much to do, Mr. President, to fulfill our obligation to leave \nour children a strong economic future and a quality of life equal to \nthe one we inherited from our own parents. The first step is to balance \nour budget--and I hope the bill before us accomplishes that goal. The \nnext step--and it is an essential one--is to tackle long term, systemic \nentitlement reform that will protect both the solvency of Medicare and \nSocial Security and the economic security of the generations that \nfollow us.\n  I hope the conferees will not make those goals even harder to achieve \nin the future.\n  With that plea Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n      THE BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL MUST PROTECT LEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I continue to be concerned about actions \nby Congress that hurt legal immigrants.\n  Last year, Congress passed a so-called welfare reform bill. This \nharsh bill cut off legal immigrants from most Federal assistance \nprograms for the first time in history. It permanently banned legal \nimmigrants from SSI and food stamps. It banned them for 5 years from \nAFDC, Medicaid, and other programs. And, it gave the States the option \nof permanently banning them from these programs.\n  We quickly saw the effect of these extreme provisions. Panic spread \nthrough the immigrant community. The Social Security Administration \nsentnotices to legal elderly and disabled immigrants that they would \nsoon lose their SSI benefits. Numerous reports in the press told of \nlegal immigrants who would be turned out of nursing homes, or cut off \nfrom disability payments. Some legal immigrants took their own lives, \nrather than burden their families. Thankfully, many Members of Congress \nrealized that these provisions went too far.\n  This budget reconciliation bill corrects many of those mistakes. \nMembers of the Finance Committee and Budget Committee showed impressive \nleadership in developing this bill. They recognized that the immigrants \naffected by last year's harsh cuts are individuals and families who \ncame here legally. By and large, they are family members--mothers, \nfathers, and sons, daughters--of American citizens. They play by the \nrules, pay their taxes, and serve in the Armed Forces. They can be \ndrafted. They can volunteer. We have hundreds of them in Bosnia today.\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nThey are future citizens trying to make new lives for themselves and \ntheir families in this country. I commend the committees for working so \nhard to come up with a bipartisan proposal.\n  This bill allows legal immigrants who are already receiving SSI to \ncontinue their SSI payments. It preserves SSI coverage for immigrants \nalready in the United States who become disabled in the future, and for \nfuture immigrants who are too severely disabled to go through the \nprocess of naturalization to become citizens. It extends the exemption \nfor refugees from 5 to 7 years. It exempts children from the 5-year ban \non Medicaid eligibility.\n  There is still much more to be done to correct the problems created \nfor immigrants by last year's welfare reform law. But, overall, this \nbill makes worthwhile progress toward restoring a safety net for \nimmigrants who fall on hard times. I hope that Senators will do all \nthey can to see that the immigrant provisions in this bill are retained \nin the Senate-House conference and final bill.\n\n\n                            Medicare Reform\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of some very \nimportant Medicare reforms made within the reconciliation package \nbefore us. Specifically, I am pleased the committee included reforms to \nthe formula used to determine the reimbursement rate for health plans \nunder the Medicare Program to make it fairer and more equitable for \nStates like Minnesota and other parts of rural America, changes to \nensure better access to emergency medical services, and an expansion of \nMedical Savings Accounts.\n  Reform of the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost formula has been \nneeded for years because the formula has discriminated against seniors \nwho choose to live and retire in rural communities. It has penalized \nStates like Minnesota which are efficient in delivering health care \nservices, and in doing so, discouraged quality health care. Since being \nelected to the Senate in 1994, I have made restoring fairness and \nequity to Medicare recipients in Minnesota and other parts of rural \nAmerica a top priority.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware of the fact that the current Medicare \nreimbursement formula discriminates against Minnesota by giving our \nState the second-lowest payment rates in the Nation. Not one county in \nthe entire State of Minnesota, or in 15 other States, receives the \nnational average of $467 in AAPCC payment per month.\n  Because of these low reimbursement rates, managed care organizations \nhave been discouraged from offering our senior citizens many of the \nalternative health plans available in other parts of the country, plans \nwhich offer additional benefits such as eyeglasses and prescription \ndrugs. Clearly, this is a problem which should have been addressed long \nago.\n  In February, several of my colleagues and I introduced S. 359, the \nMedicare Payment Equity Act, which would have established a floor of 80 \npercent of the national adjusted capitation rate for the year and made \nthe AAPCC formula more equitable by blending the national and county \nspecific percentage. More recently, I cosponsored S. 862, authored by \nSenator Grassley, which followed the same lines of reform and even more \nclosely resembles what was ultimately passed by the Finance Committee. \nUnder the leadership of Finance Chairman Roth and through the tireless \nefforts of Senators Thomas, Burns, Grassley, and Roberts, we have \nsucceeded in beginning to fix the Medicare formula to make it fairer \nfor Minnesota's seniors and right some of the wrongs against us.\n  The AAPCC reforms contained in the reconciliation bill are a very \nimportant step in restoring fairness and providing greater choices for \nMedicare recipients who live in Minnesota, particularly in rural \ncommunities. This truly represents a great victory for Minnesota's \nsenior citizens as we close the longstanding gap of inequity in the \nMedicare Program.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also addresses another important \nissue in which I have been deeply involved. In January, Senator Graham \nof Florida and I introduced S. 238, the Emergency Medical Services \nEfficiency Act, to establish a reasonable standard for determining \nMedicare reimbursement for EMS services. Our bill would ensure that EMS \nproviders would be reimbursed based upon a prudent layperson standard, \nrather than the ultimate diagnosis of a physician. This revised \ndefinition will ensure that EMS providers are prepared to meet the \nchallenges facing them as they work to improve their services.\n  All of us depend daily on the readiness, efficiency, and immediate \nresponse of our emergency medical system. And while many of us take it \nfor granted, we all want it to work well when we need it. Many of the \nmen and women who risk their lives delivering emergency care have told \nme the system can be improved, yet their desire to improve the services \nthey provide has rarely been recognized by Congress. This provision in \nthe reconciliation bill is the first step in helping EMS providers help \nthemselves become more efficient. I would like to thank Senator Graham \nfor his efforts in the Finance Committee to see that this important \nissue was included in the package.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Roth for his efforts to \ninclude an expansion of Medical Savings Accounts. In developing a \nMedicare Choice Program modeled on the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nplan, this will offer, for the first time, a real choice to America's \nseniors.\n  Again, I commend and thank Chairman Roth and his Finance Committee \ncolleagues for including these important changes in the reconciliation \nspending package.\n\n\n  BIPARTISAN BUDGET AGREEMENT ITEMS TO BE ACHIEVED IN APPROPRIATIONS \n                                PROCESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to address some concerns \nexpressed by the administration with regard to two items they believe \nshould be in this reconciliation bill. I would like to clarify what we \nassumed in the 1998 budget resolution for those items.\n  The bipartisan budget agreement did include assumptions on additional \nfunding for unemployment insurance benefits integrity and on extension \nof fees for SSI State supplemental benefit administration. In both \ninstances, the budget resolution assumed that these proposals would be \nimplemented by the Appropriations Committee, and therefore the \nauthorizing committees were not instructed to achieve these savings in \nreconciliation. The budget resolution is the basis for scoring \ncongressional action and cannot be changed in an ad hoc manner, that \nis, without passing another concurrent resolution to change it.\n  I would ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee if it is not \nalso his understanding that these proposals are to be considered by his \ncommittee?\n  Mr. STEVENS. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am \ncommitted to working with the chairman, and the administration \nregarding the levels of funding assumed in the bipartisan budget \nagreement that are within purview of the Appropriations Committee. It \nis my understanding that the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education has been working with the Office of Management \nand Budget with regard to the proposals you have mentioned.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for helping clarify this matter.\n\n\n   COVERAGE OF CERTAIN SERVICES IN RELIGIOUS NONMEDICAL HEALTH CARE \n         INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions in this \nbill to ensure the continuation of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement \nfor secular nursing services in religious nonmedical health care \ninstitutions. These provisions ensure that strong religious beliefs are \nnot a barrier to Medicare and Medicaid benefits.\n  When Medicaid and Medicare were enacted over 30 years ago, Congress \nincluded a special provision granting a religious accommodation for \nmembers of the church, so that they could receive benefits for care in \ntheir facilities comparable to the benefits available to others for \nsimilar cases.\n  For 30 years, the Christian Science Church relied on Medicare and \nMedicaid benefits and built a health care system that assists thousands \nof men and women. At a time when the Health Care Finance Administration \nhas expressed increasing concerns about fraud and abuse in Medicare and \nMedicaid, there are no complaints about the Christian Science Church. \nMembers of the church only ask to practice their religion without \nunnecessary interference.\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\n  Last summer, however, a Minnesota district court determined that the \nprovisions in the Medicare and Medicaid statutes onto the Christian \nScience Church are unconstitutional. As Judge Kyle stated in his \nopinion, ``legislative accommodation of religious beliefs is a valuable \nand worthy enterprise, but here * * * the accommodation has gone too \nfar and too strongly favors the convictions of one particular sect.''\n  However, the court also recognized the fundamental injustice that \nChristian Scientists were required to pay the taxes for Medicare and \nMedicaid, but could not receive the benefits of these programs. The \ncourt also recognized the purpose underlying the original statutes. The \ncourt clearly identified the statutory language referring to the church \nas the problem, not the goal of providing comparable benefits to those \nwho disavow traditional medical treatment because of their religious \nbeliefs.\n  The provision in the reconciliation bill meets this goal without \nundermining the Constitution. All references to the Christian Science \nChurch are eliminated. The provision will grant reimbursement for \nsecular nonmedical nursing services to any person who, because of \nreligious beliefs, does not believe in medical care and relies on faith \nhealing in a religious nonmedical health care institution. As with \nother aspects of this health care system, the Health Care Finance \nAdministration will closely monitor the provision for fraud, abuse, and \npublic health concerns.\n  The chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, and I have worked closely to ensure the \nconstitutionality of this provision.\n  This provision meets the worthwhile goals of the original Medicare \nand Medicaid laws, while meeting constitutional concerns. It deserves \nto be enacted into law so that the needed benefits will continue to be \navailable.\n\n\n             food stamps for cross-border native americans\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know it is too late for Chairman Roth \nto include this change in the manager's amendment, but I did want to \nraise it before we finish here today.\n  As the chairman knows, thanks to a provision in both the Finance and \nWays and Means packages, native Americans who are entitled to cross the \nU.S. border under the Jay Treaty are not affected by last year's \nwelfare law restrictions on providing SSI to aliens. Unfortunately, due \nto jurisdictional considerations, neither the Finance nor the Ways and \nMeans Committees included food stamps in this provision. Preliminary \nestimates indicate that such an inclusion would not incur significant \ncost.\n  I understand Senator Lugar is supportive of the inclusion of food \nstamps and I hope the chairman and ranking member will work with me and \nother Members during conference with the House to include a food stamp \nmodification.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee and the Finance Committee \nfor having the courage to follow through on a promise the Government \nmade long ago to career military personnel. I know the future of health \ncare for elderly military retirees is an issue that deeply concerns \nmany of us, and I am pleased that we have found a financially \nresponsible solution to the growing problem of health care access for \nthis group of retired personnel.\n  With the Defense Department expected to complete full implementation \nof the Tricare medical plan within the year, many retirees, who made it \ntheir lives' work to defend our freedom, face the certain loss of \nmedical benefits when they turn 65 unless Congress acts now. As a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, I am deeply disturbed by this \nprospect. That is why I have consistently supported responsible \ninitiatives to guarantee the future of DOD health care for Medicare-\neligible military retirees.\n  In New Hampshire, I have witnessed firsthand the impact of defense \ndownsizing on health care resources for this vulnerable population. \nWhen Pease Air Force Base closed in 1991, thousands of aging retirees \nwere left to compete with active duty personnel and military retirees \nfrom neighboring States for fewer spaces in the New England DOD health \ncare system. Once Tricare takes hold, this group will lose any \nremaining access to the military system they now enjoy because the \nDefense Department can no longer afford to offer these retirees the \nmedical benefits they were promised. This is unacceptable.\n  After 4 years of meetings, hearings, and failed legislative \ninitiatives, the Senate has finally reached a workable solution to the \nhealth care crisis now facing Medicare-eligible military retirees. \nMedicare subvention, as the plan is known, will allow the Defense \nDepartment to seek reimbursement from Medicare for the cost of treating \neligible retired military personnel. By authorizing the DOD to carry \nout a 3-year Medicare subvention test program, the Senate has taken a \ndecisive step toward restoring military retirees' faith in the country \nthey honorably served. I am pleased to have supported Medicare \nsubvention since the proposal's inception, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the coming years to ensure that our \nGovernment does not shirk the responsibility of providing elderly \nmilitary retirees with the quality, affordable health care they \ndeserve.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          MEDICARE SUBVENTION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, throughout each year we address a number \nof Medicare issues. This year, we have a Medicare issue within the \nreconciliation bill which is related to military health care, \nspecifically, Medicare subvention. Without Medicare subvention, \nmilitary treatment facilities cannot receive reimbursement from \nMedicare for care the facilities provide to military retirees who are \nalso eligible for Medicare. With Medicare subvention, we can continue \nto improve the quality of life for military personnel, their families, \nand retired service members and their families by providing them with \nalternative access to treatment.\n  Because health care is such an important aspect of quality of life in \nthe military, it is imperative that we continue to provide our military \npersonnel and retirees with the access which they were promised. \nCurrently, because the access of military retirees age 65 and over is \non a space-available basis and due to overcrowding of military \ntreatment facilities, finding adequate medical care has proven \nincreasingly difficult if not impossible. Clearly, this is not a trend \nwe want to continue if we hope to retain and recruit the quality and \nquantity of men and women needed to fight and win wars in the future.\n  Medicare subvention would fulfill the commitment made to our former \nservice members by allowing Medicare to reimburse the Department of \nDefense [DOD] for care provided to members who are Medicare-eligible \nbeneficiaries. I believe that Medicare subvention would be fiscally \nbeneficial to Medicare and would make available an important revenue \nsource that will enable and encourage DOD to provide care to over-65 \nretirees. Further, Medicare will save money because DOD can provide \ncare less expensively than civilian providers. This is clearly a win-\nwin situation for both the DOD and Medicare.\n  Clearly, ending access to military medical facilities when \nbeneficiaries reach an age when they will most need it is fundamentally \nunfair. Our veterans have earned our support, and they deserve the best \naccess to medical care that we can make available. I believe that \nMedicare subvention is a necessary step in the right direction, and I \nfully support the Medicare subvention provisions found in the \nreconciliation bill.\n\n\n                     Food Stamp Nutrition Education\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas, and I commend her for her diligent work in fighting \nfraud in the Food Stamp Program. I would also like to thank her for \nworking with me to address a concern of mine with regard to food stamp \nnutrition education.\n  For 2 years, the Reading Terminal Farmers' Market trust participated \nin a partnership with the USDA to develop a community-based nutrition \neducation program in Philadelphia. Using a Federal share to match \nprivate grants from the Knight, Pew and Kellogg Foundations, the trust \nestablished\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\nthe Philadelphia nutrition education network to integrate nutrition \neducation into ongoing food distribution and health programs. The \nPhiladelphia School District, Allegheny University of Health Sciences, \nWIC, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and others were engaged as \npartners in the network, which reached over 17,000 children and adults \nin 1996.\n  By all accounts, this program was a success; and last summer, when \nthe one-time cooperative agreement with USDA expired, the trust sought \nto continue their important work under the existing food stamp \nnutrition education program. In June 1996, the trust submitted a food \nstamp nutrition education plan requesting matching funds for a \nnutrition education plan in four low-income communities and at the \nReading Terminal Market. Unfortunately, USDA regulations only permit a \nFederal match for local or State government funding. Since the Reading \nTerminal Farmers' Market Trust relies upon private contributions to \nfund their programs, USDA determined that they were not eligible to \nparticipate in the food stamp nutrition education program.\n  Since last summer, my office has been working with Reading Terminal \nFarmers' Market Trust to find a way for this program to continue. It is \nmy understanding that nutrition education programs in Vermont and New \nYork City have encountered similar problems with USDA matching funds. I \nhave worked with Chairman Lugar of the Agriculture Committee and \nSenator Leahy to craft an amendment that will address these problems, \nand I am grateful to the Senator from Texas for including this language \nas section 2 of her amendment.\n  The language in this amendment will enable nonprofits and State \nagencies to receive grants in order to operate nutrition education \nprograms that are coordinated among a broad range of food distribution \nand social service providers. In order to reach the maximum amount of \neligible individuals and to leverage private funds for this endeavour, \nprivate donations will be made eligible to match the Federal grant.\n  The amendment provides $600,000 for grants for each of fiscal years \n1998 through 2001, and no individual grant may exceed $200,000.\n  This provision has the support of Agriculture Committee Chairman \nLugar and Senator Leahy.\n\n\n   FINAL REGULATIONS ON SOCIAL SECURITY INSURANCE DETERMINATIONS FOR \n                                CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, during the consideration of this \nimportant bill, I would like to bring to your attention developments \nregarding the administration's recently released SSI regulations for \nchildren. Through sections 211 and 212 of Public Law 104-193, the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, Congress \nestablished a new eligibility test requiring that children show the \npresence of ``marked and severe functional limitations'' to become \neligible for Supplemental Security Income [SSI] disability benefits. \nAdditionally, under these new rules up to 300,000 children who are \ncurrently eligible for SSI will undergo a redetermination assessment \nover the next several months.\n  On February 11, 1997, in an attempt to implement these provisions, \nthe Social Security Administration issued interim final regulations \nthat require a level of disability that meets or equals the listings of \nimpairments criteria. As stated in a letter written by nine of my \ncolleagues and me to the President in April, I believe this regulation \nestablishes an overly severe standard that misinterprets the intent of \nCongress to reform the SSI program for children with disabilities. \nSSA's test would remove up to 135,000 SSI disabled children this year \nalone. Thus, thousands of severely disabled children would face a loss \nof needed SSI benefits--contrary to the will of Congress.\n  I believe the Social Security Administration should establish a \ncomprehensive functional test at a stricter severity level than the \nformer individualized functional assessment test, but one that does not \nharm children with serious disabilities. A test protecting children \nwith severely disabling conditions--including those with one marked and \none moderate condition--would accurately reflect the intent of \nCongress. The administration has estimated this test would terminate \n45,000 children this year, and close to 250,000 over 6 years.\n  Mr. President, I have already heard from constituents in my State of \nVermont whose children will soon lose their SSI benefits. These \nfamilies have nowhere else to turn. Such predicaments present troubling \nmoral and budgetary questions--how to provide for those families who \nare shut off from desperately needed SSI benefits, and whether these \nregulations will simply shift the costs of providing for children with \ndisabilities from SSI to other Federal entitlement programs, or to the \nStates as communities react to these troubling cases. Such cost \nshifting would eliminate any significant savings gained. Additionally, \nthe loss of SSI benefits will force families to move their children to \ncostly out-of-home placement, as parents would no longer have the \nfinancial support to stay at home and care for the disabled child.\n  This is a matter that I will be pursuing with the Administration with \nthe intent of reconciling the Administration's interpretation with the \nregulations passed by Congress during the welfare debate last fall.\n\n\n                     Welfare-to-Work Grant Program\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The pending legislation provides $3 billion to establish \na Welfare-To-Work Program and specifies the activities for which the \nfunding may be used. The list of allowable activities does not allow \nassistance for education or training activities with the exception of \non-the-job-training.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Over the past several years I have met with a number of \nwelfare recipients, caseworkers and others to discuss the issue of \nwelfare reform in the State of Iowa. The discussions have also included \na number of individuals who have successfully made the transition from \nwelfare to self-sufficient employment. In many cases, the key to this \nsuccessful transition was participation in post-secondary classroom \ntraining. I understand that the pending legislation prohibits use of \nthe Welfare-To-Work Programs funds for this purpose but want to clarify \nthat States may continue to use Federal funds received under the \ntemporary Assistance for Needy Families Program or their own resources \nfor post-secondary classroom training.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct. TANF does have some restrictions on \nvocational education activities, however States may use these funds or \ntheir own State funds for the education and training activities \ndescribed by the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for making that clear. I have another \nquestion.\n  The Welfare-To-Work Program provides formula grants to States and \nrequires States to develop a formula for distribution of the funds \nwithin the State in consultation with sub-State areas. However, it is \nnot clear what types of entities are eligible to provide the welfare-\nto-work services and that States have flexibility on this score.\n  In 1989, Iowa established 11 Family Development and Self-Sufficiency \nPrograms to work with welfare recipients with a history of long-term \ndependency on the program and those who were at risk of long term \ndependency. These projects, 10 at nonprofit organizations, have been \nevaluated and have demonstrated success in moving welfare recipients \noff of welfare and into self-sufficient employment. In addition, a \nnumber of community action agencies and community development \ncorporations have also been working with welfare recipients on exactly \nthe kind of activities envisioned by the pending legislation.\n  I just want to make sure that a State may provide funding from the \nWelfare-To-Work Program to entities such as community action agencies, \ncommunity development corporations and other nonprofit organizations.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct. States may provide funding to these types \nof organizations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, when Congress and the President reached \nagreement on the broad outlines of plan to balance the Federal budget, \nI had hoped that I could stand before the Senate during debate on the \nreconciliation legislation and proudly announce my full support. It is \nwith deep regret, Mr. President, that I cannot. After careful \nexamination of S. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, I have come\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\nto the conclusion that this legislation is good for Washington but bad \nfor the taxpayers, and because it is not in the best interests of the \nworking Americans we represent, I must reluctantly oppose it. Here are \nthe major grounds on which I base my decision.\n  As I have said in previous statements before this Chamber, I have \nmade the pursuit of a balanced budget my top priority in Congress, and \nhave always said that I would support a budget plan that meets three \nspecific criteria: First, it must shrink the size and scope of \nGovernment and return money--and the power those dollars represent--to \nthe taxpayers; second, it must balance the budget by the year 2002 with \nsteadily declining deficits each year without the use of rosy economic \nscenarios; and third, it must provide meaningful, broad-based tax \nrelief to working families.\n  Tax relief, of course, will be dealt with in the other half of the \nreconciliation package. While there are many good provisions included \nin the bill, this so-call spending reduction legislation still fails to \nmeet those pro-taxpayer standards.\n  First and foremost, like the budget agreement on which this \nreconciliation legislation is based, this bill does not shrink \nGovernment and return power to the taxpayers. In fact, it does the \nopposite; it increases mandatory spending. In the next 5 years, total \nmandatory spending would increase from $825 billion in 1997 to $1.1 \ntrillion in 2002, a growth of 32 percent. Over the next five years, \nMedicare will increase at a rate of 6.1 percent and Medicaid will \nincrease nearly 7 percent each year from the inflated baseline. Instead \nof eliminating wasteful spending to reduce the Federal deficit, this \nbudget plan actually creates numerous new programs, including $34 \nbillion in new entitlement programs funded by the taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars.\n  In doing so, the plan has erased all of the savings achieved in last \nyear's landmark welfare reform legislation. The reconciliation \nlegislation includes about $24 billion in spending for new children's \nhealth care initiatives, while adding back $14.2 billion in welfare \nbenefits for legal aliens and food stamp recipients.\n  Under this legislation, the Federal Government will spend $1.2 \ntrillion on welfare alone over the next 5 years. That is $15 billion \nhigher than the CBO projected. Of every dollar collected by the IRS, 14 \ncents goes to welfare programs, with less than 1 cent dedicated to tax \nrelief for working families.\n  The fundamental flaw of the bill and the major source of my \nopposition to it is the new entitlement programs it creates. Such \nspending is a serious mistake at a time when we should control the \nexplosive growth of mandatory spending and reduce the size of the \nFederal Government. History tells us that earlier entitlement programs \nstarted small, with perhaps the best of intentions, but have since \nexploded and now consume about 70 percent of all Federal revenues. To \nmy disappointment, Washington has still not learned its lesson.\n  Second, Mr. President, despite some positive changes, including \nstructure changes in Medicare, the entitlement programs remain intact. \nThis not only breaks our promise to the American people on fundamental \nentitlement restructuring, but also ensures that big Government lives \non by allowing Washington to avoid the hard choices it must make to \naddress our long-term fiscal imbalances.\n  Without fundamental changes, the imbalance between the Government's \nentitlement promises and the funds it will have available to pay for \nthem will eventually shatter our economy. In its recent report, ``Long-\nTerm Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options,'' the Congressional Budget \nOffice warns us that if these long-term budgetary pressures are not \nrelieved, Federal budget deficits would mount and could seriously erode \nfuture economic growth. The Federal deficit would increase from 1.4 \npercent of GDP, or $107 billion today to 30 percent of GDP in 2035, \nnearly $11 trillion. The debt held by the public would increase from 50 \npercent of GDP, or $3.9 trillion in 1996 to 250 percent of GDP, $91 \ntrillion in 2035. Such rapid growth of the Federal debt and deficit \nwill bankrupt this great Nation.\n  This gloomy picture has been confirmed by the recently released \nreport of the Social Security and Medicare boards of trustees. Without \nclear changes in public policy to address the financial imbalance, the \nhospital insurance fund, one of the Medicare trust funds, will be \nbankrupt in just 4 years. The Medicare trust fund will run a deficit of \n$13 billion this year. By 2001, it will run a deficit of $49 billion \nand go broke. The disability insurance trust fund will be bankrupt in \n2015, and Social Security trust funds will be bankrupt in 2029. And we \ndo not have any clear and agreed public policy to address this \nimbalance.\n  Although the proponents of the legislation claim that it will avert \nthe crisis of Medicare bankruptcy until 2007, the fix is temporary and \nis no more than tinkering with the system. Accounting gimmicks are also \napplied to extend the life of Medicare. It shifts home health care from \npart A to part B and use the general account to cover the deficits of \nthe trust fund. This means a surge of new spending in Medicare in the \nfuture that taxpayers will be obligated to fund.\n  Third, unlike the Balanced Budget Act produced by the Republican \nCongress in 1996, this Balanced Budget Act does not result in steadily \ndeclining deficits, because the savings are achieved not through honest \naccounting but through rosy economic scenarios. Although this \nlegislation claims over $117 billion savings in Medicare and $8 billion \nin Medicaid, all of the spending cuts result from a baseline projection \nof Government spending in which programs are assumed to grow according \nto such factors as the rate of inflation, population growth, and \nformulas written into the law.\n  Any honest budget plan must reach balance through steadily declining \ndeficits every year; in other words, the deficit must be lower each \nyear than the preceding one. This 5-year budget agreement actually \nincreases the deficit for the first 2 years, then projects enough of a \nreduction in the final 2 years to reach balance. The deficit under this \nbudget will go up by $23 billion next year, from $67 billion this year \nto $90 billion, and remain as high as $90 billion in 1999. Over 70 \npercent of the deficit reduction will not occur until after President \nClinton leaves the White House. A significant percentage of the plan's \ndeficit reduction results from optimistic economic assumptions, not \nsound policy changes.\n  A budget plan must also be based on real numbers and not the inflated \nbudget estimates that have been used in the past to justify more \nspending and higher taxes. This budget agreement fails on that score as \nwell by continuing to use the inflated budget estimates of the past to \nmask the spending increases it contains. I cannot support a budget that \nuses such gimmicks simply to make the numbers add up on paper.\n  In its analysis of the budget, the Heritage Foundation concluded that \n``a credible plan to balance the Federal budget must result in a \nsmaller Government that costs less and leaves much more money in the \npockets of working Americans. The current reconciliation bill not only \nfails these important tests, but in many cases would implement policies \nthat are worse than taking no action at all.''\n  Our current sound economic growth has reduced the budget deficit to a \n17-year low without any fiscal constrains and reforms. We should use \nthis historic opportunity to balance the budget in less than 5 years, \nstart to pay back our $5.4 trillion national debt, and address our \nlong-term fiscal imbalances. Unfortunately, we have once again missed \nthis opportunity.\n  Mr. President, under the legislation before us, Washington will spend \nmore of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars creating new entitlement \nprograms, while expanding old programs just to please the big-spending \npoliticians and the special interest groups they feed. That is not the \nbudget the taxpayers of Minnesota are expecting. That is not the budget \nCongress owes America's working families. But that is the budget \nWashington claims is the right answer. I regret that I do not agree, \nand cannot therefore support the spending portion of the budget \nreconciliation legislation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 445\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain my vote in opposition to the motion to waive the Budget Act for\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nconsideration of the substitute amendment offered by Senator Reed.\n  To its credit, the Reed substitute did not contain the Medicare home \nhealth care/copayment language or the 65-67 Medicare age eligibility \nlanguage in the reported bill. I voted against both of those provisions \non independent votes yesterday and continue to be concerned about their \ninclusion in S. 947.\n  Notwithstanding those elements of the Reed amendment, I could not \nsupport it because it failed to include an important provision or \nmedical savings accounts for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\nexemption from auctions for public safety radio services and allocation \n       of spectrum for public safety and public service entities\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposal to ensure \nthat sufficient radio spectrum is made available for public safety and \nmaintenance of the Nation's critical infrastructure, such as pipeline, \nrailroad, and electric, gas and water utility services. With the \nsuccess of spectrum auctions for commercial radio services, the FCC has \nbeen reluctant to allocate sufficient spectrum for these vital \nservices. This legislation will expand the FCC's authority to auction \nspectrum, but not at the expense of entities that we have entrusted to \nprotect the safety of life, health and property and to provide \nessential public services.\n  In adopting rules for the use of this new spectrum, I hope the FCC \nwill promote the development of shared public safety/public service \nradio systems. In Nevada, it was recognized several years ago that it \nwould be prohibitively expensive for any one public safety agency or \npublic service utility to build and maintain a state-of-the-art 2-way \nradio system to cover this vast territory and provide the service \nfeatures these various agencies need. Several key public service and \npublic safety organizations took the initiative to pool their resources \nto build a system that would share backbone infrastructure, such as \nmountaintop repeater sites and radio frequencies. Through software \npartitioning, each user has its own discreet and secure virtual private \nnetwork on this shared infrastructure. The parties first had to secure \nwaivers of the FCC's rules so that nongovernment entities could share \npublic safety frequencies on a not-for-profit basis. Initial system \nusers include the Nevada Department of Transportation, University of \nNevada law enforcement personnel, City of North Las Vegas, Sierra \nPacific Power Company, and the Nevada Power Company. Other utilities \nand state and local government agencies are also looking to partner in \nthe system, which currently covers more than half of the State's \ngeography.\n  Shared public safety/public safety radio networks such as the one we \nhave pioneered in Nevada have many advantages: First, joint use of a \nsystem is a spectrally efficient; second, during disasters and \nemergencies, there is a great need for interoperability between \nemergency response agencies and public service utilities that is easily \naccommodated on the shared system; third, equipment can be loaned from \none entity to another on an as-needed basis during specific emergencies \nor special situations; fourth, other agencies and utilities can be \nadded to the system without system duplication of facilities; fifth, \nsmaller, rural agencies can access state-of-the-art technology that \nwould otherwise be beyond their reach; and sixth, taxpayer and utility \nratepayer costs can be significantly reduced.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona agree that these shared public safety/\npublic service radio networks should be promoted?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I agree. I would also like to offer my support for \nthe allocation of new spectrum for use by public safety and public \nservice organizations, and would urge the FCC to adopt rules that would \nfacilitate, if not promote, the development of shared radio systems by \nsuch entities. I also know that Senators Stevens, Lott, and Burns have \nbeen very concerned and involved in this issue. I look forward to \nworking with them and Senator Bryan to ensure that the Commission takes \nsuch action as necessary to deal with this subject and I am also \nhopeful that we can, if needed, clarify any problem with this language \nin conference.\n\n\n                       What is Right for Medicare\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the votes on this reconciliation bill \nincluded two votes on spending cuts in the Medicare Program. The two \ncontroversial amendments dealt with increasing the eligibility age for \nMedicare from age 65 to 67 and income-testing of Medicare for upper \nincome beneficiaries.\n  I support the change that will result in substantial savings through \nreduction of Medicare reimbursements to providers. I also agree with \nother changes that will improve and streamline the program.\n  However, I voted against the proposal included in the Committee's \nbill which would increase the eligibility age from 65 to 67 and the \nproposal to impose a means-test for higher-income beneficiaries.\n  I am willing to consider supporting both of these proposals under the \nright conditions, which I will describe below but I think it is \ninappropriate to be making Medicare cuts on the spending side of \nreconciliation in order to make room for larger tax cuts on the revenue \nside of reconciliation.\n  Whatever changes are made in Medicare should be made exclusively and \nspecifically for the purpose of extending the solvency of Medicare--not \nfor the purpose of providing additional room for tax cuts, the bulk of \nwhich are proposed to go to upper income earners in the United States. \nWe must look at the right ways to keep Medicare solvent without \nbreaking faith with the country's senior citizens.\n  Asking senior citizens who make more than $50,000 to pay higher \nprices for their Medicare policies so that investors who make $500,000 \ncan be given tax cuts seems inappropriate to me. There's no denying a \ndirect connection when the Medicare proposals are made in the context \nof a reconciliation bill that includes spending and taxing. The act of \nachieving Medicare savings then becomes intertwined with the desire for \ntax cuts on the revenue side.\n  The reconciliation bill specifically calls for a commission to make \nrecommendations on long term changes necessary to ensure the solvency \nof the Medicare Program. I support that and I hope that such a \ncommission will be established quickly and will ultimately result in \nsolid recommendations which the Congress can then act on quickly.\n  When we are able to look at recommendations which are developed \nspecifically for the purpose of extending Medicare solvency, then I am \nwilling to consider changes to Medicare, including means-testing and/or \nincreasing the eligibility age under the following conditions.\n  First, with respect to increasing the eligibility age, if and when we \ndo that, we must be prepared to respond to the question of what happens \nto those senior citizens whose incomes are inadequate to pay the higher \ncost of private health care insurance between age 65 and 67 when they \nwould no longer be covered. Changing the eligibility age from 65 to 67 \nwithout providing some mechanism to provide for the availability of \naffordable insurance coverage for the citizens in that age group would \nsimply mean we have millions more uninsured Americans. Low income \nsenior citizens between the ages of 65 and 67 will never be able to \nafford the kind of premiums that will be assessed by the health care \nindustry to insure people of that age. So, the eligibility age increase \ncannot simply be considered on its own as it was in the reconciliation \nbill. Nor can it be argued that the increase in the eligibility age \nparallels the increase in the social security retirement age. The \nramifications are very different for increasing the medicare \neligibility age.\n  Second, with respect to means-testing or income-testing, as it is \ncalled, I am willing to support means-testing for Medicare, but again, \nonly on the condition that the means-testing itself is done for the \npurpose of extending the solvency of Medicare and not part of a \nreconciliation bill that is designed to cut spending in a way that will \naccommodate additional tax cuts.\n  The temptation is too great for those in Congress who never supported \nthe Medicare bill in the first place. It is a concern of mine that the \nproposed changes to Medicare in this bill are there not for the purpose \nof increasing the solvency of Medicare, but rather are there to \naccommodate tax cuts for upper income Americans. This, in my judgement, \nundercuts the Medicare Program.\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 428\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have cosponsored amendment \nNo. 428, which will significantly reduce fraud, abuse, and waste in the \nMedicare system. This is an issue which I have been working on for many \nyears and I am pleased to have been joined in this battle to combat \nfraud and abuse in our health care system by my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Tom Harkin.\n  This important amendment introduced by Senator Harkin incorporates \nportions of my legislation, the Medicare Whistleblower Act S. 235, \nwhich would assist Medicare beneficiaries with identifying provider \nfraud in the Medicare system.\n  Over and over again, I have heard from seniors about their personal \nexperiences with fraudulent and negligent billings throughout the \nMedicare Program. Many of these seniors say that their Medicare bills \nfrequently include charges for medical services which they never \nreceived, double billings for a specific treatment, or charges which \nare disproportionate and severely marked up. Usually, most of these \nseniors have no idea what Medicare is being billed on their behalf, and \nthey have no way to obtain a detailed explanation from the Medicare \nproviders.\n  These personal stories from senior citizens are confirmed by analyses \nand detailed studies. According to the General Accounting office, fraud \nand abuse in our Nation's health care system costs taxpayers as much as \n$100 billion each year. Medicare fraud alone costs about $17 billion \nper year which is about 10 percent of the program's costs.\n  This is quite disconcerting, especially in light of the financial \nproblems facing our Medicare system.\n  A fundamental problem with the Medicare system is that most \nbeneficiaries are not concerned with the costs of the program because \nthe Government is responsible for them. One of my constituents shared \nwith me an experience he had when his provider double-billed Medicare \nfor his treatment and the provider told him not to be concerned about \nit because ``Medicare is paying the bill.'' This is an outrage and we \ncannot allow this flagrant abuse of taxpayer dollars to continue. \nRemember, when Medicare overpays, we all over-pay, and costs to \nbeneficiaries and the taxpayers spiral while the financial \nsustainability of the program is violated.\n  The amendment addresses this fundamental problem in the Medicare \nprogram by strengthening the procedures for detecting and identifying \nfraud and waste in the Medicare system. Beneficiaries would be given \nthe right to request and receive a written itemized copy of their \nmedical bill from their Medicare health care provider. This itemized \nbill should be provided to the beneficiary within 30 days of the \nprovider's receipt of their request. If anyone knowingly fails to \nprovides a beneficiary with an itemized bill they will be subject to a \ncivil fine. Once the beneficiary receives the itemized bill they would \nhave 90 days to report any inappropriate billings to Medicare. The \nMedicare intermediaries and carriers would then have to review the \nbills and determine whether an inappropriate payment has been made and \nwhat amount should be reimbursed to the Medicare system.\n  I recognize that provider fraud is not the sole source of waste and \nabuse in the Medicare system, and I wholeheartedly support other \ninitiatives which address beneficiary fraud. However, studies indicate \nthat provider fraud is most prevalent and the greatest concern for the \nsystem, making initiatives such as this one which specifically target \nprovider fraud very important.\n  It is imperative that we put an end to the rampant abuse and fraud in \nthe Medicare system. I wholeheartedly believe that this provision would \ncontribute significantly to this effort.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill contains \nprovisions that impact most of the programs and services provided by \nthe Federal Government. Few people in the United States are not touched \nin some way by the changes we have voted for during this debate. I \nwould like to touch upon just a few of the provisions.\n  The bill includes significant progress toward protecting the Medicare \nProgram. Without the changes included in this legislation, the Medicare \ntrust fund would go bankrupt in 2001. The changes include the first \nmajor structural changes to Medicare in its 30-year history. The Senate \nbill modernizes Medicare by offering seniors the option of choosing \nfrom among a range of quality private health plans in addition to \nexisting fee-for-service Medicare. It includes important new health \ninsurance coverage for the Nation's children. It returns a degree of \nprotection for people who live and work in our country, but because of \nforeign birth are not citizens of the United States.\n  The bill makes substantial advances in ensuring that Medicare and \nMedicaid beneficiaries can get comparative information to help them \nchoose the best available health care plan for their needs. An \namendment I sponsored with Senators Chafee, Jeffords, Kerrey, Breaux, \nWyden, and Kennedy requires that includes comparative information on \nbenefits, cost sharing, premiums, service area, quality and performance \nincluding disenrollment, satisfaction, health process and outcomes, \ngrievance procedures, supplemental benefits, and physician \nreimbursement method be provided to Medicaid recipients in managed \ncare. In many cases, Medicaid managed care plans have significant \ndifferences in the treatment of asthma, immunization, heart disease, \ndiabetes, and other problems endemic to the Medicaid population. This \namendment should assist Medicaid beneficiaries in choosing high-quality \nplans, and through competition among plans, increase the quality of \nall.\n  The bill also included an important demonstration program for \nMedicare based on the Government's own employee health care plan. That \ndemonstration program includes provisions to improve the quality of \nhealth care for Americans based on a bill I sponsored, S. 795, the \nFederal Health Care Quality, Consumer Information and Protection Act.\n  The dramatic drive of millions of people into managed care was all \ngeared toward stopping unacceptable cost increases in healthcare. Now \ncost increases have slowed and it is time to focus on quality. Congress \nhas made some initial, spasmodic efforts, such as last year's drive-\nthrough delivery legislation. The health care quality provisions in \nthis demonstration program represents an effort to take a more \ncomprehensive and durable approach to improving health care quality.\n  The Government has a powerful tool we think has gone unused--its \npurchasing power. The Federal Government is the single biggest \npurchaser of health care in the country. If we use that purchasing \npower wisely, the quality of health care in the country will be pulled \nupward dramatically. If we don't, the Federal Government will drag down \nthe efforts the private sector is making to improve their employee's \nquality of health care.\n\n  If the bill passes, the Government will only purchase Medicare \ncoverage in this demonstration program that satisfies two requirements:\n  First, plans will have to provide information that allows people to \nmake straightforward plan-to-plan comparisons of health care quality. \nWith that information, Medicare beneficiaries could look up the plans \nin their area to see which had the best record of care for the elderly. \nEmpowering consumers with comparative quality information would force \nhealth care plans to compete continuously and aggressively on quality \nresulting in ongoing health care improvements.\n  Second, all health care plans in the demonstration would have to meet \ncertain minimum criteria or they couldn't be purchased by the Federal \nGovernment. Setting uniform federal criteria provides a powerful tool \nto address quality issues that emerge from the rapidly evolving health \ncare industry. Existing accrediting agencies like the National \nCommittee on Quality Assurance for Quality Assurance [NCQA] or the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations [JCAHO] \ncould be licensed to certify that the health care plans are in \ncompliance with the minimum criteria which should minimize bureaucratic \nduplication.\n  Finally, to hold this proposed system together and prevent the \nstandards from becoming outdated, an Office of Competition is created \nwithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nServices. The Director of the Office of Competition will set and update \nthe basic requirements for comparative data and minimum criteria. They \nwill also work out a formula to pay for value. High quality plans will \nget paid slightly more than low quality plans.\n  The Director will draw on the expertise already developed by large \nprivate purchasers and coordinate with them in improving the purchasing \nrequirements over time.\n  The stakes are high. This year over $1 trillion, almost one-seventh \nof the economy, will go toward health care services. Purchasers, both \nprivate and public, need to demand quality from the health care \nmarketplace. Today you can identify a good stereo, a good car, or a \ngood shampoo. But, you can't get the most basic information about the \nquality of your healthcare. That lack of information on health care \nquality is no longer acceptable, it can be fixed, and the Government \nshould join the best corporate purchasers in the repair effort.\n  I am deeply concerned about one aspect of the Medicare package that \nis included in this budget reconciliation bill. The Senate Finance \nCommittee has enacted a series of reforms that would dramatically \nchange the methodology by which payments are made to Medicare managed \ncare plans as well as the new plans envisioned in the bill. This new \npayment structure would result in a redistribution of Medicare \nresources that is very beneficial to areas that have low health care \ncosts and very damaging to areas where the delivery of health care \nservices is much more costly.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, seniors in four of our eight \ncounties would suffer from Medicare managed care payments that, under \nthis bill, would decline by more than 20 percent relative to current \nlaw. Don't misunderstand--I support actions to keep the Medicare trust \nfund solvent. But these reformulations don't just produce savings--they \nfundamentally shift expenditures from high cost to low cost areas. In \none Connecticut county, this legislation would extract 57 times more \nsavings from seniors enrolled in managed care than would the House Ways \nand Means Committee bill, which achieves similar savings. These are \nsobering figures--and they do not even take into account the impact of \nthe bill's risk adjustment mechanism, which would automatically reduce \nMedicare payments by an additional 5 percent for all new managed care \nenrollees in their first year of enrollment.\n\n  This legislation over-reaches in seeking to achieve a greater measure \nof geographic equity in the Medicare payment system. Instead of making \nthe modest adjustments that are needed to improve the fairness of the \ncurrent system, this bill calls for sweeping reforms that would disrupt \nthe coverage of many seniors in order to help others.\n  Tragically, many of those who would be hurt the most are low-income \nseniors who already have selected Medicare managed care plans because \nthey need the additional benefits--such as prescription drug coverage, \nand dental and vision care--and the low out-of-pocket costs that many \nof these plans offer. These low-income seniors cannot afford to expose \nthemselves to the high deductibles and copayments of the Medicare fee-\nfor-service system, nor can they afford to purchase an expensive \nsupplemental Medigap policy.\n  As I consider this issue, I think about the many areas in Connecticut \nthat have suffered from economic downturns in recent years and, even \ntoday, are not enjoying the strong economic growth that is evident \nthroughout much of the country. Seniors in these areas are particularly \nvulnerable. Considering that a disproportionate number of Medicare \nmanaged care enrollees are low-income seniors, I believe we should \nproceed carefully as we contemplate reforms that affect their coverage. \nFor many of these seniors, a reduction in their Medicare benefits would \ncause severe financial hardship.\n  I want to emphasize that I have no desire to be involved in any \ncontest that pits the Medicare beneficiaries of Connecticut against \nthose of Iowa, Nebraska or any other State. I completely support the \nexpansion of new health care choices to all seniors, regardless of \nwhere they live. I am convinced, however, that this can be accomplished \nwithout awarding 60-percent payment increases for certain low-cost \nareas--many of which tend to be sparsely populated--at the expense of \nother areas where large numbers of seniors are already enrolled in \nprivate health plan options. The number of seniors who would be \npenalized by this shortsighted approach far exceeds the number who \nwould benefit.\n  I strongly believe that a more cautious, thoughtful approach is \nwarranted. For example, a 70/30 blend between local and national \npayment rates would go a long ways toward eliminating the disparities \nthat currently exist--without causing massive cuts in certain areas. In \naddition, a minimum annual update for all plans, combined with some \nkind of link between growth in fee-for-service spending and managed \ncare spending, would help to assure that the resources available to \nMedicare managed care plans do not fall hopelessly behind the growth in \nmedical inflation. It is totally unrealistic to think that we can allow \npayments to decrease in certain areas--while actual costs are \nincreasing by 5 or 6 percent annually--without having any adverse \naffect on seniors.\n\n  As we move forward with Medicare reform, we need to acknowledge that \nit is, in fact, more costly to serve Medicare beneficiaries in some \nareas of the country than others. There are legitimate reasons why it \ncosts more to deliver health care services in densely populated urban \nareas. The wages of medical personnel and the capital costs of medical \nfacilities differ considerably from region to region and from State to \nState. Even within individual States, medical costs vary from county to \ncounty. To discount this economic reality, as this legislation does, is \nsheer folly.\n  Perhaps the most troublesome component of this Medicare payment \nproposal is the new enrollee risk adjustment mechanism. This provision \narbitrarily and automatically reduces Medicare payments by 5 percent \nfor all new managed care enrollees--regardless of their age or health \nstatus--in their first year of enrollment. I have serious concerns \nabout the implications of this proposal. How are we supposed to promote \ncompetition within the Medicare Program if we begin by saying that \neveryone who leaves the fee-for-service system will be subject to a 5 \npercent penalty? This new enrollee tax will limit beneficiary choice by \ndiscouraging health plans from entering markets in which seniors do not \nhave private health plan options at this time. Everyone in this chamber \nshould be deeply alarmed by this misguided provision.\n  Having given this Medicare payment proposal an honest and thoughtful \nevaluation, I am convinced that we should work toward a more sensible \nand well-reasoned approach when this legislation is considered in the \nSenate-House conference committee. I want to state very clearly that I \ndo not have a problem with the amount of Medicare savings this \nlegislation would achieve; I just believe we have an obligation to \nachieve these savings in ways that do not disrupt the coverage of \nseniors. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for a new approach.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 460\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have offered an amendment to \nthe budget reconciliation package which provides incentives for States \nwith expanding access to health care coverage under the Medicaid system \nto devise innovative and cost effective programs. This amendment is \nimportant to any State interested in best serving the health care needs \nof its people.\n  My amendment authorizes the continuation of a State's Medicaid \nmanaged care program operating under a section 1115 waiver. States \nwould have the option of requesting an automatic extension of their \nwaiver program for 3 years or permanently continuing their waiver \nmanaged care program if it has successfully operated for at least 5 \nyears and has demonstrated an ability to successfully contain costs and \nprovide access to health care.\n  In addition, this amendment allows these same States to utilize their \nown resources to revise their programs and expand coverage, while \nreducing both State and Federal costs.\n  The amendment will assist States in expanding health care coverage to \ntheir most vulnerable populations. This is something Congress has spent \na great deal of time talking about during this session of Congress in \nterms of\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\nchildren. But children are not the only ones for whom health coverage \nis a priority. There are still millions of people in this country who \nlive below the poverty line who do not have coverage. Unfortunately, we \noften forget about these individuals.\n  Several States have led the way in innovation for expanding coverage \nthrough cost containment: Tennessee, Oregon, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and \nArizona. My home State, Arizona, was the first to recognize that \nimproved quality, better access and reduced costs could be achieved \nthrough the appropriate use of managed care as an integrated approach \nto health care for low income people.\n  These States have summoned the political will and marshaled their \nState resources to improve their health care programs while reducing \nboth State and Federal costs. Many new States are now following the \nexamples set by the pioneers and have filed statewide section 1115 \nwaiver requests to move their programs into managed care.\n  In Arizona, 72 percent of the voters decided last fall that health \ncare should be available to everyone under the poverty line. Arizona \nalready covers children up to 133 percent over the poverty line. This \nmeans Arizona decided to cover the 50,000 men and women without \nchildren who live under the poverty line. This is their only hope of \nhealth care coverage.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has recently erected additional \nbarriers to Arizona's initiative. In spite of the substantial savings \ndocumented by Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] evaluators \nsince the program began in 1982, more than enough to offset the cost of \nexpanding coverage, the administration would not allow Arizona to \nreinvest these savings it achieved over a traditional fee-for-service \nprogram in expanded coverage. Nor will HCFA allow the State credit for \ntheir program's expected savings over the next 5 years.\n  States like Arizona which have successfully been operating under an \n1115 Medicaid waiver should not be penalized for a change in Federal \nguidelines which occurred after the program began. No one is \nquestioning whether these States have saved the Federal Government \nmillions. Arizona, Tennessee, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and any other State \nwith such a proven track record, should be allowed to use the managed \ncare savings it achieved over a traditional fee-for-service program to \nexpand coverage for their most vulnerable populations.\n  This important amendment assists States in providing access to health \ncare for the most vulnerable populations.\n\n\n                            medical research\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record some \nof the many letters I have received in support of Senator D'Amato's and \nmy amendment to S. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to create a \nmedical research fund. These letters show the widespread grassroots \nsupport for this amendment which would expand support for medical \nresearch above and beyond what is currently being done at the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH].\n  The people behind these letters understand what many recent studies \nhave demonstrated--that investments in medical research can both save \nlives and lower Medicare costs through the development of more cost-\neffective treatments and by delaying the onset of illness. They \nunderstand that while health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion \nannually, the United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total \nhealth care budget to health research. These letters are from people \nthat understand the importance of increased funding for biomedical \nresearch. I ask unanimous consent that these letters in support of the \nmedical research amendment be submitted for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Thank you.\n                                          American Association for\n\n\n                                        Cancer Research, Inc.,\n\n                                  Philadelphia, PA, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon.

Tom Daschle.\n       Dear Senators: Thank you for your efforts to increase funds \n     provided to the National Institutes of Health through the \n     creation of a Health Research Fund.\n       A million Americans suffer from Parkinson's disease, a \n     neurological disorder that causes increasing tremor, \n     stiffness and slowness of movement, eventually leaving us \n     unable to move or speak. I have lived with Parkinson's for \n     ten years, watching Parkinson's increasingly disable me, and \n     seeing others like former Congressman Mo Udall lose the \n     battle to the point of total immobility. The human suffering \n     that results from Parkinson's is immense and incalculable, \n     but this condition also produces a fiscal nightmare: \n     Parkinson's is estimated to cost at least $25 billion a year \n     in medical care, disability benefits, assisted living and \n     lost productivity. The cost is so high because we typically \n     live in a disabled state for a long time, and the battle \n     against less of function is ongoing and expensive.\n       Meanwhile, there is immense scientific promise, with \n     Parkinson's described by scientists as ``one of the brightest \n     spots in brain research.'' Nonetheless, the research is in \n     slow motion, stymied by inadequate funding: the federal \n     research budget for Parkinson's totals only about $30 million \n     or $30 per American afflicted. The current federal policy on \n     Parkinson's wastes billions in public and private dollars \n     coping with the effects of the disease, when millions of \n     dollars could be put toward finding a cure.\n       The Congress is moving toward a dramatic reversal in this \n     policy, by support for the Udall Parkinson's Research bill, \n     which would authorize $100 million to adequately invest in \n     this research. The bill is co-sponsored by 57 Senators and \n     202 Congressmembers, and we expect to see it enacted very \n     soon. This momentum could be derailed by the present \n     allocation for health programs in the 1998 budget agreement. \n     If not corrected this year in appropriations for the National \n     Institutes of Health, the present funding disparity almost \n     surely will continue, leaving the human and fiscal nightmare \n     to go on unabated.\n       Your amendment can fix this funding problem, return fiscal \n     sanity to this policy, and give hope to our struggling and \n     desperate community today.\n       Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Joan I.

John Rockefeller,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the 1,100 members of the \n     Research Society on Alcoholism, I am writing to unequivocally \n     support the Medical Research Amendment. The\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\n     Research Society on Alcoholism is a professional research \n     society whose members conduct basic, clinical, and \n     psychosocial research on alcoholism and alcohol abuse.\n       Alcoholism is a tragedy that touches all Americans. One in \n     ten Americans will suffer from alcoholism or alcohol abuse. \n     It's cost to the nation is nearly $100 billion annually. \n     Research holds the promise of developing effective methods \n     for the prevention and treatment of this far reaching \n     disease.\n       The Medical Research Amendment is an answer to the problem \n     of desperately needed research funds. An investment of this \n     type will create the ability for the National Institutes of \n     Health to fund grant applications that will lead to \n     advancements in all areas of health research. At this time of \n     unprecedented opportunities in alcohol research, this \n     amendment provides much needed assistance.\n       Thank you for your support of the research community. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of \n     assistance in any way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Ivan Diamond, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            College on Problems of\n\n\n                                        Drug Dependence, Inc.,\n\n                                      Richmond, VA, June 24, 1997.\n     Hon.

John Rockefeller,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The College on Problems of Drug Dependence \n     (CPDD) is the leading scientific society in the field of drug \n     abuse. On behalf of our nationwide membership I am writing to \n     lend our support to the Medical Research Amendment. Our \n     commitment to research advances and their positive \n     implication for the future is strengthened by this amendment \n     and its commitment to the research community.\n       An estimated 30 million Americans suffer from drug and \n     alcohol addiction. Alarmingly, of the 59 million women of \n     child bearing age, nearly 5 million are using illicit drugs \n     such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Economically, drug \n     and alcohol abuse cost this country more than $1600 billion \n     annually. Research is the answer to understanding this \n     complex and devastating problem.\n       The Medical Research Amendment is the answer to a long \n     standing problem facing the United States, the undervalued \n     commodity of research. Research can provide us with the \n     elusive answers to questions of addiction, drug abuse, and \n     treatment. This amendment is an investment in the future of \n     America and not just the National Institutes of Health.\n       Thank you for your support of research and its advances. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of \n     assistance in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Robert L.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Al and Tom: On behalf of Columbia University \n     College of Physicians and Surgeons, I wish to express our \n     support for the amendment offered by Senators D'Amato, \n     Harkin, Specter, and Mack to provide additional funds over \n     appropriated amounts for the National Institutes of Health \n     that is being offered to the Budget Reconciliation Bill.\n       Current amounts for NIH are truly insufficient to fulfill \n     the objectives of NIH and the promise of biomedical research. \n     We have the opportunity to find the genetic basis of disease \n     and cures for illnesses such as Parkinson's, cancer, \n     diabetes, and others that afflict millions of Americans. The \n     contributions potentially offered by this amendment will save \n     millions of lives and billions of dollars.\n       Support for biomedical research is one of the most \n     important investments Congress can make in the health and \n     welfare of our citizens. All of us in academic medicine thank \n     you for your leadership and vision.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Herbert Pardes, M.D.,\n\n                               Vice President for Health Sciences,\n     and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            The National Coalition\n\n\n                                          for Cancer Research,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon.

Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The 55,000 cancer researchers, nurses, \n     physicians, and health care workers, tens of thousands of \n     cancer survivors and their families; 40,000 children with \n     cancer and their families, 82 cancer hospitals and cancer \n     centers across the country, and more than 2 million \n     volunteers who make up the National Coalition for Cancer \n     Research commend your medical research amendment to the \n     fiscal year 1998 Senate Reconciliation Bill.\n       It is the Coalition's central conviction that the solution \n     to the complex problems surrounding cancer--the reduction in \n     morbidity, mortality, and the high costs of medical care--\n     will come in a stepwise manner from the generation of new \n     knowledge through research. Additional federal support for \n     cancer research as provided by your Health Research Fund will \n     abet the human and financial costs of cancer.\n       We must remember that despite the declining death rates of \n     the past few years, in the United States, men have a 1 in 2 \n     lifetime risk of developing cancer, and women have a 1 in 3 \n     risk. Cancer is still the second leading cause of death and \n     is expected to be the leading cause of death by the turn of \n     the century. The direct costs of health care services to \n     cancer patients is currently estimated at more than $104 \n     billion annually and is increasing each year. The generation \n     of new knowledge through research into the molecular events \n     involved in the cause and progression of cancer should lead \n     to increasingly effective means of protection and treatment, \n     the only means to stop the spread of disease, and curtail \n     these costs.\n       The Coalition recognizes that the Congress is pressed with \n     securing savings in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and \n     applauds your attention to the need to invest in biomedical \n     research to stop the spread of diseases which cause long term \n     care costs. The Coalition commends your amendment which \n     secures additional resources for biomedical research because, \n     without doubt, research is the gateway to progress against \n     cancer.\n       Thank you for seizing this opportunity now to do something \n     of utmost importance for our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Albert H. Owens, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               National Down Syndrome Society,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Alfonse D'Amato,\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hon. John Rockefeller.\n       Dear Senators: One in every 800 children is born with Down \n     Syndrome and there are over 350,000 people with this \n     condition in the U.S. today. It is the most commonly \n     occurring chromosomal abnormality, resulting when an \n     individual possesses three, rather than usual two, copies of \n     the 21st chromosome.\n       Medical research supported by the National Institutes of \n     Health is our only hope in developing better therapeutics to \n     treat those individuals who have Down syndrome and to help us \n     better understand the causes of this disease so we can one \n     day prevent it from occurring. The National Down Syndrome \n     Society has just entered a historic public-private research \n     initiative with the National Institutes of Child Health and \n     Human Development to examine behavior and cognitive \n     development of individuals with Down syndrome. This project \n     is an important first step in increasing our understanding of \n     this disease.\n       Thank you for your efforts and commitment to ensuring the \n     longterm viability of our medical research infrastructure. We \n     support your efforts to establish a National Fund for Health \n     Research to ensure the NIH has the resources necessary to \n     continue to advance medical science in the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Myra E. Madnick,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Alliance for Aging Research,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Alliance for Aging Research, an \n     independent not-for-profit organization working to improve \n     the health and independence of older Americans, applauds and \n     strongly supports an amendment to establish a National Fund \n     for Health Research. We understand this fund would be \n     established in the Treasury to expand support for medical \n     research through the National Institutes of Health.\n       As you know, the Alliance has consistently made the case \n     that the most effective means to achieve savings in Medicare \n     and Medicaid is by improving the health status of older \n     Americans. The most effective long-term strategy is to \n     advance biomedical research and to apply what we learn to \n     improved geriatric health management and prevention of \n     chronic disease. Studies released this year from Duke \n     University show a steady decline in chronic disability since \n     the 1980s among this nation's older population, saving \n     Medicare billions of dollars.\n       In a special report presented by the Alliance to the White \n     House Conference on Aging, we stated that by postponing \n     physical dependency for older Americans by just one month \n     would save the nation $5 billion a year in health care and \n     nursing home costs. Postponing the onset of Alzheimer's \n     Disease by just five years would, in time, save $50 billion a \n     year in health care costs. And a\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\n     five-year delay in the onset of cardiovascular disease could \n     save an estimated $69 billion a year.\n       Your amendment would be a first step toward fulfilling the \n     commitment made by the Senate through the Mack Sense of the \n     Senate calling for a doubling of the NIH in the next five \n     years. We understand this would in no way take the place of \n     the Congressional appropriations to the NIH.\n       Unless we discover better ways to treat, prevent or \n     postpone diseases of aging, the costs to the nation will grow \n     exponentially in the decades ahead. Again, I commend you and \n     your colleagues invaluable support for a strong national \n     investment in medical research.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Autism Society of America,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon.

John Rockefeller.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing on behalf of the Autism Society \n     of America to support your amendment to establish a National \n     Fund for Health Research with additional savings that may \n     result from changes made by the Balanced Budget Act which \n     exceed the savings called for in the Budget Resolution. As \n     the amount of discretionary funds available for medical \n     research funding continues to shrink, we must find other ways \n     to ensure that our research infrastructure is maintained.\n       Autism is a developmental disability that typically appears \n     during the first three years of life. It is believed to be a \n     genetically-based neurological disorder that affects more \n     than 400,000 individuals in the United States, making it the \n     third most prevalent developmental disability. Autism is four \n     times more prevalent in boys than girls, and knows no racial, \n     ethnic nor social boundaries. Family income, lifestyle, and \n     educational levels do not affect the chance of autism's \n     occurrence. The estimated health care cost associated with \n     autism is greater than $13 billion a year.\n       At the present time, there is no prevention, treatment, or \n     cure for autism. Our only hope in better understanding autism \n     is through research. NIH is embarking on many exciting \n     research endeavors focused on autism. In fact, NIH Director \n     Harold Varmus has said numerous times that the time is right \n     for autism research--we now have the tools to help us begin \n     to unlock the mysteries of this disorder.\n       We appreciate your commitment to identify an additional \n     source of funding for medical research and for giving \n     individuals with autism the hope that through research we \n     will find a treatment and cure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Sandra H.

John Rockefeller.\n       Dear Senators: Medical Research is critical to individuals \n     suffering for depressive illnesses. On behalf of the more \n     than 65,000 members of the National Depressive and Manic-\n     Depressive Association I am writing to support your amendment \n     to establish a National fund for Health Research.\n       Depressive illnesses are treatable diseases. Without the \n     research advances we have seen over the last 20 years, many \n     individuals suffering from depressive illnesses would not \n     have the opportunities they have today to participate as \n     contributing members of our society. New therapeutics which \n     have been developed through research are giving them this \n     chance.\n       In any given year, 17.4 million American adults have some \n     form of depressive illness such as major depression, bipolar \n     disorder, or chronic, moderate depression. These conditions \n     account for more than $148 billion in direct health care \n     costs, and indirect costs. Such as lost work days for \n     patients and care givers. Investments in biomedical and \n     behavioral research on mental disorders are imperative for \n     preventing and treating these debilitating illnesses and \n     controlling the costs associated with them.\n       Thank you for your efforts to expand our national \n     commitment to medical research!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lydia Lewis,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this budget bill--which would put us on a \npath to eliminating the budget deficit in the year 2002--contains \nnumerous reforms of the Medicare program. In addition, the bill would \nrestore short-term solvency to Part A of Medicare--the part that pays \nhospital bills and will otherwise be bankrupt in four years. I have no \nobjection to most of the Medicare reform provisions, and I will vote \nfor this bill overall.\n  However, I want to talk briefly about two provisions that I oppose \nand explain why I voted to take them out of this bill.\n  First, Mr. President, this bill would raise the age at which a person \nbecomes eligible for Medicare from the current age 65 to age 67. I \nvoted to keep the eligibility age at 65. While this increase would be \ngradual and would be phased in over the next 30 years--so it would not \naffect any current seniors--I think it moves us in the wrong direction. \nWhat we should be doing is making sure that more, not fewer, people \nhave health insurance.\n  Changing the current law so that today's workers will have to wait \nuntil they are 66 or 67 before they become eligible for Medicare \nthreatens to add millions of people to the rolls of the uninsured. It \nis my understanding that 70 percent of Americans who retire between the \nages of 60 and 65 will have no health insurance through their \nemployers. If they have health insurance at all, they are paying \nexorbitant rates to buy it on their own.\n  Increasing the eligibility age for Medicare by 2 years would leave \nmost of these people unprotected for 2 more years. This result is \ntotally counter to why we created Medicare in the first place: To make \nsure that older Americans have access to health care services when they \nare likely to need it the most. Raising the eligibility age for \nMedicare without addressing the issue of those who will lose--or those \nwho will continue not to have--health insurance is a glaring gap in \nthis proposal.\n  Now, it has been argued by supporters of this change that because the \nSocial Security retirement age will gradually increase to age 67, the \neligibility age for Medicare should increase at the same time. But, Mr. \nPresident, there is no rational basis for linking Social Security and \nMedicare. They are two separate and distinct programs. If it is good \npolicy to raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67--which I do not \nthink it is at this time--then those arguments need to be presented. It \nis not good enough simply to say, ``Well, that's what we're doing with \nSocial Security.'' And, I should note, that even when the Social \nSecurity retirement age increases, people will still have the option of \nearly retirement at age 62. That is not the case with Medicare. It is \nall or nothing. And, we should not tell people between 65 and 67 that \nthey get nothing.\n  The second provision that I opposed would have--for the first time--\nimposed means testing on higher income seniors. Under the plan, the \nmonthly premiums for Medicare part B, which pays for doctor services, \nwould have been based on how much income a person has. Now, I have long \nsaid that I believe it is not unfair or inappropriate to have wealthy \nseniors pay more for their Medicare coverage. So I support means \ntesting in principle. But I am not sure that the means testing scheme \nin this bill is either fair or appropriate--and I think we ought to be \nsure of both before we make such a significant change in this program.\n  This legislation was just drafted last week. Until noon yesterday--\nTuesday--this bill would have charged wealthier seniors higher \ndeductibles under part B. But, then at midday, just a couple of hours \nbefore we voted on this issue, the bill was changed so that retirees \nwith greater income would pay higher premiums, not higher deductibles. \nThe fact that this last minute change was made just exemplifies the \nproblem of trying to address this issue with haste.\n  The premium increases in this budget bill are very substantial, and \nthey would hit individuals with incomes over $50,000 and couples with \nincomes over $75,000. But we really do not know yet what the effect of \nthese increases would be on these families, or on the Medicare system \nitself. This is why we need to proceed with greater caution.\n  What we do in this budget bill--and what we must do--is what we have \ndone many times in the last 30 years: Make the changes necessary to \nensure the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund over the next \n10 years. To address the long-term concerns once the baby boom \ngeneration reaches retirement age, I have previously called for the \nestablishment of a bipartisan commission to study the situation and \nmake recommendations. This bill establishes just such a commission, and \ninstructs it to report back to Congress in a year.\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\n  My point is that neither the increase in the Medicare eligibility age \nnor means testing are necessary to solve the short-term financial \nproblems of the Medicare system. Instead, these are issues that the new \ncommission should look at. In making significant changes to the \nMedicare program--among the most successful Federal programs ever--we \nneed to do so with great thoughtfulness and deliberation.\n  These changes have no immediate impact on the Medicare trust fund or \non our general goal of balancing the overall Federal budget by 2002. In \nshort, there is no reason why we cannot wait until we have the benefit \nof the recommendations of the bipartisan commission--within the next \nyear--before we take action of this nature. That is why I supported \ntaking these changes out of the budget bill, and why I supported \nSenator Reed's alternative Medicare proposal to make only those changes \nneeded to make sure that Medicare remains financially solvent.\n\n\n                          MEDICARE PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate took several difficult votes in \nthe last two days related to Medicare reform. After carefully \nconsidering each of the amendments offered in the Senate, I cast my \nvote in favor of preserving and protecting the long-term solvency of \nthe Medicare system.\n  I voted for an amendment to eliminate the bill's provisions which \nwould require means testing of Medicare premiums. I also voted for an \namendment which would have simply delayed the implementation of premium \nmeans testing until the year 2000. I believe it is foolish to hastily \nmake such a drastic change as this without the benefit of an indepth \nstudy of the entire Medicare Program. Unfortunately, both of these \namendments failed.\n  I am concerned about the bill's provisions which would delay the \neligibility age for Medicare to 67 from the current age of 65. However, \nthe bill would not implement this change until the year 2003, which \nwill not affect current beneficiaries and, I believe, will allow us to \nassess this change within the context of a larger study of the program.\n  The bill does establish a bipartisan commission to study the entire \nMedicare Program and make recommendations for the changes necessary to \nkeep the program solvent beyond the year 2001, which is when the \ntrustees have reported the program will be bankrupt. I believe we \nshould wait for the commission's recommendations before enacting any \nfundamental changes to the program. However, I felt it was important to \nshow a willingness to consider taking a first step toward long-term \nstructural changes in order to give impetus to the commission's work.\n  The budget reconciliation bill before the Senate contains many key \nprovisions to expand benefits under Medicare and incorporate choice and \ncompetition into the current program. For example, the bill authorizes \nMedicare coverage of mammography screening, colorectal screening, bone \nmass measurement, and diabetes management. It also creates a Medicare \nChoice Program and a demonstration program for medical savings accounts \nfor seniors. It contains provisions designed to eliminate waste and \nfraud in the Medicare system which could result in significant savings. \nThese are improvements to Medicare for which I have fought for many \nyears.\n  I believe firmly that our priority must remain protecting the \nMedicare system from bankruptcy by the year 2001, and I will continue \nto work toward that goal.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 482\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Levin-Jeffords amendment increases from \n12 to 24 months the limit on the amount of vocational education \ntraining that a State can count toward meeting its work requirement \nunder the new Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. Under \nthe old welfare law, recipients could attend postsecondary vocational \neducation training for up to 24 months. I strongly support the new \nlaw's emphasis on moving welfare recipients more quickly into jobs, but \nI am troubled by the law's restriction on vocational education \ntraining, limiting it to 12 months. Two-year community college study, \nfor instance, would not meet the requirement.\n  Mr. President, the limitation on postsecondary education training \nraises a number of concerns, not the least of which is whether persons \nmay be forced into low-paying, short-term employment that will lead \nthem back onto public assistance because they are unable to support \ntheir families.\n  Study after study indicates that short-term training programs raise \nthe income of workers only marginally, while completion of at least a \n2-year associate degree has greater potential of breaking the cycle of \npoverty for welfare recipients. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nthe median earnings of adults with an associate degree are 30 percent \nhigher than adults with only a high school diploma or its recognized \nequivalent.\n  Mr. President, let me just give some examples. The following are jobs \nthat a person could prepare for in a two-year community college program \nand the salary range generally applicable to the positions:\n\n\n                               NATIONWIDE\n\n       Accounting, $14,000-$28,000.\n       Computer technician, $14,000-$31,000.\n       Law enforcement, $13,500-$25,000.\n       Dental hygiene, $18,000-$60,000.\n       Respiratory therapy tech, $21,000-$32,000.\n\n\n                                MICHIGAN\n\n       Computer programing, $24,800-$42,900.\n       Radiology technician, $22.235-$32.425.\n       Legal assistant, $28,630-$30,000.\n       Child care development (supervisor), $23,590-$29,724.\n       Registered nurse, $24,400-$38,135.\n\n  Mr. President, the National Governors Association recognizes the \nmerits of this amendment and has called for its passage. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it because it will help us reach the new law's \nintended goal of getting families permanently off of welfare and onto \nself-sufficiency.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two \narticles that are relevant to this issue which appeared in the February \n17, 1997, USA Today and the June 1, 1996, New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Feb. 17, 1997]\n\n                   College Off Limits in Welfare Plan\n\n                            (By John Ritter)\n\n       States rushing to get welfare recipients off the rolls and \n     into jobs are telling some college students on public \n     assistance to drop out and find work.\n       Under the old welfare system, recipients of cash grants \n     could go to school full-time. The new law, with its emphasis \n     on moving welfare recipients quickly into jobs, restricts \n     educational options.\n       Short-term job training and a year of vocational education \n     are approved ``work activities'' under the new federal law, \n     passed last year, but regular college and community college \n     study are not.\n       So even as President Clinton preaches education as the \n     route to prosperity, welfare reform is forcing recipients--\n     predominantly single mothers--to forsake school for low-\n     paying jobs.\n       States must put bigger proportions of their welfare \n     caseloads to work--25% this year, 50% by 2002--or lose funds.\n       ``The emphasis has shifted from how can we retrain people \n     or pick up where their education left off to how can we move \n     them into work,'' says Elaine Ryan of the American Public \n     Welfare Association.\n       By one estimate, as many as 700,000 single parents on \n     welfare are enrolled in higher education and training.\n       In California, 125,000 welfare recipients attend community \n     colleges. The City University of New York system has 20,500 \n     welfare students.\n       Schools already are lobbying state legislatures to find \n     ways to keep these students and their tuition reimbursements.\n       But prospects are not bright.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 1, 1996]\n\n           Workfare Rules Cause Enrollment to Fall, CUNY Says\n\n                         (By Karen W.

The decline in enrollment is significant, CUNY \n     officials say, because studies show that college gives people \n     on welfare a good chance to get better jobs at higher pay.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me take 1 minute, and then we are \ngoing to final passage. I want to thank everybody for their \ncooperation. Under a very difficult process and procedure, I think we \ndid very well. On a number of issues, there was great bipartisan \nsupport. I thank those on the other side of the aisle who have \nsupported this overall package, and I hope the vote is overwhelming. \nTonight we complete\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nthe first step of three legs. The three legs are to get the deficit \ndown by reducing spending; second is for us to get a good tax bill for \nall Americans; third is to do the appropriations bills in a manner that \nis consistent with the agreement and which doesn't violate the Budget \nAct.\n  I believe this is a historic beginning, and I am very pleased to be \npart of it. I thank everyone here for their role. I thank all eight \ncommittees that assumed their burden and produced their reconciliation \npackage. Mostly, I thank Senator Roth, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and Senator Moynihan, his Democratic manager, and all those \non the Finance Committee who worked to produce a bipartisan bill.\n  The lesson learned is that we can get things done that are difficult \nbut good for the American people in a bipartisan way if we just work at \nit. I believe the best example we have of that is the Finance Committee \nthis year. All the other committees had lesser responsibilities, but \nthey provided their savings without rancor and with almost unanimity \nand, if not, a unanimity of spirit. I believe there is no process that \nwould have let us in the U.S. Senate get this much work done. If this \nbill were freestanding and the tax bill were freestanding without the \nprotections of the Budget Act, I just ask you to dream about what might \nhappen. First, I think each bill could take 4 or 5 weeks, I think the \namendments could run into the hundreds, and the bill could look like \nsomething completely different by the time we finished than what we \nstarted with. So we take some bad with the good in this difficult \nprocess called the reconciliation bill.\n  I thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee not only for the \nwork here on the floor, but actually as we moved through the last 3\\1/\n2\\ months, Senator Lautenberg has been very good to work with, and we \nproduced a good package, which will show up here in a bipartisan vote \ntonight. I thank the Senator. We produced a good bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will be brief. I sense that \neverybody would like to hear a long speech, but I am going to \ndisappoint them. I just want to say, Mr. President, that I, too, \nenjoyed my work with the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. We managed to resolve all of our problems without too much \ndispute, without any confrontation. There wasn't a moment that we \nwalked out on anything. This reconciliation bill is consistent with \nthat. We did, as it was appropriately noted, rush through some things. \nBut that does not at all, in my view, suggest that we rushed through \nand didn't have the appropriate knowledge or review of the items that \nwe were processing.\n  I thought it was a job very well done. I must say, if we didn't have \nsome time constraint on this, Heaven knows how long we would all be \nhere. We would see summer come and go and we would still be debating.\n  Again, I enjoyed the process and my first time at bat with the Budget \nCommittee in the position that I have. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope \nthat Senator Domenici will, as my ranking member in the not-too-distant \nfuture, also enjoy it. I promise to be cooperative.\n  I want to thank the staff of the Policy Committee, but particularly \nmy senior staff here--Bruce King, Sander Lurie, Nell Mays, Marty \nMorris, Amy Abraham, John Cahill, Jodi Grant, Matt Greenwald, Phil \nKarsting, Sue Nelson, Jon Rosenwasser, Jim Klumpner, and Mitch Warren--\nwho did a terrific job, as I know Bill Hoagland and his team did. I \nwon't go through the names, but I will say that I have gotten to know \nthem and respect them and admire the work they have done. I thank \neverybody for their cooperation, particularly my colleagues on this \nside.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Gramm would like 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of people speak in my 13 \nyears in the Senate, but I don't think I have ever seen anybody do a \nbetter job of taking complicated issues and explaining them in a very \nshort time as Senator Domenici has done in the last 2 days. I think we \nhave made history on this bill, and I think the Senator from New Mexico \nhas been a very important part of that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in my opening statement, I thanked my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, and our staff for their excellent work. I would be remiss, \nhowever, if I failed to conclude without again expressing my \nappreciation for these diligent professionals--men and women who work \ninto the wee, wee hours, late nights, early mornings, and weekends to \nhelp us craft a bill that could find the kind of success that this has \nfound on the Senate floor.\n  I would like to particularly thank the following majority and \nminority staff of the Finance Committee who worked so hard on this \nbill, including Lindy Paull, Frank Polk, Julie James, Dennis Smith, \nGioia Bonmartini, Alexander Vachon, Dee Dee Spitznagel, Joan Woodward, \nBrig Gulya, Mark Patterson, David Podoff, Faye Drummond, Kristen Testa, \nDoug Steiger, Rick Werner, and Rakesh Singh.\n  Again, I am grateful for the outstanding work that they did.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, earlier this month I read an article by Dana \nMack, a mother and the author of a new book, ``The Assault on \nParenthood: How Our Culture Undermines the Family.'' It was powerfully \npersuasive. Her thesis was that parents today love their families as \nmuch as, if not more than, ever--that today's parents are attentive and \neven more committed than those of an earlier generation but that they \nare pressed economically.\n  In her studies, Ms. Mack discovered that the most serious challenges \nfaced by parents today are economic challenges.\n  Listen to her statistics. It costs the average American couple today \ntwice--twice--the proportion of their yearly household income to pay \nthe mortgage than it cost their parents; average Federal income payroll \ntaxes rose from 2 percent of family earnings in 1950 to 24 percent in \n1990; health costs have skyrocketed in the past 20 years, sending 4 to \n5 million women to work for medical insurance alone.\n  Consider these statistics along with the one that has been repeated \noften in the debate over real tax relief--that American families pay \nmore in taxes than they do for food, clothing, and shelter combined--\nand it becomes apparent how important this Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nis. Tax relief is no longer a partisan issue, and I was encouraged by \nthe spirited cooperation that was exhibited in the Senate Finance \nCommittee as we deliberated and then reported this bipartisan bill out \nof committee.\n  Such a bipartisan effort allows me to stand on the floor and say \nwithout hype or hyperbole that today is, indeed, a historic day. It is \nhistoric because this proposal is truly bipartisan, and, as a \nconsequence, Americans can look forward to their first significant tax \ncut in 16 years. It is historic because the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nis part of a budget reconciliation that will lead our Nation to a \nbalanced budget in 2002.\n  And because of our efforts to ensure bipartisan cooperation, the \nFinance Committee bill we consider today contains a balanced and fair \npackage of tax relief measures. It includes proposals important to both \nDemocrats and Republicans, and it is structured to provide major tax \nrelief--relief to America's hard working and overburdened families.\n  There were three criteria that guided our work. We wanted tax relief \nfor middle-income families, tax relief to promote education, and tax \nrelief to stimulate economic growth, opportunity, and jobs.\n  With these objectives in mind, we crafted a bill that includes a $500 \nper child tax credit, and an increase in the exemption amount for \npurposes of the alternative minimum tax, a provision that will save \nmillions of middle-income families from experiencing the headaches of \nAMT.\n  We crafted a bill that contains tax measures to assist students and \ntheir parents in affording the cost of postsecondary education. These \ninclude the $1,500 Hope scholarship tax credit, a $2,500 student loan \ninterest deduction, and a permanent extension of the tax-free treatment \nof employer-provided educational assistance.\n  We also included the tax-free treatment of State-sponsored prepaid \ntuition assistance plans, a new education IRA serving both education \nand retirement needs, tax incentives for teacher training and school \nconstruction, and a repeal of the tax exempt bond cap.\n  To promote savings, investment, and economic growth, we expanded \nIRA's. We did this by doubling the income limits on the tax deductible \nIRA so that more families can set up an IRA. We expanded the spousal \nIRA. For the first time, homemakers will be able to save up to $2,000 \nannually regardless of their spouse's participation, in an employer \npension plan. And we also created a new nondeductible IRA Plus account. \nA very important part of this IRA Plus is that it will allow penalty-\nfree withdrawals for first-time home purchases and periods of long-term \nunemployment. And to promote investment and jobs we included a capital \ngains tax cut, dropping the top rate to 20 percent. This will create \nnew incentives for venture capital.\n  For families, this bill offers relief from the estate tax, the tax \nthat can rob a family of its farm or business when a father or mother \npasses away. To help these families, we raise the unified credit to $1 \nmillion per estate by 2006, and we provide tax-free treatment for \nfamily-owned farms and businesses for up to $1 million.\n  Each of these is an important step, Mr. President. The fact that \nthese were included in a bipartisan proposal indicates that business as \nusual is changing in Washington. The Senate is willing to lay aside \npartisan politics to provide Americans with the kind of tax relief they \nneed.\n  As with any bipartisan effort, not everyone will be fully satisfied \nwith this proposal. For my part, I would like to see greater tax \nrelief, and I consider this the first in a series of steps that I hope \nwill lead to deeper tax cuts and eventual long-term reform. But this \nbipartisan effort signals an important beginning, one which is built \nupon a foundation of principles we share, whether we be Republican or \nDemocrat.\n\n  Eighty-two percent of this tax relief is made up by our family tax \ncut and education assistance, priorities that we all share. As I have \nsaid, it represents the biggest tax cut in 16 years, tax relief that is \nfocused on middle-income families.\n  But beyond these major tax cuts, our proposal contains a number of \nimportant smaller items. These include the extension of certain \nexpiring tax provisions. For example, we extend the R tax credit, a \ncredit that helps our exporters compete in world markets to maintain \nour leading edge in several key industries.\n  We make the orphan drug credit permanent and allow for contributions \nof full value of appreciated stock to charitable foundations. We also \nextend and expand the work opportunity tax credit to assist welfare \nrecipients and others in getting jobs.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contains a package of measures to \nhelp the District of Columbia get on its feet, including a reduced \ncapital gains tax rate and a first-time homebuyer tax credit. It \ncontains a guaranteed and secure source of funding for Amtrak to enable \nour national rail passenger system to move to privatization. And it \nalso has a measure allowing taxpayers to expense the cost of cleaning \nup brownfields, as well as several measures to help taxpayers who have \nbeen victims of floods in the Upper Midwest. And finally, we offer tax \nsimplification in the pension, individual, foreign, and small business \nareas.\n  Mr. President, this package includes several revenue raisers that \npartially offset the cost of the tax cut. The most prominent is an \nextension and improvement of the funding stream for our national \naviation system and a 20-cent tax on cigarettes. Beyond these, we close \nloopholes in the foreign tax area, as well as in the area of corporate-\nowned life insurance and tax shelter reporting.\n  I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the spirit of \nbipartisanship that prevailed as we crafted this tax relief package. It \nhas been a successful, productive experience because we have worked \ntogether, taking the recommendations and concerns of each member of the \nFinance Committee, as well as the recommendations of our colleagues \noutside of the committee, and we have put together a package that is \nworkable, a package that will go a long ways toward offering relief, \nespecially to America's overburdened middle class.\n  Now, I realize that in the course of debating this proposal in the \nChamber there will be those who stand against this bipartisan bill. In \na partisan effort, there will be those who attack this tax relief bill. \nBefore they begin their arguments, however, I want to put them on \nnotice. I want them to understand that the lion's share of the\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\ntax package--82 percent--goes for the family tax credit and the \neducation package. Eighty-two percent is directed to middle-income \nfamilies.\n  I want them to understand that according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, at least three-quarters or 75 percent goes to families making \n$75,000 or less, and at least 90 percent goes to families making \n$100,000 or less.\n  These are the facts, and they are understood on both sides of the \naisle. They are understood by those who believe that the time has come \nto provide real, meaningful tax relief to hard-working families that \nhave been overburdened for too long.\n  They are understood by those who realize, as President Clinton has \nsaid, that the era of big Government is over and now Washington must \npromote an environment where the genius of enterprise and the market \neconomy can sustain long-term economic growth and bring jobs and \nsecurity to families everywhere.\n  I began my remarks by quoting an article that highlights the economic \nstrain placed on families today, and let me close by using three \nhypothetical Delaware families and show how the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997 will benefit each of them.\n  Let's begin with a single mother whom we will call Judy Smith. Judy \nhas two young children. She works as a legal secretary in Wilmington \nmaking $35,000 a year. Currently, she pays over $3,000 in Federal \nincome taxes--over $3,000. Now, to put that into perspective, $3,000 is \nwhat her family of three will pay all year to buy the food they eat at \nhome. In other words, Judy's paying the Federal Government what it \ncosts to feed her family.\n  Now, when the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 becomes law, Judy's taxes \nwill be cut by $1,000--$500 for each child. A third of her Federal tax \nliability will be gone. And what can Judy do with that extra $1,000?\n  I am sure she can think of a number of good uses, but if she wants--\nagain thanks to the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997--Judy will be able to \nset up education IRA's for her two children.\n  The second hypothetical family I want to introduce you to is a \nmarried couple, Jim and Julie Wilson. The Wilsons own a farm in Sussex \nCounty. They have three children. Jim works the farm and Julie is a \nhomemaker. They earn $55,000 per year from their farm. Of that $55,000, \nthey pay over $5,500 in Federal income taxes--fifty-five hundred \ndollars. That, Mr. President, is more than they will pay for all the \nfood they consume at home during the year. After the Taxpayers Relief \nAct of 1997, however, the Wilson's taxes will be cut by $1,500--$500 \nfor each child. Julie Wilson will be able to set up a homemaker IRA to \nsave for her retirement.\n  If Delaware adopts a State-sponsored prepaid tuition plan, the \nWilsons will be able to participate in the plan and save for their \nchildren's college education. Looking far ahead, if the farm prospers, \nJim and Julie will be able to pass it on to their children free of the \nburden of the estate tax. All of these benefits to this middle-income \nfamily are contained in the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let's look at a young two income couple. \nWe'll call then John and Susan Jones. They live and work in Dover, DE. \nCollege graduates, John is a veterinarian and Susan is a physical \ntherapist. They make $75,000 and have one young child. Under current \nlaw, the Jones family pays about $11,500 in Federal income taxes. After \nwe pass the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997, the Jones will be able to \ndeduct a portion of the interest on their student loans. They will \nreceive the $500 per child tax credit, and they will be able to set up \nIRA Plus accounts for themselves and an education IRA for their child.\n  It is for families like these that we have created the Taxpayers \nRelief Act of 1997. It is because of its fairness that this bill \nreceived strong bipartisan support in committee. I believe the Finance \nCommittee fairly reflects the Senate as a whole--as well as the broad \ninterests and concerns of the constituents our Members represent. This \nis their package. It delivers to the American people what they asked us \nto do in the last election--a bipartisan and fair return of the fiscal \ndividend accruing from a balanced budget.\n  I am grateful to all who worked so long as so well to draft this \nbill. I am grateful for Senator Moynihan's leadership, as well as for \nthe other members of the committee who allowed bipartisan cooperation \nto prevail throughout the process. And again, Mr. President--as I did \nyesterday--I thank the professional capable staff of the Senate Finance \nCommittee for their countless hours and lost sleep. This was, indeed, \nan heroic effort, and it is my honor to bring it to the floor.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield if he has completed \nhis statement?\n  Mr. ROTH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator indicate what the plan is for the rest of \nthe day and tomorrow?\n  Mr. ROTH. It is my plan to continue for several hours this evening, \nprobably until 9, 9:30, 10, come back in the morning around 9:30 and \nproceed throughout the day.\n  Mr. BYRD. When you say your plan is to continue to about 9 or 9:30 \ntonight--was that it?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is my thought now, yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will there be amendments called up?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, amendments will be called up, but there will be no \nvotes tonight. They will be held over until the morning.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the plan with regard to votes on tomorrow?\n  Mr. ROTH. There will be votes, hopefully, throughout the day.\n  Mr. BYRD. Beginning when?\n  Mr. ROTH. The first vote, I think, I would say to my good friend from \nWest Virginia, would start around 9:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator plan to attempt to stack these votes this \nevening if amendments are called up?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. It has been announced by the leader that there will be \nno more votes tonight, so if we complete debate on any amendment, it \nwould be stacked in the morning.\n  Mr. BYRD. I had not heard any announcement with regard to the modus \noperandi with respect to this bill, insofar as the evening is \nconcerned, and actions on tomorrow.\n  What I am concerned about is it appears to me we are going to get \nourselves right back in the same situation that we were in today with \nstacked votes and only a couple of minutes for explanations and some \nSenators like myself really not knowing what is in the amendments.\n  Mr. ROTH. I do not expect that many amendments to be raised tonight. \nI will say at most it will be one or two, and there will be time in the \nmorning for the sponsors and opponents to review the pros and cons of \nthe amendments.\n  I would, of course, urge Members to bring their amendments to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thought most Members were leaving when I saw them lined \nup for the vote. Does the Senator contemplate any point in time when \nall amendments will be presented to the Senate? Is there going to be a \ndeadline of that, as to a time? I think in connection with the bill \nthat was passed today, it seems to me that all amendments had to be \noffered before the close of business, or by the close of business, last \nevening. What is the plan in regard to this measure?\n  Mr. ROTH. We do not have any plan at this time to say amendments have \nto be submitted by such and such a time. But, of course, as you know, \nthere is a 20-hour limitation on reconciliation. So, hopefully, \neverybody will bring their amendments down early so they can be \nconsidered early and we can avoid the situation that we had of a lot of \nSenators bringing their amendments at the end.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator plan to have between \namendments on tomorrow for explanations of the stacked amendments?\n  Mr. ROTH. I hadn't really considered that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not trying to create problems for the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. No, I understand. I would say we would give 5 minutes to a \nside.\n  Mr. BYRD. Five minutes to a side?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes; 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. That would be quite an improvement over what we have been \nseeing with only 2 minutes and so much noise in the Chamber it was \ndifficult for Senators to hear what was being said in the 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think the situation, of course, arose on the legislation \nwe just passed upon because people did not\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\nbring their amendments in until the last minute and then, under the \nrules, there is no more time. You know better than I, in a sense, \ngiving 2 minutes goes beyond the rule.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, could we have a limitation on the number of \namendments that will be called up this evening and stacked for tomorrow \nmorning?\n  Mr. ROTH. I suspect our real problem is going to be to get people \ndown here to offer them. But I don't want to discourage anyone in the \ncourse, so I would prefer not to try to limit it, for that reason.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Does the Senator have any idea how much time is going \nto be--there is a total of 20 hours on the measure. Does the Senator \nhave an idea how much time we will have of the 20 hours on tomorrow?\n  Mr. ROTH. No, I can't really answer that.\n  Going back to your question about tonight, if we could bring up six \ntonight, that would be a maximum and I would be pleased at that.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I realize the Senator is not in a position to make certain \npronouncements that would be binding on others interested in the \nmeasure, but I am concerned lest we tomorrow find ourselves short of \ntime; quite a number of votes that have been stacked, not much time for \nexplaining those amendments and, in the final analysis, voting on the \nmeasures that we know very little, if anything, about. I am not talking \nabout the Senator. He is on the committee. He knows what is in the \namendments.\n  Mr. ROTH. No. I appreciate what the Senator is saying.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will probably have two amendments. One of my amendments--\nI may offer an amendment that will attempt to extend the time on \nreconciliation measures. So I might say to the Senator, I want to be \nable to call up that amendment tomorrow, if I am able to develop one in \nthe short amount of time that we have.\n  I have another amendment that I have been working on, and I hope we \ncould count on, say, 4 minutes equally divided between each amendment \nthat is stacked, so we would get 2 minutes on a side. I find the \nexplanations that are offered on amendments between votes are more \nedifying, in many instances, than the debates that went along earlier. \nMost Senators are able to capsule their remarks and focus more. But I \nreally don't think a minute to a side is enough. I have seen some \nSenators cut off in the middle of sentences because the minute ran out. \nSo, if we could say 4 minutes equally divided, would the Senator be \nagreeable to that?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would certainly be agreeable at this stage, I would say \nto the distinguished Senator. Once we utilize the full time, it is \nsomething I might want to review from time to time. But I understand \nwhat the former majority leader is saying, and I appreciate his \nreasoning behind it.\n  So, as far as the morning is concerned, I assure him there will be 4 \nminutes equally divided on any amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe that the rule with regard to reconciliation bills \nprovides for 2 hours on any amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. And 1 hour on any amendment to an amendment. That being the \ncase, if the Senators so chose, they could use up the 20 hours on \nseveral amendments.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct. That is, I guess, part of the basic \nstructure of the reconciliation. I think, to be candid, that was \ndeliberately done at that time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Circumstances have changed since that measure was written.\n  Mr. ROTH. And we all learn from experience.\n  Mr. BYRD. I had a lot to do with writing that in 1974.\n  Mr. ROTH. You played a critical role.\n  Mr. BYRD. Things were different then. If I could foresee what I now \nsee, looking backward, I probably would have changed it a little bit. \nBut, in any event, I thank the distinguished Senator. I didn't want to \nintrude on his time or impose on him, but I am just concerned, as I \nsaid today, and frustrated--without complaining about any individual. I \ndon't find fault with any individual.\n  Mr. ROTH. I fully understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. Every individual is acting in good faith. With that \nunderstanding that we will have 4 minutes equally divided between each \namendment and there is no deadline at this point in time drawn with \nregard to the offering of amendments, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree that on any amendments considered and stacked \ntoday, there will be 4 minutes prior to the votes tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator for the exchange.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we begin the debate on the second of \ntwo budget reconciliation bills called for under the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998, I again want to commend \nand thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for the \nfine bipartisan manner in which he has led us this year. I look forward \nto that spirit of bipartisanship continuing today as we work toward the \nadoption of the tax bill by the full Senate.\n  It is my belief, although it is not much shared just now in Congress \nor in the White House, that this is no time for tax cuts. Just \nyesterday, in a report released by Treasury Secretary Rubin, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, in its annual review of the U.S. economy, \nstated that the United States should delay tax cuts ``in order to \nachieve an earlier reduction in the budget deficit'' and strengthen the \ncredibility of the balanced-budget pact between Congress and President \nClinton.\n  Were it up to this Senator, we would continue on the deficit \nreduction course begun in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993, which has had extraordinary results. The economy is in its best \nshape in 30 years. CBO projects that the deficit will be $67 billion \nfor fiscal year 1997, far below original estimates. Inflation was just \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent in May--equivalent to an annual inflation rate \nof only 2 percent. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, its \nlowest in more than a quarter century, and the Wall Street Journal \nreported today that the measurement of consumer confidence in the \neconomy is at a 28-year high.\n  Given this success, we may well come to regret having enacted the tax \ncuts in this bill. Nevertheless, we do not have a majority in the 105th \nCongress. The congressional leadership and the President have agreed \nthat there will be tax cuts this year. And so given that reality, I \njoined with other Democratic members of the Finance Committee in \nworking with Chairman Roth--in a bipartisan mode--to help shape the \nbill now before us. The resulting legislation is not altogether what \nsome of us would prefer, but even so it does include a number of \nredeeming provisions.\n  I would particularly wish to commend and thank the chairman for the \ninclusion of the following provisions: Making permanent the single most \nsuccessful tax incentive for education, the exclusion from income of \nemployer-provided educational assistance under section 127. The Roth-\nMoynihan bill to make 127 permanent now has over 50 cosponsors, \nincluding all 20 members of the Finance Committee; repealing the cap on \nissuance of section 501(c)(3) bonds for universities, colleges, and \nnonhospital health facilities; providing $2.3 billion in funding for \nAmtrak by allocating one-half cent per gallon of the Federal gasoline \nexcise tax; and extending the fair-market value deductibility of gifts \nof appreciated property to private foundations.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I say to my friends and colleagues, please \ncome down and present your amendments. The bill is now open to \namendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Madam President. I first want to \ncongratulate the Senator from Delaware for an excellent bill he has put \nforward on an important topic. We are finally talking about tax cuts, \nsomething we should have been talking about for a long period of time, \nbut we haven't since 1981. This is a great day. I think it is a great \nopening that we are finally doing something about the tax burden on the \nAmerican people, where they are paying over 40 percent of their income \nin taxes. I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for \nraising this.\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, as I was stating briefly earlier, I \nwant to recognize the work of the Finance Committee chairman, who is \ndoing an extraordinary job and doing something we haven't done since \n1981, and that is cut taxes. We need to do this, we need to do it to \nstimulate the economy.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, we have had some good discussions \nhere. Looking at the overall tax cut bill that we have, which I think \nis very important that we do, I am congratulatory toward the chairman.\n  I chair the District of Columbia Subcommittee. We have really been \nlooking strong at what we need to do in the District of Columbia to \nmake us a shining city. The chairman has done an extraordinary job of \nincluding things like zeroing out capital gains on real property in the \nDistrict of Columbia, something I think we ought to look at nationwide, \nbut let us try it here first.\n  We also have in there a provision for new homeowners and new home \nbuyers, a $5,000 tax credit provision in there for new home buyers in \nthe District of Columbia to attract people back to Washington, DC, to \nmake it a shining city.\n  Unfortunately, there is one other provision, section 602, in the bill \nthat creates an economic development corporation--requires the creation \nof an economic development corporation--in order to access some of the \ntax credits. I have great difficulty with this entity. It is something \nthat would have to be created by the District of Columbia Committee. It \nis an entity that would have condemnation authority. It is an entity \nthat would have a broad base of authority, appointed by the President. \nIt is in effect going to be a department of commerce for the District \nof Columbia with a lot more authority and a lot more power.\n  I do not think that survives the Byrd rule test, and I raise the \npoint of order on section 602 of Senate bill 949 under the Revenue \nReconciliation Act of 1997, the Byrd rule provision, because I believe \nthese are extraneous. I think this is an ill-conceived concept even \nthough I am very supportive of what the chairman has done overall for \nthe District of Columbia. He is stepping up to solve the problem. But I \ndo not think this provision is the way to go. I do raise a point of \norder under the Byrd rule to that particular provision, section 602.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, first, let me say that I appreciate the \ninterest and concern expressed by my colleague from Kansas. I will and \ndo hereby, under section 904 of the Budget Act, move to waive the point \nof order raised by him.\n  I urge that in the meantime he might work with my staff to see if we \ncan develop some alternative that meets his concern with the present \nlanguage and see if we cannot develop something that will move this \nproposition ahead.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I will take those suggestions to \nheart and will see if we can work something out.\n  Let me again say one more time, this chairman--anybody in Washington, \nDC, watching this should be thankful for what he has done in stepping \nup and solving a tough problem of how we do make this a shining city \nagain. I applaud that effort and will work with his staff to see if we \ncan resolve particular concerns that he has before a vote tomorrow.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is pending.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. At this time it is my pleasure to call upon my \ndistinguished colleague from the State of North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise this evening to offer some \namendments. I will do so and understand that they will be set aside for \nother business to be conducted after these amendments. I wanted to have \nan opportunity to discuss them, some of which I hope the chairman and \nranking member will be able to support. Others I expect they will not.\n  But I do so with great respect. And I say, as I begin this process, \nthat I was very impressed that the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nthe Senator from Delaware, clearly sought bipartisanship and sought a \nworking relationship with all members of the committee as he \nconstructed the piece of legislation that is now on the floor of the \nSenate. I, for one, applaud him for that.\n  Some of the proposals in this piece of legislation I think are \nexcellent proposals, I support them. Others, I would have written \ndifferently. And that is the purpose of offering some amendments. But \ngenerally speaking, I think the Senator from Delaware has done the \nSenate a service by saying, when the committee writes a bill, he wants \nto involve all members of the committee. Instead of, as is so often the \ncase here in the Senate, having a political debate ending up with the \nworst of what each has to offer, reaching out and getting the best of \nwhat both sides have to offer on these issues makes a great deal of \nsense.\n  So I begin by paying my compliments to the manner in which the \nFinance Committee wrote this bill. As I said, some parts of the bill I \nsupport very strongly. Other parts, I would have written differently \nand would like to change. That is the purpose for this discussion.\n\n\n                            Motion To Refer\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me describe a motion to refer I \nintend to offer that I want to get a vote on as we proceed. It is a \nmotion that would do the following:\n  We are proposing, and Congress will likely allow to become law, a \nseries of tax cuts. I support some of these proposals. I want to be \ncertain, however, that the direction that we are heading is a direction \nthat will not explode the deficit in the outyears.\n  We are all familiar with the stories about the 1981 tax cut proposals \nand the discussion about the fiscal policy in which we then had less \nrevenue but built up our military spending, double, and then \nentitlements continued to rise, and the result was we blew a real hole \nin the Federal deficit.\n  I am going to propose a trigger, in essence. I will do it, however, \nin a different manner. I will do it with a motion to refer the bill \nback to the committee with instructions to report back with an \namendment providing for a mechanism to temporarily suspend sections of \nthe bill dealing with capital gains and the IRAs in any fiscal year \nafter the year 2002 if two things occur:\n  One, the Congressional Budget Office reports that the revenues lost \ndue to the bill have exceeded the budget agreement's restrictions on \ntax cuts, and, two, the Department of the Treasury reports there has \nbeen a deficit in the previous fiscal year.\n  My point is very simple. I would like us to have some safety \nmechanism in this piece of legislation that says, if where we are \nheaded beyond the first 5 years results in additional Federal budget \ndeficits, that then we could suspend temporarily a part of these tax \nchanges so that we can get the budget back into balance.\n  I have proposed it the way I have proposed it because I do not want \nus to discover that we are having budget deficits in the outyears \nsimply because we are spending more money. That is not my purpose. But \nI do want to be in a circumstance here or have the Senate be in a \nsituation that if the amount of tax cuts exceed the revenues that we \nhad an agreement for in this piece of legislation, and if the Treasury \nDepartment reports that we had a deficit the previous year, that four \nsections of this tax cut would be temporarily suspended in order to get \nthe budget back in balance.\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\n  That will be one of my recommendations. I do that simply because I \nwant us to be certain beyond the first 5 years that we maintain the \nfiscal discipline that I think is commendable and I think is necessary.\n  We have, I think, achieved some things together in this Congress with \na budget agreement, one which I voted for. I do not want to blow that \napart in the sixth, seventh or eighth years out believing then, well, \nwe balanced the budget for 5 years and then all of a sudden the budget \nis out of balance and in a deficit condition once again.\n  So I send this motion to refer to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion to refer.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] moves to \n     refer the bill, S. 949, to the Committee on the Budget, \n     with instructions to report the bill back to the Senate \n     within 3 calendar days of session with an amendment \n     providing for a mechanism to sunset temporarily Sections \n     301, 302, 304 and 311 of the bill in any fiscal year after \n     fiscal year 2002, if (1) the Congressional Budget Office \n     reports that the revenues lost due to the bill have \n     exceeded the budget agreement's restrictions on tax cuts \n     and (2) the Department of the Treasury reports that there \n     has been a deficit in the previous fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Next, Madam President and the chairman of the committee, \nI intend to offer three amendments that are relatively small, targeted \namendments that deal with the issue of disasters, natural disasters. \nMost of us recognize that we have spent a lot of time talking about \ndisaster relief and issues affecting people dealing with flood \ndisasters, earthquake disasters, tornadoes and fires and so on.\n  We had a circumstance in our region of the country where the Red \nRiver had a massive flood, a 500-year flood. We had 90 percent of a \ncommunity of 50,000 people who were displaced out of their homes, many \nhundreds of those homes--nearly 1,000 homes--have been totally and \npermanently destroyed.\n  In many of those cases, all of their records were destroyed as well. \nPeople left with a half hour's notice and only the clothes they were \nwearing and lost everything. The Internal Revenue Service knowing that \nthis happened the first week or so of April, second week of April, they \nsaid, ``We will allow an extension to file income tax returns.'' It is \npretty clear people fleeing a flood and who have lost everything, \nincluding all of their records, will not be able to file tax returns on \nApril 15.\n  So the Internal Revenue Service said they would extend the tax filing \ndeadline. I appreciate that. And it made a lot of sense because \nhundreds of those people, thousands of those people could not have \ncomplied, people in South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota. The IRS \nsaid, ``We will consider a tax return timely filed if it's filed by the \nend of May.'' Then as this flood continued, they moved it to August, \nand that is where it is.\n  The IRS said to those victims of that disaster, ``If you file by that \ndate, there will be no penalty because we have moved the filing date,'' \nrecognizing you could not possibly comply. But then the IRS said, ``But \nyou are going to have to pay interest because we don't have the \nauthority to waive the interest.'' The disaster victims have asked the \nquestion, ``Well, if it is considered timely filed, why are we being \ncharged interest?'' And the Internal Revenue Service said, ``Well, \nyou're being charged interest because we don't have the capability of \nwaiving it.''\n  The Treasury Secretary said he is sympathetic to my amendment, he \nwill support it. I have talked to the majority on this, and I hope this \nwill be one that--it will have an almost insignificant revenue \nconsequence, but just makes sense. It gives the IRS the authority \nclearly to do what it wants to do and should do but does not now have \nthe authority to do.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the motion to \nrefer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 515\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to abate the \naccrual of interest on income tax underpayments by taxpayers located in \n  Presidentially declared disaster areas if the Secretary extends the \n time for filing returns and payment of tax (and waives any penalties \n   relating to the failure to so file or so pay) for such taxpayers)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer the amendment and send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 515.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 211, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 724. ABATEMENT OF INTEREST ON UNDERPAYMENTS BY \n                   TAXPAYERS IN PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER \n                   AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6404 (relating to abatements) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Abatement of Interest on Underpayments by Taxpayers \n     in Presidentially Declared Disaster Areas.--\n       ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary extends for any period \n     the time for filing income tax returns under section 6081 and \n     the time for paying income tax with respect to such returns \n     under section 6161 (and waives any penalties relating to the \n     failure to so file or so pay) for any taxpayer located in a \n     Presidentially declared disaster area, the Secretary shall \n     abate for such period the assessment of any interest \n     prescribed under section 6601 on such income tax.\n       ``(2) Presidentially declared disaster area.--For purposes \n     of paragraph (1), the term `Presidentially declared disaster \n     area' means, with respect to any taxpayer, any area which the \n     President has determined warrants assistance by the Federal \n     Government under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \n     Act.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to disasters declared after December 31, 1996.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will be brief on the next two \namendments. They relate to the same issues. As I indicated, the first \ndealt with the waiver of interest, which I hope we can do. It will have \nalmost insignificant consequence, but will be significant to the \ndisaster's victims.\n  The others, I have been visiting with the staff of the majority and \nthe minority and other Members.\n  One deals with the question of the use of IRAs by victims of the \ndisaster who now find themselves with a need to invest in their home to \nrepair it, but they do not have any money except that which is in an \nIRA, or the need to invest in a business that has been destroyed, and \nthey have no resources except that which is in an IRA. I hope with the \nchairman that we can find a way to provide that opportunity. I am happy \nto provide a reasonable limit on it.\n\n  I offer the amendment and hope we can visit about it in the ensuing \nhours prior to this bill's conclusion.\n  Let me offer that amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 516\n\n(Purpose: To provide tax relief for taxpayers located in Presidentially \n            declared disaster areas, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 516.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 211, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 724.

Madam President, let me ask unanimous consent that \namendment No. 516 be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 517\n\n   (Purpose: To impose a lifetime cap of $1,000,000 on capital gains \n                               reduction)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer one additional amendment this evening to be sent \nto the desk. Let me describe the amendment before I send it to the \ndesk. It is an amendment that I wrote years ago, and I have offered it \npreviously but feel that I want to offer it again on the issue of \ncapital gains. I have long felt when we provide capital gains \ndifferential treatment that we should provide a lifetime limit on the \namount of capital gains one is able to take at a preferred tax rate.\n  I have proposed in the past, and will propose with this amendment, a \n$1 million lifetime limit on capital gains tax treatment per taxpayer. \nI will describe later, and we will have an opportunity tomorrow to \ndiscuss some of these issues, but I really feel that the Congress \nshould address this with respect to capital gains.\n  Let me make one additional point. There are some--and we can have a \nphilosophical discussion about the tax situation--some that say, let us \nexempt income from investments which tend to favor those who invest. \nWhy not say, let us exempt income from work and favor those who work, \nor maybe a balance between those who work and those who invest. But I \nhave great difficulty believing that somehow investment has more merit \nthan work.\n  Let's index investment. Let's index the income from work. I want to \nhave a discussion in the context of capital gains as to why do we \nalways in Congress, when we talk about giving some break or cuts, why \ndo we always talk about taxing work and exempting investment? It is not \nthat I am opposing trying to provide encouragement to investment, but \nwhy not provide similar encouragement to work?\n  I want to have that discussion on the issue of capital gains, and I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 517.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 96, strike lines 11 through 16, and insert:\n       ``(3) Adjusted net capital gain.--For purposes of this \n     subsection--\n       ``(A) In general.--The term `adjusted net capital gain' \n     means net capital gain determined without regard to--\n       ``(A) In general.--The term `adjusted net capital gain' \n     means net capital gain determined without regard to--\n       ``(i) collectibles gain, and\n       ``(ii) unrecaptured section 1250 gain.\n       ``(B) $1,000,000 lifetime limitation.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The adjusted net capital gain for any \n     taxable year shall not exceed $1,000,000, reduced by the \n     aggregate adjusted net capital gain for all prior taxable \n     years.\n       ``(ii) Special rule for joint returns.--The amount of the \n     adjusted net capital gain taken into account under this \n     section on a joint return for any taxable year shall be \n     allocated equally between the spouses for purposes of \n     applying the limitation under clause (i) for any succeeding \n     taxable year.\n       ``(C) Capital gains rate reduction not to apply to certain \n     taxpayers.--The adjusted net capital gain for any taxable \n     year in the case of any of the following taxpayers shall be \n     zero:\n       ``(i) An individual with respect to whom a deduction under \n     section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable \n     year beginning in the calendar year in which such \n     individual's taxable year begins.\n       ``(ii) A married individual (within the meaning of section \n     7703) filing a separate return for the taxable year.\n       ``(iii) An estate or trust.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. A final comment. I wanted to offer these amendments so we \ncould begin discussing them. I hope a couple of them might be accepted \nand a couple of them we can have votes on, especially the issue of \ntriggering the tax cuts beyond the first 5 years to make certain we are \nnot once again experiencing a Federal deficit in the long term. I am \nvery interested--and I will be here to talk tomorrow--about other \nissues with respect to an alternative that I think has great merit.\n  Let me leave, as I began, to compliment the Senator from Delaware. \nThere are a number of provisions in his piece of legislation I support \nand think have great merit. I hope some of the amendments that I offer \nand others offer that will improve the bill might be accepted, as well. \nIf we can get the best of what both sides have to offer in this debate, \nthe Congress will pass a tax bill that is worthy of consideration by \nthe American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 518\n\n   (Purpose: To repeal the depletion allowance available to hardrock \n  mining companies already enjoying substantial subsidies due to the \n             largesse associated with the 1872 mining law)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 518.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . REPEAL OF DEPLETION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN HARDROCK \n                   MINES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The first sentence of section 611(a) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\n     1986, 26 U.S.C. 611(a), is amended by inserting immediately \n     after ``mines'' the following: ``(except for hardrock mines \n     located on land subject to the general mining laws or on land \n     patented under the general mining laws unless such patented \n     land was acquired (subsequent to the date the patent was \n     issued), pursuant to an arms-length transaction prior to June \n     25, 1997)''.\n       (b) Definitions.--Section 611 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by redesignating subsection (c) as \n     subsection (d) and inserting after subsection (b) the \n     following new subsection:\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of subsection (a), `general \n     mining laws' means those Acts which comprise chapters 2, 12A, \n     and 16, and sections 161 and 162 of title 30 of the United \n     States Code.''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1996.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, this is the 9th consecutive year that I \nhave tried my very best to do justice to the taxpayers of the United \nStates. I have heard an awful lot of talk in the last 60 days by people \non both sides of the aisle about the $135 billion in tax cuts for those \nlong-suffering taxpayers. I do not intend to debate the merits of the \ntax cuts tonight.\n  What I want to debate is the cynicism, the contradiction, the \nhypocrisy of talking about doing justice to the taxpayers on one hand \nby giving them a massive tax cut, and at the same time allow the \nbiggest mining companies in the world to take billions of dollars worth \nof gold off land that belongs to the taxpayers of the United States and \nnot pay one red cent for the privilege and then turn around and give \nthese same mining companies an enormous tax break which they never did \nanything to deserve.\n  In 1872, Ulysses Grant signed the famous mining law of 1872 that \nencouraged people to go West and stake 20-acre claims. The 1872 mining \nlaw is still firmly intact. There are now over 330,000 claims that have \nbeen legitimately filed that belong to people who went out and simply \ndrove 4 stakes in the ground every 20 acres and then went down to the \ncourthouse and filed their claim. In addition, there are approximately \n650 applications that have been filed with the Bureau of Land \nManagement for patents on some of those claims which would permit the \napplicants to buy the land for $2.50 or $5 an acre.\n  The people in the Senate do not pay much attention to this issue. \nThey apparently pay little attention to the people watching C-SPAN \nbecause they are the ones who are getting the shaft.\n  Madam President, can you imagine this scenario. Newmont Mining Co., \none of the biggest mining companies in the world, has a gold mine in \nNevada. They pay the owners of the land on which that gold mine is \nsituated an 18 percent gross royalty for the gold they take off that \nland. However, when they mine on public, taxpayer-owned land, they do \nnot pay one red cent to the taxpayers of this country.\n  And you wonder why the people of this country are cynical. You wonder \nwhy the words ``corporate welfare'' were used so generously around here \nwhen we were looking for offsets for this massive tax cut, and this \nbill comes back to us from the Finance Committee with not a word about \ncorporate welfare.\n  Do you know what else these mining companies do? They find somebody \nthat has a bunch of claims that they think have some potential, and \nthey buy the claims and then they mine it. Then they go to the Bureau \nof Land Management and say, ``We have commercial gold or silver on this \nland and we want to buy it, and we will give you the princely sum of \neither $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre.''\n  Do you know what Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior, has to do? \nHe has to, by law, give them a deed to that land. Here is what has \nhappened just in the past several years.\n  Barrick Gold Co. paid the U.S. taxpayers $9,000. Do you know what \nthey got for that? They got almost 2,000 acres in Nevada with 11 \nbillion dollars worth of gold on it. It belongs to the taxpayers of the \nUnited States. Do you know what the taxpayers are going to get for that \n$11 billion? Zip, zero, nothing. No royalty, no severance tax, no \nreclamation fee, and then they take a 15 percent depletion allowance on \nthe gold they take out. We not only give it to them for $2.50 an acre \nor $5 an acre, we give them a depletion allowance for mining what they \nnever paid for.\n  In 1995, Faxe Kalk, a Danish company, bought land in Idaho containing \n1 billion dollars' worth of travertine. Do you know what they paid the \ntaxpayers of the United States for this land containing the $1 billion \nin minerals? They paid $275.\n  There is an application pending at the Bureau of Land Management \nright now by the Stillwater Mining Co. for about 2,000 acres of Forest \nService land in Montana. Stillwater will pay a maximum of $10,000 for \nthat land. What do you think lies under that 2,000 acres of land? This \nis their figure, not mine: 38 billion dollars worth of palladium and \nplatinum--$38 billion. Do you know who that belongs to? It belongs to \nthe taxpayers of the United States. Do you know what the taxpayers of \nthe United States are going to get in exchange for their $38 billion? \nYou guessed it--the shaft. Nothing, not a penny. And people stand up \nand defend this thing as though it is some kind of a righteous cause.\n\n  These mining companies do not mind paying private property owners a \nroyalty. They pay the States a royalty when they mine on State lands. \nThey also pay the states a severance tax. It is only when the land \nbelongs to the taxpayers of the United States that they object.\n  When you hear people in the coffee shops in your hometown talk about \nGovernment being sold off to the highest bidder, you cannot find a \nbetter case of it. The Halls of Congress and the Senate office \nbuildings have been so full of lobbyists since I announced I was going \nto try to do away with the depletion allowance for companies mining on \npublic land, you could not stir them with a stick. I can hardly get \ndown the hall from my office because the Finance Committee office is \nbetween my office and the elevator.\n  So what I am saying, Madam President, let's at least have the courage \nto tell the taxpayers of this country that we are not going to give the \nmining companies, after we give them lands for $5 an acre, a 15 percent \ndepletion allowance to mine minerals they never paid for.\n  When the oil companies buy a lease in the ocean, when the coal \ncompanies buy a lease on lands in the West, when the natural gas \ncompanies explore for gas on Federal lands, any time they find it, they \npay a royalty for the interest in the minerals. They take a depletion \nallowance and they are entitled to a depletion allowance because, by \ndefinition, if you are depleting a capital asset, that is a legitimate \nthing to do when you paid for it in the first place. The oil and gas \ncompanies deplete oil and gas, and they have a right to do it. They \npaid a handsome price for it, and they are depleting an asset they paid \nfor. These people paid nothing.\n  What have the taxpayers gotten out of this besides not 1 red cent in \nroyalties? Well, for openers, they have gotten 557,000 abandoned mine \nsites, 57 of which are on the Superfund list. The Mineral Policy Center \nsays that the estimated cost of cleaning up the mess that these mining \ncompanies have left us is between $31 billion and $72 billion.\n  I hate to be repetitive, but just to emphasize the point, let me go \nthrough it again. The mining companies give the taxpayers $5 an acre \nfor gold. They take billions of dollars worth of gold off the land. \nThey pay the taxpayers no royalty at all, they get a 15 percent \ndepletion allowance; and then they leave an unmitigated environmental \ndisaster, which is going to cost the taxpayers of this Nation between \n$31 billion and $72 billion to clean up.\n  Madam President, I have announced that I would not seek reelection, \nand in deliberating on that decision, I got to thinking about debates, \nwhat would be debated, what would be said, who would say it, and how \nwould you respond. And I thought, how would you respond to an \naccusation that you voted for allowing the gold and silver and \npalladium and platinum mining companies to continue raping and \npillaging the taxpayers of this country--all the time you are talking \nabout a big tax cut for the taxpayers because they deserve it? And how \nare you going to pay for the tax cut? You are going to pay for the \nlion's share of it by cutting Medicare by $115 billion. You can put any \nface on it you want. I didn't vote for it. I have no intention of \nvoting for it. Take $115 billion off Medicare and that, in turn, will \ncome off of services for the elderly, part of the most vulnerable in \nour society, and then you ask\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\nyour opponent, did you vote for that? Yes, I voted for that. Well, this \n$115 billion that you cut in Medicare, what did you do with it? We gave \nit away in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America. You didn't put \nit on the deficit? No, we didn't put it on the deficit. You are going \nto balance the budget by cutting taxes? Isn't that the same old line \nyou gave us back in 1981 that gave us a $5.3 trillion debt? Then what \nif somebody said, how about those mining companies? I have heard \nSenator Bumpers, and I have read in the paper some of the things he \nsaid--for 9 years--about how the mining companies take billions of \ndollars worth of gold off of what is or was Federal lands, and they pay \nnothing for it, isn't that true? It is true. Nobody will deny it. And \nthey don't pay 1 red cent. It gives corporate welfare a bad name.\n  The Western Senators, which have gold mines in their States on \nFederal lands, ask what if you bought a mining claim from some nester \nthat staked out 500 acres, and the mining companies pay him handsomely \nfor it, aren't they entitled to a depletion? Now, that is a neat way to \navoid the issue. It also makes this point. When you buy 500-acre \nclaims, for example, from some old nester that has been sitting on them \nfor 10 years, they not only pay him a handsome price for it, they pay \nhim a royalty, or what we call residual, an override. Now, they are \nwilling to pay State's royalties, they are willing to pay private \nowner's royalties, and when they buy this land from some old nester \nthat staked it 10 or 20 years ago, they are willing to pay him a \nroyalty. It is only if the words ``U.S.'' are on it anyplace that they \ndon't want to pay a penny in royalty.\n  The questions I ask every year, and the questions that never get \nanswered, are: Why are you willing to do this to the taxpayers? Why are \nyou willing to pay a royalty of 18 percent on private lands in Nevada? \nWhy are you willing to pay an average of 5 percent on all private lands \nin the United States? Why are you willing to pay the States a severance \ntax? Why are you willing to pay the States a royalty on their lands? \nBut when it comes to lands that belong to the taxpayers of the United \nStates, you are not willing to pay 1 red cent? Everybody falls silent \nwhen you pose those questions.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Well, Mr. President, all but the freshman who just came \nin here this year have heard this debate before. A lot of people here \nhave heard this debate in spades over the years. The problem is \nidentical to what it was 9 years ago when I brought it up the first \ntime. It is the most egregious, outrageous scam being perpetrated on \nthe people of this country.\n  I have only got a year and a half left here, but I promise you, I am \ngoing to bring this up until the last day I am in the U.S. Senate. I am \nimmensely offended by it. I cannot believe my colleagues have allowed \nit to continue. We have made one or two little modest gains--very \nmodest gains. But the mining companies are fighting like saber-toothed \ntigers--they are standing in the hallways, they are in the committee \nrooms, they are all over the place--to protect the greatest sweetheart \npiece of corporate welfare in the history of mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I have listened to \nmy good friend from Arkansas embellish one of his favorite subjects, \nand that, of course, is the American mining industry as we know it \ntoday.\n  I think it is fair to say that we have had, with the minority, a \ncontinuing, ongoing effort to try and bring about changes in our mining \nlaw--meaningful changes that are supported by the industry, meaningful \nchanges that are supported by the minority. Unfortunately, we haven't \nbeen able to generate a resolve of many of these issues. But I think it \nis fair to say that the attack today proposed by my friend from \nArkansas is not just an attack on the percentage depletion allowance, \nbut, in reality, it is an attack on the American mining industry as we \nknow it today.\n  Now, I don't know about my friend from Arkansas coming over here, but \nI didn't run into anybody in the Halls. I didn't run into any \nlobbyists. Nobody has talked to me. I venture to say that if you walk \nout now, you won't run into any either.\n  What we are looking at here is a matter of equity for an industry \nthat is very important to our Nation, to our security interests, who \nmust compete in a worldwide marketplace. We are either competitive or \nwe are not.\n  For the information of my friend from Arkansas, the value, in 1995, \nof the combined contribution of the mineral industry to Arkansas was \n$744 million. So when he says ``they don't pay one red cent,'' well, \nthey contributed $744 million to the economy of Arkansas. In Alabama, \nit is $2 billion; in Arizona, it is $9 billion; in Texas, it is $7 \nbillion; in New York, it is $8.3 billion. So when you say they don't \npay anything, let's look at the working men and women in the mining \nindustry today, and let's look a little more closely at reality.\n  What is proposed by my friend from Arkansas--and he is right, it is a \npunative proposal, as he has been working at it for 9 years and he is \ncommitted until the day he leaves to work on it. I admire that spirit. \nBut he is not telling you the whole story. There was a proposal by the \nadministration earlier this year to do away with percentage depletion \nfor this industry. And the important thing, Mr. President--and I would \nlike my friend from Arkansas to acknowledge the reality of it--it was \nrejected by both the Finance Committee in the Senate and the House Ways \nand Means Committee, and it should also be rejected by the full Senate.\n  When you strip away the rhetoric--and there is lots of it around \nhere--on this matter, the issue boils down to one simple question: \nwhether this body wants to go on record now in support of a nearly $700 \nmillion tax increase on the domestic mining industry. We talk about tax \nbills, we talk about tax breaks, we talk about stimulating how much \nmore earnings the average family member can make and take home and \nsave. But this proposal by my friend from Arkansas would tax America's \nmining industry an additional $700 million--and this is a domestic \nindustry, mind you. Well, I think it is fair to say--and I think most \nof you would agree--that the Treasury will never see anywhere near $700 \nmillion from this proposal, because this latest assault on the industry \nwill simply speed up one thing--the departure of the mining industry \nfrom our shores.\n  This is a worldwide market. You compete or you don't compete. Now, \nthe continuing decline of this industry is reflected on the chart I \nhave on my left. As my colleagues can see, jobs in this industry have \nbeen declining dramatically. Let's look at it. Metals make up the gold, \nsilver, lead, and zinc production. The others are in iron ore and \ncopper. In 1980, we had 98,000 jobs; today, we have 51,000 jobs. This \nis the gold, silver, lead, and zinc. That is not to assume we are not \nusing as much gold, silver, lead, and zinc. We are. We are importing it \nfrom other countries. Why? Because we are not as competitive in the \nworld marketplace.\n  Iron ore. In 1980, we had 21,000 workers. In 1995, we had 9,000. \nWhere has the industry gone? It has gone to South America, South \nAfrica. That is the reality we live under. Now, does my friend simply \nwant to tax this industry another $700 million and drive it offshore? \nThat is what is going to happen, make no mistake about it.\n  The copper industry. In 1980, 30,000 jobs; today, 15,000 jobs in the \nUnited States It isn't that we don't have the minerals. We are not \ncompetitive in an international marketplace. My friend from Arkansas \nsimply ignores that reality. He never mentions it. It is always they \nare getting a free ride. He doesn't mention the jobs that are created \nin each State or the contribution associated with what that prosperity \nmeans to the families.\n\n  I think it is important to point these things out. These are accurate \nfigures. This is the condition of the industry today. It competes \nworldwide. The jobs, Mr. President, that have disappeared are good-\npaying jobs. Make no mistake about it, these are not the MacDonalds \nminimum-wage jobs. The average yearly wage for miners is nearly \n$46,000, one of the highest wage levels of any segment of America's \nworkers. That doesn't include the benefits provided for these workers.\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\n  What does the Senator from Arkansas propose to do with these workers \nif you tax the industry that much more? Are these people going to be \nretrained? They are going to be out of a job. They are going to be on \nwelfare. You know where these jobs are going to go. They are going to \ngo to Latin America, Canada, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Central \nAsia.\n  For example, gold mining exploration budgets have been dipping in the \nUnited States from a high of $149 million in 1992 to $120 million in \n1996. But at the same time spending in Central and South America has \nincreased more than five times--from $28 million in 1992 to $145 \nmillion last year. These are investments that could have and should \nhave been made in the United States but for the hostile environment \nthat this industry, which is a basic industry in the United States, \nfaces at home.\n  If this tax increase is approved, we will merely hasten the further \ndecline of this domestic industry, for instead of using capital to \ninvest in exploration and development in new sites in the United \nStates, the mining industry will be forced to abandon new projects at \nhome. It will have to close marginally profitable mines with the loss \nof hundreds, if not thousands of permanent good-paying jobs.\n  Mr. President, the underlying predicate of this amendment, I think, \nis fatally flawed for it assumes that mining operations on Federal \nlands are cost-free. That is what my friend from Arkansas said. He said \n``not one red cent'' did they pay for it. Nothing is further from the \ntruth. Mining operations on Federal lands are not cost-free. It is a \nmyth that patenting of land under the Mining Act of 1872 is somehow an \neasy event; that it simply is as easy perhaps as going out and writing \na check to the Federal Government. That is not reality.\n  The reality is that the exploration process leading to the discovery \nof valuable mineral deposits can cost several hundreds of thousands of \ndollars per claim just for the drilling, the sampling, and the expense \nassociated with proving up that claim.\n  I also note that in some cases mineral patent applications can \ncontain as many as 500 claims per application, and the cost of \nprocessing a single claim can run $35,000 to $40,000 to $45,000. \nMultiply that by 400 or 500 claims. What do you have? You have $19 \nmillion in costs merely for processing claims. So when the Senator from \nArkansas says they are not ``paying one red cent,'' that is not \nreality.\n  Moreover, the time required to explore land and permit it before \nmining begins has increased dramatically, with a concomitant increase \nin the cost of mining. The average time for simply permitting new \nmines, as my friend from Arkansas is well aware, on Federal land has \nincreased from 1 year to 3 to 5 years. And over the course of the last \n4 years it has averaged close to 5 years.\n  Where is it going to be in another few years? At some point in time \nyou are going to overload this. They are not going to be competitive in \nthe domestic market. Where are they going? They will go where they have \nto go to survive, and that unfortunately is outside the United States.\n  Once the companies have passed all of the hurdles, a company then \nfaces the daunting capital costs that are associated with bringing a \nmodern mine on line.\n\n  This isn't like the chicken industry. This is an industry that is \nvolatile relative to costs. Costs are not necessarily controllable in \nthe mining industry because you run into different types of production \nexposure. Some of it is very, very deep. Some of it can have water in \nthe mines. There are many, many unknowns associated with that. And the \nbiggest risk is that you develop a mine and you have no assurance that \nyour price is going to stay stable. The price fluctuates dramatically. \nBut you have made a tremendous capital investment, and you are risking \nthis capital relative to your belief that you can operate an efficient \nmine, an efficient operation, and control costs. But the unknowns are \nvery, very high.\n  In my own State, we recently opened a mine called the Fort Knox Mine \nwhich began operations outside Fairbanks. The company invested nearly \n$375 million in capital before a single ounce of gold had been mined, \nor refined, on that project.\n  So they don't pay a red cent. They put up $375 million in advance on \nthe supposition that they would be able to generate a reasonable \nreturn. Now the price of gold has dropped to a point where their \nmargins are within a couple of dollars. That is the reality associated \nwith that kind of a business.\n  I think my colleagues will agree that there is no free ride when it \ncomes to the cost of exploration, acquisition, development, and \nprocessing in the industry--whether on Federal or private land. Yet, \nthe amendment before us assumes little or no costs to the industry when \nmining on Federal land.\n  Mr. President, the rationale for the percentage depletion allowance \nis it recognizes the unique nature of resource depletion by providing a \nrealistic and practical method for the creation of funding necessary to \nreplace the diminished resource.\n  Moreover, percentage depletion reflects reality. This is a reality \nunlike in the chicken business. It is a reality that when the mines are \nexhausted, the companies must replace the depleted deposits of mineral \nresources, which are more difficult and in many cases more expensive to \ndevelop. These new deposits, because of lower grade ores, could create \nmore difficulty in mining and development. They could be more expensive \nto operate.\n  So where do you go after you deplete your mine and when the economics \nare that you can't generate a recovery? You go find a new one to stay \nin business, and hopefully it will be of the quality of the last one. \nBut you have no guarantee.\n  Hence, the justification for the percentage depletion allowance, as \nit responds to the unique nature of mineral deposits, provides for \nrealistic and practical methods of reflecting the decreasing value of a \nmine as the mine is depleted. That is what it is all about. It helps \ncompanies maintain the capital necessary to make future investments for \nreplacement of mineral resources.\n  I would also note that minerals are commodities whose prices are set, \nas I said, by the world marketplace. With an increase in mining costs \nwith the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance, what are you \ngoing to do? You can't pass it on to the purchasers in the form of \nhigher selling prices. You either absorb it and take a loss and \nultimately if your losses are too high, you go out of business.\n  Mr. President, I would also point out that mining companies commonly \npackage mining rights from a variety of sources into a single \noperation. For example, a large open-pit mining operation may include \nprivate property acquired through homestead laws, patent and mining \nclaims, unpatented claims, States lands, and so forth.\n  The repeal of percentage depletion--as proposed by my friend from \nArkansas--from those mining rights which originate with the mining law \nof 1872 would require a complex system, so complex that we would have \nto track every single shovel of ore on the mining site. In other words, \nsome of it would be from lands that originated through private \nproperty, homestead laws, unpatented claims, State lands. How do you \nsort that out? What will likely be the result is that the depletion \nallowance would apply to a shovel of ore from one location but not a \nshovel of ore from an identical ore body 10 feet away.\n\n  That is simply absurd. But that is the solution that is suggested in \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think there is no doubt that percentage depletion \nfor minerals in mines on Federal lands is clearly appropriate tax \npolicy. But I would suggest to all of my colleagues that this amendment \nis not about depletion on lands obtained under the Mining Act of 1872. \nAs I indicated in my opening statement, this amendment is about the act \nitself. This is really just another attempt to gain leverage on the \nindustry by attacking the depletion allowance.\n  Remember, Mr. President, by adopting the proposal in the amendment of \nthe Senator from Arkansas, we would be going on record as supporting \nnearly a $700 million tax increase on America's domestic mining \nindustry.\n  I can categorically state, Mr. President, that the U.S. mining \nindustry agrees, they agree with the Senator from Arkansas, that the \nmining law of 1872 is substantially due for an overhaul. And we have \npassed reforms, ultimately to see them vetoed by the\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nPresident. But I continue to work to see that this law is reformed. I \ncontinue to work with my friend from Arkansas and my colleagues on the \nother side to accomplish such a result, and we have been doing it for \nthe last several years. The industry has supported the concept of a 5-\npercent net proceeds royalty, a fair market value for land--a fair \nmarket value for land--a permanent maintenance fee, and the earmarking \nof revenues generated from mineral production on Federal lands to \ncreate and fund abandoned mines and cleanup programs.\n  These are the things that are mentioned by my friend from Arkansas. \nHe is concerned about abandoned claims and the cleanup. We provide for \nthat in our proposed legislation. The Senator from Arkansas makes quite \na point of the wide variance in royalties. What he doesn't point out is \nthat the royalty agreements on private lands are just that. They are \nagreements. Those agreements are made between two parties. The \ndetermination of what the costs are to be allocated out is something \nthat the Senator from Arkansas doesn't look into. He just simply says, \n``Well, there is a 10-percent royalty here. There is an 11-percent \nroyalty here. And the 5-percent royalty is not applicable.'' You have \nto go into what the royalty consists of. A 5-percent net proceeds \nroyalty is fair. It is one that I support. A number of my colleagues \nbasically support substantial changes in the 1872 mining law which we \nare attempting to address and hope to have before this body yet this \nyear.\n  There are a couple of other interesting things, Mr. President. The \nadministration has never sought to develop compromise legislation that \nreforms the 1872 law while offering the U.S. mining industry the \neconomic ability to develop Federal mineral assets. That is a fact. \nThis amendment, as with the administration's identical budget proposal, \nis clearly designed to bring the industry to its knees by putting a \n$700 million tax on the industry. Remember, as we reflect on the \nmerits, that this matter has been studied and gone into in great detail \nby both the House and the Senate--the Senate Finance Committee and the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee. Both have said, no, this increased tax \non the mining industry of $700 million is not justifiable.\n  So it is acknowledged we want to overhaul the 1872 mining law, but \nthat is not what we are debating today.\n  What we are debating today in this amendment is an amendment that \nwould simply kill the domestic mining industry in this country, make no \nmistake about it. As you look at the merits of an adequate royalty, it \nhas to be based on consideration of comparisons that are real. Just \nwhat is the negotiated in and out of a higher royalty figure does not \nnecessarily represent the return to the Government agency. This is \nmodeled exactly after the royalty program that is currently operating \nin one of the most prosperous States for mining, and that is the State \nof Nevada.\n  My colleagues from Nevada I see are on the floor. I am sure that they \nwill point that out.\n  So, in conclusion, let us recognize where we are on this. This is a \n$700 million tax proposal on our mining industry, our domestic \nindustry.\n  One final point I would like to bring up is the matter of \ngermaneness. This amendment is not germane. This amendment does not \nbelong on this bill. At the appropriate time a point of order will be \nmade. I urge my colleagues not to support a waiver of the point of \norder.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I say to the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nlist of staff members of the Joint Committee on Taxation be granted \nfull floor access for the duration of S. 949 and that the list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  It should be noted that these staff members will not be in the \nChamber all at the same time but will rotate on and off as needed. \nThere is a long list, and I will just submit it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n                      Joint Committee on Taxation\n\n       Steven Arwin.\n       Tom Barthold.\n       Ben Hartley.\n       Harold Hirsch.\n       Ken Kies.\n       Kent Killelea.\n       Roberta Mann.\n       Laurie Mathews.\n       Alysa McDaniel.\n       Joe Mikrut.\n       John Navaratil.\n       Joe Nega.\n       Judy Owens.\n       Cecily Rock.\n       Bernard Schmitt.\n       Mary Schmitt.\n       Carolyn Smith.\n       Maxine Terry.\n       Mel Thomas.\n       Barry Wold.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if we might possibly get a time \nagreement here. I have talked to the chief opponents of my amendment. \nWe have two Senators from Nevada here, and as I understand it there are \na couple more besides Senator Craig of Idaho, and Senator Murkowski has \njust finished his statement. I was just wondering--we have an hour \neach, but I was just wondering if we could, since this is in the \nevening if they could--I don't know of anybody else on my side. Senator \nGregg is my chief cosponsor, and he is not going to be here this \nevening. I wonder if we could allow people to come in and speak as long \nas they want to tonight with the understanding we will have 20 minutes \nequally divided in the morning on the vote.\n  How does that sound?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think we have a number of Senators on our side we \nwant to accommodate so why not let them speak as long as they want.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let them speak as long as they want with the \nunderstanding we will have a 20-minute time agreement equally divided \ntomorrow morning. I make that request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have an amendment which I would like to offer this \nevening. I want to accommodate the Members who wish to speak on this \nissue, but I would like to have some understanding we would have an \nopportunity. I would need 15 or 20 minutes to offer my amendment this \nevening.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator from Nevada would like probably 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BRYAN. At most, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No more than 10 minutes. That could conclude at least for \nthis evening debate on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. We will visit during Senator Bryan's statement and we may \nbe able to cut that down a little bit and decide what procedure we are \ngoing to follow.\n  During the time Senator Bryan is speaking, we will get together and \ntry to accommodate the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record an article from the Wall Street Journal \ncalled ``Gold Mining Firms Act to Meet Price-Slump Challenge,'' which I \nthink makes my point to the increasing of difficulty in meeting \nproduction costs with the declining price of minerals in the world \nmarketplace today.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nGold-Mining Firms Act To Meet Price-Slump Challenge--They Reduce Costs, \n            Scratch New Mines, With No Quick Relief in Sight\n\n                  (By Mark Heinzl and Aaron Lucchetti)\n\n       Gold companies are hunkering down, struggling to weather \n     one of the most prolonged slumps in gold prices in years.\n       Mining companies are slashing costs and tearing up plans \n     for new mines as the price of the precious metal continues to \n     slide to three-year lows. Just since November the price of \n     gold futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange's \n     Comex division has plunged to $353.40 an ounce from above \n     $380. The skidding price is enough to turn many high-cost \n     mines into money-losing duds and spoils the economics of many \n     planned projects.\n       ``No question, if prices stay at this range, you will see \n     fewer new gold mines,'' says\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\n     Dennis Wheeler, chairman and chief executive officer of Coeur \n     D'Alene Mines Corp. in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.\n       Many analysts believe gold prices will linger at current \n     levels or lower for several months. Gold prices have been \n     pushed downward by slumping investment demand and the fear of \n     increasing supplies from central banks. In Europe, central \n     banks have been pressured to sell their gold reserves in an \n     effort to meet debt requirements for European monetary union \n     in 1999.\n\n\n                         Outlook for Investment\n\n       Unless the stock market experiences a hefty correction or \n     inflation rears its head, gold investment demand probably \n     will remain low as investors turn to financial investments \n     with higher returns.\n       ``It would take a very substantial market correction of \n     about 15% to turn things around for gold,'' says William \n     O'Neill, chief futures strategist for Merrill Lynch & Co. The \n     price could bottom out at between $330 and $350 an ounce, \n     before turning slightly upward, analysts say. The decline in \n     the mineral's price has sent investors in gold-mining stocks \n     running for cover. The Toronto Stock Exchange's gold-stock \n     index has dropped 8.5% since mid-November. Last year \n     investors were focused on gold companies with potential \n     discoveries of new deposits; this year ``we will see the \n     market start to reward companies that have cash flow, \n     production and reserve value,'' says Victor Flores, a gold-\n     fund manager with United Services Advisers Inc., a San \n     Antonio mutual fund company.\n\n\n                         Write-Down on Project\n\n       An early casualty of gold's weakness is the Casa Berardi \n     mine in Quebec. One of its owners, Toronto-based TVX Gold \n     Inc., recently announced plans to shutter the mine, which \n     eats up more than $350 an ounce in cash operating costs. The \n     company said it will take an undetermined write-down on the \n     project.\n       At five of the 22 largest U.S. mines, cash costs to produce \n     gold are at or above $347.30 an ounce, the 39-month low that \n     gold touched last week. At current prices ``most mines are \n     keeping their head above water, but the others will have to \n     take cost-cutting measures, from stopping low-grade \n     production to shutting the mine down,'' says John L. Dobra, \n     an economist at the University of Nevada-Reno.\n\n\n                      ``challenging times'' ahead\n\n       About 10%-15% of the world's gold mining could be postponed \n     if prices stay at current levels for a sustained period, says \n     Jeffrey M. Christian, managing director of CPM Group, an \n     industry consultant. World-wide, gold is produced at an \n     average cash cost of $257 an ounce, says Gold Fields Mineral \n     Services Ltd., a London industry research consultant. \n     However, the total cost including capital expenditures comes \n     to $315 an ounce, only about $40 an ounce lower than the \n     current commodity price.\n       ``Every company is looking very carefully'' at cutting \n     costs, says Leanne Baker, gold analyst for Salomon Brothers \n     Inc. Companies are expected to reduce spending in \n     exploration, administration and low-grade gold mining, which \n     has a higher cost of production, analysts say.\n       Coeur D'Alene Mines has recently laid off 4% of its staff, \n     halted all charitable donations and sold the company jet in \n     an effort to make up lost profits. ``We anticipate more \n     challenging times ahead,'' says Mr. Wheeler, its chief \n     executive.\n       Pegasus Gold Inc., a Spokane, Wash., gold concern that \n     mines about 570,000 ounces a year, has also taken steps to \n     survive in the new lower price range. The company recently \n     announced it would reduce its exploration budget by about \n     20%, freeze senior-management salaries and delay construction \n     on new gold projects in Montana and Chile until 1998.\n       ``We looked at the current gold market and our cost \n     structure, and we just needed to reduce spending,'' says John \n     Pearson, director of investor relations for Pegasus. Mr. \n     Pearson says the construction delay will shift about $100 \n     million in capital spending to 1998, when the company will \n     reassess the market. ``Right now, the whole gold market is a \n     negative environment; investor sentiment is weak,'' he says.\n       Lower gold prices have also hurt Echo Bay Mines Ltd., a \n     Denver company struggling to increase its gold reserves and \n     production. The company recently took a charge of $77 million \n     after ripping up plans to develop its big Alaska gold \n     project, Alaska-Juneau, and also canceled common-share \n     dividend payments to conserve cash after a string of \n     quarterly losses. Gold's recent nose-dive ``made the \n     economics that much more difficult'' for the project, says \n     Echo Bay's chief financial officer, Peter Cheesbrough.\n       While marginal projects and mines fall by the wayside, the \n     price slide is also heating up the competition between mining \n     companies for exceptional, higher-grade gold projects. Lower \n     prices are expected to heighten the gold industry's \n     consolidation. ``We'll continue to see merger mania,'' \n     predicts CPM Group's Mr. Christian.\n       Placer Dome Inc., a Vancouver, British Columbia, gold \n     miner, is offering $4.5 billion in stock in a battle against \n     Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. The price: Bre-X Minerals \n     Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta, and its Indonesian Busang gold \n     deposit. Bre-X says Busang could produce as much as four \n     million ounces of gold a year at cash operating costs below \n     $100 an ounce, compared with Placer Dome's cash costs of \n     about $240 an ounce.\n       With Busang, Placer Dome could ``rid themselves of their \n     higher-cost, more risky mines,'' says Marc Cohen, a gold \n     mining analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Indeed, if Placer Dome \n     gets the Indonesian mine, the company says smaller projects \n     in Mexico, Costa Rica or Australia could be shelved, \n     especially if prices stay weak.\n       The deals have been getting bigger. Homestake Mining Co., \n     San Francisco, and Newmount Mining Corp., Denver, both \n     recently offered more than $2 billion in stock to acquire \n     Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp., which analysts say has a solid \n     production and exploration profile.\n       Meanwhile, low gold prices are hurting most companies' \n     results, especially relatively unhedged producers such as \n     Echo Bay and Homestake, analysts say. Hedging involves using \n     derivatives such as options and futures to lock in future \n     revenue from gold.\n       Some companies were blind-sided by gold's fall. Montreal-\n     based Cambior Inc. dropped its overall hedge position in 1996 \n     to roughly one year's worth of production from the company's \n     more traditional level of two years, says Henry Roy, \n     Cambior's chief financial officer. Cambior's remaining hedge \n     position leaves about 50% of the 500,000 ounces in annual \n     output hedged at nearly $440 an ounce.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  The Senator from Alaska is yielding to the Senator from Nevada such \ntime as he might consume?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would be willing to informally agree that \ntomorrow there be 20 minutes equally divided prior to a vote.\n  Mr. REID. On this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. On this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The distinguished floor manager is just suggesting to \nproceed as we were with the understanding there be 20 minutes equally \ndivided tomorrow morning on this amendment.\n  That is essentially my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I would rather that Senator \nBryan proceed. That would give us an opportunity to speak and take \nabout 10 minutes and then we would be happy to consider the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator repeat that?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bryan is going to speak for approximately 10 \nminutes. During that time, we have some procedural things we would like \nto discuss before we enter into a unanimous-consent agreement, because \nit may not be this amendment we will be debating. It may be a second \ndegree.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I understand you may offer a second-degree amendment \nthis evening, and I certainly have no objection to that. I need to be \ngone from here for about an hour, and that is one of the reasons, I do \nnot mind telling you, I am trying to get an agreement here so I will \nfeel free to leave the floor for an hour. Perhaps we ought to just keep \ngoing here.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend from Arkansas, we will be real \nquick, and as soon as Senator Bryan finishes we will work something out \nwith the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the distinguished Senator from Alaska yield the \nSenator from Nevada 10 minutes? I believe I can do it in a shorter \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We are not keeping time, I would advise my friend from \nNevada. So I have yielded the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, and I very \nmuch appreciate his statement, which I think effectively deals with the \namendment that our friend from Arkansas has offered.\n  Let me preface my comments while the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas is in the Chamber that he noted that at the end of this \nCongress he will not be a candidate for reelection and this will \nrepresent his last Congress as a Member of this body. I must say that I \nregret the decision of the Senator from Arkansas. He has a \ndistinguished record of public service in his own State as Governor and \nas a Member of this body. I have been pleased to share common cause \nwith him on many, many issues which I believe in his public policy \npronouncements are correct for the country, and he, indeed, has been a \nvisionary in some of the things he wishes to do.\n  I do not quarrel for one moment with his sincerity. I know the depth \nof his conviction and I know them to be deeply entertained. I believe, \nhowever, that\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nthe Senator's zeal for this issue has obscured some of the facts that I \nthink important for us to understand before we follow the course of \naction that he would suggest to us.\n  First, I want to point out the importance of this industry to my own \nState and to correct what is oftentimes, because of an oversimplified \npresentation, an impression that is given that the industry pays no \ntaxes. We hear this continuously in the course of the debate on the \nmining law of 1872.\n  According to the National Mining Association, the industry, coal and \nhard rock, paid more than $600 million in Federal taxes in 1995. The \nGeneral Accounting Office issued a report recently --this is not a \npublication that emanates from the mining industry but a General \nAccounting Office report--that indicates the average tax rate for the \nmining industry from 1987 to 1992 was 35 percent. Now, that is compared \nwith 23 percent for the automobile industry, 19 percent for the \nchemical industry, and 33 percent for the transportation industry. In \nNevada alone, the gold mining industry paid more than $141 million in \nState and local taxes in 1995, including $32.7 million in property \ntaxes.\n  So let no one who is listening to this argument be misled that the \nindustry pays no taxes, that it is given a free ride. That simply is \nnot true. The industry pays a substantial amount of taxes at the \nFederal level, at the State level, and at the local level.\n  This issue really is not about the depletion allowance. This is \nreally the stalking horse for an issue which we have been debating for \nsome years, and that is the mining law of 1872. There is no \ndisagreement among Members that the mining law of 1872 needs to be \nupdated and modernized. The industry recognizes that and is in \nagreement, and my colleague from Arkansas recognizes that. And there \nis, indeed, fundamental agreement on the general areas that need to be \nupdated.\n\n  Let me just refresh my colleagues' memories and identify the issues. \nThe industry acknowledges that a royalty needs to be paid, and they are \nprepared to pay a 5 percent net proceeds royalty.\n  Now, there is a difference as to how much the industry should pay, \nbut there is a recognition on behalf of the industry that a net \nproceeds royalty tax is appropriate and the industry is prepared to pay \nthat.\n  Second, there is a recognition that the mining law of 1872 needs to \nbe changed, and those who gain access pursuant to the law of 1872 need \nto pay a fair market value for the surface estate, in addition to the \nroyalty which I have just indicated. That is a second area of \nagreement, the fair market value.\n  Third, there is a fundamental recognition, if entry is gained as it \nis under the mining law of 1872 and there is no longer utilization of \nthe land for that purpose, of the possibility of revert, allowing the \nSecretary of the Interior to revoke the authority and to reenter the \nlands at his discretion.\n  There is a recognition of the need to pay a permanent maintenance fee \nfor every claim that is held on Federal lands, and that fee needs to be \nmade permanent; that an abandoned mines land fund should be \nestablished, and that as part of that a reclamation requirement be \nimposed as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6332-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     VISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF THE COLOMBIA NATIONAL SENATE\n\n  Mr. BRYAN.

The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 518\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as I have indicated, there is broad \nagreement within the industry that the mining law of 1872 needs to be \nupdated. There is agreement in those areas that have been identified \nas: 5 percent net proceeds royalty; the fair market value of the \nsurface estate; that a reverter provision be provided so that in the \nevent the property is no longer used for mining purposes, the Secretary \nof the Interior would have the right to reclaim the land for public \npurposes; that there be a reclamation requirement and a permanent \nmaintenance fee as part of that reclamation. So, there is a broad \nagreement that the mining law of 1872 needs to be reformed.\n  In the context of this debate, the issue is not whether the mining \nlaw of 1872 should remain inviolate, unchanged and sacrosanct, it is a \nquestion of how it needs to be updated to reflect the realities of the \nlatter part of the 20th century. In that respect, the mining industry \nhas been engaged in a dialog, now, for the better part of the last \ndecade. There is obviously disagreement as to the specifics. I am \nhopeful, before my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from \nArkansas, retires from this body, that we can indeed have an agreement \non these issues and produce a piece of legislation that all of us can \nembrace.\n  Let me speak specifically to the provisions that are contained in the \nproposal of the Senator from Arkansas. He would, in effect, repeal the \npercentage depletion allowance as it has existed in the code, in one \nform or another, since 1913. A percentage depletion allowance is not, \nas the senior Senator from Arkansas suggests, a giveaway to the mining \nindustry. Rather, it is a longstanding tax policy that recognizes the \nunique nature of the mining industry.\n  Congress has long recognized that the principal capital asset of a \nmineral producer is its mineral reserves, the ore body itself. These \nmineral reserves are classified as wasting assets. As the minerals are \nproduced or sold, the mineral deposit from which they are taken is \ngradually exhausted. Indeed, that is the history of every mining \nexploration in the history of my own State. These ore bodies are not \ninexhaustible; they last for a finite period of time, and the tax law \nreflects the reality of those circumstances.\n  That was first recognized in 1913, when the Congress allowed a \nportion of the value of these assets or reserves to be deducted from \ntaxable income to allow producers to replace that ore body, their \nwasting asset. So depletion is similar to the depreciation allowance \nfor the use of physical properties. It is an allowance that allows an \ninvestor in natural resources to recover his capital outlay in the \nmineral through a depletion allowance to producers to simply level the \nplaying field between those classes of taxpayers. So, although it is \nunique, its underlying premise, its principle is the same: to recognize \nthat the asset is not inexhaustible, that it has a finite lifespan, and \nthe Tax Code reflects that circumstance.\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\n  The capital investment necessary for modern mining is astronomical. \nIt is not unusual to anticipate capital expenditures that will exceed \n$1 billion when opening a new mine. So the notion that somehow this \nland is turned over and immediately the next day the entrant is able to \nextract a large body of ore and make fantastic profits with no outlay, \neither in terms of ultimate tax liability or expenditures, simply is \ndivorced from reality. Many explorations prove unsuccessful; that is, \nthe quality of the reserves are simply unsustainable in terms of their \neconomic feasibility. And that is a reality.\n  Many claims turn out to be unsuccessful because the mineral is not \nidentified and cannot be located for purposes other than exploration. \nSo the risks here in a mining operation are enormous. The Bumpers \namendment would repeal the percentage depletion allowance for only \nthose minerals obtained from land granted under the 1872 mining law. I \nthink therein lies the true nature of the Bumpers amendment. This has \nlittle or nothing to do with tax reform. It seeks to punish the mining \nindustry because Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on \nreforming the mining law of 1872. And that is patently unfair.\n  We recognize that reform needs to occur. The dialog continues. As I \nhave indicated, I am hopeful that in this Congress it will be possible \nfor us to achieve an agreement with respect to that reform.\n  Moreover, as the Senator from Alaska pointed out earlier, this \nindustry is part, as other parts of our economy are, of a global \ncompetition. For us to remain competitive in America it will be very \nimportant for us not to impose a tax system that is viewed as so \npunitive as to discourage mineral exploration in its entirety.\n  I speak with some personal knowledge of the situation because, in my \nown State, we have gone through a series of mining booms. The origin of \nNevada's history--born, as it was, during the Civil War--is a result of \nthe first great mineral discovery in our State, the Comstock Lode, in \n1859. That discovery, which brought thousands of people into what is \nnow Nevada, laid the predicate for Nevada's admission to statehood. The \nmining industry was such an important part of the early economy in \nNevada that the first attempt at statehood failed because of the way \nthe State Constitution, as then proposed, contemplated the imposition \nof the tax on mining. So our heritage is linked to this industry, and \nthe taxable implications are something that all of us in Nevada are \nvery mindful of.\n\n  That mining boom lasted for a period of roughly 25 years. By the end \nof the century, the ore bodies having been depleted in the Comstock \nLode, Nevada's mining industry was in a pronounced state of recession. \nIt was resurrected ever so briefly during the period of World War I, \nand then declined at the end of that war. The modern period really \nbegan about 10 or 15 years ago, with the technology that makes it \npossible to recover microscopic particles of gold, so small, so minute \nthat they are undetected by the human eye.\n  So this is an industry which has had a series of cyclical ups and \ndowns. The suggestion of recklessly imposing this new tax structure is \nsomething that apprehends great fear for all of us in Nevada because of \nthe sensitive nature of the industry and its transitory nature, based \nupon market circumstances as well as the ability to continue to locate \nnew bodies of ore.\n  For Nevada and for America, it has been a good industry. It employs \nabout 120,000 people in America. In my own State, it employs 15,000. \nAnd, as has been pointed out by the Senator from Alaska, if one looks \nat the pay scale of major industries in America, the average salary in \nmining is close to $46,000 a year, and in the context of the debate \nthat we had earlier today about Medicare and Medicaid, and coverage of \nhospital and physician services, most mining companies provide a full \nrange of insurance coverage for their employees and their dependents. \nSo they have been good citizens with us in Nevada. And they have \ncontributed immeasurably to the prosperity that we enjoy in Nevada.\n  In point of fact, Nevada produces more in the way of gold than any \nother State in the country. Indeed, if we were a separate country, we \nwould rank internationally somewhere among fourth, fifth and sixth in \nterms of production worldwide. So this is a major industry with \nenormous significance to my State, that pays good money to good people. \nWe are not going to allow that industry to be devastated by an \nimprovident, zealous attack on the industry and the failure to properly \nconsider what the impact of this would be.\n  Let me, by way of a concluding comment, indicate what kind of an \nadministrative nightmare this provision would be. As I indicated a \nmoment ago, this change would apply only with respect to those minerals \nthat are recovered under public lands, under lands which were entered \npursuant to the provision of the mining law of 1872. That suggests that \na mining operation is finitely defined and that an operation that \nderives its origin from entry under the mining law of 1872 is a \nseparate and distinct and discrete operation from that part of the \noperation in which the mining company may have acquired title to the \nproperty through private sale.\n  Indeed, if you look at the mining operations that currently exist in \nmy own State, and if you look at the source of title or occupancy of \nthose lands, you will find as many as five or six different derivative \nsources for the occupation and/or title or patent to those claims. So \nit would be an administrative nightmare in allocating this new system \nof taxation to a single operator on a single mine who is mining bodies \nof ore through different areas within a fairly confined area of a few \nof those acres. So it is totally impractical.\n  I hope my colleagues recognize that this is not the sort of thing we \nshould do without giving due deliberation to the broader issue which \nwill be discussed during this Congress and I hope will be resolved, and \nthat is to deal with the update of the mining law of 1872. That is what \nthis debate ought to be about, rather than a punitive approach which is \ntaken in the proposed Bumpers amendment.\n  I hope, at the appropriate time, my colleagues will join us in \nrejecting this proposal and allow us to continue the debate with \nrespect to reform during the course of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from Idaho yield for a minute?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bumpers is off the floor, but he asked if I would \npropound a unanimous consent request on his behalf. First of all, I \nsuggest that the unanimous consent request will be that at the time \ndebate is completed in the morning, a point of order will be raised \nagainst this amendment on the basis of germaneness.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Nevada withhold for a moment? Staff \nhas, I believe, comprised that unanimous consent request and will \nprovide it to you.\n  Mr. REID. The one thing I ask, because he has been so patient here, \nis that the Senator from Illinois--he has been waiting here for several \nhours while we worked our situation out --would it be appropriate that \nhe be allowed, as part of the unanimous consent request, to offer the \nnext amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. We have to check with the floor managers.\n  Mr. President, while that is going on, let me reclaim my time and \ndiscuss the Bumpers amendment for a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Alaska and the two \nSenators from Nevada in our commitment and belief that the 1872 mining \nlaw deserves to be reformed. These four Senators have worked for the \nlast 4 to 5 years to bring responsible and sensitive reform to this \nold, but very important, law, a law that has served our country well on \npublic lands that allows an individual to go forth to explore, to \ndiscover and to develop the mineral wealth of our country.\n  It is also important to recognize that this is a public resource, and \nthere needs to be an appropriate balancing act in the effective \nutilization of a public resource and a return to the taxpayer of the \nvalue of that resource.\n  Because the 1872 mining law was really intended at a very early time \nin our\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\ncountry's history to be a development law that allowed growth and \ndevelopment primarily in the public lands of Western States, I, a \nWestern Senator, along with the Senator from Alaska and the two \nSenators from Nevada as Western Senators, saw a need, along with a good \nmany others of our colleagues, to provide good reform to this old law \nto allow the mining industry to go forth, to assure there would be a \nright to discover, a right to develop, but to do all of that in the \ncontext of sound environmental policy and, for the first time, to \npropose a royalty on hard-rock mining; also, to recognize that there \nwas a surface value that is no longer there and an absolute sense of a \nneed to develop western lands. So, therefore, there ought to be a \nmarket value placed on the surface rights that one gained as they \ngained title through the patenting process which allowed that public \nresource to go to private utilization.\n  But for 4 years, this administration has literally refused us the \nright to do that. This Senate passed mining law reform. It was in the \nbudget reconciliation 2 years ago, and the President vetoed it. So for \nthe Senator from Arkansas to stand on the floor this evening and say \nthere has been no meaningful mining law reform isn't quite true. There \nhas been a very aggressive effort on the part of this Senator; the \nSenator from Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee; the Senator from Louisiana, now retired, Senator Johnston, \nwho was the chairman of that committee; and, of course, the Senators \nfrom Nevada who understand the importance of mining, as I do, because \nit is a critical part of their economic base and the resource \ndevelopment in their State.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has another vision of mining. It is called \nno-mining. For some reason, he believes that this is a source of wealth \nto the Treasury of this country, and when he sees millions of dollars \ninvested, somehow he immediately equates that as millions of dollars \nreturned to the Treasury, when the fact is that while money can be \nreturned to the Treasury, it takes an average of $400 million to \ndevelop an operating mine today, to make sure it is in compliance with \nthe Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, to make sure it meets the \nNEPA requirements, to make sure it is operated in a sound environmental \nway, while returning a profit to the company and to the investors that \nput up the nearly $400 million for that development.\n  Unlike other kinds of resources, minerals are not sold in Little Rock \nat a Little Rock value or Boise, ID, at a Boise value. They are sold in \nLittle Rock or in Boise based on a world value, a world market, because \ngold and silver and iron, zinc and lead, and all of those kinds of \nthings that make up the fundamental base of the industrial society that \nwe enjoy are traded in a world environment.\n\n  When that price slips, so it slips at the mine. A mine that one year \ncan be very profitable, the next year can be very unprofitable and can \nlose money. That has been and is the history of mining in our country. \nYou talk about striking it rich, that happens in mining, but I also \nknow a lot of miners who struck it poor.\n  A mining company in our State just a year ago called me and said they \nwanted me to know that they were shutting down a major mining operation \nin one of the counties in the State of Idaho. Why? After they had \ninvested millions of dollars, their exploration didn't pan out to be \nquite what they thought it ought to be. Their drilling didn't determine \nthe projections of the ore body that existed. So they were shutting it \ndown and walking away and writing off millions and millions of dollars \nof cost in the development of a mill and a plant and a site and all of \nthose necessary tools to bring that mineral out of the ground to the \nsmelter in a refined way.\n  I say nothing new on the floor of the Senate tonight. I only bring \ncurrent the 200-plus-year history of the mining industry of our Nation.\n  But reform is necessary, and this Senator, along with the Senator \nfrom Alaska--the two Senators from Nevada have just authored a new \nmining law reform approach. We sat down with the Senator from Arkansas \nand his staff to try to see if we could not build a bipartisan \ncompromise. That hasn't happened yet, and we want that to happen. We \nbelieve in the reform.\n  But what the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas proposes tonight \nis not constructive. It doesn't add to the overall effort to build \nstrong mining law for this country that allows continued development in \nan environmentally sound way, to build the resource and the wealth base \nof our Nation and to assure a domestic supply of minerals and metals.\n  It does quite the opposite. It goes directly at mining industries in \nthis country, and it could very well render them marginal and, in some \ninstances, less than profitable. When that happens, the mining industry \ndoesn't stay around. It very quickly closes its doors and the average \njob of $46,000 a year goes wanting, and that mining industry goes to \nPeru or to Chile or to Colombia or to Ecuador or to Mexico to build the \nwealth base of those countries and to deny us the $100 billion industry \nthat we have here.\n  I don't think that makes good sense. I never have. And I can't \nunderstand the thinking of the Senator from Arkansas in that regard, \nother than he just appears to have it out for the mining industry.\n  In my State, it is an important industry. Nationwide, it is tens of \nthousands of very high-paying jobs, and there is no question that this \nindustry contributes a great deal to our country and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to the economy on an annualized basis.\n  The mining industry already pays taxes. Somehow, because they are \nable to patent public resources and then develop them, the Senator from \nArkansas suggests they pay nothing, they ``get a free ride.'' That one \nexample on the bottom line of the chart of the Senator from Arkansas is \nan Idaho-based operation. There may be a billion dollar's worth of \nreserves in the ground, but that operation isn't operating today. They \nare not functioning, and the reason they are not is that they are not \ncurrent in the economy of the marketplace. They may have invested \nmillions of dollars, and they may have paid the Federal Government \nthrough the process of the $2.50 an acre surface value in the patenting \nprocess, but they are not returning any money today, and their mine \nsits idle. That is not unusual. That is the way the mining industry \nworks. That is the way it has always worked. My guess is it won't \nchange.\n  The mining industry already pays an average in Federal taxes at 32 \npercent, according to the General Accounting Office. Because of the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax, they currently pay a very high rate. \nBut the Senator from Arkansas says, ``Whoop, that's not good enough, \nstick them again 8 to 10 percent.'' So we get them up to 42 percent. \nWhy do you want to pay 42 percent on your income flow if you can move \nacross the border and pay less? That is exactly what has happened. The \nSenator from Alaska and the Senators from Nevada spoke very clearly \nabout that in their past statements. The exodus out of this country of \nthe mining industry and the jobs and the expertise and the engineering \nthat flows with it is a tragedy to which we shouldn't contribute.\n  So I hope that Senators will recognize that we shouldn't be \nlegislating more in relation to this tax bill that we have before us. \nThis comes outside of the agreement. We have worked very hard, and, I \nmust say, the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Finance \nCommittee have done what I think is an excellent job in working to stay \ninside an agreement that the leadership of the Senate and the House and \nthe President struck as it related to revenue and tax relief.\n  Tax relief ought to be creating jobs, it ought to be promoting \neconomic development, it ought to be growing our economy instead of \nshrinking it, instead of destroying thousands of jobs that I believe \nthis kind of legislation and the Bumpers amendment would accomplish.\n  I have before me a chart that talks about the combined direct and \nindirect contribution of the metals mining industry to the economy of \nthe individual States of this Nation. I could go through that, but here \nis the bottom line, Mr. President.\n  The bottom line is $134,378,000,000 a year. Is that in the pocket of \nsome mining executive? Absolutely not. It is in the work force of \nCaterpillar equipment in Illinois. It is spread across the country in \nthe supplies and the direct and indirect services that provide for\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nthe mining industry. It is in the chemical industry of Delaware.\n  I am amazed, but I look down here and see that in Connecticut alone \nis $1,792,000,000--Connecticut--directly attributable to the mining \nindustry of the country. I did not know there was a mine in \nConnecticut. Well, there probably is not, but there are major corporate \nheadquarters and there are suppliers, and those suppliers create jobs.\n  Of course, when you have a broad-based industry like metals and \nmining, all States benefit. Literally every State in the Nation has \nnearly $100 million or more in value of directly associated or related \njobs to the metal and the mineral industry of our country.\n  That is why we should not be stepping forward in some form to destroy \nit. We ought to be promoting it. Most importantly, the Senator from \nArkansas ought to be working with the Senators from Nevada and from \nIdaho and from Alaska to get reform that we all want so that the mining \nindustry of the country can know the ground on which it operates and \nthe law to which it must comply. That is what we ought to be about.\n  So I hope that tomorrow when we vote on the Bumpers amendment, we can \nvote it down, recognizing that when we deal with reform in the mining \nindustry, let us deal with it in a comprehensive way in the appropriate \nauthorizing committee with the hearings that are necessary to make sure \nthat what we do fits so that we do not wound an industry that has \nprovided for us well and that continues to employ tens of thousands of \npeople across our country and provide well over $100 billion annually \nto the wealth base of this country. That is the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask through the Chair to the manager of the bill, is the \nunanimous-consent request now ready to be propounded?\n  Mr. ROTH. No. We are still waiting for clearance on the Democratic \nside.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the chairman of the Energy and Water \nCommittee entered into the Record this evening a news article that was \nprinted earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal. The news article \nsays a great deal about the debate that is taking place here tonight.\n  We can talk about all the jobs that mining produces--and there are \nover 100,000 of them in the United States alone--we can talk about all \nthe direct and indirect income that it generates for States, but the \nmost important thing that I think brings this in proper perspective is \nto look at what is happening to mining today.\n  ``Gold-Mining Firms Act to Meet Price-Slump Challenge.''\n  The price of gold has dropped precipitously. The price of gold is \nlow. As indicated in this article, ``[Mining Companies] Reduce Costs, \nScratch New Mines, With No Quick Relief in Sight.''\n  The article says, among other things:\n\n       Mining companies are slashing costs and tearing up plans \n     for new mines as the price of the precious metal continues to \n     slide to three-year lows. . .[the prices] plunged to $353.40 \n     an ounce . . . The skidding price is enough to turn many \n     high-cost mines into money-losing duds and spoils the \n     economics of many planned projects.\n\n  Dennis Wheeler, chairman and chief executive officer of Coeur D'Alene \nMines, which is headquartered in Coeur D'Alene, ID, says, ``No \nquestion, * * * you will see fewer new gold mines.''\n  This is a quote from this article.\n\n       Gold prices have been pushed downward by slumping \n     investment demand and the fear of increasing supplies from \n     central banks.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       At [least] five of the 22 largest U.S. mines, cash costs to \n     produce gold are at or above $347.30 an ounce. . .\n\n  What this means, Mr. President, is that the cost of gold is not \nenough to meet the costs of producing the gold. That is why in Nevada \nyou have seen companies laying off people. That is why you have seen \nmines going out of business. At this stage they have been the small \noperations, but the big ones are going to come unless something happens \nto raise the price of gold or to cut costs, or both.\n\n       Coeur D'Alene Mines has recently laid off 4% of its staff, \n     halted all charitable donations, and [as Mr. Wheeler said] . \n     . . ``We anticipate more challenging times ahead.''\n\n  And that, Mr. President, is an understatement.\n  Pegasus Gold is a substantial company based in Spokane, WA. They have \noperations in the State of Nevada. They mine over half a million ounces \nof gold a year. But they have taken steps to survive in the new lower \nprice range, or trying to survive.\n\n       The company recently announced it would reduce its \n     exploration budget by about 20%, freeze senior-management \n     salaries and delay construction on new gold projects in \n     Montana . . .\n\n  Echo Bay Mines, a Denver-based company has operations in the State of \nNevada, among other places. Lower gold prices have also hurt Echo Bay, \ncausing its gold reserves to go down.\n\n       The company recently took a charge of $77 million after \n     ripping up plans to develop its big Alaska gold project [in] \n     Alaska-Juneau . . .\n\n  Now, I say, Mr. President, this is only a little example. So $77 \nmillion they spent before they turned a single spade of dirt.\n  A little operation outside the town of Searchlight, NV, where I was \nborn, still maintain my residence--that operation took about $100 \nmillion before they could do any mining. It is a relatively small \noperation.\n  Echo Bay:\n\n       . . . also canceled common-share dividend payments to \n     conserve cash after a string of quarterly losses.\n\n  Many, many gold companies are suffering the same fate as the few of \nthese that I have referred to out of this article.\n  Gold mining companies are having real difficulty. As has been \nindicated already on the floor, the General Accounting Office has \nindicated that gold companies now--the mining industry now--is paying \nabout a 32 percent effective tax rate. Now, if this goes up, as \nindicated by my friend from Idaho, they will be out of business in a \nlarge scale.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, would create an administrative \nnightmare for the Department of the Interior. For example, the origin \nof the claims and lands currently being mined, they could not be \ntracked, or if they could it would be extremely difficult. Often these \nclaims have been owned and conveyed at arm's-length transactions.\n  How do you go back and effectuate this depletion allowance that he \nwants to dispose of? Many properties are obtained through a variety of \nways other than the 1872 mining law. Remember, they have been mining in \nthe State of Nevada since the 1840's. Many claims were filed prior to \nthe 1872 mining law.\n  Mining companies often put together their operation from private \nproperty acquired through laws, both State and Federal.\n  How would we keep track of ore on a property that has several \ndifferent property origins? The depletion allowance would apply to a \nshovel of ore for one location but not to a shovel of ore identical to \nthat just 10 feet away.\n  In principle, there is little difference between allowing mineral \nproducers a depletion allowance and allowing a manufacturer to \ndepreciate a plant and equipment.\n  In the process of manufacturing, the manufacture's equipment requires \nreplacement.\n  Therefore, a depletion allowance for mineral producers a simply \nlevels the playing field between these classes of taxpayers.\n  Again this amendment unfairly targets the western mining industry.\n  This amendment is an attempt to do mining law reform, and this is not \nthe place or time for such an effort.\n  If this Congress wants to rewrite the current mining law then it \nshould begin in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, not on the \nSenate floor tonight.\n  The Bumpers amendment proposes to eliminate the percentage depletion \nfor non-fuel minerals.\n  This amendment to eliminate Percentage Depletion is an ill-conceived \nand ill-advised attempt to circumvent congressional efforts to reform \ncurrent mining law.\n  The U.S. mining industry has long agreed that the mining law is due \nfor an overhaul.\n  Serious efforts to accomplish such a result have taken place over the \npast several years.\n  Legislation has reached the President's desk that would have, among\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\nother things, imposed significant royalties on minerals produced from \nnew mines developed on Federal lands.\n  The administration has never sought to develop compromise legislation \nthat reforms the mining law.\n  This amendment is simply another attempt to attack the industry on \nyet another front.\n  The capital investment necessary for modern mining is astronomical.\n  It is not unusual to anticipate capital expenditures well in excess \nof $1 billion when opening a new mine.\n  With the repeal of the investment tax credit, the extension of \ndepreciable lives, and the imposition of the alternative minimum tax, \nthe tax burden on the U.S. mining industry is significant and \nburdensome.\n  The most recent GAO report on the subject indicates that the mining \nindustry is currently paying a 32 percent effective tax rate.\n  It is estimated by the State of Nevada that this proposal would \nresult in the following: 2,300 jobs; $220 million in economic output; \nand $68 million loss in household earnings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time and the opposition's time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. REID. There is no time. There is no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On a reconciliation bill there is an hour.\n  Mr. REID. Oh, all time is gone? That is fine.\n  Senator Bumpers left anticipating that there would be a unanimous-\nconsent request entered. I certainly want to do that before I leave \ntoday, if at all possible.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m., \non Thursday, there be an additional 20 minutes for debate equally \ndivided between Senator Murkowski and Senator Bumpers, and immediately \nfollowing that debate time, Senator Murkowski be recognized to raise a \npoint of order against the Bumpers amendment; and further, immediately \nfollowing a motion to waive, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation \nto the Bumpers amendment; to be immediately followed by 20 minutes of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on or in \nrelation to the Dorgan amendment No. 517; to be followed by 10 minutes \nof debate equally divided in the usual form on the Dorgan motion to \nrefer, with Senator Roth being recognized to raise a point of order \nagainst the Dorgan motion to refer; and, further, immediately following \na motion to waive, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nDorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I would like to present an amendment for \nfloor consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 519.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 267, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 780.

Mr. President, simply put, this amendment which I have \noffered asks that we move toward more equitable tax treatment for the \nself-employed with respect to the deductibility of their health \ninsurance premiums within this budget process. I believe this issue \nenjoys wide support among my colleagues in the Senate.\n  I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to a letter which has \nbeen sent to the Senate Finance Committee signed by over half of the \nmembership of this body. A total of 53 Senators have urged that there \nbe movement in this legislation toward the equitable treatment for the \nself-employed with respect to the deductibility of health insurance \npremiums.\n  Today, I would like to reaffirm our commitment to helping the self-\nemployed afford health insurance and receive parity with their \ncorporate competitors who can already deduct 100 percent of their \nhealth insurance premiums by passing this amendment.\n  Let me say at the outset, the term ``self-employed'' is a term of art \nused in the Tax Code but for those who are following the progress of \nthis debate, they may be interested in the people who fall into the \ncategory of the self-employed. Those would include, of course, \nentrepreneurs, small business people, family farmers and the like. It \nis the fastest growing segment of the American economy.\n  More and more people are starting businesses. More and more people \naspire to own their own businesses. More and more women are getting \ninvolved in entrepreneurial endeavors. So this amendment addresses a \nproblem which exists and one which can only become worse as more people \nget into self-employment categories and still do not enjoy the same \npositive tax treatment as corporations and their employees.\n  There are over 23 million self-employed in the United States today. \nUnfortunately, over 5 million of these people have no health insurance. \nThe rate is higher for self-employed people than the rate for salaried \nand waged workers. On the average, salaried and waged workers have only \n16.8 percent of their membership uninsured, as against 25 percent of \nthe self-employed that are uninsured.\n  The simple fact of the matter is there is a 50 percent higher \nlikelihood that a person is uninsured--without health insurance--if \nthey are self-employed, as opposed to being a salaried employee.\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\n Not only are the self-employed less likely to have health insurance, \nbut those that do pay on the average 30 percent more for their health \ninsurance premiums. They do not have access to group health insurance. \nThey pay some of the highest rates in the Nation.\n  For those who follow closely the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, which as I understand it is the largest organization of \nsmall businesses in America, they might be interested to know that when \ntheir membership was surveyed nationwide last year and asked their No. \n1 issue for Washington, it was not capital gains; their No. 1 issue was \nthe cost of health insurance. When I traveled across Chicago last year \nand met many entrepreneurs and small business people, I asked them the \nchallenges they face, and time again they said, it is such a great \nconcern to us and to our families that once having left the protection \nof a group health insurance plan and having moved into self-employment, \ninto small business, or in many cases to family farms, they found \nthemselves unable to afford health insurance.\n  I can recall a telephone call to my congressional office, when I \nserved in the House. A woman called when she heard of my interest in \nthis issue and said, ``I want to tell you my family story.'' It is one \nthat is repeated many times on farms across America. She said, ``I was \nat home as a farm wife raising our children, raising the family. Then I \ndecided I had to go to work in town.'' She said to me, \n``Congressman''--I was a Congressman--``Congressman, the reason I work \nis because the salary I earn pays for two things: Day care for my \nchildren, which otherwise I would take care of at home, and the \npremiums for health insurance for our farm family.'' That story is \nrepeated many times over, across the United States, where people are \nstruggling to come up with the resources to be able to afford health \ninsurance.\n  Currently, the self-employed in America may only take a tax deduction \nof 40 percent for the cost of health insurance premiums. However, \ncorporations and their employees enjoy a full 100 percent \ndeductibility. This is not fair.\n  I once asked some of the older Members of the House who had been \naround during many, many years of debate on tax bills why this \ndisparity existed, why would we take one group of Americans working for \nbusinesses and give them full deductibility of health insurance, and \nsay to self-employed people, you can only deduct 40 percent. I was \ncertain there had to be some rationale behind this dichotomy. I spoke \nto Sam Gibbons, now retired Congressman from Florida, who served on the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee for many years. He said there is no good \nexplanation for it. It came about sometime after World War II when \ncorporations and unions asked for this advantage and it was given to \nthem. The self-employed did not speak out. Health insurance was not a \nmajor issue, and as a consequence this dichotomy, this divergence in \nthe deductibility of health insurance became enshrined in law.\n  Scheduled increases in current law for the deduction of the self-\nemployed will slowly, slowly increase from the current level to 45 \npercent by 2002. We are talking about waiting 5 years for it to go up 5 \npercent more for deductibility, and then even by 2006, almost 10 years \nfrom now, under current law the deductibility for self-employment will \nonly be 80 percent--never reaching 100 percent deductibility of a \ncorporation or big business. That is a very long time for self-employed \npeople to wait.\n  We should make progress on this issue on increasing deductibility \nthis year within this budget package. Farmers and many other hard-\nworking, self-employed individuals, including many women who recently \nstarted small businesses in record numbers, deserve help in this area, \nsooner rather than later.\n  You might take into consideration this fact: Of the 10 million \nuninsured children in America today, 1.3 million of them live in \nfamilies where there is at least one parent who is self-employed. These \nchildren comprise approximately 13 percent of all uninsured children. \nSo for these families, for the breadwinners who own the small \nbusinesses, for the family farmers and for their children, this is a \nvery critical amendment.\n  Now, the obvious question to be asked of myself and others who come \nto the floor with changes in the Tax Code is this: How are you going to \npay for it? How will you provide the resources to offset the cost of \ngiving this new deduction to the self-employed? I will tell you, \nupfront, we raise the tobacco tax, the Federal tobacco tax.\n  The current cigarette tax is 24 cents per package. The current tax on \nsmokeless tobacco is about 2.7 cents, for snuff; and 2.3 cents for a \npouch of chewing tobacco. This bill increases the cigarette tax by 20 \ncents per pack to 44 cents. That is the bill that comes out of the \nSenate Finance Committee. It increases the tax on smokeless tobacco \nproducts by the same 83 percent. That will raise the tax to around 5 \ncents for snuff, 4.2 cents for chewing tobacco.\n\n  The amendment I offer to provide the deductibility, full \ndeductibility for health premiums for the self-employed, is paid for by \nadding about 10 cents to the tax on cigarettes, about 10 cents, a tax--\nmaybe a fraction higher that might be necessary to make certain that it \nmeets this budgetary requirement. Ten cents, 10 pennies for a person \nbuying a package of tobacco.\n  What will we buy as a Nation for these 10 pennies? We will buy \nprotection for millions of Americans who today do not have it, health \ninsurance that they can afford, giving them fair treatment under the \nTax Code, saying to people who buy tobacco products you will pay a few \npennies more for those products. We, as a Nation, will see great \nbenefit coming to many families and many children across America.\n  We are waiting for a formal revenue estimate from the Joint Tax \nCommittee. We have been in negotiation with them. We are told that the \namount of the tax on a package of cigarettes may be slightly over 10 \ncents, but we are in this range of between 10 and 11 cents.\n  What happens when you raise the price of a package of cigarettes, as \nthis bill does, by 20 cents already? Fewer children buy them. As you \nmake tobacco products more expensive, kids stay away. Now, isn't that a \ngood idea? Don't we all agree that to have 3,000 children start smoking \nfor the first time every day in the United States is a bad idea? \nShouldn't we discourage this addiction of our children? I think we all \nagree on that. I think even the tobacco companies have come to \nacknowledge that they are a major part of the problem that we have \ntoday in addiction to nicotine and tobacco.\n  In addition to taking care of a lot of children who are uninsured and \na lot of self-employed and their families by increasing the tax on \ntobacco products slightly, by 10 cents or a few fractions beyond that, \nwe will discourage children from using tobacco products. Is that a \ncritical problem in our country? I think we all know that it is. \nTeenage smoking in America has risen by nearly 50 percent since 1991.\n  I will close with just a few brief remarks about the sales tax and \njust say to my colleagues it would be foolish, foolish, for us to \nignore the reality that tobacco taxes are going to increase. We have \nasked for a survey of State existing tobacco taxes as of today. What \nare the taxes in each State imposed by those States and their \nlegislatures on tobacco products? I say to my friends and colleagues if \nyou will take a look here, you will see that more and more State \nlegislatures are dramatically increasing tobacco taxes as a source of \nrevenue.\n  For example, let me give you a few. In the State of Hawaii, the State \ncigarette tax will go from 60 cents to 80 cents in just a few weeks. In \nthe State of Maine, the cigarette tax is going to double from 37 cents \nto 74 cents by the end of the year. In the State of Alaska, the tax \nrate on cigarettes and tobacco products will move from 29 cents to $1 \ndollar by the end of the year. In the State of Utah, from 26\\1/2\\ cents \nto 51.5 cents. State legislatures understand this is a good source of \nrevenue. The Senate Finance Committee understood that when it added a \n20-cent tobacco tax.\n  So I ask my colleagues to seriously consider a very minor increase of \nabout 10 cents a pack to tobacco and measure it against what we will \nwin as a Nation. We had this long debate a few years ago about \nuniversal health care. I certainly believe in it and subscribe to it. \nWe did not finish that debate with a work product that achieved \nresults. I hope with this amendment,\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\nthough, we can move forward on the path toward moving more people into \nthe protection of health insurance. The 5 million uninsured self-\nemployed people deserve that type of protection. Those self-employed \nand their children will benefit greatly from this amendment.\n  I know that this may be a tough amendment for the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I have watched the course of this debate over the last \ncouple of days and it is clear that they do not always warm up to \nsuggestions of change. Maybe this time there might be an exception. \nMaybe with the bipartisan support of some 53 Senators, the members of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, the leadership, might consider this \namendment. It is one which would greatly enhance the tax package which \nthey offered.\n  I yield back the floor and offer my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 520\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for children's health insurance initiatives)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I now send to the desk the amendment that \nwas reported out by the Finance Committee regarding the children's \nhealth insurance initiative. This amendment provides $8 billion over 5 \nyears for children's health insurance coverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 520.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 521 to Amendment No. 520\n\n         (Purpose: To improve the children's health initiative)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I now send to the desk a second-degree amendment pursuant \nto the order of the Senate agreed to today which incorporates the \nprovisions of the Roth and Chafee amendments on the children's health \ninitiative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 521 to amendment No. 520.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask the Chair this question: Do I understand correctly \nthat the second-degree amendment which I offer is by virtue of today's \norder of the Senate considered adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay it aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 519\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, might I inquire of the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, can we reach some agreement about debate that \nwill be allowed on my amendment tomorrow when it is considered?\n  Mr. ROTH. I have to tell my good friend, no, we cannot agree at this \ntime.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So under the rules would the amendment automatically be \nconsidered tomorrow or subject to any debate?\n  Mr. ROTH. It could come up tomorrow but we cannot limit debate at the \npresent time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My current understanding, I have 43 minutes left on the \ndebate on this amendment and the opposition has 59 minutes as we have \nconcluded debate this evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Would the chairman give me a couple of minutes to make a \nstatement as it relates to the Durbin amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. Two minutes?\n  Mr. FORD. Two minutes.\n  Mr. President, no one here in the Chamber is opposed to helping \nchildren. We have tried our best over the years, and we are trying our \nbest now. It seems like every time you want some money you go to \ntobacco. We have had Senators from the other side of the aisle that \nvoted against tax on tobacco or any other excise tax because they \nthought that was the prerogative of the State, and the Senator from \nIllinois just laid out how much additional tax is going on. So we have \na negotiated agreement that people are getting something they never \nthought they would be able to get. We have to get that through \nCongress.\n  Now, if we had 10 cents from this committee, and 20 cents there, and \n43 cents tomorrow, we have killed the agreement and there is no way the \nincome can equal the projection because with a dollar additional on a \npack of cigarettes we lose 20 percent of production and have a 20 \npercent reduction.\n  We are trying to get in this package reduction of teen smoking or \nunderage smoking. We have a criteria there if they do not do it, they \npay more money. Yet we are putting it where they cannot do that.\n  I say to my friends, I am from a tobacco State, absolutely, and I \nplead guilty to that. I am going to represent them the best I can, but \npile on, pile on, pile on--you are not going to have any money left. \nThe States won't be able to get any money and their budgets will be \nbehind, our projections will not reach that total, we will be behind, \nso everybody piles on tobacco.\n  I hope you will take a step back with all these crocodile tears I see \naround here. I understand those. But there is some point where we have \nto meet reality, and reality is do you want to complete a job that is \nstarted or do you want to do something that will unbalance this budget \nwithin a very short period of time.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator for allowing me the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. How long would the Senator from Illinois like?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am the first woman in history to \nserve on the Senate Finance Committee, and I have been just delighted \nto work with the chairman and his staff and my ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan. They have been accommodating, they have been supportive and \nthey have listened. And I have to say that this was the third occasion \nthat I have had to work on a tax bill. While the tax bill did not \nresult as I would have written it, at the same time, I can think of no \nbetter group with which to work than the members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and, particularly, its leadership.\n  Mr. President, I want to share a few preliminary thoughts about the \ntax bill. I intend to file an expanded statement at a later time. At \nthe outset, I want to say that I intend to vote for this bill. It was \nworked on by the committee. We worked hard on behalf of the goals of \nachieving a balanced budget. We worked hard on behalf of achieving an \nopportunity for the American people to focus their resources in the \nmost productive way for our economy as a whole.\n  When I came to Congress, my over-arching goal was to create a more \nfiscally responsible environment, a better fiscal environment for our \nchildren. We needed to reverse the trend to borrow, to pay for things \nnow, at the cost of having our children pay back our debts and \nforeclosing their options and opportunities. Even though it caused some \nconsternation, I supported a balanced budget amendment precisely \nbecause I believe that we have an obligation to prepare and to make it \neasier for our children than our parents left it for us. I believed \nthat we had to ensure that we do not leave our children in greater debt \nthan our parents left to us.\n  So my main focus in coming here to Congress was to focus in on \ngetting some order about our fiscal house, reducing the deficit, and \nactually beginning to create the framework in which our economy can go \nforward, and the strength that not having this burden of debt would \nhave given it. For that reason, I also took the position that it was \nnot time yet for us to go into providing\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\nfor tax cuts, that we needed to restrain our desire to cut taxes until \nsuch time as our fiscal house was in order. Deficit reduction should \nhave been our goal as a matter not only of our fiscal responsibility, \nbut of generational fairness. And so I started off with that \nproposition from the very beginning.\n  In 1993, the first year I was here in the Senate, I voted for the \nbudget that President Clinton submitted that began the path toward \ndeficit reduction. Since that bill, which was very controversial at the \ntime--I remember people calling it the ``biggest tax increase in \nhistory,'' even though it only increased taxes on the very top wage \nearners or top income earners in our country. It was very controversial \nat the time. In fact, in the election that followed, a number of people \nlost office because people thought they had sent our country on the \nwrong fiscal path.\n  However, that bill has proved, I think, over time, to be the jump-\nstart that this economy needed in order to give rise not only to the \nbooming stock market and booming economy that we have seen, but the \ndeficit reduction that we have seen. Since the time of that vote, the \ndeficit has gone from about $290 billion--almost $300 billion--to $65 \nbillion this year. Now, without a tax cut, we could have retired our \ndebt entirely before the year 2002. While it is a fact that some of the \neconomists argue that we don't need to worry about deficits and we \ndon't need to retire our debt, at the same time, I think there is an \nexpectation from the American people that we would do everything we \ncould to get that done in as timely a fashion as possible. Reducing the \ndeficit would have had the effect of lowering interest rates and would \nenable us to provide even larger tax cuts, once we have paid all our \nbills. But that is not the case at this time. There is consensus for \ncutting taxes this year--a budget deal that explicitly tailored the \namounts of net tax cut and outlays with some specific parameters.\n\n  So since there is consensus on the tax cut that came out of the \nBudget Committee, and that is the direction we have been ordered to \ntake in the Finance Committee, I believed that the tax cut given should \nbe targeted to provide the maximum benefit to relieve families of the \ntax burden that they have to carry. Unfortunately, this bill only \npartially meets that goal.\n  The problem, as I see it, and my one sadness about what we have seen \nhere, is that this tax bill is not progressive. To make the bill \nprogressive, the distribution of the tax cuts should allow the largest \nportion of the tax cut to go to the greatest number of families. This \nis simply community fairness. Unfortunately, this bill still allocates \nthe largest amount of the tax cut to the fewest number of Americans \ninstead of the other way around.\n  This bill allows some 22 million American families to receive almost \n$40 billion in tax cuts, while 88 million families receive only about \n$20 billion from this tax cut. The average tax cut that will be \nreceived by families making less than $17,000 a year will be about $12. \nFamilies with incomes of less than $33,000 a year will receive an \naverage of $64 from this tax cut. Families with incomes of less than \n$55,000 will receive an average $274 from this tax cut. Families \nearning less than $94,000 will receive an average of $583 from this tax \ncut. However, if you go beyond that, families with incomes above \n$94,000 will receive an average of $1,789 from this tax cut.\n  In short, Mr. President, the 22 million Americans making over \n$100,000 will receive 65 percent of the tax cut here, while the 88 \nmillion people earning under $100,000 will receive about 34 percent of \nthe tax cut.\n  Now, there is no question that tax cuts are always popular. Many of \nthe tax cuts which give rise to this result are popular, particularly \nthe estate tax, capital gains reduction, and IRA expansion. But it \nseems to me that just based on sheer numbers, working class people \nshould have fared better. Even though we tried to remedy some of these \nissues, we were not successful. Senator Rockefeller and I, for example, \ntried to remedy the effect of the $500-per-child tax credit; \nnonetheless, a majority of the working poor will be excluded from the \nlargest part of this bill.\n  Well, Mr. President, I have taken up my 2 minutes. I thank the \nchairman for his indulgence. I want to point out that, as we direct \nthese issues of tax policy, we should be mindful that, if we really \ncare about family values, about our total community, we need to have \ntax fairness as a guiding principle in our deliberations, with the \ngreatest benefit going to the greatest number. It seems to me that what \nought not to guide our deliberation is just what sounds good or what is \npolitically popular or easy to do. We could have done a better job with \nthis tax bill. I know the chairman tried and the ranking member tried; \nwe all tried. This bill is a better bill than the House bill by a long \nshot. But, at the same time, I hope as we go into conference, we will \nbe mindful that there are an awful lot of working people and families \nout there who need our help, and we have an opportunity and an \nobligation to give it to them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a scaled-down, in fact, a way \nscaled-down version of an amendment that I offered in the Finance \nCommittee markup. It failed on a very close vote, with the full amount \nof close to $900 million. This is an attempt to ensure that this next \nwinter we do not have the kinds of emergencies we have faced with the \ninability to finance the school repairs necessary to keep the DC \nschools open.\n  This amendment is to the provisions in the bill dealing with the \nDistrict of Columbia. What this will do--hopefully, if accepted--is \nalso place in the hands of those at the conference an amendment to help \nin the most critical area this city faces, and that is the decreasing \ncapacity of its schools to even stand up, to keep the kids out of rain, \nand to protect the boilers from blowing up, and everything else.\n  It is a modest start of only $70 million, but it will open a path, \nhopefully, that may be utilized in case these emergencies continue to \nincrease. What it strikes is a provision in the bill that is only a $75 \nmillion provision.\n  The provision that is in the bill attempts to set up some sort of tax \ncredit system for businesses and people in the District of Columbia \ninterested in having assistance in developing businesses. That is all \nvery fine. I point out and emphasize again and again that that \nprovision is in the House bill. So if mine does pass, it still will be \nin the committee of conference, and the members, then, will have a \nchoice of whether they desire to try and protect the city schools from \nshutting down, or whether they prefer to use this provision with \nrespect to tax credits.\n  Let me give you the dimensions of the school problems in this city. \nFirst, very briefly, we have, for better or worse, one of the worst \nschool systems in this country--and this is the Nation's Capital. I \nremind all of my colleagues that we have accepted responsibility for \nthose schools. We have basically replaced the city council with the \ncontrol board. We have replaced the school board with the board of \ntrustees. We have given authority to the control board to basically run \nthe city. Yet, the capacity of the city to do anything about its \nschools is greatly limited. Although they have substantial revenues, \nthose revenues are critical and important to just keeping the schools \nopen. They have $2 billion in necessary code repairs in order to make \nthese schools up to code.\n  Each year, we have had emergency appropriations to try and handle \nthis situation. Those emergency appropriations have been in the terms \nof $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million a year. This is \nin an attempt to find a way to take care of those problems through the \nappropriations process in its normal form.\n  I point out that these tax breaks that are included, which I will \nstrike, really do nothing to bring middle-class families back to the \nDistrict. The only thing that will bring families back to the District \nis a school system that will provide them with schools in which their \nchildren will learn something. We have one of the worst records, as far \nas our students go, of any city in the country. Without that, all the \nother things we try to do here will not bring back the middle-class \nfamilies, unless we take care of the school system.\n  I point out that Andrew Brimmer, chairman of the DC Control Board, \nsays that the impact of the tax break provisions in this bill will do \nlittle or nothing. We must improve the schools and public safety. Let's \nget real in the efforts to help the city. Every week I travel the DC \nschools I see leaky faucets and roofs, broken boilers, and I could go \non. The boilers are going to be the critical problem this next year. \nThey are likely to shut the schools down in the middle of winter unless \nwe do something. The students are suffering every day.\n  All my amendment will do is allow the committee of conference to have \nanother option, along with the one I am striking, in order to be able \nto take care of some of the emergency repairs for the schools. So, Mr. \nPresident, I also point out what has been lost and how we have \nhamstrung this city to do anything about it. The District has lost more \nthan 200,000 residents since 1970; 200,000 people have moved out. And \n50,000 have moved out in this decade alone. The only way to stem this \ntide is to improve the District services.\n  There is a time and a place for tax breaks. Again, this is just \nputting another option on the table. But you don't offer tax breaks to \nattract residents back to a city where the schools are collapsing \naround them. That is like giving free popcorn to keep people in the \nseats in a burning theater.\n  This isn't going to work. It is important that we do something about \nit.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to make sure that we have an opportunity to \ngive a seat to that conference committee for the kids in this city so \nthat they may have a chance to see their schools restored to the point \nwhere this city can be proud of them and proud of their school system.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the reconciliation measure. I therefore raise a point of \norder against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the time has been used or yielded back, \nthe point of order is not in order.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am not clear on the situation. The \npoint of order does not lie at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not in order until all \ntime has been used or yielded back.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I withdraw the point of order and ask that \nthe matter be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I now yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for the time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 518\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to talk very briefly about an \nissue that is before the body with regard to an amendment on mining law \nreform.\n  First, let me just say very briefly that I am delighted that this \ndebate is going on. I am delighted that we are talking about tax relief \nfor the first time really seriously in 10 years. We are going to hear a \nlot about different kinds of details. We will hear a lot of different \nviews, and that is healthy. That is the way it ought to be.\n  There are many here who do not support tax relief. I understand that. \nIt is a legitimate point of view--not one I share--of those who do not \nwant tax relief but would rather have more Government spending. We have \nnot had tax relief since the early 1980's. It is time we do that.\n  I certainly want to congratulate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for bringing this package forward. It is time that we gave \nsome relief to working families, and relieve people who are paying \ntaxes and allow families to keep more of their own money. That is what \nit is all about.\n  We hear people say, ``Well, there shouldn't be tax relief because we \nneed to balance the budget.'' Their notion is that you have to balance \nthe budget and continue to spend more. But what we ought to be doing is \ncontrolling\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\nspending. And that is part of what this package does.\n  We heard earlier in the evening debate about mining. I wanted to talk \njust a bit about two aspects of that. One is there is an amendment, of \ncourse, which would eliminate the depletion allowance for hard-rock \nmining. However, in the presentation we heard more about the mining law \nof 1872 than we did about the depletion.\n  Let me tell you that we would have a revised mining law of 1872 if we \ncould get some of those who constantly complain about it to agree to \nsomething. I have been here in the House, and now in the Senate for 2 \nyears. We have had this every year. We have been very close to having a \ndecision. But the very folks who complain the most about not revising \nit are the ones who never find anything to agree to.\n  I can tell you that there has been agreement on the idea of having \nroyalties from the users, from the producers, and from nearly everyone \nhere. There has been agreement on the idea of paying marketplace price \nfor the land, or in fact not taking title to the land. That could well \nbe done. And I would suggest that those who complain the most about \nchange are the ones that cause it not to happen.\n  I simply want to say that when you want to start talking about \ndepletion allowance and talking about the fact that the minerals are \nthere and free, I want to tell you that they are not free. They are not \ndoing you much good unless there is a substantial kind of investment to \nextract those minerals--probably as much as $400,000 or $500,000 to be \nable to do it at all.\n  The value of the resource is not there unless someone has an \nincentive to invest the money to do the mining. And then, of course, \nthe idea is to create jobs. The idea is to create jobs. Some 2,300 jobs \nin Nevada--high-paying jobs in the neighborhood of $50,000 a year as \ncompared to $25,000 as a national average. These are the kind of jobs \nthat are there. With tremendous investment in these kinds of jobs there \nis revenue. There are taxes, and there is payment. We ought to \nencourage that rather than discourage it.\n  The suggestion was made that somehow mining goes on and there is no \nreclamation of land. That is not true. There were in earlier years a \nlack of reclamation laws but there are not now. There are tons of laws \nthat cause reclamation.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not want to go on forever. But I do want to \ntell you that mining is one of the basic industries in this country--\nthat minerals are relatively valueless unless there is someone willing \nto make the investment to extract them. They create some of the \nhighest-paying jobs in this country. They generate local taxes. They \ngenerate taxes through wages. And they are very much part of our \neconomy--an economy that tends to be forced out of this country by \ncontinuing to raise taxes.\n  I suspect this issue is not a proper one to have there. But it is one \nwe are talking about, and voting on in the morning.\n  I urge my associates here in the Senate to vote against the Bumpers \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in a quorum call. But we are in \ncontrolled time. The Senator from Delaware controls time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Delaware for \npermission to go ahead and make some comments, a general floor \nstatement, and then I would like to introduce an amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator. I would like to, Mr. President, \ncompliment the chairman for his hard work on this particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, this week I am confident that the Senate will approve \nthe largest tax cut since the Reagan tax cuts of 1981. And it is about \ntime.\n  In the 16 years since the last tax cut, Congress has enacted two \nmajor tax increases--one in 1990, and the other in 1993.\n  Mr. President, it is time for a change. It is time to put American \nfamilies ahead of Washington, DC's insatiable appetite for more \nGovernment spending.\n  Taxes are now higher than they have ever been. Taxes constitute one-\nthird of the economy. And Tax Freedom Day--the day to which the average \nAmerican works to pay the combined Federal, State, and local tax \nburden--and that date is May 9. It is the latest it has ever been.\n  Mr. President, I view this tax cut as a downpayment. My long-term \nobjective is to ensure that no American family pays more than 25 \npercent of its income in taxes.\n  A balanced Federal budget, and a reasonable level of taxation should \nbe the twin objectives of Congress as we enter the next century.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to support this tax cut and to help \nensure that the bridge to the 21st century does not become a giant toll \nbridge.\n  Today I would like to focus on what I call the growth tax. This is \ntypically referred to as the capital gains tax, a term which liberals \noften use derisively to help create the impression that only the rich \npay the growth tax.\n  In fact, as you may know, Mr. President, nearly all Americans own \ncapital, and they experience a tax on that capital when they sell a \nhouse or when they sell stocks or a small business or a farm or a \nranch.\n  Under our current Tax Code, gains on capital investment are taxed at \na 28-percent Federal rate, and often an additional 5 percent or more in \nState taxes comes in on top of that. This is the growth tax, and this \nis among the highest growth tax of any major industrial nation.\n  The real growth tax is often much higher than 28 percent. This is \nbecause our Tax Code does not protect Americans from taxation on \ncapital gains that result only from inflation. This means, for example, \nthat an investment held for 10 years where up to one-third of the gain \ncan be due to inflation, taxes are due even on this.\n  This is clearly one of the most unfair aspects of this tax. \nGovernment policies contribute to inflation, and Government then turns \naround and taxes its citizens on that inflation.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I intend to fight very hard to see \nthat indexing is included in our growth tax cut. The House bill wisely \nincludes this provision--and I commend Chairman Bill Archer for this. \nThe Senate bill, unfortunately, does not yet have indexing. Hopefully, \nby the end of the week, it will.\n\n  Some have dismissed indexing as too costly for this tax bill. But for \nme this is an issue of fundamental fairness. It is wrong for the \nFederal Government to tax its citizens on inflation.\n  It is not too costly not to include indexing. Indexing simply means \nthat Americans would be permitted to disregard any gains due solely to \ninflation, and then pay taxes only on real gains.\n  Mr. President, let's take a look at how this capital gains growth tax \nhits ordinary working Americans beginning with their home.\n  The Tax Code generally allows gains on a personal residence to be \ndeferred as long as the proceeds are used to purchase another larger \nhome. However, many Americans eventually pay capital gains on their \nhome, particularly as they get older and find that their residence has \nappreciated substantially in value.\n  Our tax bill deals with this issue by exempting all but the very rich \nfrom any taxation on gains from their principal residence. This is a \nlong overdue reform.\n  Next, let's look at financial investments. Stocks are a frequent \nsource of capital gains taxes, and stock ownership today is more \nwidespread than ever before. Stock ownership has doubled in the last 7 \nyears to the point where 43 percent of all adult Americans own stocks.\n  Obviously, with those numbers, Mr. President, it is spread throughout \nsociety. Today, half of the investors are women and half are noncollege \ngraduates.\n  Stocks are typically held for retirement, education expenses, and \nother long-term goals. This is precisely the type of savings and \ninvestment that we need in our economy. Investments foster business \nexpansion, and job creation. Capital is the lifeblood of a free\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\nmarket economy. Clearly you cannot have capitalism without capital. And \nour Tax Code should encourage capital investment.\n  Mr. President, I cannot leave this topic without talking about small \nbusiness owners and farmers.\n  There is no clearer area where the growth tax makes no sense. \nMillions of American families put their lives into building small \nbusinesses and farms. Often those businesses or farms are sold to \nfinance a decent retirement. But this can occur only after Uncle Sam \ngets his cut of 28 percent of all the gains. Often, over half of these \ngains are due only to inflation. It is no wonder that millions of our \nmost ambitious citizens have lost faith in our tax system.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, tax relief is on the way. This bill \nlowers the growth tax from 28 to 20 percent for most families, and \nthose in the lowest tax bracket would pay only 10 percent. This tax cut \nwould help make life easier for millions of Americans, and it will help \nour economy to grow and create new jobs.\n  To those Americans who own a home, who save for retirement or who own \na small business or farm, I say that next time a liberal says that \ncapital gains are only for the rich, remember, he is thinking of you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 523\n\n[Purpose: To strike the extension of the Temporary Federal Unemployment \n                                Surtax]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I now would like to send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 523.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 397, strike section 881.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. This amendment would strike section 881 of the tax bill.\n  This section extends the so-called temporary unemployment surtax on \nsmall business and other employers through the year 2007. The House tax \nbill does not include this provision. The Senate bill, unfortunately, \ndoes. I rise to support the House position on this matter.\n  The description of this provision put out by the committee notes that \nin 1976 Congress passed a temporary surtax of .2 percent of taxable \nwages to be added to the unemployment tax rate.\n  I would suggest that at a minimum, if we are going to keep extending \nthis tax, we ought to be honest with the American worker and small \nbusiness owners and stop calling this a temporary tax. Enough is \nenough.\n  Between 1970 and 1990, there have been three unemployment tax rate \nincreases and three wage base increases. These have resulted in a \ndramatic increase in the unemployment tax burden. There is no reason to \ncontinue this temporary surtax when we have the lowest unemployment in \na quarter century and a full trust fund. This is no more than an \nadditional and unfair general revenue raising.\n  The reason for the unemployment surtax no longer exists. The \ntemporary surtax was put in place in 1976 in order to repay borrowing \nof the Federal unemployment trust fund from the general fund of the \nTreasury. Even though the borrowings were repaid in May 1987, Congress \nhas continued to extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill. As of \ntoday, all the States' reservoirs now have surpluses.\n  Since 1987, the surtax has been used solely to raise revenue to pay \nfor tax packages. The tax takes money out of the private economy for no \nvalid reason.\n  I have two concerns with this surtax. First, the Federal Government \nis breaking its commitment to employers and to workers that this added \ntax would be temporary. Clearly, it is not temporary, and if this \nprovision remains in the bill and is enacted, the tax will have been in \nplace for 30 years. This is not the way Government should do business.\n  The second problem I have is that we should not be imposing \nunnecessary payroll taxes. Payroll taxes cost jobs. Because small \nbusinesses are generally labor intensive, payroll taxes, which are a \ntax on labor, strike small businesses particularly hard. Payroll taxes \nare paid whether there is a profit or a loss.\n  I would note that high payroll taxes in Europe, particularly in \nGermany, is one of the principal reasons that unemployment is so high. \nThis should be a warning to us to work steadily to limit the payroll \ntax on U.S. businesses.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there is some concern about my \namendment, so I will withdraw this amendment and urge the Senate to \nagree to the House position on this issue.\n  There are a number of Senators, and I can assure you there are many \nthousands of small businesses, that would like to see this provision \nout of the bill, but before I withdraw my amendment, I would like to \nmake an inquiry to the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth. In light of the fact that this tax was to be a temporary \ntax, would the chairman consider either removing the provision in \nconference or modifying it to at least terminate the tax more quickly \nthan proposed in the bill?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to answer the question raised by the \ndistinguished Senator. I understand the concerns he has expressed. I \nunderstand the impact it has on small business. I say to him that this \nis an aspect of our proposal that was recommended by the \nadministration, but I will certainly, in going into conference with the \nHouse Members, keep in mind the concern the Senator has expressed and \nlook at this matter very carefully.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for his sincerity and real concern \nabout the surtax, and I would just, in conclusion, reflect on some of \nmy own experiences with the surtax. When it was first applied in 1976, \nI was just basically starting out in my small business. I had just been \nin business 4 or 5 years. I had not been in business long enough to \nhave to pay any unemployment compensation, never had to have any \nturnover in my business, but every dime counted in that new business. \nAnd when that surtax was imposed on that small business that I was \nstarting at the time, it did have an impact.\n  I do not believe we can continue to disregard the impact that these \nunemployment taxes have on small businesses, particularly the small \nbusinesses that are just starting out. We need to encourage people to \ngo in business for themselves. We need to encourage people to someday \nthink in terms of being their own boss and being self-sufficient. These \ntypes of tax provisions do have a disproportionate impact on small \nbusinesses, particularly those just starting out.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 523) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from \nMontana 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 518\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Earlier this evening an amendment was offered to do away with the \ndepletion allowance on mining. It seems every year we have to go \nthrough this process really explaining what the National Mining Act is \nall about.\n  Yes, we have been awfully close to coming up with some kind of \nagreement for reform of the act. We have been so close that everybody \nagreed, but one would get the feeling--although it seemed like it fell \napart, I get the distinct feeling that those who would reform the act \nor be the reformers want the issue rather than the results. I am always \nreminded of John Adams when he come back to the Congress and was asked \nabout an issue. He said duty is ours; results are reserved to God.\n  Let us look at the intent of the Mining Act. It is as true today as \nit was in the days it was written. This act has been around about 120 \nor 125 years. I would say to anybody who lives in this country and owns \nproperty, even though it may be his private home in an urban area, the \nownership of his\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\nown home, which means land ownership or property ownership, which has \nbeen one of the cornerstones of America, the building of America and \nthe freedom of us as a people, has been the result of a land tenure \nact. It was a way that we moved all the lands in this United States of \nAmerica into private ownership.\n  That is what the Mining Act was all about. We have had only two, I \nthink, maybe three, major land tenure acts. One of them was the \nHomestead Act, and that was a result of the Louisiana Purchase, where \nyou were deeded 160 acres of land, and if you proved it up to be \nviable, then they gave you ownership of that land. And ever since then, \nit has changed hands many times, but it has allowed us to own property, \nland, and real estate. It has been the cornerstone of our economy.\n  In mining, it was a little bit different, but yet it was a land \ntenure act. It was a deal struck by this Government that owned millions \nof acres of land telling a miner that if you go out and you find a \nmineral, whether it be precious metals or trace minerals or whatever, \nand it has value and you prove it up to be a viable enterprise, we will \nguarantee you the surface of that land and access to that deposit. You \ninvest your money, and if there is nothing there, we do not as a \ngovernment owe you anything and you can go merrily on the way, and the \nland belongs and stays in the ownership of the Government of the United \nStates of America.\n  I think I would be laughed out of this building if I went down to \nappropriations and said I have a government agency that wants to \nexplore for silver or gold or platinum or palladium or anything else \nand asked for an appropriation of $20 million to explore and to prove \nup a claim. That is risking a lot of taxpayers' money. I would be told, \nwhy, this is the craziest thing we have ever heard. Taxpayers didn't \ngive us the money for such a cockamamy idea of going out and exploring \nfor that mineral.\n  So what did we do? We struck a deal. You invest, Mr. Miner, your \nmoney, your time, your equipment. If you find it, that's good. If you \ndo not, then the Government is not out anything. But we guaranteed \naccess and we guaranteed surface rights if a mineral or precious metal \nwas found.\n  The National Mining Act was never an environmental act. It does not \nexempt mining companies from the environmental laws that are in place \nboth by the State and the Federal Government. They are not exempt of \nthat--clean air, clean water. They are required to reclaim it after the \nmine has been mined out. All it was, was to guarantee Americans access \nto a precious metal or mineral. Yet, those who would want to change it \nsay that is no longer important.\n\n  We could have settled on royalties, could have settled on land price, \ncould have settled on all of that. But the reformers refused to accept \nit. So I say, before we do too much changing, let's really understand \nwhat the law is all about, because it works today as it did whenever \nthe law was made the law of the land. It seems like there are a lot of \nfolks who do not understand that. They did not understand the Homestead \nAct either. This country eats, provides food for its families, cheaper \nthan any other society in the world as a percentage of your paycheck \ngoing solely for food for your family. That was done because American \nagriculture owns the land. It is their farm. They make it produce. It \nis as competitive as selling shoes or watermelons. It does not make any \ndifference. But all of that was the result of a land tenure act called \nthe Homestead Act.\n  Why do we have to turn around and explain this every time this issue \ncomes up? Yet, there are those who would like to twist and turn and not \nreally represent the act for what it really is and why it was designed \nthat way. They say gold miners get rich on gold. Where is it used, for \njewelry? No, not really. We wouldn't even have a space program if we \ndidn't have gold and silver, because there is as much of it used in \nelectronics as there is in jewelry.\n  The only platinum or palladium mine is found in Montana. It is the \nonly one in this country. It is one of three in the whole world. If you \ndidn't have palladium, you wouldn't have catalytic converters to \nprotect our air. Yet, there would be those who would say maybe it is \nnot a necessity--until we look at the manufacturing and our science and \nour technologies, of what these trace minerals and these other minerals \nare really worth to this country.\n  Do we want to get as dependent on our precious metals and minerals as \nwe are on oil? We are almost 51 percent dependent on oil from offshore. \nIs that energy policy? Does that give us energy security? I don't think \nso.\n  So we have to be very, very cautious whenever we start talking about \na subject and a law that a lot of people say, ``Well, they're ripping \noff the Government.'' What's just the opposite is true. Because that \nmine provides jobs; it provides a tax base in many counties. In the \nWest, that is the only thing they have. It provides public safety and \nroads and schools. It is the backbone of that county's economy. Yet, \nthere are those who say tourism is growing and it is taking over and we \ndon't need mining anymore. I don't know of anybody who wants to stand \naround and flip hamburgers for $4.25 an hour, or whatever it is, when \nyou could probably get a better job producing something, producing \nwealth for this country. It just doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  Those of us who come out of, let's say, natural resources or \nagriculture, I guess we look at it a little bit different. But you look \nat it different when you come up through those ranks, as some of us in \nthis room have done, including the Presiding Officer who is in the \nchair tonight. It doesn't hurt to have a little dirt under your \nfingernails so you understand what makes things go in this country. All \nnew wealth, all new wealth produced in this country comes from either \nthe renewable resource of the Earth and, sometimes, some of it from the \nfinite resources that are found in this Earth. That is where new wealth \nis produced. It is produced nowhere else. Every one of us chase the \ndollar around. But, especially in the renewables, that is the real \nworth of a nation. And those renewables were produced on private land \nownership where people took care of it, managed their resources and \nmade a community and a State and a nation grow.\n  So, when we start talking about the national mining act and how it \nshould be changed, let's be very cautious and remember why it was \npassed in the first place. Why it was passed in the first place--mining \nis very, very risky. I can't go to Appropriations and appropriate money \njust to go out and scratch around the hills and try to find a gold \nnugget, because it just will not happen.\n  So I will oppose the Bumpers amendment tomorrow. I think there will \nbe a point of order raised on it anyway. But, nonetheless, let's not \nforget just exactly the reason the mining act was passed and why it \nworks today, just like it did when it was passed 120 years ago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       electric utility industry\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the utility industry is undergoing \ndrastic change as a result of deregulation.\n  I know that municipal utilities are concerned about the tax-exempt \nstatus of their outstanding debt if they enter the competitive market. \nI also know that investor-owned utilities are concerned about municipal \nutilities using their tax-exempt debt and their tax-exempt status to \ngain an unfair competitive advantage. In addition, there are a host of \nissues relating to how electric cooperatives will fare in the emerging \ncompetitive marketplace.\n  I believe that we need to re-examine the Tax Code to determine how \nbest to ensure a level playing field in the era of electricity \nderegulation and competition.\n  Because of the importance of this issue to consumers, investors, the \nelectric power industry, and to our economy, as I told Treasury \nSecretary Rubin in an April 22 letter, I believe this is a matter for \nCongress, not the IRS, to decide.\n  Mr. ROTH. How does the chairman of the Energy Committee suggest we \nproceed?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have asked the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to prepare a complete analysis of tax provisions relevant to \nthe electric utility industry. Once this report has been prepared, I \nbelieve our committees should hold hearings and make recommendations \nonce we have\n\n[[Page S6356]]\n\nhad a chance to thoroughly examine these issues.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I agree with the suggestion of the chairman \nof the Energy Committee.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and I look forward to working with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6344-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending June 20, the U.S. imported 7,630,000 barrels \nof oil each day, 301,000 barrels fewer than the 7,931,000 imported each \nday during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the very few weeks that Americans imported less \noil than the same week a year ago, Americans relied on foreign oil for \n54.4 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the \nupward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United \nStates obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign \ncountries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil \naccounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By \nU.S. producers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.--now \n7,630,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6356-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last year, I stated on the Senate floor \nthat ``our country stands at a crossroads on the path it travels in \nrelations among the different races and ethnic groups that make up the \nAmerican people. Down one path is the way of mutual understanding and \ngoodwill; the way of equal opportunity for individuals; the way of \nseriously and persistently addressing our various social problems as \nAmerica's problems. * * * Down the other path is the way of mutual \nsuspicion, fear, ill will, and indifference; the way of group rights \nand group preferences.''\n  I am proud to stand today with my colleagues in the House and the \nSenate, and others who have worked so hard for the cause of \nopportunity, to announce the introduction of the Civil Rights Act of \n1997. The act represents our best efforts to recommit the nation to the \nideal of equal opportunity for every American--to emphasize that we \nmust resist the temptation to define the nation's problems in narrow \nracial terms, and rather must roll up our sleeves and begin the hard \nwork of dealing with our problems as Americans, and as fellow human \nbeings.\n  Of course, our critics will imply that those of us who today reject \ndivisive racial preferences and distinctions do so because we \nunderestimate the social, economic, and discriminatory obstacles some \nAmericans face. President Clinton, for example, told his audience in \nSan Diego last week that ``[t]he vast majority of [Californians who \nsupported that state's Proposition 209] did it with a conviction that \ndiscrimination and isolation are no longer barriers to achievement.'' \nBut that is just plain wrong.\n  To the contrary, last week in the Senate Judiciary Committee we heard \nfrom a panel of ordinary citizens who movingly told us of their \nexperiences with discrimination in America. Among them was a Chinese-\nAmerican mother from San Francisco, Charlene Loen, who told us how her \nyoung son Patrick was denied admission to an elite public magnet \nschool, Lowell High School, because he is Chinese. The school \ndistrict's efforts to ensure diversity among its students led it to \nemploy a system of racial preference that had the effect of capping \nChinese enrollment in many of its schools, forcing Chinese children to \nscore much higher on entrance exams than children of other races. At \nvirtually every public school Ms. Loen approached, she was first asked \nwhether Patrick was Chinese, and when learning that he was, would \ninform Ms. Loen that Patrick need not apply. The Chinese quota was in \neffect full. Ladies and gentlemen, that is not the promise of America.\n  There should be no question that discrimination indeed continues to \ndeny opportunities to too many Americans. At the Judiciary Committee's \nrecent hearing we heard from black Americans, white Americans, Asian \nAmericans, and even a victim of an outrageous hate crime. But the \nquestion that we all must answer is whether one American's racial \nsuffering should be valued above another's. It is a question that will \nonly become more complicated and more urgent as our population grows \never more diverse.\n  As we in the Judiciary Committee now know, when we prefer individuals \nof one race, we must by definition discriminate against individuals of \nanother. But America's great social divide can never be crossed until \nwe begin the work of building a bridge of racial reconciliation. By \nsaying today, with the introduction of this act, that the Federal \nGovernment stands for the principle that racial discrimination in all \nits forms is wrong, we hope to take a small step forward on the path to \nhealing the nation's racial wounds by recognizing that every American \nis equal before the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6356-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6356-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6356-S6357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:44 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nHouse:\n\n       H.R. 1316.

A bill to amend section 7(m) of the Small Business Act to \nestablish a Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program; to the Committee \non Small Business.\n\n\n        The Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate referral.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Welfare-to-Work \nMicroloan Pilot Program Act of 1997, and I do so with Senators Bumpers, \nHarkin, Grassley, Landrieu, Cleland, Lieberman, Wellstone, Levin, \nSnowe, and Lautenberg. I thank and congratulate all of them for their \ncommitment to this important program. This legislation will assure that \nAmericans who have had to rely on public assistance have the same \nopportunities as other Americans to start and operate a small business.\n  Mr. President, America is the home of the entrepreneurial frontier. \nHere, anyone can explore boundless opportunities to try new things, to \nbegin again, and to build new lives. Americans have inherited \ncharacteristics from the frontiersmen--embracing risk, change, and \nindividualism--and applied it directly to starting and expanding \nAmerican small businesses. As the ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee and a Senator from Massachusetts, I am honored to represent a \nState that employs more and more people and continues to fuel the \nnational economy and job market. Massachusetts' 360,000 small firms are \nemploying over 50 percent of our workers. From 1991 to 1995, all \nAmerican businesses with fewer than 500 employees created 11 million \nnew jobs, while businesses with more than 500 employees cut three \nmillion jobs overall.\n  I want to open the entrepreneurial frontier to all Americans who want \nto leave the welfare system behind and build new lives for themselves \nand their children.\n  The Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program is geared to assist \npeople in moving people from welfare into the work force, not just as \nworkers but as entrepreneurs. It is more than a jobs bill. It will not \nonly build businesses, but it will build communities. This bill builds \non the foundation of the SBA's remarkable Microloan Program which \nallows businesses and startup companies to receive development \ncounseling and small loans of up to $25,000. The average microloan size \nis only $10,800. Under the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot Program \nlocal organizations will serve welfare recipients by using SBA grants \nfor intensive business development assistance. In addition, the bill \nwill allow local organizations to help future business owners overcome \ntwo of the greatest obstacles that they have, access to affordable \ntransportation and convenient child care.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation--to \nassure that the American dream can be realized by all Americans and \nfuture generations. We must build a system now that will help our \nchildren. One in five of America's children--14.3 million--live in \npoverty. Two-thirds of welfare recipients are children. If we want to \nlift them up and out of poverty, we must give them new opportunities to \nexplore and benefit from the resources of America's frontier. We must \nact now to provide their parents and guardians with a map across the \nentrepreneurial frontier.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that this type of program has already \nworked, and I just want to share a couple of quick examples with you. \nOne of the people who has already received this type of grant under the \nMicroloan Pilot Project is Karla Brown, owner of Ashmont Flowers Plus \nin Boston. In 1990, she found herself divorced with a young daughter, a \nmountain of debt, bad credit and unemployed as a result of major \nsurgery. After being on disability for 3 years, she decided to start \nher own business. In 1993, she started selling flowers at a subway \nstation. As the business grew, she leveraged the resources of local \norganizations, developed a business plan, received an SBA funded \nMicroloan, and opened a store in Codman Square, a critical commercial \nnode in a low-income neighborhood in Boston. With a $19,000 loan from \nthe Jewish Vocational Service in Boston and a tremendous commitment to \nbecome a successful entrepreneur, she is now the proud owner of a \nbusiness that has annual sales of $100,000 and employs two people part-\ntime. Karla Brown's big idea of a flower shop was one of many new \nbusinesses applauded by an article entitled ``SBA Microloans Fuel Big \nIdeas'' in a recent issue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's magazine.\n  Karla is joined by others on this entrepreneurial frontier. In 1995, \nthe Western Massachusetts Enterprise Fund made a loan of less than \n$10,000 to a divorced, single mother who was receiving public \nassistance. The woman believed in her own skills as a hairdresser and \nher own personal efforts. With the help of her community organization, \nshe developed a marketing plan, targeted special underserved markets--\nhomebound elderly, group home residents' and disabled people--and, in \njust 2 years, she is now busy with appointments all day long and has \nnever missed a loan payment. In fact, under the SBA's Microloan \nProgram, the Government has not lost one dime in the 6 years of \noperation because loan repayment rates are so high. The reason this \nprogram is so successful is because the SBA provides grants for \ntechnical assistance for the loan recipients and helps to make certain \nthat these ventures are successful.\n\n  Another Massachusetts organization, Jobs for Fall River, Inc., saw \nthe potential in a 35-year-old woman who was relying on welfare while \ncaring for her elderly mother and her young son. She wanted to start a \nbusiness to design clothing. Her first attempt at the enterprise failed \nbecause she was not able to afford the child care, transportation \ncosts, and operating costs for running the business without a loan. \nHowever, after attending an 8-week intensive training session, she was \nable, through the assistance of Jobs for Fall River and SBA-provided \nfunding, to develop a business plan and receive a loan in May of 1996.\n  We can open the entrepreneurial frontier for more Americans on public \nassistance with the Welfare to Work Microloan Pilot Program--partnering \nthe resources of the SBA with local organizations like the Western \nMassachusetts Enterprise Fund, Jobs for Fall River, and the Jewish \nVocation Services in Boston.\n  During a recent hearing before the Small Business Committee, an \ninspiring witness from Iowa, Mr. John Else of the Institute of Social \nand Economic Development, told of the successes his organization is \nworking with welfare recipients under the SBA Microloan Program. \nIndividuals in their program have a business success rate that is three \ntimes higher than the average for new businesses. His testament, \ncombined with the requests of other local organizations for more \nflexibility to help this community, convinced me that we need to expand \nthe success of this program.\n  Opening the frontier for more small businesses is critical to \nachieving the aims of welfare reform. States are now facing tall goals \nto reduce the welfare roles--their caseloads must be reduced by 25 \npercent this year under the new law. The growth in job creation is \ndirectly parallel to the growth in small businesses. In America today, \nthere are over 22 million small businesses compared with only 14,000 \nbig businesses. We see more women than ever exploring the \nentrepreneurial frontier. Women-owned businesses represent one-third of \nall U.S. companies, contribute more than $1.5 trillion in sales to the \nU.S. economy, and employ more people than the Fortune 500. Women-owned \nsole proprietorships have a start-up rate twice that of male-owned\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\nbusinesses. It is important for us to help women move into \nentrepreneurial roles because women comprise a large share of welfare \nroles. I suggest that the program I am introducing today is an \nexcellent way to move people from welfare into the marketplace, not \njust as workers and wage earners, but as business creators, as people \nwho will be able to provide jobs for other people as well as gain their \nown self-sufficiency.\n  Because the record shows that during the 6 years of the Microloan \npilot project the Federal Government has not suffered one loss, we \nought to be prepared to replicate these results with programs that \ncreate more jobs and enhance the economy. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this effort.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to express support for the Welfare-\nto-Work Microloan Pilot Program Act of 1997. The existing Small \nBusiness Administration [SBA] Microloan Program has enjoyed great \nsuccess in moving people off welfare and helping them start their own \nbusiness. The welfare-to-work initiative will not only continue this \nsuccess, but it will also improve the services provided by the current \nMicroloan Program.\n  The existing Microloan Program has two components. First, it works to \nprovide short-term loans of up to $25,000 to small businesses. SBA \nmakes these loans through various nonprofit organizations that have \nclose ties to their communities. Second, the Microloan Program also \nprovides technical assistance to help clients learn important skills \nsuch as accounting, marketing, and advertising.\n  It is important that we continue the Microloan Program, and we must \nalso look to implement other services that will make it more effective. \nThe welfare-to-work initiative does just that by establishing a 3-year \nprogram that will continue and expand upon the existing program. Like \nthe current law, this bill will extend loans and technical assistance, \nbut it will also allow for more business planning and training \nassistance prior to extending loans to welfare recipients. It will also \nallow intermediaries to use supplemental grants to help borrowers with \ntransportation and child care expenses. Extending these services is \nessential in order to allow welfare recipients who don't have the money \nfor transportation and child care to participate in the program.\n  An example of the Microloan Program's success is the Institute for \nSocial and Economic Development [ISED] in Iowa City, IA. ISED is \ndifferent from most development corporations in the Microloan Program \nbecause it does not extend loans to its clients. Rather, it provides \ntechnical assistance and will act as an intermediary to set up a loan \nbetween their client and a bank. ISED's technical assistance program \nprovides structured training in which clients develop plans for a \nprofitable business. Due to this effort, ISED has enjoyed an extremely \nhigh success rate, with 70 percent of its client's businesses still \noperational. This statistic becomes even more impressive considering \nthat of all the small businesses started across the Nation in the last \n8 years over 70 percent no longer exist.\n  We must recognize that the welfare-to-work initiative benefits both \nwelfare recipients and our taxpayers. The Microloan Program presents \nwelfare recipients with the preferable option of self-employment as a \nmeans to move off welfare. At the same time, it saves the State money \nand moves people from being welfare recipients to taxpayers. In Iowa, \nnearly 400 welfare recipients have started and maintained their own \nsmall business, and the total savings to the State have been $1 million \nin welfare benefits alone.\n  The welfare-to-work initiative gives welfare recipients the \nopportunity to be self-sufficient. It provides the entrepreneur with \nthe money to start a business, and the skills and services to maintain \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bond, Mr. Mack, \n        and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 957. A bill to establish a Pension ProSave system which improves \nthe retirement income security of millions of American workers by \nencouraging employers to make pension contributions on behalf of \nemployees, by facilitating pension portability, by perserving and \nincreasing retirement savings, and by simplifying pension law; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n     The Retirement Security for all Americans Pension Pro-Save Act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the problem of retirement security is an \never mounting challenge to the future welfare of our Nation. More than \n51 million Americans are not covered by any kind of pension plan. The \naging of the baby boom generation will dramatically increase the \nretired population in proportion to the working population early in the \nnext century. By the year 2029, when the youngest baby boomers reach \nage 65, more than 68 million persons will be older than 65--accounting \nfor more than 20 percent of the U.S. population, compared to just 12 \npercent today.\n  In my own State of New Mexico just 29 percent of our work force has \nsome kind of pension plan. As this chart shows, New Mexico has the \nworst ranking in the nation in terms of workers covered by pensions. \nJust a few states have private sector working populations with over 50 \npercent covered by pensions.\n  Our Nation is facing certain crisis if we fail to take steps to \ncorrect this problem of people working until retirement--and finding \nthat their Social Security benefits fail to maintain adequate and \nacceptable living standards. Despite the proliferation of retirement \nproducts in various forms of IRA's and 401(K) plans, patterns clearly \nshow that those who earn enough to save probably do. Our problem is \nthat over the last 18 years, we have had no increase in the percentage \nof our work force that is participating in a qualified pension program.\n  Those who are well off and can look forward to retirement security \ncannot afford to just abandon those who are not. We have a market \nfailure that we must address, particularly as the Nation's traditional \nsafety net is being rolled back because of budget cuts on so many other \nfronts. I am not opposed to improving and even expanding the pension \nplans of those who have them now. My concerns, however, are focused on \nthe reality that we are improving existing pension plans, expanding IRA \nopportunities and creating new forms of individual retirement accounts, \nbut we are still doing absolutely nothing to get a large portion of our \nuncovered work force covered by some degree of retirement savings.\n  The costs of doing what we need to do will be large. But let's think \nfor a moment about the IRA provisions in the tax bill we are discussing \ntoday. The IRA expansion provisions in the Senate version of the bill \ncost approximately $3.3 billion during the first 5 years and $20.5 \nbillion in the following 5 years. These costs may be appropriate and \nnecessary--but at the same time, we need to confront the revenue impact \nof covering the parts of our society that currently have no retirement \nsavings at all. I think that it is poor public policy to expand only \none-half of the equation like we have been doing.\n  Mr. President, in order to ensure that this Congress does face the \nissue of retirement security for all working Americans and not just the \nfortunate minority who are saving, I am here to introduce the \n``Retirement Security for All Americans Pension Pro-Save Act.''\n  The bill I am introducing outlines a concept for pension expansion \nand portability that has been discussed in this Chamber several times \nover the last several decades but which has not evolved until now as \nlegislation. The Pension ProSave System, a clearinghouse for individual \npension accounts, would improve the retirement income security of \nmillions of working Americans by encouraging employees to make \ncontributions on their behalf, by facilitating pension portability, by \npreserving and significantly increasing retirement savings and by \nsimplifying pension law.\n\n  Mr. President, this plan is not aimed at the existing pension and \nsavings structures in this country. This proposal targets those who are \nworking their way towards retirement--and will have little or nothing \nto supplement their Social Security benefits. Despite 18 years of \navailability of simplified pension plans, pension coverage remains low \nin the small business sector. Even when covered by a tax-advantaged \npension plan, workers do not always continue to save their pension \nassets when they can receive them when\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nmoving from one place of employment to another. Tax penalties \nunfortunately have not been very successful in discouraging the \nspending of these mid-career retirement savings disbursements. Of the \n$47.9 billion in pre-retirement distributions made in 1990, less than \n20% of recipients reported putting the entire distribution into another \ntax-qualified retirement plan.\n  The Pension ProSave Clearinghouse is modeled after the highly \nsuccessful Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College \nRetirement Equity Fund [TIAA-CREF], the largest private pension system \nin the world with assets over $136 billion and about 1.7 million \nparticipants at about 5,500 institutions. Not replacing existing \npension programs, Pension ProSave is designed to supplement these other \nprograms and will increase pension coverage to millions of Americans.\n  The benefits of Pension ProSave are first, that this plan would \nprovide an incentive and a simple, hassle free way for employers to \nprovide portable pension benefits to their workers. Employees could \nalso make matching contributions to their accounts on a 2:1 basis to a \nmaximum of $6,000. The employer's contributions also would not exceed \n$6,000. Mr. President, I want to emphasize that these are the \nemployee's accounts--not the government's and not the employer's. These \naccounts will remain with those workers the duration of their lives.\n  Second, Pension ProSave would stop the leakage of retirement savings \nby furnishing employer's pension contributions into a privately \nmanaged, pension portability clearinghouse. Worker's account balances \nwould be invested and managed by private sector firms in diversified \nportfolios.\n  Let me explain how Pension ProSave would work. Any employer wishing \nto take advantage of the Pension ProSave Program would furnish the \nnames of all employees, employed for at least 6 months and over 21 \nyears of age, to the ProSave Portability Clearinghouse established in \nthis Act. The employer will indicate each employee's salary and the \nuniform percentage of all salaries which the employer will contribute \nto employee ProSave accounts. The employer will have the option of \nchanging its percentage contribution each year, as long as \nthat contribution equals at least 1 percent. This can help business \nowners--who want to provide pension benefits to their employees--avoid \ngetting locked into a rate that remains fixed while the economic \nperformance of their small businesses may be volatile.\n\n  Once a ProSave account is established for an employee, the employer \nwill forward contributions to the account at the time of each paycheck \nor at least prior to the end of that year.\n  With the agreement of the employee, an employer who has another \ndefined benefit or defined contribution plan for its employees and who \ndoes not choose to establish ProSave accounts will still be able to use \nthe portability clearinghouse as a repository for retirement funds of \nan employee who is leaving its employ. When a worker leaves one job \nwhere retirement benefits have accrued, the employee may request the \nemployer to deposit the cash value of those retirement benefits--or any \nportion of them--in the Pro Save account of the employee at the \nportability clearinghouse.\n  Mr. President, the funds contributed by an employer to the retirement \nsecurity of his or her employees by way of a ProSave account will \nremain there and be invested at the direction of the employee until \nretirement. The portability clearinghouse will contract with investment \nfirms to manage funds through the clearinghouse. Investment options \nwould include a fixed income fund, an equity fund, a government \nsecurities fund, small business capitalization fund, an international \nfund, and an infrastructure fund. Accounts would be valued on a daily \nbasis, and participants could transfer funds among investment accounts \nat intervals determined by an oversight board, perhaps at monthly or \nquarterly intervals. Employers will have no responsibility for \nadministering a pension fund or managing funds for employees who have \nleft their employment. This should be very attractive to businesses \nthat do not desire to carry long-term responsibilities for workers who \nhave moved on.\n  While employer contributions are locked into the Pension ProSave \naccounts until retirement, funds contributed by the employee are \navailable to be loaned for certain purposes and under terms established \nby the Portability Clearinghouse Board.\n  At retirement, account balances would be paid out either in the form \nof an annuity--with survivor benefits--or a lump sum retirement. \nSpousal consent would be required.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that some who oppose this plan will \nrattle the cages and make claims that this act is nothing but more big \nGovernment, another bureaucratic institution that spreads the \nGovernment further into our lives. These claims will be wrong--and will \nonly serve to help maintain an economic reality that permits those best \noff in our society to save up to $30,000 a year on a tax-advantaged \nbasis. Others in simple 401(k) plans can save up to $9,500 a year. It \nis unacceptable that workers who don't have an available pension plan--\ncan only save $2,000 a year in IRA accounts.\n  We have a responsibility not only to create a more equitable savings \nstructure for those Americans who have the desire and wherewithal to \nsave--but also to the many Americans who are low-income workers who \nmove from job to job eventually to retirement, finding then that \nnothing has accrued to help them in their retirement years.\n  Government had a role in establishing IRA's and 401(k)'s. Now we must \ndo what we can to provide incentives to employers to provide modest \nretirement security for more employees. This plan is an enabler--it \ncreates a structure, similar in many ways to the TIAA-CREF model \nestablished at the beginning of this century by Andrew Carnegie to \nprovide pension portability for professors and university employees \nmoving between one higher education institution and another.\n  This is an issue in which the Government does have an important role \nto play because the market has failed to provide the extension of \npension coverage to 51 million Americans. Pension ProSave promotes \nsavings, helps more people reach retirement with pensions, helps buffer \nagainst the turbulence of the economy, and provides many employers with \na good vehicle for profit-sharing. All of these are benefits for our \nNation as a whole.\n  For the employer, Pension ProSave provides a hassle-free, no red-tape \nway to make contributions to a pension--and frees employers from the \nresponsibility and requirement of administering a pension plan.\n  The plan also increases the amount of the tax-deferred savings \npermitted for the employer and each employee. It gives the employer a \nvehicle for profit-sharing, and the employer escapes any and all \nresponsibility for the employee's pension. Funds contributed to Pension \nProSave will be exempt from other savings limits under current law for \nother pension products. This should provide a powerful incentive to \nowners of small businesses who can save more themselves if they make \nequivalent commitments to their employees.\n  For the employee, the benefits are most importantly that millions of \npension-uncovered workers in this country will get coverage. This plan \nincreases the amount of tax-deferred savings permitted to each \nemployee, provides immediate vesting, and removes the concern that \nemployees might have about the solvency of pension plans or their \nprevious employers. Among other benefits, Pension ProSave eliminates \npolitical corruption in the administration of pension funds and \nprovides one account that can be permanently maintained and in which \nfunds can continually accrue no matter the number of job changes in a \nworker's career.\n  By having national visibility, Pension ProSave would make the concept \nof saving for retirement more attractive and appealing to employees. \nThis plan would increase employer pension contributions on behalf of \ntheir workers without existing pension plans, rather than relying on \n401(k) plans that are funded largely by employees' voluntary saving \ndecisions. Employers would be able to make voluntary, tax-deductible \ncontributions on behalf of their workers and would have flexibility in \nthe amount they contribute each year.\n  Vesting would be immediate. Plan sponsors would be relieved of the \nexpense and responsibility of providing financial education to their \nemployees\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\nand the legal implications of providing investment options.\n  Mr. President, I think that one cause of the extraordinary economic \nanxiety in our Nation is related to the eroding sense of financial \nsecurity at retirement. A recent study of workers' views of their \npresent and future economic circumstances found that most people \nbelieve that despite the twists, turns, and pitfalls in our rapidly \nchanging economy, they can chart a successful course to retirement. But \ntheir anxiety levels were extremely high when concerns about the \nsolvency of Social Security and about the great number of Americans \nwithout pension benefits were mentioned.\n  Americans include retirement security in their personal strategies \nfor economic success. I believe that America is calling for a credible \nproposal that will get more of our citizens covered by some kind of \npensions.\n  There is no doubt that the costs will be high and will impact the \nNation's short term tax revenue. However, it is also clear that \nincreasing retirement savings will help bolster national savings, which \nwill help spur more long-term investment and economic growth. The high \ncost of this plan would be true of any plan that succeeds in \nestablishing more retirement security for our working population. We \nseem to be willing to sustain high costs for expanding retirement \nopportunities for some; I just think we need to make sure that we are \ndoing whatever we can to provide retirement savings coverage to the \nrest of society.\n  These are costs that we must consider and should bear--for the long \nterm benefit of our Nation in whole. Establishing Pension Pro-Save \naccounts is an investment that will help our Nation better able to cope \nwith the retirement savings crisis that we will certainly face in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Pension ProSave Act with Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. \nSenator Bingaman has done yeoman's work in drafting this bill. I hope \nmy colleagues will take time to read the bill and join us as \ncosponsors.\n  As the average age of Americans is rising at a steady rate, we all \nhave become more aware of the importance of retirement programs and \nretirement security. At the same time, only about half of all workers \nare covered by a retirement program--and of those, many who are \ncovered, work for a Federal, State, or local government entity. An \nincredible 87 percent of workers employed by small businesses, those \nwith fewer than 20 employees, have no private retirement or pension \ncoverage. Less than 40 percent of the 33 million Americans aged 65 and \nolder collect a pension, other than Social Security. These numbers are \ncause for concern.\n  There are three sources for retirement security: Social Security, \npersonal savings and a pension. Our bill has been offered in an effort \nto expand pension coverage, especially among small business \nestablishments where coverage and participation is least likely to \noccur. The complexity and expense involved in setting up a pension plan \nis daunting. It is outside the grasp of many small businesses. In \naddition to administrative complexity and the cost of hiring an \nactuary, accountant and a lawyer to set up a plan, a small business \noften decides against plan sponsorship because of laws and regulations \nthat actually discriminate against them, such as the prohibition on \nmatching contributions for self-employed individuals, or limitations on \ncontributions for small plans that are even lower than those permitted \nfor the medium-sized or large pension plan.\n  Pension ProSave would permit the establishment of either a simplified \ndefined contribution or a defined benefit pension plan or both, with \ngreatly reduced recordkeeping, reporting and regulatory requirements. \nThe ProSave system encourages thrift, through its defined contribution \nprovisions, which are individual account plans and similar in concept \nto an IRA or a 401(k) plan, and through its simplified defined benefit \nplan provisions which are traditional pension plans promising a \nspecific benefit payment upon retirement.\n  In addition, one of the most appealing features of Pension ProSave is \nthe portability clearinghouse. The clearinghouse would make it easier \nfor workers with ProSave accounts to take their pensions with them as \nthey change jobs. True pension portability has been a most elusive \nobjective for policymakers and yet it is one of the most important \nfeatures that Americans want in pension programs.\n  A lack of portability also discourages long-term pension savings \nbecause it can encourage leakage. Pension system leakage occurs when a \nworker changes jobs and either cashes out a pension benefit or receives \na lump sum distribution from a retirement plan and spends the money, \nrather than saving it. Taxing distributions has not stopped leakage \nfrom the system. The more difficult it is for that worker to transfer \nhis account from one plan to another, the more likely it is that the \nworker will just spend the money. The more complicated and punitive the \nlaws and regulations surrounding pension rollovers, the less likely a \nworker is to bother to make one. He or she will simply pay the penalty \ntax and spend the money.\n  Consequently, pension experts have spent a great deal of time and \neffort trying to figure out ways to ease these pension rollovers and \novercome obstacles to portability so that people can save their all \nretirement money in a single account.\n  Let me pause for a moment to say that while Pension ProSave's \nportability feature is the result of many years of consultation and \ncareful drafting, we realize that it would be quite difficult to \njustify a new government sponsored entity in these days of fiscal \nstringency. Our experience with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. \nleads me to suggest that there could be a more efficient means of \nmaking Pension ProSave accounts portable than by establishing a new \ngovernment sponsored entity to manage and invest them.\n  Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable and yet can be \ninvested in banks, certificates of deposit, mutual funds, equities or \nany number of other investment vehicles. Should we permit Pension \nProSave accounts to be managed and invested in the private sector and \nif so, how should that be accomplished? By leveraging the power of the \nprivate sector, savers have the potential for more investment choices, \nand for higher rates of return on their investments. In addition, there \ncurrently exists in the private sector, mutual fund/401(k) \nclearinghouses which are used to track individual accounts and keep \nrecords of investments and account balances. Are these models for the \nPension ProSave clearinghouse?\n  I look forward to hearing about these and other substantive and \ndrafting issues from experts who are concerned about increasing \nretirement savings at the individual level and in increasing retirement \ncoverage among small businesses where it is needed the most. I am \nespecially interested in the concept of a simplified defined benefit \nplan which is portable and hope that we can explore that issue when \nhearings are held on this bill in the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee. Pension ProSave Act is a good bill. I am proud to cosponsor \nit and thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership in bringing us \ntogether to introduce it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 958. A bill to provide for the redesignation of a portion of State \nRoute 17 in New York and Pennsylvania as Interstate Route 86; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       The Redesignation of Route 17 as Interstate 86 Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \nfellow Senator from New York to introduce legislation that will \nredesignate sections of New York and Pennsylvania Route 17 as \nInterstate 86. The southern tier of New York has waited over 40 years \nfor this historic legislation that will correct a mistake made in 1955 \nthat has contributed to the economic decline of this once prosperous \nregion.\n  When the original plans were being developed for the New York \nInterstate System, Route 17 was to be designated the main east-west \ninterstate route. The (Federal) Bureau of Public Roads thought \notherwise. They preferred the New York State Thruway which was already \nunder construction using state moneys. Albany did not object nor did \nrepresentatives of the region.\n  The error had no significance at the time, since no special funding \nwas\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\navailable for interstates. The very next year, however, the Federal-Aid \nHighway Act of 1956 was enacted, creating a Highway Trust Fund to be \nfunded through gasoline taxes. The Federal Government would now pay 90 \npercent of the cost of any interstate segment. The Southern Tier \nExpressway--Route 17--was not eligible for those interstate funds.\n  In the 1950's the region was still bustling--IBM was in Binghamton, \nhalf the television sets in the world were built in Elmira, Corning was \na high tech contender, and Jamestown was a major manufacturing center. \nWhat begun as an Indian trail, became a great railroad, and a \nstrikingly creative industrial corridor, was allowed to languish.\n  It is time we do something about it.\n  This legislation we introduce today would finally ameliorate the \nlegacy of an opportunity missed long ago.\n  The bill would immediately designate 360 miles of Route 17 between \nErie, PA and Harriman, NY, that meet Federal interstate construction \nstandards as Interstate 86, creating connections to I-90, I-390, I-81, \nI-84, and I-87. The remaining 30 miles of Route 17 would be designated \nas a future part of the interstate system and will become I-86 as soon \nas the State Department of Transportation upgrades them. I am confident \nthe NYDOT, working together with the Federal Highway Administration, \nwill soon have the rest of Route 17 up to interstate standards.\n  The southern tier region, along with the rest of Upstate New York, \nhas suffered enduring economic hardship and job losses, even as the \nnational economy has boomed. The bill I propose to redesignate Route 17 \nas I-86 would help enhance the visibility of this important region and \nhighlight its potential for business development and tourism.\n  I would also like to recognize the efforts of Samara Barend, a \nsouthern tier native, who was so effective in mobilizing support for \nthis issue. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this \nmost important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 958\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the designation of a portion of State Route 17 in New \n     York and Pennsylvania as an Interstate route would promote \n     the visibility of the region, the potential of the region for \n     business development and tourism, and the economic regrowth \n     of the region; and\n       (2) a major portion of State Route 17 is a logical addition \n     to the Interstate System and will provide an east-west \n     interstate highway that benefits a large region of New York \n     and Pennsylvania that has suffered competitively from the \n     lack of such a highway.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF PORTION OF STATE ROUTE 17 IN NEW YORK \n                   AND PENNSYLVANIA AS INTERSTATE ROUTE 86.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b)(2), the portion \n     of State Route 17 located between the junction of State Route \n     17 and Interstate Route 87 in Harriman, New York, and the \n     junction of State Route 17 and Interstate Route 90 near Erie, \n     Pennsylvania, is designated as Interstate Route 86.\n       (b) Substandard Features.--\n       (1) Upgrading.--Each segment of State Route 17 described in \n     subject (a) that does not substantially meet the Interstate \n     System design standards under section 109(b) of title 23, \n     United States Code, in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act shall be upgraded in accordance with plans and \n     schedules developed by the applicable State.\n       (2) Designation.--Each segment of State Route 17 that on \n     the date of enactment of this Act is not at least 4 lanes \n     wide, separated by a median, and grade-separated shall--\n       (A) be designated as a future part of the Interstate \n     System; and\n       (B) become part of Interstate Route 86 at such time as the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines that the segment \n     substantially meets the Interstate System design standards \n     described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Treatment of Route.--\n       (1) Mileage limitation.--The mileage of Interstate Route 86 \n     designated under subsection (a) shall not be charged against \n     the limitation established by the first sentence of section \n     103(e)(1) of title 23, United States Code.\n       (2) Federal financing responsibility--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the \n     designation of Interstate Route 86 under subsection (a) shall \n     not create increased Federal financial responsibility with \n     respect to the designated Route.\n       (B) Use of certain funds.--A State may use funds available \n     to the State under paragraphs (1) and (5)(B) of section \n     104(b) of title 23, United States Code, to eliminate \n     substandard features, and to resurface, restore, \n     rehabilitate, or reconstruct, any portion of the designated \n     Route.\n\n       By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 959. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto prohibit the sale or transfer of a firearm to, or the possession if \na firearm by, any person who is introxicated; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                   THE NO GUNS FOR DRUNKS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprohibit firearm sales to, and possession by, individuals who are \nobviously intoxicated.\n  Mr. President, a casual observer might think that this legislation is \nnot necessary. Most Americans probably think that it is already illegal \nto sell a gun to a visibly intoxicated person. At the very least, the \naverage citizen likely believes that it is only common sense that a gun \ndealer would never sell a gun to a drunk customer. Unfortunately, \nneither assumption is correct. Some gun dealers do sell guns and \nammunition to visibly intoxicated persons. My bill will deter these \nsales, and punishes those who persist in making such dangerous sales.\n  Federal and state laws currently prohibit the sale of alcohol to \nobviously drunk individuals, to protect both the intoxicated individual \nand others. Likewise, it is against the law for intoxicated persons to \noperate a motor vehicle. Unbelievably, it is not against Federal law to \nsell a firearm to a visibly intoxicated individual, or for an \nintoxicated person to possess a firearm.\n  Worse still, Mr. President, some firearms dealers simply ignore \ncommon sense and sell guns and ammunition to any customers if they are \nclearly intoxicated. The absence of a legal prohibition on such sales \nallows these gun dealers to escape liability for the absolutely tragic, \nand foreseeable, consequences of such outrageous conduct.\n  For instance, Deborah Kitchen, a mother of five children, is now a \nquadriplegic after being shot by her ex-boyfriend with a rifle he had \npurchased from a Florida K mart. This man was so drunk when he \npurchased the rifle that the store clerk had to fill out the Federal \nfirearm purchase form on his behalf. By his own admission, the ex-\nboyfriend had consumed a fifth of whisky and a case of beer the day he \nshot Ms. Kitchen. Nevertheless, the store sold him a .22 caliber bolt \naction rifle and a box of bullets. He then used these to paralyze Ms. \nKitchen from the neck down.\n  Ms. Kitchen sued the K mart for it's outrageous conduct. A jury found \nthe store liable of common law negligence, and returned a verdict in \nthe amount of $12 million. A Florida appeals court overturned the \njury's verdict, citing the lack of statutory prohibition on the sale of \nfirearms to intoxicated persons.\n  Or, Mr. President, consider the case of Anthony Buczkowski, who \nsuffered severe injury after being shot by a drunken ammunition \npurchaser. William McKay stumbled into a Michigan K mart store after a \nday-long drinking spree. Although obviously drunk and an admitted \n``mess'', he was still sold a box of shotgun shells. He later used this \nammunition to shoot Mr. Buczkowski. Although the trial court entered a \njudgment against K mart for the damages suffered by Mr. Buczkowski, the \nMichigan Supreme Court reversed, citing a lack of legal prohibition for \nsuch sales.\n  Unfortunately, common sense and a sense of civic obligation have not \nbeen sufficient enough to deter these sales. Perhaps the threat of \ncriminal and civil liability will do the job. Mr. President, it is my \nfervent hope that this legislation, if enacted, will end any future \nsales of guns and ammunition to intoxicated persons.\n  Mr. President, I do not claim that most licensed gun dealers do or \nwould sell guns or ammunition to intoxicated individuals. But the fact \nis that these sales do occur--and when they happen, the consequences \ncan be devastating.\n  Mr. President, our country now understands that alcohol and \nautomobiles are a deadly mix. Common sense, and heartbreaking \nexperience, tells us that alcohol and guns also do not mix. It is time \nthat our laws reflect this common sense notion.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat a\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\ncopy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission to direct that a portion of any civil \npenalty assessed by used to assist local communities; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 THE DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES SUPPORT ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp communities that suffer when nuclear power plants operate in an \nunsafe manner.\n  As most of my colleagues know, when the NRC discovers safety \nviolations at a nuclear power plant, it is authorized to fine that \nfacility for its transgressions, and these fines have been as high as \n$1.25 million. Under current law these fines go directly into the \nfederal treasury, with no allowances being made for the communities \nthat are home to these deficient nuclear power plants. When a nuclear \nfacility is poorly operated, it often creates severe safety, \nenvironmental, and economic concerns for surrounding communities. \nTherefore, it is only fair that those communities should receive a \nportion of any NRC fines to go toward addressing matters of local \nconcern. That is why I have introduced the Distressed Communities \nSupport Act.\n  This legislation is simple and straightforward--it would allow 50 \npercent of the fines levied by the NRC against nuclear facilities to be \nfunneled back to communities adversely affected by the plant's \nmismanagement.\n  The Distressed Communities Support Act would be extremely helpful to \ntowns adjacent to nuclear plants which may be trying to develop special \nhealth, safety, and environmental programs. More important, this bill \nwould help communities where the safety violations of the nuclear plant \nrequire that the plant be permanently shut down and decommissioned.\n  It is a fact that nuclear plants around the country are aging, making \nit increasingly difficult for many of them to meet safety standards and \nremain operational. Therefore, it is important that communities \nthroughout the country have increased access to resources to deal with \nproblems caused by negligent nuclear plants. In my home state of \nConnecticut, the time to help local communities is now.\n  The Connecticut Yankee nuclear plant in Haddam, Connecticut is in the \nbeginning stages of decommissioning. In light of numerous safety \nviolations, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the plant closed \nuntil these safety concerns were addressed. Then, in December of 1996, \nthe owners of Connecticut Yankee decided to permanently close the \nfacility. This decision came despite the fact that the license for the \nfacility was set to expire in 2007. While the owners of Connecticut \nYankee had chosen to permanently close the plant, the NRC continued its \nreview of the safety violations, and fined Connecticut Yankee $650,000.\n  This early decommissioning of this plant will have a dramatic impact \non Haddam and other surrounding towns. Connecticut Yankee was the \narea's largest employer and represented almost half of the tax base in \nthe town of Haddam--a town of just under 7,500 residents. It employed \nmore than 300 individuals. The sudden loss of tax revenue and jobs will \nhave a devastating impact on this area, and the town may well be forced \nto raise local taxes and make cuts in town services, including the \npublic schools.\n  In addition to the economic impact is the serious health and \nenvironmental impact of the way in which this facility was run. The \npeople of Haddam and surrounding towns are facing difficult days as \nthey contend with radioactive waste and related problems.\n  While local officials and residents are looking at innovative ways to \nrebuild their town's tax base, Haddam needs and clearly deserves \nfinancial assistance to get on the road to economic recovery. As we \nlook for ways to provide financial assistance for this community, it \nonly seems logical that some portion of the $650,000 in fines should go \ntoward helping these people.\n  It is even more fitting that a town like Haddam should receive some \nfederal assistance, because the federal government is partly \nresponsible for this town's problems. NRC Commissioner Shirley Jackson \nhas stated that the NRC failed to adequately regulate this plant to \nensure safety, and stricter monitoring could have prevented a number of \nthe problems that this plant has experienced. A recent GAO report \nreleased by Senator Lieberman details the failings of the NRC in \noverseeing CT Yankee and other plants.\n  In most every case where a nuclear power plant's negligence prompts a \nfine by the NRC, the communities surrounding the plant will feel some \nnegative repercussions. Therefore, I believe that a portion of these \nfines should be available to the affected communities.\n  While the Distressed Communities Support Act will not solve all of \nthe problems of towns like Haddam, Connecticut, it is a fair and simple \ninitiative that will provide relief to thousands of Americans.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 960\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act with respect \nto certain gaming practices on tribal lands held in trust by the \nSecretary of the Interior, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n                 the gambling clarification act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to reform \nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. There is, as I speak, a tribe that is \nattempting to move into the State of Missouri to build a large gambling \ncasino. I do not believe the tribe is entitled to build this casino \nunder the Indian gaming law, but while Secretary Babbitt has indicated \nhe would consider our views in making his decision, he may rule in \nfavor of the tribe and those who favor gambling. The only way to \nreverse his decision would be for Congress to change the law and I plan \nto start that process now.\n  As my colleagues know, Mr. President, the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct became law in 1988 to address the rapid growth of gambling on \nIndian tribal lands. The Supreme Court affirmed the sovereignty of \nIndian tribes and upheld their right to conduct gambling on their \ntribal lands, holding that such a right could only be abrogated by an \nact of Congress. Recognizing that it is the policy of the majority of \nthe States to prohibit or drastically regulate gambling and recognizing \nthat many of the citizens of these States regard gambling as morally \nrepugnant, Congress passed the Indian Gambling Regulatory Act.\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n  The intent of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is to balance tribal \nsovereignty with a State's interest in regulating and controlling \ngambling. The bill attempted to accomplish this by bringing parties to \na mutual table to work out an agreement for regulating gambling on \nreservations consistent with State policy. But the spirit of the \nlegislation is one of containment, to limit gambling and control its \ngrowth. IGRA pursues the objective by narrowly restricting the \ncircumstances by which gaming can be conducted on land acquired by \ntribes after the date of passage of the statute, October 17, 1988. \nHowever, like many pieces of regulation, unforeseen circumstances \narise, loopholes open and language proves to be too vague or obtusely \ndrafted. Such is the case with IGRA. My legislation does not attempt to \nreopen or rewrite the bill, but it does attempt to address some of the \nlegislative voids that affect my State and others.\n  A first step for a tribe to conduct gaming on Indian land is to \npetition the Secretary of the Interior to have land taken into trust, \nthis permits the tribe to benefit from the tax advantages afforded \nIndian tribes. While such trust petitions are under review by the \nSecretary, he is instructed to review the petition considering the best \ninterests of both the tribe and the surrounding community. Furthermore, \nwhile such a petition is under review, elected officials have an \nopportunity to confront the Secretary with any concerns regarding \ngambling on that land or any objections that community members may hold \nregarding gambling. The statute, however, does not require the tribe to \ndeclare to the Secretary that land will be used for gambling. \nFurthermore, there is nothing in the statute that would prohibit a \ntribe from representing to the local community and the Secretary that \nland will be used for an unobjectionable purpose, only to begin using \nthe land for gambling after it has been placed in trust.\n  My legislation will require a tribe that is planning to begin \nconducting gambling on newly acquired tribal land to inform the \nSecretary during the trust application process that the land in \nquestion will in fact be used for gambling. Tribes with land held in \ntrust that have not made such a declaration to the Secretary will be \nprohibited from using that land for gambling until such time as the \ntribe applies with the Secretary to have that land held in trust for \nthe specific purpose of gambling. I believe this language will \nencourage the tribes to be open and upfront regarding their gambling \nplans for the trust land and is in the best interests of communities to \nbe affected by gambling and in the best interests of the tribal-\ncommunity relations. Communities that have serious concerns with the \nintroduction of gambling to their neighborhoods will be given \nthe opportunity to register their concerns with their elected officials \nand with the Secretary of the Interior. Tribes will also be disinclined \nto misrepresent their intentions or engage in any deceptive tactics to \nacquire land to begin or expand their gambling operations, which will \ngo a long way to abating any suspicion between the tribes and the \nsurrounding communities.\n\n  This language also clarifies the language regarding tribes in the \nState of Oklahoma, a State where there is no tribal reservations, \nattempting to spread their gaming operations into a neighboring State. \nI believe such a practice was not foreseen by the original statute and \nis inconsistent with the spirit of that statute. Specifically, my \nlegislation will permit an Oklahoma tribe to expand their gaming \noperations into a neighboring state, but only when the tribe is located \nin that State and the gaming will be conducted within the boundaries of \na former reservation. My State is confronted with a situation where a \ntribe has purchased land reaching across the State border into Missouri \nand the tribe is attempting to use that recently purchased land to \nclaim residency in Missouri for the purpose of the statute. To me, that \nis exploiting the loose drafting of a statutory language. I do not \nbelieve the tribe is located in Missouri as contemplated by the statute \nand, therefore, is not entitled to bring a casino into this Missouri \ncommunity over the overwhelming objections of Missourians. My bill will \nmake this section clear.\n  Finally, the Indian Gaming statute authorizes tribes to conduct \ngaming on their reservations and other trust lands to the extent that \ngaming is permitted in that State. Such language is consistent with \nother Federal law by which tribes are subject to the criminal laws of \nthe State but they are not subject to the regulations of the State. The \nMissouri constitution prohibits land-based gaming, gaming of this class \nmay only be conducted on floating facilities on the Missouri River or \nMississippi River. This prohibition was a popular referendum passed by \nthe people of the State and the State legislature endorsed the \nobjection to land-based gaming in a resolution. My legislation clearly \nstates the Missouri Constitution contains a prohibition on land-based \ncasinos and may not be interpreted in any way to permit class III land-\nbased gaming. I might add that where a State has spoken so clearly--and \nthe State constitution is certainly a clear statement of intent--I find \nit absurd that outsiders can just come in and do what the local people \nhave said they oppose.\n  Mr. President, my proposals are not an exhaustive list, but the \nstatute has caused a situation in my State that this legislation will \naddress. I understand that the chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs will be pursuing a larger package of amendments to address the \nproblems in the gaming laws. I encourage him to do so, I look forward \nto working with him and I encourage my colleagues to join us in this \neffort. I want to conclude by reiterating that Federal Indian gambling \nlegislation is intended to control and contain Indian gambling. \nUnfortunately the legislation is riddled with loopholes that out-of-\nState gambling interests can exploit through tribes like the Eastern \nShawnee to operate gambling parlors. The people of southwest Missouri \ndo not want any kind of casino gambling and I am going to do everything \nI can do legislatively and through the regulatory process to stop it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include a copy of the bill and a brief \nquestion and answer in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DECLARATION OF INTENT TO CONDUCT GAMING.\n\n       Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. \n     4719) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Declaration of Intent to Conduct Gaming.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any \n     other provision of this Act, lands taken into trust for an \n     Indian tribe after the date of enactment of the Gaming \n     Clarification Act of 1997, shall not, for the purposes of \n     this Act, be considered to be Indian lands upon which class \n     II or class III gaming may be conducted in accordance with \n     this Act.\n       ``(2) Exception.--With respect to trust lands described in \n     paragraph (1) of an Indian tribe, class II or class III \n     gaming may be conducted on those lands in accordance with \n     this Act if--\n       ``(A) the Indian tribe submits an application to the \n     Secretary of the Interior that contains an explicit \n     declaration of the intent of the Indian tribe to conduct \n     gaming on those lands; and\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\n       ``(B) the Secretary of the Interior, in accordance with \n     procedures established by the Secretary, including reviewing \n     the applicability of subsection (b)(4), approves the \n     declaration contained in the petition.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Questions and Answers About Senator Bond's Indian Gambling Legislation\n\n       Why is this legislation needed?\n       The people of Southwest Missouri and their elected \n     representatives have valiantly fought against the Eastern \n     Shawnee tribes proposed casino project in Seneca. In \n     addition, Creative Gaming International, the gambling company \n     that is working with the tribe to establish the casino, has \n     also purchased land near Branson where they intend to open \n     another casino. At this time the tribe's application to have \n     the Seneca land taken into federal trust is pending with the \n     Secretary of the Interior. While Senator Bond has repeatedly \n     asked Interior Secretary Babbitt to deny the tribe's \n     petition, the outcome is uncertain. Loopholes in the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), the federal legislation that \n     regulates Indian gambling, need to be closed to prevent \n     tribes from locating in states where local citizens oppose \n     gambling.\n       Will this legislation interfere with the legal action that \n     the State has taken?\n       Senator Bond did not want to pursue any angle that would \n     interfere with any other efforts taken at the state level to \n     keep the casino out. The Attorney General of Missouri filed \n     suit on August 19, 1996, but filed a motion to dismiss the \n     case on November 18, 1996, which was granted on November 27, \n     1996. The fact that the case has been dropped means Bond's \n     legislation will not interfere with state efforts to stop the \n     casino.\n       Is this a fix for Missouri or a change in the gaming \n     statute affecting all tribes?\n       Both. As the situation in Missouri illustrates, the federal \n     statute intended to control the growth of this sort of \n     gambling is vague, poorly drafted and full of loopholes. The \n     Eastern Shawnee tribe is depending on this vague statute and \n     its loopholes to move into Missouri and open a casino, \n     activities that are directly contrary to the intent of the \n     statute. By focusing on several of the legal loopholes, I \n     believe we can solve the problem facing the State of Missouri \n     and other states whose citizens object to gambling \n     facilities.\n       Can this legislation pass?\n       Absolutely. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs is \n     proceeding with legislation this session to correct many of \n     the defects with the laws governing Indian gambling. Bond has \n     met with the committee chairman, Sen. Ben Nighthorse \n     Campbell, and he is aware of the situation in Missouri. Sen. \n     Campbell has several concerns with the law that are similar \n     to Missouri's and has pledged his cooperation to correct this \n     problem.\n       Congress sometimes moves slowly; does Bond have an \n     alternative plan?\n       Through his membership on the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee, Bond is well-situated to add language to the \n     annual Department of Interior Appropriations bill which would \n     prevent the Secretary of the Interior from placing this land \n     into trust.\n       Hasn't the Eastern Shawnee tribe tried to assure local \n     citizens that they no longer intend to develop a casino site \n     on the Seneca land?\n       Talk is cheap. The tribe has not amended their petition \n     application with the Department of Interior to reflect the \n     fact that they no longer intend to open a casino. Also, \n     Creative Gaming International, the New Jersey company working \n     with the tribe, noted in a press release just last Friday \n     that they were continuing to pursue ``Native American gaming \n     in southwest Missouri.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bennett, \n        Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 963. A bill to establish a transportation credit assistance pilot \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n  the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Transportation \nInfrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997,--or, TIFIA. The \npurpose of the bill is to bridge the gap between the Nation's \nsubstantial infrastructure needs and limited Federal funds. I am \npleased to report that Senators Graham of Florida, Boxer, Hatch, \nBennett, and Moynihan have joined me in cosponsoring this important \nmeasure.\n  I think we can all agree that there is a clear shortfall of public \nfunding to meet the Nation's transportation needs. Our effort to \nbalance the Federal budget only makes the challenge of meeting these \ncritical needs all the more difficult.\n  The goals of our bill are to offer the sponsors of major \ntransportation projects a new tool to make the most of limited Federal \nresources, stimulate additional investment in our Nation's \ninfrastructure, and encourage greater private sector participation in \nmeeting our transportation needs.\n  TIFIA establishes a new Federal credit program for surface \ntransportation. It will provide $800 million in credit assistance over \nsix years to public and private entities, with the purpose of \nleveraging as much as $16 billion in Federal funds for major \ntransportation projects. In turn, this Federal investment could help \nleverage total investment in infrastructure from other public and \nprivate entities of $40 to $50 billion. Eligible forms of credit \nassistance available through our proposal include loans, loan \nguarantees, and lines of credit.\n\n\n       what kinds of projects would qualify for this assistance?\n\n  National significance. Projects participating in this program must be \ndetermined by the Secretary of Transportation to be ``regionally or \nnationally'' significant. Projects must enhance the national \ntransportation system, reduce traffic congestion, and protect the \nenvironment.\n\n  Large projects. This program is targeted at large projects that are \ndifficult, if not impossible, to fund through traditional means such as \nusing a State's annual allocation in the Federal highway program. \nProjects participating in the program must cost at least 100 million \ndollars, or 50 percent of a State's most recent annual apportionment of \nfederal-aid highway funds, whichever is less.\n  Eligibility. The project must be a surface transportation facility \neligible for federal assistance--i.e., a highway, transit, passenger \nrail, or intermodal facility.\n  State and local support. The project must be included in the State \ntransportation plan and be in the approved State Transportation \nImprovement Program.\n  User charges. Projects must be self-financing through user fees or \nother non-federal revenue sources.\n\n\n why is this program needed in addition to state infrastructure banks?\n\n  The new credit assistance program will supplement existing Federal \nprograms, such as the State Infrastructure Banks or SIB's. Large \nprojects of national importance are simply too big to be financed by \nSIB's. As start-up financial institutions, SIB's are limited in the \namount of assistance they can provide in the near term. The credit \nassistance available through TIFIA will help fill this gap in the near \nterm.\n\n\n    will the federal government shoulder all of the risk for these \n                               projects?\n\n  No, under TIFIA, the Federal Government will participate in the new \ncredit assistance program as a minor investor. Our bill limits Federal \nparticipation to 33 percent of total project costs.\n  I want to emphasize that the new credit assistance program \nestablished in TIFIA is a limited, six-year pilot program. The ultimate \nobjective of the program is to phase out Federal participation in these \nlarge projects and allow private capital investment to take on this \nfunction. It is time to try a new approach and see how it works.\n  The benefits of private sector involvement in this area are enormous. \nGiving the private sector a larger role will reduce project costs and \nadvance construction schedules. It also will attract much needed \nprivate capital, and more equitably distribute risks between public and \nprivate sectors.\n  Now more than ever, we must preserve the strengths of the \ntransportation system we have in place. Yet, we also must anticipate \nthe future, addressing new problems with innovative solutions. This new \ncredit program is just the sort of creative mechanism we should be \nadvancing.\n  It is my hope that the new credit assistance program in the bill I \nintroduce today will be included as part of the reauthorization of the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. As I have said \nbefore, the ISTEA reauthorization process must reach out for ideas on \ncreative ways, like this one, to finance our infrastructure needs. The \ncombination of our nation's transportation infrastructure needs and the \nsignificant fiscal constraints at all levels of government make this \neffort imperative. This measure has the endorsement of the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association; PSA, the Bond Market \nTrade Association; the Internationals Union of Operating Engineers; the \nBuilding and Construction Trades Department; and Project America. I \nurge my colleagues to give this sensible measure their support.\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text and description \nof the bill be included in the Record.\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a well-developed system of transportation \n     infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, \n     health, and welfare of the people of the United States;\n       (2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant \n     programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure \n     investment needs of the United States because of budgetary \n     constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of \n     government;\n       (3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that \n     address critical national needs, such as intermodal \n     facilities, border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, \n     are of a scale that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State \n     assistance programs in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (4) new investment capital can be attracted to \n     infrastructure projects that are capable of generating their \n     own revenue streams through user charges or other dedicated \n     funding sources; and\n       (5) a Federal credit program for projects of national \n     significance can complement existing funding resources by \n     filling market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private \n     co-investment.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Short Title; Table of Contents\n\n       This section identifies a new Federal credit assistance \n     program for surface transportation facilities as the \n     Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of \n     1997.\n\n\n                            Sec. 2. Findings\n\n       This section recites Congressional findings that a \n     comprehensive surface transportation infrastructure system is \n     crucial to the economic health of the Nation. Traditional \n     methods of funding transportation projects, including Federal \n     grants, are insufficient to meet the Nation's infrastructure \n     investment needs. The funding gap is particularly acute for \n     large projects of National significance, due to their scale \n     and complexity. A new Federal credit program for \n     transportation will help address these projects' special \n     needs by supplementing existing Federal programs and \n     leveraging private debt and equity capital.\n       This bill is designed to provide an initial infusion of \n     Federal credit assistance over the next six years to \n     facilitate the development of large, capital-intensive \n     infrastructure facilities through public-private \n     partnerships, consisting of a State or local governmental \n     project sponsor and one of more private sector firms involved \n     in the design, construction or operation of the facility. The \n     Federal credit program is oriented to those projects which \n     have the potential to be self-supporting from user charges or \n     other non-Federal dedicated funding sources. The program is \n     structured to fill to specific market gaps through Federal \n     participation as a minority investor. The ultimate objective \n     is to phase out Federal participation and encourage private \n     capital investment to fulfill this function.\n       The program should result in additional surface \n     transportation facilities being developed more quickly and at \n     a lower cost than would be the case under conventional public \n     procurement, funding and ownership.\n\n\n                          Sec. 3. Definitions\n\n       This section sets forth the definitions for terms used in \n     this title. The key terms are listed below:\n       A ``Project'' is defined as any surface transportation \n     facility eligible under the provisions of title 23 as well as \n     chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code. Permitted \n     projects would include free or tolled highways, bridges and \n     tunnels; mass transportation facilities and vehicles; \n     commuter and inter-city rail passenger facilities and \n     vehicles; intermodal passenger terminals; and intermodal \n     freight and port facilities (excluding privately-owned rail \n     rolling stock).\n       The term ``Eligible Project Costs'' is defined to include \n     those costs of a capital nature incurred by a sponsor in \n     connection with developing an infrastructure project. These \n     costs fall into three categories: (I) pre-construction costs \n     relating to planning, design, and securing \n     governmental permits and approvals; (ii) hard costs \n     relating to the design and construction (or \n     rehabilitation) of a project; and (iii) related soft costs \n     associated with the financing of the project, such as \n     interest during construction, reserve accounts, and \n     issuance expenses. It would not include operation or \n     maintenance costs.\n       An ``Obligor'' is defined as any entity (whether a State or \n     local governmental unit or agency, a private entity \n     authorized by such governmental unit to develop a project, or \n     a public-private partnership) that is a borrower involving a \n     secured loan, loan guarantee, or line of credit under this \n     title.\n       A ``Local Servicer'' is defined as a state infrastructure \n     bank or other designated State or local governmental agency \n     which may service the credit program on behalf of the \n     Department of Transportation within that State.\n       ``Substantial Completion'' is defined as the date when a \n     project opens to vehicular, passenger, or freight traffic.\n       Other definitions specify types of lenders, project \n     obligations, and Federal credit instruments--including \n     secured loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit.\n\n\n       Sec. 4. Determination of Eligibility and Project Selection\n\n       This section defines the threshold eligibility criteria for \n     a project to receive Federal credit assistance and outlines \n     the basis upon which the Secretary will select among \n     potential candidates. The Secretary's determination of a \n     project's eligibility will be based on both quantitative and \n     qualitative factors.\n       To ensure that the project enjoys both State and local \n     support the project must be included in the State's plan and \n     program and, if the project is in a metropolitan area, it \n     must satisfy all metropolitan planning requirements of 23 \n     U.S.C. 134. The State or State-designated entity will be \n     responsible for forwarding the project application to the \n     Secretary.\n       In terms of size, the project must be reasonably \n     anticipated to cost at least $100 million or an amount equal \n     to 50 percent of a State's annual Federal-aid highway \n     apportionments, whichever is less. This two-fold test is \n     designed to allow small and rural States to accommodate \n     projects otherwise too large for their transportation \n     programs. Based on FY 1997 apportionments, eighteen States \n     could qualify projects costing less than $100 million, with \n     the minimum allocation equaling approximately $40 million.\n       An exception to this size threshold would be projects \n     involving the installation of intelligent transportation \n     systems, which would need to cost at least $30 million.\n       In addition, a project must be supported at least in part \n     by user charges, to encourage the development of new revenue \n     streams and the participation by the private sector.\n       Project applicants meeting the threshold eligibility \n     criteria then will be evaluated by the Secretary based on a \n     number of factors. Of prime importance, the project must be \n     deemed by the Secretary to be ``nationally or regionally \n     significant'' in terms of facilitating the movement of people \n     and goods in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, \n     resulting in significant economic benefits. Among the other \n     factors which the Secretary will take into account are: the \n     likelihood that the Federal assistance will enable the \n     project to proceed at an earlier date; the degree to which \n     the project leverages non-Federal resources, including \n     private sector capital; and its overall creditworthiness.\n       This section also provides that all requirements of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.), title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000d et seq.), the Uniform Relocation Assistance and\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\n     Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. \n     4601 et seq.), and section 5333 of title 49 and section 113 \n     of title 23, United States Code (relating to wage \n     protections), shall apply to funds made available under this \n     title and projects assisted with such funds.\n\n\n                         Sec. 5. Secured Loans\n\n       This section establishes a temporary lending program \n     whereby the Secretary may make direct Federal loans in fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2003 to demonstrate to the capital markets \n     the viability of making transportation infrastructure \n     investments where returns depend on excess project cash \n     flows. It is intended to help the capital markets develop the \n     capability to replace the role of the Federal government by \n     the end of the authorization period in helping finance the \n     costs of large projects of national significance. The loans \n     are contemplated to be made up front as combined construction \n     and permanent financing, although the title allows the \n     Federal loan to be made up to a year after construction is \n     completed for those projects that have arranged interim \n     construction financing.\n       A secured loan could be in an amount up to 33 percent of \n     the reasonably anticipated cost of a project, and could have \n     a final maturity as long as 35 years after the date the \n     project opens (substantial completion). The interest rate \n     would be established at the time the loan agreement was \n     executed, and would equal the prevailing yield on comparable \n     term U.S. Treasury bonds. Loan repayments would be required \n     to start within five years after the date of substantial \n     completion and are payable from user fees or dedicated \n     revenue streams.\n       The terms and conditions of each loan would be negotiated \n     between the Secretary and the borrower, and would allow a \n     lien on project revenue subject to a lien securing other \n     project debt. In the event of default and bankruptcy, \n     insolvency or liquidation of the obligor, the loan is not \n     subordinated to the claims of any other lender. A key feature \n     would allow the Secretary, for a period up to 10 years \n     following project completion, to defer principal and interest \n     payments should project revenues prove insufficient. Any \n     deferred payments during this ``ramp-up'' period would accrue \n     with interest, and this amount will be amortized over the \n     remaining term of the loan. Such a flexible payment schedule \n     (allowing for deferrals during the project's ramp-up phase) \n     should assist the project in obtaining an ``investment \n     grade'' bond rating (that is, BBB or higher) on its \n     capital markets indebtedness. Excess revenues or proceeds \n     of refinancing from non-Federal funding sources could be \n     used to prepay the secured loans without penalty.\n       The Secretary is to determine whether a secured loan can be \n     sold to another entity or reoffered into the capital markets \n     on favorable terms as soon as possible after substantial \n     completion.\n       In lien of funding secured loans directly, the Secretary \n     may provide loan guarantees to lenders, provided the \n     budgetary cost based on credit-worthiness is similar. This \n     feature is designed to attract voluntary investment from \n     pension funds and other institutional investors. Guaranteed \n     loans would not be permitted to be issued on a tax-exempt \n     basis.\n\n\n                        Sec. 6. Lines of Credit\n\n       This section authorizes the Secretary to enter into \n     agreements to make direct loans to projects at future dates \n     upon certain conditions occurring. Such agreement would be in \n     the form of a standby line of credit.\n       In contrast to a secured loan provided under section 5, the \n     line of credit would not be for the purpose of funding \n     construction costs as part of the project's initial \n     capitalization. Rather, the line of credit would be drawn \n     upon if needed to pay debt service and other project expenses \n     (such as extraordinary repair and replacement, or operation \n     and maintenance) during the critical ``ramp-up'' period after \n     the facility has opened. The line is designed to facilitate \n     project sponsors' access private capital by assisting them in \n     obtaining investment grade ratings on their debt.\n       It is intended that the financial institutions such as bond \n     insurers will develop the capability to replace this \n     temporary role of the Federal government in providing lines \n     of credit for large transportation infrastructure projects by \n     the end of the authorization period.\n       The secured loans and the line of credit are intended to \n     address projects with different financial needs based on \n     their pro-forma capital structures. The secured loans will be \n     most attractive to those projects that must demonstrate to \n     private lenders or capital markets debt investors that there \n     is adequate coverage ``going in'' based on maximum annual \n     debt service, and where the cost of the Federal loan compares \n     favorably with the cost of other borrowing alternatives. A \n     line of credit is more likely to be used by projects that are \n     able to issue capital markets debt on favorable terms with an \n     ascending debt service pattern, but need to demonstrate \n     access to contingent sources of capital to support such debt \n     service in the event revenues fail to grow as quickly as \n     annual payments of principal and interest.\n       This section sets forth various limitations on the \n     availability of draws on a line of credit. A draw on the line \n     will represent a direct loan. A line of credit could only be \n     drawn upon after the project had used up other available \n     revenues and reserves, and it could only be accessed for a \n     period of up to 10 years after a project had been \n     substantially completed.\n       The total amount of draws could not exceed 33 percent of \n     reasonably anticipated eligible project costs, as is the case \n     with secured loans. The borrower could draw down up to 20 \n     percent of the line of credit each year (i.e., the entire \n     amount could be drawn down during the first five years of a \n     ten year credit line, if needed.)\n       Any draws would need to be fully repaid, with interest, \n     within 20 years of the end of the 10-year availability period \n     following substantial completion of the project. The interest \n     rate for any draw would be established at the time the line \n     of credit agreement was entered into, at a rate equal to the \n     then-prevailing yield on 30 year U.S. Treasury bonds. The \n     repayment of the draw would be secured in a manner similar to \n     the secured loan.\n       To avoid ``double-dipping,'' a borrower could not combine a \n     line of credit with a secured loan for any given project.\n\n\n                       sec. 7. project servicing\n\n       The program will use State or local governmental agencies \n     to assist the Secretary in servicing each credit instrument. \n     The State may designate its State infrastructure bank or some \n     other public agency to serve as the local servicing agent for \n     the credit instrument.\n       The local servicing agent would function as a financing \n     conduit, much like a mortgage company, and with the \n     Secretary's approval it could charge a servicing fee. It \n     would not be financially liable in any way for the credit \n     provided; rather, it would assist in the disbursement and \n     collection of funds. It is required that the local servicing \n     agent set up a separate account from its other activities to \n     receive the Federal credit proceeds for disbursal to the \n     borrower, and to receive loan repayments for remittance to \n     the Secretary.\n\n\n                sec. 8. office of infrastructure finance\n\n       The Secretary will establish an Office of Infrastructure \n     Finance to manage the credit program and provide related \n     technical and educational assistance.\n       Program guidelines will be established by the Secretary in \n     order to ensure the program operates prudently and \n     efficiently, including requiring obligors to provide annual \n     audits.\n\n\n                    sec. 9. state and local permits\n\n       This section states that this title in no way supersedes \n     any existing State or local laws, regulations, or project \n     approval requirements.\n\n\n                            sec. 10. funding\n\n       This section provides contract authority to fund the \n     budgetary or subsidy costs of the Federal credit instruments \n     provided. (Subsidy costs, which are defined in and required \n     to be funded by budget authority under the Federal Credit \n     Reform Act of 1990, represent the present value of expected \n     cash flows for each credit instrument, taking into account \n     the default risk as well as any interest rate subsidy. Since \n     this title requires all secured loans to be made at rate \n     equal to the comparable term U.S. Treasury rate, there will \n     be no interest subsidy element.) The contract authority \n     would remain available until expended, and would be paid \n     out of the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund.\n       The section also establishes a limit each year on the \n     maximum amount of credit assistance that may be offered under \n     this title.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Budget (contract)    Nominal credit \n            Fiscal year                 authority            limit      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1998..............................        $40,000,000       $800,000,000\n1999..............................        $60,000,000     $1,200,000,000\n2000..............................       $100,000,000     $2,000,000,000\n2001..............................       $150,000,000     $3,000,000,000\n2002..............................       $200,000,000     $4,000,000,000\n2003..............................       $250,000,000     $5,000,000,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Sec. 110. Report to Congress\n\n       This section requires the Secretary to summarize the \n     activities and results of the assistance programs and \n     mechanisms provided under this title, including whether they \n     are succeeding in encourage the private capital markets to \n     invest in large transportation infrastructure projects. The \n     report shall be made within four years of enactment of the \n     title and include recommendations on whether the programs \n     should be continued or phased out by the end of the \n     authorization period as planned.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, who is the chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works, on which I am pleased \nto serve,\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\na question about his proposed Transportation Finance and Innovation \nAct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will be pleased to yield to a question from my \nCalifornia colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I also want to thank the Chairman \nfor his support for a number of critical transportation projects in \nCalifornia and in particular, the Alameda Transportation Corridor \nproject. As the Chairman knows, he supported my efforts to designate \nthe Corridor a High Priority Corridor in the National Highway System \nDesignation Act of 1995. That in turn led President Clinton to include \nin his fiscal year 1997 budget request funding to support a $400 \nmillion direct Federal loan for the project, which was approved by \nCongress last year.\n  As Senator Chafee, knows, California has major need for \ntransportation investment due in large part to the tremendous increase \nin international trade flowing through the state. While this trade has \nhelped bring California out of the economic recession earlier this \ndecade, it has also placed tremendous strain on our infrastructure. No \nwhere is this more apparent than at our border with Mexico. \nUnfortunately, after the implementation of the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, the Federal Government provided no special assistance \nto the border States to deal with the expected doubling of commercial \ntruck traffic through these border trade corridors. As the Senator \nknows from his recent tour of the area, narrow rural highways or city \nstreets are being expected to carry heavy, continuous commercial truck \ntraffic.\n  In response to this need, I introduced the Border Infrastructure, \nSafety and Congestion Relief Act. A section of my bill would provide \nFederal funds to state infrastructure banks or authorities to finance \nborder improvement projects. We know that some projects could be \nfinanced more efficiently under partnerships with the private sector. I \nunderstand Senator Chafee's bill on Transportation Finance and \nInnovation would provide an infusion of Federal credit assistance over \nthe next six years to help construct large, high-cost infrastructure \nfacilities. My question for the Chairman is this, would border crossing \nfacilities and trade corridors be eligible for this type of Federal \nfinancing under your bill?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct. Through the efforts of Senator \nBoxer, I have become aware of the need for border infrastructure \ninvestment and of her own legislation which has been referred to our \ncommittee. The Transportation Finance and Innovation Act embraces the \ninnovative finance objectives of the Boxer bill. Border crossing \nfacilities and multi-State trade corridors are clearly eligible and the \nselection criteria specifically includes those projects which promote \ninternational commerce. This bill will enable United States \nmanufacturers to deliver their goods to domestic and foreign markets in \na more timely, and cost-effective manner.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chairman. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Transportation Finance and Innovation Act. Several \nprojects in California could benefit potentially from this legislation, \nnot only in the border region but with the Alameda Corridor project in \nLos Angeles and the Bay Area Rapid Transit extension to San Francisco \nInternational Airport. I appreciate Senator Chafee's hard work and \nvision to present new innovations and ideas on financing transportation \ninvestments needed to keep our economy competitive in the world.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nRhode Island--the distinguished chairman of the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee--in the introduction of an initiative to help \naddress our nation's infrastructure needs. Our initiative aims to \nharness the resources and energies of the public and the private \nsectors, and have them work in concert to ensure that a 21st century \nAmerica has a modern system of roads, highways, and other critical \npublic works assets. We are calling this new partnership the \nTransportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997--\nTIFIA.\n  Mr. President, the numbers paint a stark and disturbing picture of \nthe state of our nation's infrastructure. A survey of our nation's \ncommunity water system estimated that a minimum of $138.4 billion are \nneeded over a 20 year period for the purposes of installing, upgrading, \nor replacing water mains, pipes, and processing facilities. Houston \nMayor Bob Lanier, Chairman of the Rebuild America Coalition, reports \nthat ``57 percent of highway pavement in all but a handful of states is \nin poor or mediocre condition; in some of the most populous regions, \nthe figure is as high as 70%.'' The U.S. Department of Transportation \nestimates that our nation must invest an additional $33 billion in \nsurface transportation in order to stay ahead of future growth, \ncongestion, and development. We are also faced with 187,000 \nstructurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges. According to \nthe Federal Highway Administration, a minimum of $8.2 billion is \nrequired to improve and correct bridge conditions.\n  In addition to these needs, we are faced with the important and \nchallenging task of balancing the federal budget in order to preserve \nthe health and prosperity of future generations of Americans. In order \nto achieve this goal and still meet our nation's infrastructure needs, \nour actions must be a combination of traditional as well as new and \ninnovative means of financing.\n  Specifically, I believe that we need to do the following: First, we \nneed to provide for a more efficient use of resources going to improve \nand develop our nation's infrastructure. We need to better utilize \ncost-saving tools and techniques so that we can stretch our nation's \npublic investment dollars as far as possible in this time of limited \nfederal funds. Second, we need to raise the level of traditional \nresources so that states will have a larger pool of dollars, including \nfederal dollars, available for infrastructure development. Third, we \nneed to attract and facilitate new and innovative financing sources, \nsuch as private investment. By fostering greater private-public \npartnerships, we can provide additional funding resources for states \nand communities. Finally, we need to develop and support innovative \nconstruction and financing mechanisms, such as State Infrastructure \nBanks (SIBs) and the legislation we are introducing today, TIFIA.\n  In the face of declining federal investment in infrastructure amidst \ntight fiscal constraints, TIFIA enables communities and states to \nutilize creative methods for addressing our nation's infrastructure \nneeds. TIFIA would provide $800 million in federal credit assistance \nfor major transportation infrastructure projects costing in excess of \n$100 million. The legislation provides a model in which states could \nuse federal loans to develop large projects that have the potential to \nbe self-supporting.\n  Projects which would be candidates for receiving assistance under \nthis program include: The Western Extension of the George Bush Freeway \nin Texas; the Broken Arrow Expressway in Oklahoma; the widening of US \nHighway 219 in New York; the Interstate 15 rebuilding project in Utah; \nthe Border Infrastructure project in Southern California; and the \nFlorida High Speed Rail.\n  In my state of Florida, the state's Department of Transportation is \nproposing the Florida High Speed Rail project, which would connect the \nmajor metropolitan areas of Miami, Orlando, and Tampa, and be the first \ntrue high speed rail line in our nation. Japan and nations in Europe \nhave already made major progress in high speed rail transportation--but \nthis progress has been contingent on support from their national \ngovernments. TIFIA could provide important credit support for such \nprojects of national significance.\n  Creative financing for infrastructure development is crucial as we \nenter the 21st century and are confronted with the extensive needs \nwhich can only be addressed through new and visionary approaches. In \nthis Congress, we are scheduled to reauthorize both the Clean Water Act \nand ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which \ngoverns our nation's highway system--two major infrastructure bills \nwhich address pressing needs that affect the daily lives of citizens \nnationwide.\n  As we focus on these two major bills, it is my hope that we will take \nsteps to improve the state of our nation's public works system in a \nsubstantial and effective manner. TIFIA should be used as one model for \ntaking these steps using a creative private-public financing approach. \nIn fact, it is my hope\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nthat this legislation will be incorporated into ISTEA.\n  We should create new partnerships which will help us to meet current \nand future needs while acknowledging the limited resources available to \nus in this fiscal environment. If we are to rebuild our nation's \ninfrastructure, and lay the groundwork for the next generation of \ntransportation infrastructure, we will need to develop innovative \nfinancing programs such as TIFIA.\n  It is my hope that after we complete the Highway Program bill--with \nthe inclusion of TIFIA as an innovative financing title--we will \ndevelop similar mechanisms for addressing the financing requirements of \nother major public works needs such as clean water systems and perhaps \neven school construction.\n  We should heed the wisdom found in the words of Daniel Burnham, a \nprominent architect who served as chairman of a commission charged with \nredeveloping the District of Columbia, ``Think no small ideas. Small \nideas have no magic to stir men's minds.'' Let us use this bill as the \nstarting point from which to make a serious and substantial dent in our \nnational development needs.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his leadership in this area \nand look forward to working closely with him as we work to pass this \nbill and reauthorize the Highway Program.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n

RANDALL INOUYE, COMMANDER, BALTIMORE DISTRICT, U.S. \n                        ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCol. Randall Inouye, Commander of the Baltimore District, U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers. Col. Inouye is moving on to a new assignment in the \nPentagon and I want to express my appreciation for the fine work that \nhe has done.\n  In the 3 short years in which Col. Inouye has commanded the Baltimore \nDistrict he has proved to be one of the best and most accomplished \nDistrict Engineers. During his tenure in Baltimore, the colonel helped \nspearhead Maryland's flood mitigation task force--a Federal, State, and \nlocal partnership effort to help communities rebuild after the \ndevastating floods of 1996. This task force is now being used as a \nmodel for similar efforts throughout the nation. Under his leadership, \nthe Poplar Island restoration project--the largest habitat restoration \nproject ever undertaken in the United States--was initiated. Poplar \nIsland is the first large-scale project to make beneficial use of \ndredged material and will help protect and promote the recovery of the \nChesapeake Bay while at the same time preserving the vitality of the \nPort of Baltimore. Similarly, Col. Inouye was responsible for many \nother important environmental restoration and water resource \ndevelopment activities in the region, including the successful \nrestoration of 32 acres of emergent tidal wetlands at Kenilworth \nMarsh--the largest and last remaining freshwater tidal wetland on the \nAnacostia; the Maryland coastal bays initiative; and the Tolchester and \nBrewerton Channel improvement projects, to name only a few. As District \nEngineer, Col. Inouye also directed and oversaw the succeessful \ncompletion of numerous military construction projects in Maryland from \nthe Army's Research Labs at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Adelphi to the \nDefense Information School at Fort Meade to the new Walter Reed Army \nInstitute of Research at Forest Glen.\n  I came to know Col. Inouye shortly after he assumed command of the \nBaltimore District and have had the privilege of working closely with \nhim over the past three years on many initiatives throughout Maryland, \nincluding those mentioned above. In every instance, the Colonel has \ndistinguished himself for his responsiveness and commitment to getting \nthe job done. He has set a new standard of excellence and \naccomplishment for other District Engineers to emulate.\n  In recognition of his outstanding service to the Baltimore District \nand other commands, Col. Inouye has received numerous awards and \ncommendations including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service \nMedal and the Army Commendation Medal. But perhaps more importantly, \nhis efforts have earned him the respect and admiration of everyone with \nwhom he has worked. I know that many Marylanders join me in expressing \nappreciation for his contributions toward improving the quality of life \nin our State and in wishing him the best in his new endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6380-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DR. JAN KARSKI\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an \nindividual who truly personifies courage and compassion. When the dark \nnight of Nazi occupation descended across most of Europe, and the spark \nof humanity was crushed beneath Gestapo jack boots, Dr. Jan Karski knew \nthat he couldn't just curse the darkness.\n  Dr. Karski was a wartime courier for the Polish underground, and he \nis often credited as being the first person to alert the Allies about \nthe existence of the death camps and the extermination of the Jews.\n  Karski's secret work began in 1939. He was riding in a cattle car, \nwith other Polish soldiers, heading for forced labor in Germany, when \nhe jumped from the window and joined the underground movement. Between \nthe winter of 1939 and the early summer of 1940, Karski was sent by the \nunderground back and forth from Warsaw to France on successful missions \nas a courier. However, in 1940 he was arrested by the Nazis in Slovakia \nand brutally tortured. Eventually, he was rescued by the Polish \nunderground and continued to fight for freedom.\n  Karski clandestinely surveyed conditions in the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto \nand even volunteered to be smuggled into the Belzic death camp to \ngather evidence of the Nazi's extermination policies. In 1943, he was \nsent by the Polish government-in-exile to inform American officials \nabout the situation in his native country, among the prominent \nindividuals he met with was President Roosevelt. In fact, shortly after \nmeeting with Karski, Roosevelt ordered the creation of the American \nRefugee Board, an organization whose main task was to protect Jewish \nescapees and place them in the United States.\n  After the war, when Poland traded Nazi totalitarianism for Soviet \ntotalitarianism, Karski moved to the United States. He earned his Ph.D. \nin Georgetown and has been teaching at the university since 1952. Among \nother honors, Karski has received the highest Polish military \ndecoration, a special citation by the United Nations, and was declared \na ``Righteous Gentile Among Nations'' by the state of Israel.\n  Mr. President, the great humanitarian Albert Schweitzer once noted, \n``A great person helps others, but a good person touches the lives of \nothers.'' If that's true, then Dr. Karski proves that good and great \ncan exist in the same individual. He continually demonstrated that one \nperson can make a difference, and at a time when many were content to \ncurse the darkness, he kept the candles of hope and humanity burning. \nUndoubtedly, he is an example for our times and a hero for the \nages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6380-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6380-S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAIR PLAY ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to note that this \nweek we celebrate the 25th anniversary of title IX, landmark \nlegislation that has played an enormous role in leveling the playing \nfield--literally--for women in sports. I was also pleased last week to \njoin my colleagues, Senator Moseley-Braun, Kennedy, and Mikulski, to \nmark this anniversary by introducing the Fair Play Act, legislation \nwhich will take the next important step in increasing educational and \nathletic opportunities for young women.\n  There is no question that sports are just as important an activity \nfor girls and women as they are for boys and men. Through sports, girls \nand women can get a feel for the positive competitive spirit which was, \nuntil recently, the almost exclusive property of boys and men. Women \nand girls who participate in sports develop self-confidence, \ndedication, a sense of team spirit, and an ability to work under \npressure--traits which enhance all aspects of their lives. In fact, 80 \npercent of women identified as key leaders in Fortune 500 companies \nhave sports backgrounds.\n  When I was a young girl growing up, girls and women did not have much \nopportunity to participate in competitive athletics. But the enactment \nof title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 changed all that, by \nrequiring that women be afforded equitable opportunities to participate \nin high school and college athletics. Since title IX's enactment, women \nand girls across the Nation have met the challenge of participating in \ncompetitive sports in record numbers. Since 1972, the number\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\nof college women participating in competitive athletics has gone from \nfewer than 32,000 to over 110,000 in 1994-95. Before title IX, fewer \nthan 300,000 high school girls played competitive sports. By 1996, that \nnumber had climbed to almost 2.4 million.\n  Today, women across America are taking bats, lacrosse sticks, and \njavelins to the glass ceiling--shattering the myth that there are \n``men's'' sports and there are ``women's'' sports. But a quarter-\ncentury after title IX's enactment, there is still much more to be \ndone. According to a recent NCAA study, only 23 percent of all current \ncollege athletic budgets are allocated to women, and women receive only \n38 percent of athletic scholarship dollars. Only 27 percent of funding \nspent to recruit new athletes target women. In high-school athletic \ncompetitions, there are two boys to every one girl participating.\n  The Fair Play Act, which we introduced to mark the 25th anniversary \nof Title IX, is designed to strengthen this important legislation and \ntherefore enhance women's athletic and educational opportunities. Under \ncurrent law, colleges and universities are required to compile \ninformation about their men's and women's athletic programs, including \nparticipation rates, operating and recruitment budgets, the \navailability of scholarships, revenues generated from athletic \nprograms, and coaches' salaries. They are required to update this \ninformation annually and make it available to prospective students and \nothers upon request. Because there is no central repository for this \ninformation, however, it is difficult for students to obtain and \nevaluate it or put it into context.\n  The Fair Play Act is designed to correct this by directing colleges \nand universities to send information they already collect on their \nmen's and women's athletic programs to the Department of Education, and \ndirects the department to publish an annual report and make this \ninformation widely available by distributing the annual report to high \nschools, and establishing a toll free number and a web site. This bill \nwill give students and families access to the kind of information they \nneed to make informed decisions about where to go to school, and will \nhelp the Department of Education enforce title IX compliance in the \narea of athletics.\n  The first 25 years of title IX have been an enormous success. Now, \nit's time for us to help millions of other girls and women get off the \nbleachers, the sidelines, and the viewing stands and onto the fields, \nthe pitchers' mounds, and the courts. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation, and look forward to seeing what the next 25 years \nhold for women's accomplishments in sports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6380-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MARVIN H. POPE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, our age has lost a scholar of \nepic achievement and range with the passing of Marvin H. Pope of the \nYale Divinity School. A Biblical scholar of unsurpassed originality and \nrange, he died at age 80 in the First Church of Round Hill, Greenwich, \nCT, just after he and his wife Ingrid had read a passage from the Bible \nfor the congregation. He was an effervescent member of the American \nSchools of Oriental Research, where he will be mourned as well as \ncelebrated.\n  As was said about Job, it could be said of Marvin H. Pope: ''. . . \nthou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased \nin the land.'' I ask that an an article on Marvin Pope, from the New \nYork Times be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the New York Times, June 1997]\n\n       Marvin Pope, 80, Profesor and Authority on Ancient Ugarit\n\n                         (By Holcomb B. Noble)\n\n       Marvin H. Pope, a retired Yale professor who was one of the \n     world's leading authorities on Ugarit, the ancient city in \n     Syria where excavations shed important light on the ancient \n     Scriptures, died on Sunday at First Church of Round Hill in \n     Greenwich, Conn. He was 80.\n       He and his wife had just finished reading passages from the \n     Bible to the congregation and returned to their pew when he \n     collapsed.\n       Mr. Pope was a professor of Near Eastern languages and \n     civilizations from 1949 to 1986 and taught at the Yale \n     Divinity School and in the religious studies department.\n       In addition, he helped prepare the first major revision of \n     the King James Version of the Bible, the Revised Standard \n     Version, in the 1940's. In the 1980's he worked with others \n     advising the National Council of Churches on the New Revised \n     Standard Version, which removed some traditional language \n     regarded as sexist. These are the two versions used in most \n     Protestant churches.\n       Many of Mr. Pope's contributions to the study of the Hebrew \n     text of the Bible and to modern English translations stemmed \n     from a day in 1928 when a farmer plowing a field in northern \n     Syria struck what he thought was a stone. It emerged, \n     instead, as part of the extensive remains, uncovered by \n     archeologists over the next year, of a cosmopolitan city on \n     the Mediterranean that had thrived in 2000 B.C. but had been \n     ransacked and burned in about 1200 B.C.\n       Among the discoveries were Ugaritic art and clay tablets \n     whose language was similar to biblical Hebrew, of which Mr. \n     Pope, over the years, became a major translator. They added \n     significant new meanings, nuances and detail to the early \n     writings of the Old Testament and the culture of their time. \n     The tablets were traced to a period from 1500 B.C to 1180 \n     B.C.\n       Mr. Pope's work on the tablets resulted in his \n     retranslations from the ancient Hebrew of the entire books of \n     Job and the Song of Songs, and a lengthy commentary about \n     them both, published in 1973 and 1977 by the Anchor Bible \n     Series. Robert R. Wilson, a professor of religious studies at \n     Yale, said those two translations were ``the brilliant works \n     of a master scholar'' and added to the general understanding \n     of an age and its poetry.\n       Scholars said that one of the difficulties in translating \n     the early tablets was that the words had been crammed onto \n     the surfaces with less regard for their legibility than \n     whether they would fit. It was often difficult to determine, \n     as a result, which line of poetry followed which. Mr. Pope \n     was able to arrange the lines in proper sequence and poetic \n     form.\n       Another difficulty was that the meanings of the first lines \n     of the verses tended to be echoed in the second lines but \n     with rarer language. Mr. Pope was one of the few able to \n     capture the meaning of the rarer passages.\n       He visited the site of the 1929 excavations, near the \n     modern town of Latakia, north of Damascus, though most of his \n     studies took place in Paris, where the hundreds of tablets \n     were put on display.\n       A man whose wit made him popular among generations of Yale \n     students, he said that one of his findings was that Baal, \n     chief god of the Ugarits, was not always chief, as scholars \n     had thought, but had maneuvered to take over from the god El, \n     whom he kicked further upstairs.\n       Marvin Hoyle Pope was born on June 23, 1916, in Durham, \n     N.C., the son of Charles and Bessie Cleveland Sorrell Pope. \n     He earned a bachelor's degree in 1938 at Duke University, \n     where he was signed up by mistake for a course in Hebrew. He \n     remained in the course, which led him to a master's degree in \n     Semitic languages and literature in 1939. He received a \n     doctorate from Yale in 1949.\n       His first wife, Helen Thompson Pope, died in 1979.\n       In addition to his wife, Ingrid Bloomquist Pope, he is \n     survived by a son, Marvin Jr., and a daughter, Beverly, both \n     of New Haven; three stepchildren, Dennis Bloomquist of Great \n     Falls, VA, Diane B. Connelly of Shaker Heights, OH, and \n     Laurel B. Shields of Austin, TX.; a sister, Mary Gladys \n     Hodges of Durham, NC and eight grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6381-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6381-S6382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BIOMATERIALS ACCESS ASSURANCE ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak today on Senate \nbill 364, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act, which I am proud to \ncosponsor. I have long been a proponent for civil justice reform and \nother legislative measures relating to product liability. As an \noriginal cosponsor of product liability reform legislation (S. 648), I \nhave long supported the biomaterials liability reform provisions \ncontained in it. I am also pleased to cosponsor those provisions as a \nseparate measure, although in my view we need both general product \nliability reforms and biomaterials liability reforms.\n  This Nation's tort system is in dire need of repair. To maintain the \nstatus quo is not only costing consumers millions of dollars each year \nbut also many lives will be lost if change does not occur soon. The \nBiomaterials Access Assurance Act approaches the subject of tort reform \nfrom a different perspective--the perspective of millions of Americans \nwho face life-threatening diseases. These are the people who have the \nmost to gain and everything to lose if Congress refuses to listen to \ntheir pleas.\n  The purpose of this act is straightforward. S. 364 attempts to gain a \nfoothold on our legal system's slippery slope by shielding companies \nwho supply raw materials to manufacturers of life-saving medical \ndevices. The Biomaterials Access Assurance Act will prevent the \nimpending shortage of biomaterials suppliers by permitting these \ncompanies to be quickly dismissed from a lawsuit provided they had no \npart in the manufacture or selling of a\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\ndevice and all contractual specifications had been met. Currently it is \ncommon practice for suppliers to be dragged into costly litigation even \nthough these companies are not involved in the creation or marketing of \na product. In fact, in almost every case thus far, biomaterials \nsuppliers are not found liable in these type of lawsuits. S. 364 \nsquashes illegitimate attempts for windfall profits and more \nimportantly, ensures these life-saving medical devices will be in \nabundant supply.\n  Right now, the escalating expense suppliers unfairly incur defending \ntheir product continues to drive many out of the U.S. market. As a \nresult, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for manufacturers of \nmedical devices to find biomaterials suppliers with the raw materials \nnecessary to produce their products. Replacement heart valves, \npacemakers, and brain shunts are but a small selection of the devices \nwhich rely on raw material suppliers.\n  My colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, mentioned in an earlier \nstatement that 13 biomaterial supply companies have been driven out of \nbusiness due to concerns about the risk of unwarranted litigation. \nSadly, the people whose lives depend on these raw materials for \nsurvival are the ones who will pay the ultimate price. Unfortunately a \nfamily living in my home State of Michigan illustrates my point.\n  Recently Mr. And Mrs. Traxler of Fremont, MI, told me of their \nfamily's desperate need to find help for their young daughter, Sarah. \nThe parents explained to me when Sarah was 2 months old she experienced \na traumatic brain injury. As a result of the injury, Sarah now requires \na shunt that drains fluid away from her brain.\n  The shunt will need replacing soon and her parents are deeply worried \nthat if medical manufacturers are forced into bankruptcy, the shunts \nkeeping Sarah alive will no longer be available. In their letter, \nSarah's parents explain, ``Because of the recent lawsuits involving \nbreast implants and other medical devices, many biomaterials \nmanufacturers have discontinued supplying the raw materials used to \nmake medical devices. Because the sale of these raw materials represent \nsuch a small percentage of their total revenues, they do not feel it is \nworth the risk of having to defend themselves in court and they have \ndiscontinued supplying these materials to medical device \nmanufacturers.''\n  This is a sad commentary on the state of this Nation's legal system. \nClearly, reform is needed and must be implemented soon to help protect \nthe life of Sarah Traxler and countless others like her. For this \nreason, I ask my colleagues many of whom are parents themselves, to \nsupport this critical legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6381-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO KARIN ELKIS WEINSTEIN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate \nKarin Elkis, who is being honored on June 30, 1997 as the Sid Levy \nMemorial Volunteer of the Year by the Jewish Community Center of South \nJersey. This annual award is presented to the volunteer who best \ncaptures the JCC's commitment to community service and self-giving. \nKarin is in charge of the Lautenberg Senate office in South Jersey and \nit is of no surprise to me that she is receiving this honor. Karin gets \nmore done in one hour than most people accomplish in a single day. She \nis energetic, caring, selfless, and always thinking about others. She \nbrings the same commitment and concern to her volunteer activities that \nshe brings to her work to serve the people of New Jersey.\n  Despite a more than full time job, three young children, and other \nfamily responsibilities, Karin has found time to make a major \ncontribution to the JCC by chairing its Festival of Arts, Books and \nCulture this year. Further, she's served as a liaison to the Early \nChildhood Department, a member of the Budget Committee, chaired the \nCamp Committee and been a member of the Executive Committee. If I \nlisted all of her activities at the JCC over the past few years, this \nstatement would be longer than a James Michener novel.\n  Through her work, Karin has touched the lives of many. She is truly \nan extraordinary person, with many talents, enormous energy and drive, \nand a compassionate heart. I am proud to have Karin on my staff and to \ninclude her as a friend. She makes an enormous contribution to the \nSouth Jersey community, through her work as a Senate employee and her \nwork as a volunteer.\n  Mr. President, I again congratulate Karin on this well deserved \nrecognition. I know that she will continue to serve the people of New \nJersey in many ways for years to come and that our pride in her \naccomplishments will continue to be justified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6382-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6382-S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CLEANING THE AIR\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past 5 months, we have been \nengaged in a troubling debate on how best to protect the health of our \nchildren, our elderly and our environment. Since the Environmental \nProtection Agency announced the proposed new standards for air quality, \nwe have witnessed an unprecedented campaign by industry to block these \nnew standards. Opponents instantly attacked the goals rather than \nsitting down to work with Congress and the administration on how to \nachieve these goals in a reasonable and cost-effective timeframe. I \napplaud EPA Administrator Carol Browner for standing up against the \nonslaught of industry backlash on the new standards. Today, President \nClinton showed equal commitment by supporting the thrust of \nAdministrator Browner's recommendation. This decision will reduce the \nsmog and soot that drifts into Vermont from outside the State. I \ncongratulate President Clinton for standing up for the health of our \nchildren and our environment. We can now begin the process of finding \nthe most cost-effective means of implementing these standards.\n  In Vermont, we recognize the benefits of high environmental \nstandards. Over the years, conservationists and the business community \nhave worked together to protect the environment. Vermonters know that a \nhealthy environment promotes a healthy economy. Yet despite our \ncommitment, Vermont and other Northeastern States have become the \ndumping ground for pollution that seeps across our borders each night \nwith the wind. The new ozone standard makes the biggest pollutors \naccountable and will reduce the burden on States in the Northeast in \ntheir battle to maintain our high standards for air quality. Acid rain \ntaught us that tough State environmental standards were not enough to \nprotect us. We saw some of our healthiest forests die off from \npollution borne from outside our region. This situation demands tough \nnational environmental standards to ensure a level playing field.\n  The new air standards will address two central issues: Where the smog \nand soot is landing and how to use new scientific evidence to continue \nimproving efforts to protect public health. We learned from the acid \nrain debate that emissions from dirty coal-fired powerplants in the \nMidwest can be transported farther than 500 miles. More than 40 percent \nof the pollution in Vermont is from outside the state. We also know \nthat utility restructuring will encourage increased generation at the \npowerplants in the Midwest. The new standards proposed by EPA will \nreduce the smog and soot that drifts into Vermont from these \npowerplants. Today's decision is a clear victory for the Northeast \nbecause we now have a standard that will reduce air pollution at its \nsource.\n  Since the passage of the Clean Air Act we have made considerable \nstrides in reducing some pollutants. The level of lead pollution we and \nour children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That \nfigure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air \nAct. If we learned one thing from the acrimonious debate in Congress \nlast year on environmental issues, it is that the American people do \nnot want to halt the progress we have made and merely rest on our \nenvironmental laurels. Americans want to keep moving forward on \ncleaning up our environment. Unfortunately, as I listen to the debate \non the Clean Air Act this Congress, I fear that we are not heeding \ntheir call. Instead of looking at ways to strengthen the Clean Air Act, \nwe are trying to undercut the existing regulations.\n  Today, the President recognized the 130 million Americans in 170 \nmajor cities who continue to breathe unhealthy air. Congress should \nlisten as well and approve the standards. I will work with my \ncolleagues in the\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\nSenate to oppose efforts to block the implementation of these new \nstandards. Members of the House of Representatives have already \nlaunched their attack on the standards by introducing legislation to \nblock the President's decision and weaken these standards. It is \nimportant to Vermont and to the Nation that we set aside the \nacrimonious debate that occurred on these standards and work together \nto develop a cost-effective implementation plan.\n  The recommendations of the Ozone Transport Assessment Group that were \napproved by 32 States lay out several concrete steps to clean up our \nair in the Northeast. I challenge Administrator Browner and the \nadministration to move quickly on these recommendations. In particular, \nI want Congress and the administration to look at what probably has \nbecome one of the largest loopholes in the Clean Air Act: Allowing the \ndirtiest power plants to continue to operate with vastly inadequate \npollution controls. The need to go back and close this loophole now--in \nthis session of Congress--assumes greater urgency because of the \nderegulation of the electric utility industry.\n  Tomorrow's United Nations conference on the environment reminds us \nthat we share the air, the water and our planet. There can be no \ngreater legacy that we leave behind for our children and grandchildren \nthan a society secure in its commitment to a healthy and \nenvironmentally sound future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6382-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BLOOMINGTON-NORMAL'S ``NOT IN OUR TOWN'' PROGRAM\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \npeople of Bloomington-Normal, IL, for their efforts to stem the growth \nof hate crimes and racial intolerance. Their commitment to taking \nproactive measures to prevent division and promote understanding serves \nas a model for communities across the Nation.\n  Inspired by the film ``Not in Our Town,'' which tells the story of \nhow Billings, MT, joined together in response to rampant hate crimes, \nthe citizens of Bloomington-Normal created their own ``Not in Our \nTown'' program. They were not, however, responding to hate crimes or \nclear racial unrest. Instead, these Twin Cities chose to create a \nvehicle for awareness and prevention, to stop hate crimes before they \nstarted. This type of program is without a doubt ahead of its time.\n  Designed to increase public knowledge about the threat of racial \nviolence, the program is carried out in a variety of ways. Adult and \nyouth discussions and forums are regularly held. All city entrances are \nmarked with ``no racism'' signs. Many city workers wear ``Not in Our \nTown'' buttons, and all city vehicles are marked with ``Not in Our \nTown'' bumper stickers. Clearly, it's difficult to be in Bloomington-\nNormal without knowing that prejudice and violence will not be \naccepted. In addition to these efforts, the city has also sponsored two \nanti-racism marches, which give citizens the opportunity to demonstrate \ntheir commitment to the program and its goals not only to each other, \nbut to surrounding communities as well.\n  Perhaps most vital to the program's success are its youth discussion \ngroups. As one teen noted, ``History is going to repeat itself if the \nyouth aren't taught about the Holocaust and slavery * * * they won't \nknow any better.'' ``Not in Our Town'' provides young people a way to \nlearn how local events are part of national issues, and more \nimportantly, how community action can really make a difference for \npeople everywhere.\n  As President Clinton begins a new initiative to have a national \nconversation about race and diversity, Bloomington-Normal has truly \ntaken the lead in providing a model that all Americans can follow when \norganizing their home towns to discuss and confront what is perhaps our \nmost important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6383-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE SLAUGHTER OF REFUGEES IN CONGO MUST CEASE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the government of the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo must bring to an immediate end the systematic search \nand slaughter of Rwandan refugees, or else face isolation from the \ninternational community. Recent media reports allege the methodical \nexecution of Rwandan refugees still hiding in the former Zaire by the \nCongolese military. Unless these atrocities are halted, Mr. Kabila \nshould not expect ready support in the United States for his efforts to \nrebuild his country.\n  News reports the last several weeks have alleged the existence of \nmass grave sites of Rwandan refugees. As of yet, we do not know for \ncertain if these reports are accurate, and if so, by whose hands the \nrefugees were slaughtered. A team of United Nations investigators \narrived in Congo last week to initiate an investigation of these \nclaims. Media reports of Congolese government directives to hinder this \ninvestigation, if accurate, are intolerable. The government of Congo \nmust bring to an immediate end the persecution of the remaining Rwandan \nrefugees, and actively assist the U.N. in its efforts to locate and \nrepatriate these Rwandan nationals.\n  According to reports of the United Nations and various \nnongovernmental organizations, thousands of Rwandan refugees continue \nto hide in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.N. High Commissioner \nfor Refugees estimates that between 200,000 and 250,000 refugees are \nstill missing in Congo. While the actual number may be uncertain, what \nis clear is that a significant number of Rwandan refugees remain within \nCongolese borders.\n  These refugees consist mostly of Rwandan Hutus who fled their country \nafter the 1994 genocide that took the lives of an estimated 800,000 \nTutsis and moderate Hutus. Despite the large numbers of refugees who \nhave already returned to their homes in Rwanda, a considerable number \nremain in Congo, many of them women and children. Many are exhausted \nand weak from almost three years of constant movement, malnutrition and \nillness.\n  Clearly there exists the very real likelihood that among the Rwandan \nrefugees who remain in Congo are those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan \ngenocide. If so, they should be returned to Rwanda and held accountable \nfor their crimes before their own countrymen at the International War \nCrimes Tribunal. There is absolutely no justification for the execution \nof any Rwandan refugee in Congo.\n  Unfortunately, reports of persecution of Rwandan refugees in Kabila's \nCongo are not entirely new. Such claims have been associated with the \nAlliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo since its \nearly battlefield victories in eastern Zaire. However, Laurent Kabila \nearlier this month in a meeting with Ambassador Bill Richardson \ncommitted himself to assist international efforts to account for and \nrepatriate Rwandan refugees in his country. The successful resolution \nof the refugee issue in Congo has serious consequences for the future \nof his country.\n  Failure to follow through on this commitment seriously calls into \nquestion the credibility of the Kabila government to deliver on its \npromises to the world and its own people. The U.N. team in Congo so far \nhas not encountered any difficulties. If Mr. Kabila expects to receive \nthe support of the international community, it is imperative that he \nfulfill his earlier pledge and secure the access the United Nations \nneeds to locate and repatriate the refugees. If Mr. Kabila does not \nlive up to his existing commitments on the issue of the Rwandan \nrefugees, it's unclear what confidence there will be for his promises \nof democracy and peace for the Congolese people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6383-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6383-S6384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENIOR CITIZENS' MEDICARE FREEDOM TO CONTRACT ACT\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise as the sponsor of the Senior \nCitizens Medicare Freedom to Contract Act. The act would provide a \ntechnical correction in the Medicare Technical Corrections Act of 1994 \n(42 USCS section 1395, et. seq.), which was signed into law in November \n1995.\n  The Medicare Technical Corrections Act of 1994 contained a subtle--\nand, based on the Congressional Record, clearly unintended--change in \nstatutory language.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] interprets this \nchange as expanding existing restrictions on private payments in \nMedicare cases in which claims are filed, to all cases involving \nMedicare enrolled individuals, regardless of whether a claim is filed.\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\n  If HCFA imposes this interpretation through regulations reportedly \nnow being drafted, HCFA would have the authority to completely prohibit \nMedicare enrolled who do not submit reimbursement claims to HCFA, and \nwho do not have claims submitted on their behalf, and who are willing \nto pay their own bills in full--from paying non-Medicare physicians out \nof pocket for needed Medicare-covered services.\n  Even without the regulations, the view of HCFA is clear.\n  HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladek states that the ``law requires that \nphysicians submit claims on behalf of beneficiaries. Violations of \nthese requirements are subject to sanctions such as civil monetary \npenalties and exclusion from Medicare.''\n  Tom Ault, HCFA Director of Policy Development, has said that ``for \ndoctors to implement private contracts is illegal.''\n  HCFA's Director of the Bureau of Policy, Kathleen Buto, states that: \nA physician can choose not to treat Medicare beneficiaries. However, \nonce a physician renders services to a Medicare beneficiary, he or she \nis subject to Medicare's requirements and regulations, regardless of \nthe physician's participation as a Medicare provider. A physician's \nfailure to comply with the claim filing requirement violates Medicare \nlaw and subjects him or her to possible monetary penalties.\n  Clearly, this change does not reflect the intent of the Congress.\n  If HCFA's interpretation is imposed by regulation, the result will be \nthat seniors not have the right to choose treatments for which they can \nafford to pay in full to a non-Medicare participating physician.\n  This will occur due to the fact that many physicians and other \nproviders are unwilling to participate in Medicare since Medicare \nreimbursement frequently covers only 70 to 75 percent of the actual \ncost of care.\n  Under HCFA's proposed regulations, physicians and other providers, \nwho do not participate in Medicare, would be prohibited from accepting \nprivate payments for their services.\n  Congress clearly never intended this result.\n  Nor does this change reflect the will of the American people.\n  In a November 5, 1996, Wirthlin Worldwide Poll, 60 percent believe \nthat Americans should be able to add their own money to Government \npayments in order to get unrationed health services.\n  Surely, a law that made it illegal to supplement with private funds \nthe amount received from Social Security would be met with disbelief \nand derision.\n  But this is exactly what HCFA has threatened to do, thereby \nrestricting health care choice for seniors.\n  HCFA's policy would also end the practice of cost shifting, whereby \ndoctors have an incentive to treat more Medicare patients who can't \nafford to supplement Medicare's low-reimbursement rate with funds from \nthose who choose to pay out of pocket.\n  To address this problem, senior citizens' medicare freedom to \ncontract amendment simply states: ``[n]othing * * * shall prohibit a \nphysician or other provider who does not provide items or services \nunder the Medicare Program from entering into a private contract with a \nMedicare beneficiary for health services for which no claim for payment \nis submitted * * * section 1805(a)].''\n  Because the strategy for enactment has changed, the bill was not \nintroduced in the 105th Congress.\n  However, in the 104th Congress, this legislation was cosponsored by \nSenators Lott, Craig, Gregg, Cochran, Nunn, Helms, Faircloth, Bennett, \nKempthorne, Mack, Murkowski, and Inhofe.\n  This legislation is strongly supported by the American Medical \nAssociation, the Seniors Coalition, the National Right to Life \nCommittee, and several other national health care organizations.\n  Although this legislation has not yet been scored by the CBO, \nallowing seniors to pay for services rather than submitting claims to \nHCFA would plausibly be viewed by the CBO as a budgetary savings for \npurposes of the Byrd rule.\n  Furthermore, this legislation calls for HCFA to report to Congress in \n2002 regarding the impact of this legislation on Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this technical \nclarification to the Medicare statute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6383-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE NEW HAVEN LIGHT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, our friend and former colleague in \nthis body, Paul Simon, has always been outspoken in his leadership on \nnational issues. He continues to contribute to the national debate as \nthe director of the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois \nUniversity in Carbondale.\n  Paul recently gathered together a number of former Senators to \nconsider the issue of Social Security. The group developed a Social \nSecurity proposal which they believe will provide a solvent Social \nSecurity system for the next 75 years.\n  I ask that the letter I received from this group be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The letter follows:\n\n         Public Policy Institute, Southern Illinois University at \n           Carbondale,\n                                     Carbondale, IL, May 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Friend: Four of us--your former colleagues, two \n     Republicans and two Democrats--who will not be seeking office \n     again recently met to discuss an issue of great importance to \n     the nation: the future of Social Security's retirement trust \n     fund.\n       If this problem is not addressed immediately, the \n     difficulties will mount and the long-run picture for both the \n     fund and the confidence in our system of government is grim. \n     The sooner you address this problem, the easier it will be to \n     resolve. Postponing responsible action may be temporarily \n     politically attractive, but history will be harsh on those \n     who ducked when action was needed.\n       We believe that salvaging Social Security requires these \n     two fundamental changes:\n       1. Congress should act to correct the Consumer Price Index \n     to reflect reality.\n       2. Congress should remove the cap on the taxable amount of \n     income covered by Social Security.\n       The fundamental decisions on the future of Social Security \n     should not be in the hands of technicians, but in the hands \n     of those who are elected by the people to reflect the values \n     of this nation and to make fundamental decisions.\n       If you accept the recommendations we make, you will provide \n     the nation with a solvent Social Security retirement system, \n     along with a much healthier fiscal base.\n       If the sacrifices that we call upon people to make are \n     accepted, the trust fund should be secure for the lifetime of \n     our children and grandchildren. That is no small gift to the \n     future of our nation. You are in a position to make that \n     contribution.\n       This is a time that calls for your leadership. We \n     respectfully ask you to meet this challenge.\n     John Danforth.\n     Paul Simon.\n     David Pryor.\n     Alan Simpson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6384-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6384-S6385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TOM HARTMANN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nTom Hartmann as he celebrates seventy-five wonderful years. Tom has \nbeen a cornerstone of academic life at Rutgers University, and he has \nmade equally significant contributions to political\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nand civic life in the State of New Jersey. It is a pleasure for me to \nbe able to honor his past accomplishments.\n  Prior to his academic career, Tom served admirably in the United \nStates Marine Corps, flying 89 combat missions in the Pacific as a dive \nbomber pilot, during World War II. As a result of his efforts, he \nreceived the Navy Cross for valor. Upon returning to the United States, \nTom transferred his sense of duty to the community. As the Associate \nDirector of the New Jersey Office of Economic Opportunity, and then as \nDeputy Director of the Governor's commission on the Newark riots, Tom \nhas played an important role in promoting better community relations \nwithin the State of New Jersey.\n  As a Rutgers alumnus, I am proud to say that I have known Tom \nHartmann personally. Tom's integrity and commitment to New Jersey's \nyouth are two of the qualities I have admired most. He has worked to \npass these same qualities along to the thousands of students who have \nsat in his classes or listened to him speak. There is no mistaking the \nsheer joy Tom has brought to his profession.\n  Without his guidance and counseling, few Rutgers students would be as \nsuccessful as they are today. This impact has been felt most in the \npolitical arena as Rutgers students have sought to make a name for \nthemselves. A number of state and national government officials, \nincluding myself, have been the direct recipients of his advice. It is \nfair to say that Tom has a gift for crystallizing a student's goals and \ntalents in order to make some of the most difficult career decisions \neasy.\n  Tom's political astuteness is well-known at all levels of government. \nHe worked closely with my predecessor, Senator Bradley, for many years \non some of the most complex issues of our time. I have sought advice \nfrom Tom on more than one occasion, and his counsel has been welcome. \nTom's ability to assess the political implications of any decision is \ntruly invaluable, and I thank him for the years of support he has \nprovided.\n  Tom's contributions have done much for the future of New Jersey, and \nour nation as a whole. I congratulate Tom on a job well done, and I \nwish him the best for seventy-five more years of happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6384-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-8\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, on behalf of the City of Chicago, \nand the State of Illinois, I would like to offer this Senate Resolution \nwith my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Dick Durbin, \ncongratulating the Chicago Bulls for winning the 1997 National \nBasketball Association Championship.\n  The Bulls have now repeated, once again, as champions--winning for \nthe fifth time in seven years. This year's triumph expands the team's \nindisputable place in history.\n  I say to my colleagues from Utah, Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett, \nthat their great State of Utah was well represented in this \nchampionship series that ended Friday in Chicago. We should all applaud \nthe Utah Jazz for a successful season, and an enormously exciting NBA \nFinals.\n  The Bulls have put together an exceptional season and a remarkable \ndynasty. There should be no doubt that the Bulls are the best team in \nthe 50 year history of the NBA, and that Michael Jordan is the best \nplayer. Despite suffering from flu-like symptoms, Jordan scored a \ndramatic 38 points in game 5 to lift his team to a crucial victory. To \nsay ``His Airness'' is the Most Valuable Player is truly an \nunderstatement.\n  And each and every Bulls player is a superb individual basketball \nplayer. What makes them all so very special is the way they have come \ntogether, under Coach Phil Jackson's guidance, to blend their talents \nas the team, playing in a way that makes each of them better. That is \nthe real hallmark of champions.\n  The Bulls have become a national and international sensation. They \nhave brought millions together as fans and as admirers. Bulls fever \ncuts across race and ethnic lines and knows no national boundary. You \ncan go to the far reaches of the globe and see a Bulls hat, or a \nMichael Jordan jersey.\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\n  In recognition of the Bulls' historic accomplishment, it is my \npleasure to offer this congratulatory resolution, and I urge my \ncolleagues to swiftly approve its passage.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I have spoken before this body several \ntimes about the serious problems in the FBI crime lab. The Justice \nDepartment's Inspector General has done the country a great service by \nuncovering the sloppiness and wrongdoing of certain lab examiners.\n  A dozen such examiners are criticized in the IG's April 15 report for \ntestifying beyond their expertise, and for changing lab reports. The IG \nfound no criminal violations. Yet the wrongful testimony and the \naltering of reports by these examiners almost all redounded to the \nbenefit of the prosecution, rather than to the defendant.\n  This is a curious phenomenon, in my mind. Why weren't the changes \nmore randomly distributed? How come they all benefitted the \nprosecution? Those are rather obvious questions.\n  And so I thought a lot about what was done by the IG to determine \nmotive or intent on the part of the examiners whose actions he \ncriticized. And I have come to the conclusion that the IG's methodology \nwas insufficient for determining motive or intent. And so, further \ninvestigation is warranted.\n  The reasons for why further investigation is warranted were laid out \nin a letter I sent to the Attorney General on June 11. For starters, \nthere was the April 16 Wall Street Journal front-page story on lab \nexaminer Michael Malone. In that article, Agent Malone is cited for \nimproper testimony in several cases, by judges and others.\n  The Wall Street Journal broke new ground in uncovering problems in \nthe FBI lab. First, it showed that wrongdoing by lab examiners has not \nbeen relegated to the three units investigated by the IG. Malone was \nassigned to a fourth unit--hairs and fibers. And second, it underscored \nthe fundamental flaw in the IG's investigative methodology; namely, \nthat it failed to review, for patterns of wrongdoing, all the cases of \neach examiner who was severely criticized in his report.\n  To illustrate the point, it is interesting to note that in the IG's \nreport, Agent Malone is criticized for wrongdoing in only one case--\nthat of Alcee L. Hastings. Yet, the Journal reporter researched open-\nsource case data and found numerous instances of apparent wrongdoing by \nMalone in other cases. If an enterprising reporter could do such a \nreview, why couldn't the IG?\n  And so I asked the Attorney General to conduct further investigation \nof those examiners, including Malone, who were severely criticized in \nthe IG report. All cases worked on by each one of these examiners \nshould be reviewed independently to determine if there is a pattern \nsimilar to what the Journal found in the case of Malone. Only then \nwould we see the full scope of each agent's actions. If any patterns \nexist, those cases should be reviewed for administrative action, for \nundisclosed Brady material, for civil liability, or for misconduct \ninvolving obstruction of justice or perjury.\n  There's some importance and urgency attached to my request. I \nunderstand that the IG has referred the findings of his report to the \nPubic Integrity Section for possible criminal prosecution. In my view, \nthey have been referred without sufficient follow-up investigation, \nthereby increasing the likelihood of declinations. I do not intend to \nstand by and watch declinations being handed out when some very obvious \nstones have been left unturned.\n  My request was that the following agents' cases be reviewed by DOJ \nprior to any decision by Pubic Integrity:\n  For possible involvement in altering reports: J. Thomas Thurman; J. \nChristopher Ronay; Wallace Higgins; David Williams; Alan Jordan.\n  For possible false testimony: David Williams, Roger Martz; Charles \nCalfee; Terry Rudolph; Michael Malone; John Hicks; Richard Hahn.\n  For possible undisclosed Brady material: Robert Webb.\n  On April 16, I met with the IG, Michael Bromwich, and raised with him \nthe subject of the Wall Street Journal article on Malone. I discussed \nmy belief that his methodology was flawed, and that I would request in \nwriting, after studying his report, that all cases involving lab \nexaminers whose work he severely criticized in his report be \ninvestigated further. Thus, the IG has been aware for some time that my \nrequest would be forthcoming.\n  In my discussions with the IG on April 16, one notable issue came up. \nI asked the IG if he had found possible criminal wrongdoing on the part \nof any of the lab personnel. He said ``no.'' I then asked him if he had \ndetected a patter of wrongdoing by any agent, as the Journal seemed to \nfind with Malone. He said ``no.'' I asked him if he even reviewed all \nthe cases of any of the criticized agents. He said ``no.''\n  These responses are troubling to me because the IG has gone out of \nhis way to say he found no possible criminal activity by lab personnel. \nIt sounds to me like he didn't even look for it. In fact, he told me in \nmy office way back in February--well after his investigation was \nfinished--that it wasn't in his charter to look for possible criminal \nactivity. Therefore, due diligence requires further investigation such \nas I have requested. Otherwise, the public's full confidence cannot be \nrestored.\n  In a specific instance, for example, the IG had critized Agent \nWilliams for ``backwards science''; i.e., tailoring evidence at the \ncrime scene to evidence found elsewhere, such as at a suspect's home. I \nasked the IG if his finding of backwards science conducted by Williams \ndidn't warrant further investigation for possible criminal intent.\n  The IG responded that Williams gave a plausible explanation in his \ndefense; namely, that Williams actually believed that was the proper \nway to conduct an investigation--in other words, ``backwards.'' The IG \nsaid the five blue ribbon scientists who investigated the lab believed \nWilliams' explanation.\n  Mr. President, I could not believe my ears. First of all, the \nscientists are not prosecutors. Second, whether Williams' explanation \nwas believed or not, the IG should have reviewed the rest of Williams' \ncases.\n  Such a review would have shown one of two things: Either he did do \nall of his investigations backwards, in which case his explanation \nwould hold up but all of his cases should be considered suspect; or, he \ndid some investigations correctly and some backwards, in which case his \nexplanation would be undermined, and intent would be an issue. At the \nmoment, because of the IG's flawed methodology, we don't know which is \ncorrect.\n  The IG did not even review the second World Trade Center case to see \nif Williams gave similarly false testimony in court, as he had in the \nfirst World Trade Center case. I understand Williams' testimony in the \nsecond case was the same as in the first case. If so, this might have \nestablished a pattern in the IG's investigation.\n  Meanwhile, at a May 13 hearing before the House Subcommittee on \nCrime, the IG admitted, under questioning from Congressman Robert \nWexler, that alterations to lab reports appeared to be biased in favor \nof the prosecution's position. This is a serious matter because it \ncould go to the issue of motive.\n  It is also not clear to me whether the IG was aware of an FBI \ninternal review in 1994 and 1995 of alterations and changes of lab \nreports after allegations were made by two lab scientists. James Corby, \nchief of the Materials Analysis Unit, conducted the review. Dr. Corby \nverified numerous instances of alterations, many of which were material \nchanges. He concluded that they were clearly intentional. In a memo to \nhis section chief, J.J. Kearney, dated January 13, 1995, Dr. Corby \nstated the following, with respect to the intentional changes:\n\n       A[n] FBI Laboratory report is evidence. Often times the \n     report itself is entered into evidence during the trial \n     proceedings. The fact that SSA [redacted name] did make \n     unauthorized changes in these reports could have resulted in \n     serious consequences during legal proceedings and \n     embarrassment to the Laboratory as well as the entire FBI.\n\n  The FBI's Office of the General Counsel [OGC] apparently concurred. A \nmemorandum from General Counsel Howard Shapiro to the Lab's director, \nM.E. Ahlerich, dated June 12, 1995, reiterated the lab's policy of not \naltering\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\nreports, and warned that, ``* * * failure to follow this policy could \nsubject the FBI and/or individual employees to civil or criminal \nliability.''\n  Mr. President, I previously placed these documents in the Record on \nMarch 20, 1997.\n  The documents and arguments I have advanced on this issue present a \ncompelling case for further investigation. We have yet to hear an \nequally compelling counter-argument from either the Attorney General, \nor the IG. The issue of my request came up at the Attorney General's \nweekly press conference of June 12. A wire story later that evening by \nthe Associated Press, quoted Ms. Reno as simply saying the following:\n\n       We have not seen any basis for criminal inquiry.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know whether or not the Attorney General had \nread my letter before giving that quote. But I assure you, that if the \nAG had read it, she would see there is plenty of basis for criminal \ninquiry.\n  I also asked Ms. Reno for a response by last week. I have yet to hear \na peep out of her office. In my view, the Attorney General needs to act \nquickly and provide a compelling rebuttal to the facts I laid out in my \nJune 11 letter to her. To simply say ``We have not seen any basis for \ncriminal inquiry'' is simply not credible. I, for one, have seen \nsufficient basis.\n  In the same June 12 AP story, the IG took issue with my statement \nthat he did not do a criminal investigation. The IG said he did a \nhybrid, criminal/administrative inquiry. The IG may not recall the \nconversation we had in my office in February. He was asked to respond \nto a comment in a letter I had received dated February 21, 1997 from \nthen-Deputy FBI Director Weldon Kennedy. The comment was the following:\n\n       * * * [T]he Department of Justice Office of the Inspector \n     General found no instances of perjury, evidence tampering, \n     evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory \n     evidence.\n\n  In my office, the IG was asked if he even looked for that. He \nresponded no, because that wasn't in his charter.\n  Regardless of what is or isn't in his charter, the fact is the IG did \nnothing to establish intent. If he wants to cite the questioning of \nDavid Williams and the backwards science as a probing of intent, well \nI'll simply rest my case.\n  It is not my intention to criticize the IG's work. To the contrary, I \nconsider it a landmark effort and an important service for the American \npeople. I have nothing but praise for Mr. Bromwich, his team of \ninvestigators, and the five blue ribbon scientists.\n  But it cannot stop there. There are too many stones left unturned. \nThere is a culture that needs reforming. There's still a cowboy element \nrunning loose in that lab.\n  It seems to me that the IG investigation is merely a point of \ndeparture. It identified individuals whose work should be more \nthoroughly scrutinized. Failure to conduct follow-up investigation can \nonly further erode the public's dwindling confidence in Federal law \nenforcement.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. President, I await the Attorney General's overdue \nresponse to my letter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6387-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6388-S6391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IGNORING THE FACTS AND TWISTING THE TRUTH\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I would like to talk about two \nletters from the Department of Defense, DOD.\n  The first letter is dated June 11, 1997.\n  The second one is dated June 13, 1997--just 2 days later.\n  Both letters are addressed to the editor of The Hill newspaper, Mr. \nAlbert Eisele.\n  Both are signed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public \nAffairs, Mr. Kenneth H. Bacon.\n  Both were written in response to an article I wrote about Mr. John \nHamre in the June 4 issue of the Hill.\n  Mr. Hamre is the Chief Financial Officer at the Pentagon.\n  He has been selected by Secretary Cohen to become the next Deputy \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I oppose this nomination for the reason I gave in the Hill article.\n  Mr. Hamre is aggressively pursuing a progess payment policy that the \ninspector general has declared illegal.\n  Mr. Bacon charges that my article ignores the facts and twists the \ntruth.\n  Ironically, Mr. Bacon's letters prove he is the one who ignores the \nfacts and twists the truth.\n  He sent the second letter to correct misinformation in the first one.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have his letters and my \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Assistant Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1997.\n     Albert Eisele,\n     Editor, The Hill, Washington, DC.\n       Letter to the Editor: Last week Senator Charles Grassley \n     authored an article condemning John Hamre, currently the \n     Comptroller at DoD and the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense (``Sen. Grassley looks for missing $50 billion at \n     DoD,'' June 4, 1997). It is a serious distortion of Mr. \n     Hamre's record. The facts actually prove the opposite of \n     Senator Grassley's contentions. It is imperative that The \n     Hill publish a correction.\n       First, Senator Grassley stated ``the books at DoD are in \n     such shambles that as much as $50 billion cannot be traced.'' \n     DoD's books were in very bad shape when Mr. Hamre signed on \n     back in 1993, and they are still troubled, but the facts show \n     that the situation is dramatically improved. Back in 1993, \n     DoD's so-called ``problem disbursements'' exceeded $34 \n     billion. Last month the total was under $8 billion, a 74% \n     reduction in three years.\n       Second, Senator Grassley stated that Mr. Hamre has left \n     DoD's funds vulnerable to theft and abuse. The facts are \n     quite different. Mr. Hamre created a dedicated organization--\n     Operation Mongoose--to undertake fraud detection and \n     prevention. He and the DoD Inspector General have hosted \n     governmentwide conferences on fraud prevention. Mr. Hamre is \n     the first, and to my understanding the only, Comptroller that \n     ever initiated an anti-deficiency investigation on himself, \n     asking the DoD Inspector General to review accounts under his \n     jurisdiction.\n       Third, Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``presided over a \n     scheme'' to make illegal process payments. Again, the facts \n     are quite different. Mr. Hamre, working with the DoD \n     Inspector General, has carried out the IG's recommendations \n     on progress payments. Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``tried \n     to legalize the crime'' by proposing legislative changes \n     concerning progress payments. That legislation was first \n     proposed by the Inspector General.\n       Fourth, Sen. Grassley claims Hamre understated his problems \n     through ``a clever bureaucratic trick to make the problem \n     look a lot smaller than it really is.'' The facts are rather \n     different. Rather than report three categories of problem \n     disbursements together, he reported all three categories in \n     two separate tables. None of the data has been dropped and \n     all of it is made available every month to the General \n     Accounting Office.\n       Reading Sen. Grassley's article is like looking at a \n     distortion mirror in an amusement park. The image he paints \n     is wildly distorted and in most cases is totally reversed \n     from the truth. Facts do matter, even in Washington, and \n     Senator Grassley has not presented the facts.\n\n                                             Kenneth H.

Grassley Looks for Missing $50 Billion at DoD\n\n\nAge-old practice of cooking the books at the Pentagon is alive and well\n\n                     (By Sen. Charles E. Grassley)\n\n       Between 1989 and 1993, a man named James Edward McGill was \n     paid $3,025,677.99 by the United States Navy for phony \n     claims. With nothing more than a mailbox, a couple of rubber \n     stamps and blank government forms, McGill set up a business \n     to cheat the taxpayers. He delivered no goods. He did no \n     work. But he had no trouble doing business with the Navy. \n     Pure chance, rather than internal controls at the Defense \n     Department (DoD), put an end to this scam. Unfortunately for \n     the taxpayers, the McGill case does not stand alone.\n       The sad truth is, the books at the DoD are in such shambles \n     that as much as $50 billion cannot be traced. The department \n     flunks every single audit by its chief financial officer \n     (CFO). And the inspector general (IG) expects the DoD to \n     continue falling short ``well into the next century.'' When \n     you can't audit the books, you don't know how money is being \n     spent. The result is a multi-million dollar money pipe left \n     vulnerable to theft and abuse.\n       The problem described here is exacerbated by an illegal \n     operation used by the Pentagon to make progress payments on \n     contracts. Under this policy, payments are deliberately \n     charged to the wrong accounts. Once payments are made, the \n     DoD attempts to ``adjust'' the accounting ledgers to make it \n     look as though the checks were charged to the right accounts \n     when the money was, in fact, charged to some other account. \n     The entire process leads to over-, under-and erroneous \n     payments.\n       Presiding over this scheme since October 1993 has been the \n     comptroller and CFO for the DoD, John J. Hamre. In his \n     official position, Hamre is responsible under the Chief \n     Financial Officer Act of 1990 ``to strengthen internal \n     controls and improve financial accounting.'' However, instead \n     of meeting a pledge to reform the process, Hamre tried to \n     legalize the crime. Earlier this year, he circulated for \n     comment draft legislation to sanction the payment procedures \n     declared illegal by the IG and authorized by Hamre at CFO.\n       A fundamental issue is at stake. In 1992, the IG stated \n     that the DoD's progress payment procedures ``result in the \n     rendering of false accounts and violations'' of Title \n     31,Section 1301 of the U.S. Code. This law embodies a sacred \n     constitutional principle. Only Congress decides how public \n     money may be spent. Section 1301 requires that public money \n     be spent as proscribed in the appropriations acts. \n     Congressional committees spend considerable effort each year \n     segregating public money in different accounts. For example, \n     the DoD appropriations bill might require procurement money \n     be used for production work and not for R purposes. Hamre's \n     payment policy shatters the integrity of the appropriations \n     accounts. It spends money according to an arbitrary scheme \n     dreamed up by DoD bureaucrats.\n       While this payment scheme was in place before Hamre's time, \n     he had a golden opportunity to fix this problem. But every \n     time the issue has popped up on his radar screen he's \n     protected the scheme. Under his leadership, the DoD's \n     progress payment operation has flourished and achieved a new \n     level of sophistication.\n       When Hamre became CFO he, in fact, did declare war on \n     financial mismanagement. Today, he cites ``steep drops in \n     contract overpayments.'' But his claims are not supported by \n     the facts. Three reports of the General Accounting Office \n     (GAO) issued during the last three years contradict Hamre's \n     success stories. The most recent analysis of the GAO \n     concludes that the DoD's progress payment scheme is the \n     biggest single driver behind overpayments. And each of these \n     reports shows that the DoD has no check in place to detect \n     overpayments. Virtually every overpayment ever examined by \n     the GAO was detected by recipients of checks, not by the \n     government. In most cases, contractors voluntarily refunded \n     the overpayments.\n       If Hamre was serious about eliminating overpayments,  why \n     didn't he shut down the progress payments operation? If he \n     has no capability whatsoever to detect overpayments, where \n     does he get the data that shows a steep drop in such \n     payments? How does he know they are going down if he \n     doesn't know how many there are? Perhaps this means the \n     contractors are no longer making voluntary refunds.\n       Hamre also has claimed his financial reforms have produced \n     sharp drops in unmatched disbursements. Again, the claims \n     don't stand up to scrutiny. In fact, Hamre has used a clever \n     bureaucratic trick to make the problem look a lot smaller \n     than it really is. In December 1996, he issued a decree that \n     arbitrarily redefined the entire universe of problem \n     disbursements. He simply made the universe smaller by \n     excluding huge numbers of unreconciled disbursements from the \n     totals appearing in official reports. This was not missed by \n     the GAO. In yet another report, the independent analysts \n     challenged Hamre's approach. The GAO concluded that the DoD \n     is understating the size of problem disbursements by at least \n     $25 billion. So, instead of the $18 billion claimed by Hamre, \n     at least $50 billion of tax dollars are unaccounted for.\n       Because of these facts, I stand opposed to the nomination \n     of Hamre for deputy secretary of defense. My personal \n     feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my position, as \n     charged by some. Rather, I have reached my conclusion based \n     on the facts. If government does not hold accountable the \n     official who is responsible by law, then who?\n       While Hamre inherited a major problem caused by years of \n     neglect, he took aggressive action to perpetuate the mess. \n     True, Hamre has made a lot of promises and statements about \n     reforming the process. But good intentions never get the job \n     done at the Pentagon. The bottom line is, these kinds of \n     problems cannot be corrected unless those in charge are held \n     accountable. Awarding promotions to leadership that drops the \n     ball is a green light for con artists like James Edward \n     McGill.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think it would be very helpful to make \na side-by-side comparison of these two letters.\n  It would help bring my main point about Mr. Hamre into sharper focus.\n  Mr. Bacon's two letters are identical in every respect but one.\n  A major discrepancy exists between the last paragraph on the first \npage of the first letter and the same paragraph in the second letter.\n  I would like to quote from that portion of the first letter.\n  This is Mr. Bacon talking:\n\n       Senator Grassley claimed Hamre presided over a scheme to \n     make illegal progress payments. Again, the facts are quite \n     different. Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD IG, has carried \n     out the IG's recommendations on progress payments. Senator \n     Grassley claimed Hamre tried to legalize the crime by \n     proposing legislative changes concerning progress payments.\n       That legislation was first proposed by the IG.\n\n  Mr. Bacon's statements do not square with the facts. They are \ninaccurate.\n  Mr. President, I pride myself on always doing my homework and always \nsticking to the facts.\n  My article on Mr. Hamre's illegal progress payment policy is no \nexception.\n  I have documents to back up every point I have made.\n  From day one, I have never strayed from the facts and conclusions \npresented by the DOD IG.\n  From day one, the IG and legal counsel have maintained that the \ndepartment's progress payment policy ``results in the rendering of \nfalse accounts and violation of the law.''\n  Nothing has changed since the IG issued its report in March 1992.\n  The illegal progress payment policy remains in effect at this very \nmoment.\n  The IG has consistently maintained that the ``status quo is \nunacceptable'' and that the policy must be brought into compliance with \nthe law.\n  After 5 years of unproductive meetings, the IG recommended that the \ndepartment seek ``legislative relief.''\n  The IG proposed a temporary exemption from the law, while the \nprogress payment operation was being overhauled.\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n  But when the draft language hit the street late 1996, it was not at \nall what the IG had in mind.\n  This language was drafted by the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService but was Mr. Hamre's brain child.\n  It was far reaching, comprehensive and permanent.\n  The IG and legal counsel came unglued when they saw it and killed it \nin the end.\n  Mr. President, those are the facts--according to the IG--not \naccording to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. Bacon's first letter is out of sync with the facts.\n  When the IG, Ms. Eleanor Hill, saw Mr. Bacon's first letter, I am \ntold, she blew her top.\n  She picked up the phone and called Mr. Bacon. He was on travel, but \nhis principal deputy, Mr. Bernath, was in his office over at the \nPentagon.\n  She confronted him with the truth.\n  He agreed right then and there to retract the false and misleading \nstatements in Mr. Bacon's first letter.\n  Mr. President, that's how we ended up with Mr. Bacon's second letter.\n  I would now like to quote from the revised portion of his second \nletter:\n\n       Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD IG, is working to carry out \n     the IG's recommendations on progress payments. Senator \n     Grassley claimed Hamre tried to legalize the crime by \n     proposing legislative changes concerning progress payments. \n     Prior to proposing legislation, Mr. Hamre had discussed with \n     the DOD IG the possibility of seeking legislative relief if \n     it was too difficult for the department to comply with the \n     current statute.\n\n  These revisions give Mr. Bacon's letter an entirely new meaning.\n  ``Is working to carry out'' is a far cry from ``has carried out.''\n  ``Discussed with the DOD IG'' is a far cry from ``first proposed by \nthe DOD IG.''\n  The revisions--demanded by the IG--strengthen my main point, Mr. \nPresident. They showcase Mr. Hamre's shortcomings.\n  I need to thank Mr. Bacon.\n  His letters make my case:\n  Mr. Hamre has failed to carry out the IG's recommendations and bring \nhis policy into compliance with the law.\n  Mr. Hamre's policy continues to operate outside the law at this very \nmoment, and that's exactly why he felt like he needed legislation.\n  He needed to cover his back side.\n  He needed legal cover for his illegal policy.\n  Now, I would like to commend Mr. Bacon for being more truthful and \naccurate.\n  But there's one little problem.\n  His first letter still stands as a matter of record.\n  Where did the misinformation come from in the first place?\n  Did Mr. Bacon dream it up by himself? Or did someone set him up? If \nso, who? Did Mr. Hamre have any knowledge of this letter?\n  Mr. President, I have written Mr. Bacon. He needs to answer my \nquestions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Kenneth H. Bacon,\n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bacon: I am writing in response to your letters of \n     June 11, 1997 and June 13, 1997, to Mr. Albert Eisele, Editor \n     of The Hill.\n       Your letters attempt to address some of the points I raised \n     in an editorial piece, which appeared in the June 4, 1997 \n     issue of The Hill.\n       Mr. Bacon, you suggest that I have distorted the truth and \n     ignored the facts. On the contrary, I pride myself on doing \n     my homework and always sticking to the facts, and my article \n     on Mr. Hamre's illegal progress payments policy is no \n     exception. Ironically, it is clear from the revisions you \n     were forced to make in your second letter--to correct errors \n     you made in your first letter--that it is you who has ignored \n     the facts and distorted the truth.\n       From day one, I have never strayed from the facts and the \n     conclusions presented by the Department of Defense (DOD) \n     Inspector General (IG). From day one, the IG and legal \n     counsel have maintained that the department's progress \n     payment policy ``results in the rendering of false accounts \n     and violation of the law.'' Nothing has changed since the IG \n     issued its report in March 1992. The illegal progress payment \n     policy remains in effect at this moment. From day one, the IG \n     has maintained that ``the status quo is unacceptable'' and \n     the policy must be brought into compliance with the law. \n     After five years of endless meetings and ``seeing no light at \n     the end of the tunnel,'' the IG recommended that the \n     department consider seeking ``legislative relief.'' The idea \n     was to obtain a temporary exemption from the law--while the \n     progress payment operation was overhauled. The language \n     itself was drafted at Mr. Hamre's direction--not by the IG \n     but by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. When that \n     language hit the street, it was not at all what the IG had \n     envisioned. It was far reaching and comprehensive and \n     permanent. The IG and legal counsel expressed strong \n     objections to it and killed it in the end.\n       Those are the facts, Mr. Bacon. If you have any questions \n     about the facts, I suggest you contact the IG. You need to \n     talk with Mr. Bob Lieberman. He is the Assistant IG for \n     Auditing. His number is 703-604-8901. He will set you \n     straight. He knows the progress payments issue from top to \n     bottom and beginning to end. He's the expert.\n       When you speak to Mr. Lieberman, you will quickly discover \n     that you are the one who departed from the facts. You will \n     quickly discover that your first letter contains inaccurate, \n     misleading, and even false information. This is the most \n     offensive portion of your letter:\n       ``Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD Inspector General, has \n     carried out the IG's recommendations on progress payments. \n     Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``tried to legalize the \n     crime'' by proposing legislative changes concerning progress \n     payments. That legislation was first proposed by the \n     Inspector General.''\n       After you signed and mailed this letter to the Hill, I was \n     given a copy. I immediately realized that your primary \n     assertion was false. The suggestion that Mr. Hamre had \n     brought his progress payments policy into compliance with the \n     law was totally and completely wrong. It did not square with \n     the facts--as I know them. So I sent your letter to the IG \n     for comment to make sure I wasn't off base. I have been told \n     that the IG, Ms. Eleanor Hill, was enraged when she saw that \n     statement. She called your office to complain. You were on \n     travel, but she spoke with your deputy. He agreed to retract \n     your false and misleading statements. As a result of the IG's \n     complaint, you sent a second, revised letter to The Hill. \n     This one is dated June 13, 1997. The false statements have \n     been removed from this letter. They have been replaced by \n     statements that constitute a fairly accurate reflection of \n     the facts. The revised statement is as follows:\n       ``Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD Inspector General, is \n     working to carry out the IG's recommendations on progress \n     payments. Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``tried to legalize \n     the crime'' by proposing legislative changes concerning \n     progress payments. Prior to proposing legislation, Mr. Hamre \n     had discussed with the DOD Inspector General the possibility \n     of seeking legislative relief if it was too difficult for the \n     Department to comply with the current statute.''\n       Mr. Bacon, your second letter takes a big step in the right \n     direction. ``Is working to carry out'' is a far cry from \n     ``has carried out,'' and ``discussed with the DOD IG'' is a \n     far cry from ``first proposed by the DOD IG.'' Those \n     corrections conform with the facts as I understand them.\n       Mr. Bacon, the corrections you made in your second letter \n     strengthen my main point and showcase Mr. Hamre's \n     shortcomings. In fact, they make my case: Mr. Hamre has \n     failed to carry out the IG's recommendations and bring his \n     progress payment policy into compliance with the law. His \n     progress payment policy continues to operate outside of the \n     law at this very moment, and he knows it. That's exactly why \n     he proposed legislation. He wanted legal cover for an illegal \n     operation. He wanted to sanction a policy that the IG had \n     declared illegal and that he had personally authorized. As I \n     said, he wanted to legalize the crime. And finally, this \n     legislation was not dreamed up by the IG. It was the brain \n     child of Mr. Hamre and the Defense Finance and Accounting \n     Service.\n       I commend you for trying to be more accurate and truthful, \n     but your original letter still stands as a matter of record. \n     You signed and mailed it. How did that happen? Was the \n     misinformation of your own making, or did someone else set \n     you up? I would like some answers.\n       Mr. Bacon, I would like to understand the true origins of \n     the false information contained in your first letter. Is this \n     something you dreamed up on your own? If not, where did you \n     get the information? What organization within the department \n     provided this information? Please provide the name and title \n     of the person who supplied this information. And did you \n     discuss this particular piece of information with Mr. Hamre? \n     Did Mr. Hamre have any knowledge of this information? Was Mr. \n     Hamre aware of your letter before it was mailed to The Hill?\n       I request a response to my questions by June 24, 1997.\n       Your cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will take the time \nto make a side-by-side comparison of Mr. Bacon's first and second \nletter.\n  A side-by-side comparison of the two letters will help them to \nunderstand who is sticking to the facts and telling the truth, and who \nisn't.\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/25/senate-section/article/S6388-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
