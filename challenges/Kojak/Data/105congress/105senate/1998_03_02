Now we have the \nopportunity, but we are having difficulty getting Senators to come to \nthe floor and offer amendments. We need those amendments to be offered \ntoday. I believe we have had one amendment that has been offered and \naccepted, but we need others. We need to make really good progress this \nweek on this important legislation. Beginning on Wednesday or Thursday, \nwe will also, hopefully, be able to take up the funding or financing \namendments that may be offered.\n  We do have some items--only a few--but we have some items left on the \nExecutive Calendar that could be considered. Therefore, a rollcall vote \nis possible today. I had hoped that it would be on the bill itself. I \nunderstand now it may not be. So I am looking for an Executive Calendar \nnomination or two that might require a vote that we can take up.\n  I want to make it clear to the Senators, once again, there will be \nvotes on Mondays and there will be votes on Fridays so that we can get \nthe ISTEA bill done and the other important legislation we must get \ndone in March.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Kyl is here to seek recognition to talk \non an issue that is very important to me and the country with regard to \nhow we deal with the situation in Iraq.

Mr. President, we are well aware that an agreement was \nstruck this week by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi \nAnnan, and the Iraqi Government, led by Saddam Hussein, with respect to \nthe sites that Iraq agreed would be open to unfettered inspection at \nthe conclusion of the gulf war. Let me give a little history first.\n  Remember that the United States and the allied forces were prepared \nto carry the battle further, perhaps even to Saddam Hussein himself, \nbut the President of the United States judged that the battle could be \ncalled off if the Iraqi Government would agree to a series of \ncommitments to abide by the rule of law in the future. As a result, we \nstopped our military campaign against the Iraqi Army, and an agreement \nwas entered into between the Iraqi Government and the allied forces \nunder the jurisdiction of the United States in which the Iraqi \nGovernment made some very specific promises. The key promise was not to \ndevelop any weapons of mass destruction and to destroy everything that \nthey had.\n\n  To implement that commitment, an inspection regime was established, \nand the Iraqi Government agreed to allow unfettered inspection of its \ncountry in order to assure that it was abiding by the agreement not to \ndevelop and, indeed, to destroy any weapons of mass destruction that it \nmight already have.\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\n  From the day that agreement was signed, it has been violated \nrepeatedly by the Iraqi Government and Iraqi authorities, and it has \nbeen literally, Mr. President, a cat-and-mouse game between the U.N. \ninspectors under UNSCOM and the Iraqi Government. It seems that \nunfettered inspection has been permitted until the inspectors get \nwarm--like the old child's game, ``Am I getting warm yet?''--and as \nsoon as the inspectors would get warm, then there would be delay and \ndeception and denial and, if it were serious enough, outright barring \nof inspectors from a site or facility until the offending material had \nbeen whisked literally out the back door, in some cases, and then when \nthe site was clean, the front door would open, the inspectors would be \ninvited in and they would find, of course, nothing. That game went on \nfor a long time. Finally, the U.N. inspector said, ``Enough, this isn't \ngoing to work; every time we get warm, he stops us and we have to find \na way to enforce the agreement that Saddam had entered into.'' That is \nwhen the United States began to consider a bombing campaign as a means \nof at least attempting to degrade the weapons of mass destruction that \nIraq had developed.\n  A lot of people felt it probably wouldn't succeed because it is \ndifficult to find those caches of weapons, except for the ones that \nwere disclosed when Saddam Hussein's son-in-law defected to Jordan for \na while and indicated where this material was and our inspectors were \nable to go in and find it as a result of that, Saddam Hussein all of a \nsudden remembering that he had forgotten to tell us that that existed.\n  Except for that instance, we have been unsuccessful in being able to \nidentify much of these stocks. So it was problematic as to whether a \nbombing campaign would actually result in the destruction of this \nmaterial. As a result, a lot of people were pushing the administration \nprior to that bombing campaign to develop a broader strategy that would \nconsist of a wide array of actions that over time could result in \naddressing the real problem here, which everyone agrees is Saddam \nHussein himself. That broader strategy might consist of a series of \nactions that would destabilize his regime, would put more pressure on \nhim and would eventually perhaps result in a replacement of his \nGovernment, not by assassination, which is contrary to American policy, \nbut by means of the assistance of the people of Iraq.\n  Since the agreement by the U.N. Secretary General, the need for a \nresolution from the Congress supporting military action has been, in \neffect, put on hold, but I suggest that it is only on hold, that there \nwill come a time, sooner or later, when the United Nations will, again, \nbe faced with the question, and the United States as the primary actor \nhere, as to whether or not it is necessary to take some additional \naction.\n  As sure as we are here today, Mr. President, the Iraqis will violate \nthe terms of either the most recently agreed-upon regime for inspection \nor the remaining principles of inspection which apply to other than the \nso-called eight Presidential sites in Iraq. That would probably happen \nif, that is to say, we begin again to get warm, if our inspectors find \nsomething that they want to get into further.\n  At that point, we will begin to again see denial and deception by the \nIraqi Government. At that point, it is going to be relevant again \nwhether or not the American people, the world community and the \nCongress support action by the administration to deal with the then \nmost recent crisis. If the administration has developed a broad \nstrategy, the bombing campaign only being a part of that strategy, and \neveryone recognizing that it by itself is not going to solve the \nproblem, but as a part of an overall strategy can contribute to a \nsolution, then the President, I think, will have the support he needs \nto proceed with the execution of that plan.\n  But the development of that plan is critical, and that is why I think \nduring this interregnum, this period in which at least nominally \ninspections will be permitted and pressure of immediate military action \nhas receded, it is important for us in the Congress to work with the \nadministration to help it develop the outlines of such a policy. That \nis not our job, and I don't suggest that the Congress be the one to \ndevelop that broad strategy. That is the administration's prerogative; \nit is the administration's responsibility. It is its responsibility, \nand because many in Congress feel the administration has abdicated a \nsignificant part of that responsibility in the past, I think we have \nthe opportunity and we have the responsibility to share ideas with the \nadministration that it could put together in a broader strategy. If it \ndoes that, it will have the support of the Congress if and when that \ntime comes. That is why I think it is important for us to talk a little \nbit about the agreement that was entered into and about some \nalternative proposals that have been suggested, including one which I \nwill submit for the Record. A letter sent to the President by 28 \nprominent--prominent--American citizens offers their suggestions as to \nwhat might be done, most of which have also been offered by Members of \nthe Senate.\n  Before I close with that, let me indicate that when the majority \nleader took the floor last week to criticize the agreement that had \nbeen entered into between the Secretary General and Saddam Hussein, I \nsupported the remarks that he gave and I have said that ever since, \nbecause I think some criticism of this agreement is warranted.\n  It is a fact that our Government was put in a box when the President \nand the Secretary of State, in effect, ceded this element of policy to \nthe United Nations. It was a foregone conclusion we would have to then \naccept the agreement and attempt to abide by it; we had no choice at \nthat point; and as a result, the administration has to go forward with \nit and has to nominally at least support it. Richard Butler, the chief \ninspector, has to support it. He is a man of significant qualifications \nand eloquence. In describing how this is going to work, he says he can \nmake it work, but it is all predicated on the assumption that Saddam \nHussein will abide by the agreement. That is what Richard Butler \nhimself says.\n  There are a lot of criticisms of the agreement, about the precedent \nthat it sets, about the fact that it puts the United Nations literally \nin the driver's seat and reduces the UNSCOM inspectors, the \nprofessionals, and the United States, which has been a primary country \nbacking the agreement, to a secondary position. There has been \nsignificant question about whether the inspections themselves will be \ncompromised by the inclusion of a lot of diplomats which are \nessentially to act as chaperones to the inspectors at these eight \nPresidential sites.\n  Part of the problem of the inspections is that Saddam Hussein has \nalways seemed to have been aware of where we wanted to go and has been \none step ahead of us. That is because his Government has significantly \npenetrated the operations and has information in advance of the \ninspections. If the diplomats are involved in this, and some of them \nare from countries which are clearly supportive of the Iraqi regime, it \ncertainly is open to question as to whether or not the inspections will \nbe compromised in the future.\n  So a lot of questions that the majority leader raised about this \nagreement, I think, remain as significant and ought to instruct us in \nthe future as to how not to go about business. But it is done. And for \nthe time being, we are going to have to at least abide by it.\n\n  The key point about the agreement that I think I will make is this: \nWe should have no illusions that it will be abided by. At some point, \nthe Iraqis will, if we get close to finding something, prevent either \nthe full inspection under the new agreement or revert to form under the \ncurrent policies that apply to all of the sites other than the eight \nPresidential sites. In either case, we have the responsibility to act.\n  Now, the administration has the view that this will actually make it \neasier for us to engage in military action in the future because in the \npast we did not have support from the world community, but this time if \nSaddam Hussein violates it, the world community will be with us. Well, \nunfortunately, the world community appears to have an almost infinite \ncapacity for rationalization not to take an action against Saddam \nHussein because we cannot even get a resolution through the Security \nCouncil that says the ``severest'' consequences will result from a \nviolation of the agreement. Instead, we argue about words--of whether \nit will\n\n[[Page S1179]]\n\nbe very severe consequences. This clearly means that our allies are not \ngoing to be backing us in terms of the kind of military action that we \nwill want to take if and when that becomes necessary.\n  So concluding on this point, Mr. President, I think it is important \nfor us to look at some of the suggestions that are being made and for \nthe administration to begin to develop this broader policy.\n  I want to put two things in the Record at this point. I will ask \nunanimous consent to do so. One is a letter, an open letter to the \nPresident, signed by 28 prominent Americans, calling upon the President \nto consider a variety of specific actions that should be taken; and the \nother is a statement by Paul Wolfowitz who is the Dean of the Paul H. \nNitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity for the House Committee on International Relations on \nFebruary 24. Since that was a House hearing, I thought it would useful \nfor our Members here in the Senate to have it.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that those two documents be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Open Letter to the President--Committee for Peace and \n           Security in the Gulf,\n                                                February 19, 1998.\n       Dear Mr. President: Many of us were involved in organizing \n     the Committee for Peace and Security in the Gulf in 1990 to \n     support President Bush's policy of expelling Saddam Hussein \n     from Kuwait. Seven years later, Saddam Hussein is still in \n     power in Baghdad. And despite his defeat in the Gulf War, \n     continuing sanctions, and the determined effort of UN \n     inspectors to fetter out and destroy his weapons of mass \n     destruction, Saddam Hussein has been able to develop \n     biological and chemical munitions. To underscore the threat \n     posed by these deadly devices, the Secretaries of State and \n     Defense have said that these weapons could be used against \n     our own people. And you have said that this issue is about \n     the ``challenges of the 21st Century.''\n       Iraq's position is unacceptable. While Iraq is not unique \n     in possessing these weapons, it is the only country which has \n     used them--not just against its enemies, but its own people \n     as well. We must assume that Saddam is prepared to use them \n     again. This poses a danger to our friends, our allies, and to \n     our nation.\n       It is clear that this danger cannot be eliminated as long \n     as our objective is simply ``containment,'' and the means of \n     achieving it are limited to sanctions and exhortations. As \n     the crisis of recent weeks has demonstrated, these static \n     policies are bound to erode, opening the way to Saddam's \n     eventual return to a position of power and influence in the \n     region. Only a determined program to change the regime in \n     Baghdad will bring the Iraqi crisis to a satisfactory \n     conclusion.\n       For years, the United States has tried to remove Saddam by \n     encouraging coups and internal conspiracies. These attempts \n     have all failed. Saddam is more wily, brutal and \n     conspiratorial than any likely conspiracy the United States \n     might mobilize against him. Saddam must be overpowered; he \n     will not be brought down by a coup d'etat. But Saddam has an \n     Achilles' heel; lacking popular support, he rules by terror. \n     The same brutality which makes it unlikely that any coups or \n     conspiracies can succeed, makes him hated by his own people \n     and the rank and file of his military. Iraq today is ripe for \n     a broad-based insurrection. We must exploit this opportunity.\n       Saddam's long record of treaty violations, deception, and \n     violence shows that diplomacy and arms control will not \n     constrain him. In the absence of a broader strategy, even \n     extensive air strikes would be ineffective in dealing with \n     Saddam and eliminating the threat his regime poses. We \n     believe that the problem is not only the specifics of \n     Saddam's actions, but the continued existence of the regime \n     itself.\n       What is needed now is a comprehensive political and \n     military strategy for bringing down Saddam and his regime. It \n     will not be easy--and the course of action we favor is not \n     without its problems and perils. But we believe the vital \n     national interests of our country require the United States \n     to:\n       Recognize a provisional government of Iraq based on the \n     principles and leaders of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) \n     that is representative of all peoples of Iraq.\n       Restore and enhance the safe haven in northern Iraq to \n     allow the provisional government to extend its authority \n     there and establish a zone in southern Iraq from which \n     Saddam's ground forces would also be excluded.\n       Lift sanctions in liberated areas. Sanctions are \n     instruments of war against Saddam's regime, but they should \n     be quickly lifted on those who have freed themselves from it. \n     Also, the oil resources and products of the liberated areas \n     should help fund the provisional government's insurrection \n     and humanitarian relief for the people of liberated Iraq.\n       Release frozen Iraqi assets--which amount to $1.6 billion \n     in the United States and Britain alone--to the control of the \n     provisional government to fund its insurrection. This could \n     be done gradually and so long as the provisional government \n     continues to promote a democratic Iraq.\n       Facilitate broadcasts from U.S. transmitters immediately \n     and establish a Radio Free Iraq.\n       Help expand liberated areas of Iraq by assisting the \n     provisional government's offensive against Saddam Hussein's \n     regime logistically and through other means.\n       Remove any vestiges of Saddam's claim to ``legitimacy'' by, \n     among other things, bringing a war crimes indictment against \n     the dictator and his lieutenants and challenging Saddam's \n     credentials to fill the Iraqi seat at the United Nations.\n       Launch a systematic air campaign against the pillars of his \n     power--the Republican Guard divisions which prop him up and \n     the military infrastructure that sustains him.\n       Position U.S. ground force equipment in the region so that, \n     as a last resort, we have the capacity to protect and assist \n     the anti-Saddam forces in the northern and southern parts of \n     Iraq.\n       Once you make it unambiguously clear that we are serious \n     about eliminating the threat posed by Saddam, and are not \n     just engaged in tactical bombing attacks unrelated to a \n     larger strategy designed to topple the regime, we believe \n     that such countries as Kuwait, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, whose \n     cooperation would be important for the implementation of this \n     strategy, will give us the political and logistical support \n     to succeed.\n       In the present climate in Washington, some may \n     misunderstand and misinterpret strong American action against \n     Iraq as having ulterior political motives. We believe, on the \n     contrary, that strong American action against Saddam is \n     overwhelmingly in the national interest, that it must be \n     supported, and that it must succeed. Saddam must not become \n     the beneficiary of an American domestic political \n     controversy.\n       We are confident that were you to launch an initiative \n     along these line, the Congress and the country would see it \n     as a timely and justifiable response to Iraq's continued \n     intransigence. We urge you to provide the leadership \n     necessary to save ourselves and the world from the scourge of \n     Saddam and the weapons of mass destruction that he refuses to \n     relinguish.\n           Sincerely,\n         Hon.

Secretary General has made it possible to \n     avoid, for the time being, the necessity of U.S. military \n     action against Iraq, I see no reason to rejoice about the \n     outcome of the latest crisis with Iraq. Nor do I see any \n     reason to be optimistic about the agreement that has been \n     reached. In fact, the events of the last several weeks \n     constitute a significant political victory for Saddam \n     Hussein.\n       However, the course of military action that the \n     Administration was preparing for would have been an even \n     greater political defeat for the United States, accomplishing \n     little or nothing at the cost of the lives of American pilots \n     and Iraqi civilians and also at great political cost to our \n     friends and allies in the region. What the United States \n     needs to develop urgently is a long-term strategy so that we \n     will not find ourselves in the same box again in a few \n     months, forced to choose between an unsatisfactory diplomatic \n     outcome or costly and ineffective military action. If we must \n     act militarily in Iraq, it should be in support of a serious \n     effort to help Iraqis to liberate their country from Saddam \n     Hussein's tyrannical grasp. That is also the only way to \n     rescue the region and the world from the threat that will \n     continue to be posed by Saddam's unrelenting effort to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and to exact vengeance \n     for the defeat he suffered in the Persian Gulf War.\n       I would like to discuss three points in my testimony this \n     morning:\n       (1) Even a perfect agreement would have constituted a \n     tremendous victory for Saddam Hussein and left the UNSCOM \n     inspectors under an enormous handicap in their efforts to \n     uncover his weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems.\n       (2) The agreement, or what we know of the agreement, leaves \n     enormous question marks about whether UNSCOM will any longer \n     be able to carry out its function of searching for Saddam \n     Hussein's weapons of mass destruction in any of the eight so-\n     called Presidential Palaces or for that matter, in any other \n     locations that Saddam Hussein may at some later date decide.\n       (3) If the agreement has not effectively gutted the \n     inspection effort and if the inspectors are thus able to get \n     lucky and get back on the trail of what they were about to \n     discover when Saddam blocked inspections a few months ago, \n     the United States must have military options that are better \n     than the one that was available this time of bombing targets \n     whose contents we have little knowledge about in the small \n     hope that this might ``substantially reduce'' his weapons of \n     mass destruction capability. What is needed is not the \n     ``major land campaign'' that top Administration officials \n     falsely suggest is the only effective way to remove Saddam \n     from power. The real option is to support the many Iraqis who \n     desperately want to overthrow this tyrant, but who have so \n     far found the U.S. stinting and unreliable in the support we \n     have provided them. What is needed is not a ``massive U.S. \n     ground invasion'' but political, economic and military \n     support so that Iraqis can carry that fight themselves.\n\n\n                the losses in a return to the status quo\n\n       First, it is important to recognize how much Saddam has \n     gained even if the present agreement actually did commit him \n     to allow the UNSCOM inspectors the ``free, full, unfettered \n     access to these sites, anywhere in the country'' that \n     President Clinton demanded in his speech to Pentagon \n     personnel on February 17. Most of the reasons to be skeptical \n     about this agreement can be found in the President's own \n     speech.\n       As President Clinton said, an agreement with Saddam Hussein \n     on this issue means nothing: ``Saddam has spent the better \n     part of the past decade trying to cheat on [the] solemn \n     commitment'' to submit to inspection of his suspect weapons \n     programs. ``Throughout [this] entire process,'' as the \n     President said, ``Iraqi agents have undermined and undercut \n     UNSCOM.''\n       It is also true, as the President said, that the UNSCOM \n     inspectors have done a remarkable job of uncovering Iraq's \n     secret programs despite all of this lying, concealing and \n     obstruction. But there is one major difference now if the \n     inspectors are able to go back to work unhindered in Iraq: \n     this crisis has bought Saddam months of time to move whatever \n     it may have been that U.N. inspectors were about to discover \n     that forced Saddam finally to declare key sites off limits. \n     As good as the inspectors are, it is not reasonable to think \n     that they could get back any time soon to the point they were \n     at when Saddam's obstruction began. It could take many \n     months, or even years, particularly when much of the progress \n     they have made in the last two years has been due, again as \n     the President acknowledged, to the extraordinary revelations \n     brought out by Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamel, when he \n     defected in 1995. It is unlikely that we will ever get such a \n     well-placed defector again.\n       Thus, even in the best of circumstances. Saddam Hussein has \n     almost certainly bought himself a very long time before we \n     will have to face the need to obstruct the U.N. inspectors \n     again, to continue the game of ``cheat and retreat'' as Les \n     Aspin called it. Long before then, we can be sure, the \n     pressure will build from Russia, France and others to lift \n     the sanctions on Iraq on the grounds that the inspectors have \n     found nothing. And once again President Clinton had it right \n     in his February 17 speech when he said: ``Already these \n     sanctions have denied him $110 billion. Imagine how much \n     stronger his armed forces would be today, how many more \n     weapons of mass destruction operations he would have hidden \n     around the country if he had been able to spend even a small \n     fraction of that amount for a military rebuilding.''\n       What has Saddam had to pay for this long breathing space \n     and for the four-month defiance of the United Nations that \n     produced it? Absolutely nothing. Even worse, he has been \n     rewarded for it. Rewarded by forcing the United States into a \n     costly military build-up that has strained our relations with \n     key allies in the region. Rewarded by the legitimacy of a \n     meeting with the Secretary General of the United Nations and \n     a formal agreement with him (a dignity, we should be \n     remember, would never have been accorded to Radovan Karadzic \n     when he claimed to be the leader of Serbian Bosnia). \n     Rewarded by an enormous outpouring of sympathy and support \n     for him in many parts of the Arab world. Rewarded by \n     appearing to have stood up to the United States and not \n     paying any price for doing so.\n       Perhaps most seriously of all, Saddam has been rewarded by \n     the repeated statements by top U.S. officials--not to mention \n     those of other countries--that our goal is limited merely to \n     getting the U.N. inspections restored. That is to say, or \n     rather as President Clinton said, ``Would the Iraqi people be \n     better off if there were a change in leadership? I certainly \n     think they would be. But that is not what the United Nations \n     has authorized us to do; that is not what our immediate \n     interest is about.'' Or, in the words of the Secretary of \n     Defense: ``What we are seeking to do is not to topple Saddam \n     Hussein, not to destroy his country, but to do what the \n     United Nations has said in its declarations.'' Of course, \n     these are not warm endorsements of Saddam Hussein's \n     continuation in power. But they certainly go a long way to \n     discourage opponents of his regime from thinking that we are \n     seriously interested in removing Saddam.\n\n\n                 potential weaknesses in this agreement\n\n       There are also serious problems with the agreement itself. \n     It does much more than simply provide for ``diplomats'' to \n     accompany UNSCOM inspectors in visiting sensitive sites. In \n     fact, Article 4 of the agreement says that inspection of \n     those sites will be conducted not by UNSCOM but by a new \n     Special Group, appointed by the Secretary General, in which \n     members of UNSCOM will simply be members. Although the \n     language is ambiguous, it suggests that the Executive \n     Director of UNSCOM, Ambassador Richard Butler, who by all \n     reports has done a magnificent job to date, would not be a \n     member of this Special Group. The Special Group would have \n     its own head, called a Commissioner, also appointed by the \n     Secretary General.\n       If this means that Ambassador Butler has effectively been \n     dismissed for the function of inspecting sensitive sites, and \n     access to those sites is now to be negotiated by a Russian \n     diplomat or someone else who is more sensitive to Saddam's \n     claims of ``sovereignty'' than to the need to carry out \n     effective inspections, then the damage to the inspection \n     regime is truly fatal. If any confidence is to be placed in \n     this agreement at all, it is vital that the Secretary General \n     move very quickly to appoint Ambassador Butler as the \n     Commissioner of the Special Group, something which the \n     agreement permits but does not require.\n       Even if the Executive Director of UNSCOM remains in charge \n     of inspecting sensitive sites, there are other reasons for \n     concern. The inclusion of ``diplomats'' in the teams may \n     compromise security, a serious problem for UNSCOM in the best \n     of circumstances. The promise by the Secretary General to \n     bring the issue of lifting of sanctions to the attention of \n     the Security Council, while seemingly vapid, could generate \n     serious problems. Finally, there are serious concerns about \n     the size and scope of the defined eight ``Presidential \n     Sites'' that are supposed to be defined in the annex to the \n     agreement, an annex which was still not available more\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\n     than twenty-four hours after the agreement was announced.\n\n\n                  the need for better military options\n\n       It may be a long time, if ever, before the inspectors can \n     get close to finding whatever it was that caused Saddam to \n     start obstructing them last year. But if they do, we can be \n     certain, he will block them again. President Clinton has said \n     that in that case we must be prepared to take military \n     action. If so, that military action needs to be something \n     more effective than what was planned this time.\n       Although the Clinton Administration declared repeatedly \n     that the air strikes they were planning would not be ``pin-\n     pricks'' like the ones they administered in response to \n     Saddam's attempted assassination of President Bush in 1993 or \n     to his attack on our Iraqi opposition allies in 1996, simply \n     making a bigger bang is no guarantee of serious results. \n     There is simply no way that the U.S. Air Force can do from \n     the air what the U.N. inspectors must do from the ground. \n     Over time it seemed that our objectives were steadily scaled \n     back. As it began to dawn that bombing would probably not \n     succeed in forcing the inspectors back in--indeed, it might \n     well have the opposite effect--one heard less talk of that as \n     a possible objective. But since we also couldn't hope to \n     eliminate Saddam's weapons of mass destruction with air power \n     alone, we finally ended up with the objective of \n     ``substantially reducing'' that threat. In the absence of \n     inspectors, it would be impossible to know what we had \n     actually destroyed. Perhaps the thinking was that the word \n     substantially has enough flexibility in it to cover a range \n     of outcomes. But as Secretary Cohen demonstrated with his bag \n     of sugar, it would not take much left over to continue to \n     pose a serious threat.\n       Thus, the U.S. would have been left trying to claim \n     significant military success, with little evidence to back it \n     up, while the evidence of death and destruction in Iraq would \n     be real and readily demonstrated by Saddam. Risking American \n     lives and the lives of innocent civilians is something that \n     should be done only when there are serious goals to be \n     accomplished by doing so. The proposed operation could meet \n     that standard only with the greatest of difficulty. And it \n     would have imposed serious costs on our allies in the Arab \n     world.\n       Which brings us to the question asked by the elderly \n     veteran in Columbus, Ohio: ``If push comes to shove and \n     Saddam will not back down, will not allow or keep his word, \n     are we ready and willing to send the troops . . . and finish \n     this job, or are we going to do it half-assed, the way we did \n     before?''\n       Secretary Cohen's answer was ``What we are seeking to do is \n     not to topple Saddam Hussein . . . but to do what the United \n     Nations has said in its declarations.'' At the same Town \n     Meeting, Sandy Berger said that ``The costs and risks of that \n     course of action, in our judgment, are too high and not \n     essential to achieving our strategic interests as a nation . \n     . . It would require a major land campaign, and risk large \n     losses of our soldiers.''\n       Yet Secretary Cohen on other occasions, has said correctly, \n     that this is not simply about U.N. declarations but about \n     real threats to U.S. National Security. Saddam Hussein has \n     demonstrated that we will cheat and try to build weapons of \n     mass destruction as long as he remains in power. He \n     demonstrated, by attempting to assassinate George Bush early \n     in the term of a new American administration and by \n     burning Kuwait's oil fields as his army left that country, \n     that he is bent on serious vengeance against those who \n     opposed him in the Gulf War. He has demonstrated not only \n     in 1990 but also again in 1994 that he will pose a threat \n     to Kuwait whenever he thinks he has a chance. He has \n     demonstrated countless times that he will conduct genocide \n     and war crimes against his own people including gassing \n     them with chemical weapons, machine-gunning them in mass \n     graves. and threatening them with starvation by diverting \n     rivers. The one effective way to cope with the weapons of \n     mass destruction problem, like all these other problems, \n     is to help remove him from power.\n       As President Clinton has said, the issue of weapons of mass \n     destruction is an issue that concerns the future of the \n     twenty-first century. As Mr. Berger said in Columbus, it is \n     an issue worth fighting for. Why is it worth fighting for \n     ineffectively with air power and not worth fighting for \n     effectively, if that means using ground forces? Instead of \n     deciding what means it is willing to use, and then tailoring \n     the goals to fit them, the Clinton Administration should \n     decide what it takes to do the job and ask the country to \n     support it.\n       However, the estimates that it would take a major invasion \n     with U.S. ground forces seriously overestimates Saddam \n     Hussein. As we did for too long in Bosnia, we are in danger \n     of painting a brutal dictator and his army as mighty giants \n     when, in fact they are military pygmies. There was some \n     excuse for overestimating the capability of the ``fourth \n     largest army in the world'' before the Gulf War, when all we \n     had to go on was their performance against Iran in the \n     1980's. There is no reason to be doing so today, when their \n     weaknesses were exposed in 1991, and when the Iraqi army of \n     today is far weaker than the one that we faced then.\n       The notion that a large U.S. ground invasion would be \n     needed is based on the belief, repeated often by U.S. \n     government officials, that the Iraqi opposition is feckless. \n     But that Iraqi opposition rose up in large numbers to fight \n     against Saddam Hussein in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf \n     War. That Iraqi opposition, with some help from the U.S. \n     Operation Provide Comfort, kept the northern third of Iraq \n     out of Saddam's control for more than five years, and even \n     today, despite the serious division between the two major \n     Kurdish factions, Saddam's writ is weak in Northern Iraq.\n       Alas, it is U.S. support for the Iraqi opposition, more \n     than that opposition itself, which has been feckless. I am \n     sorry to say that the single best opportunity to support the \n     Iraqi opposition was during the Bush Administration, when \n     Saddam Hussein was to use his armed helicopters to slaughter \n     the rebel forces, while American fighter planes flew over \n     head, with their pilots not allowed to shoot at Saddam's \n     gunships. But, where the Clinton Administration came to \n     office promising to do more, they in fact have done less. We \n     have preferred to support coup attempts in Baghdad, which are \n     almost certain to be penetrated and to fail, than to provide \n     open support to the democratic opposition. Ultimately, when \n     the Iraqi opposition was fighting for its life in the North \n     when Saddam attacked Irbil in 1996, the United States made a \n     few meaningless missile strikes against radars in the South, \n     proclaiming the North to be of no strategic importance and \n     abandoning the people whom we had promised to support.\n       But Saddam is not ten feet tall. The brutality that makes \n     him so feared by his people also makes him hated. And his \n     army is badly weakened by its defeat in the Gulf War and by \n     the effect of years of sanctions. When President Bush did \n     decide to do something to stop Saddam's repression of his \n     people, by launching Operation Provide Comfort in April of \n     1991, it took only a small, lightly armed American force and \n     ill-equipped Kurdish guerillas, backed up by the threat of \n     American air power, to drive the Iraqi army out of the \n     northern third of the country. When the opposition proposed \n     an attack on Iraqi forces in the North in 1995, the United \n     States warned them not to and said we would not support them. \n     As a result, the larger of the two Kurdish factions pulled \n     out but the operation nevertheless succeeded in capturing \n     several large Iraqi army units with minimal fighting.\n       Just a few days ago, Daniel Williams reported in the \n     Washington Post from Amman, in an article titled ``Saddam May \n     Be Weaker Than He Seems,'' that:\n       ``Diplomats, Jordanian officials and travelers say that the \n     south is dangerous territory for Saddam Hussein's army and \n     police. `By day, things seem calm enough, but at night the \n     police and soldiers retreat into their shelters. They are not \n     safe,' said a recent arrival from Iraq. `There is lots of \n     hit-and-run activity on Saddam's security forces. The \n     nighttime belongs to them,' a Western diplomat added.''\n       What saves Saddam from massive uprisings in this situation, \n     a former Iraqi military official exiled in Jordan told \n     Williams, is that ``no one wants to be burned twice.'' If the \n     United States wants the opposition to Saddam Hussein to be \n     less feckless, then it must be less feckless in its support. \n     This does not mean that we can guarantee their success. But \n     there are certain minimum things that we must do. We cannot \n     pretend to support a serious resistance movement when we have \n     yet to give them a single rifle, much less antitank weapons. \n     We cannot plan to sit by while helicopter gunships slaughter \n     them without interference.\n       What the U.S. needs to do to support effective resistance \n     to Saddam Hussein is not a large ground invasion, but rather \n     a series of political, economic and military measures that \n     can help the Iraqi people liberate themselves:\n       Political: We need to challenge Saddam Hussein's claims to \n     be the legitimate ruler of Iraq. This will be much harder to \n     do in the wake of the agreement that he has just signed with \n     the Secretary General. But it is important, nevertheless, to \n     press to indict him as a war criminal and to challenge his \n     claim to represent Iraq in the United Nations.\n       We should also indicate our willingness to recognize a \n     provisional government of free Iraq, and the best place to \n     start is with the current organization and principles of the \n     Iraqi National Congress, the only organization that has to \n     date set forth a set of principles on which a post-Saddam \n     representative government could be built.\n       The United States can expect to be isolated at first in \n     pushing these positions, but it is important to do so because \n     they are not merely symbolic steps. They have real practical \n     consequences, both political and economic.\n       Economic. One of the consequences of creating a mechanism \n     to recognize a provisional government for Iraq is that it \n     would open a way to make the frozen assets of Iraq, \n     reportedly in the neighborhood of $1.6 billion just in the \n     U.S. and U.K. alone, available to support the resistance.\n       Another important measure will be to lift economic \n     sanctions from regions in Iraq that are wrested from Saddam's \n     control. It is inexcusable that sanctions have been kept in \n     place all this time on Northern Iraq, even when it was \n     liberated territory. This squeezed the people in the North \n     between a U.N. embargo from the north and Saddam's embargo \n     from the south, thus exacerbating tensions among the Kurds.\n       Ultimately, the most important economic measure will be to \n     make provision for the oil\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\n     resources of liberated areas to be made available to support \n     the resistance to Saddam Hussien.\n       Military: Serious military support is also needed from the \n     United States, but not the large land invasion that is thrown \n     up regularly as a straw man. What is needed most of all is \n     weapons and logistics support. Anti-tank weapons, in \n     particular, could have a powerful equalizing effect, just as \n     anti-air weapons did in Afghanistan. It is difficult to \n     understand how U.S. officials can claim that we have tried \n     supporting the opposition, when we have never tried to arm \n     them.\n       We should also be prepared to provide air cover for \n     liberated areas within the southern and northern no-fly \n     zones. This is of critical importance, not only to provide a \n     base from which the resistance to Saddam can operate, but \n     also to provide a secure zone to which units of his own army \n     that wish to change sides can go. Saddam is now so unpopular \n     with his own regular army and even with many parts of his \n     Republican Guards that if a secure and honorable path can be \n     opened for his army to leave, major units are likely to do so \n     or to desert without a fight. This presents a very different \n     scenario than the imagined ``major land invasion'' with U.S. \n     troops marching on Baghdad against a fiercely resisting Iraqi \n     army.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Mr. Chairman, it seems clear that the United States is \n     going to have to live with this agreement. While we can work \n     to clarify certain important details--particularly those that \n     bear on the continued ability of UNSCOM to do its remarkable \n     work. But no new agreement with Saddam Hussein is going to \n     fundamentally alter the threat that Saddam poses to his \n     people, his neighbors and the world, whether from weapons of \n     mass destruction or conventional weapons or from terrorism. \n     Despite the eagerness of some for a quick test of the new \n     agreement, we can't really know whether this new \n     inspection regime is working for a long time (although we \n     might learn sooner that it is not working). Despite the \n     eagerness of some for quick military action if the \n     inspectors are obstructed now, we should not be in a hurry \n     to take military action as pointless as what we were just \n     now planning to do.\n       What we should be doing now is preparing for the time when \n     we face another crisis with Saddam Hussein or another \n     opportunity to act to help the Iraqi people liberate \n     themselves. That is something that we should start doing now. \n     It seems to be something the Administration will not do \n     unless Congress forces them to. For that purpose, I would \n     urge the Congress to:\n       Urge the United States government to recognize, and assist \n     in all practicable ways, a provisional government of free \n     Iraq representing all the people of Iraq and committed to \n     reconciliation within Iraq and to living at peace with its \n     neighbors.\n       Appropriate $100 for the purpose of assisting the \n     provisional government. The administration should work to \n     recover these funds from blocked Iraqi assets now held by the \n     U.S. treasury.\n       Press for the United States to seek an indictment of Saddam \n     Hussein for war crimes and crimes against humanity in an \n     appropriate international tribunal.\n       Saddam is in a position of great weakness today. But the \n     weakness will only become apparent if he is pushed. If we \n     exaggerate his strength and thus encourage the defeatist \n     mentality that seems to affect Administration strategy today, \n     we will help him buy time for a later confrontation when he \n     will be much stronger and the costs in blood and lives will \n     be much higher. As the veteran said in Columbus:\n       ``Are we going to do it half-assed? And then men at that \n     time to (sic) come back and ask my grandson and some of these \n     other grandsons to put their lives on the line, if we're \n     going to do it half-assed, the way we did before.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Now, this document that the 28 advisers--let me indicate who \nsome of these people are, people like former Secretary of Defense Frank \nCarlucci; and Caspar Weinberger; and Judge William Clark, former \nNational Security Adviser; Doug Feith, former Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense; Fred C. Ikle, former Undersecretary of Defense; \nBill Kristol; Robert Kagan; Bernard Lewis; Don Rumsfeld, former \nSecretary of Defense; and Paul Wolfowitz, as I said; and Richard Perle. \nThey are all, I think, eminently qualified to offer this kind of \nadvice.\n  I urge the President to consider the suggestions that are made here, \nwhich revolve around preliminarily the principle that military action \nalone will not force Saddam to comply, that he is the problem, that is, \nno coup d'etat is likely to succeed in this country and therefore the \nway to get him out is to create a series of conditions which will \nenable the Iraqi people themselves to provide the insurrection that \nwill eventually depose him. This might include the following:\n  Recognizing a provincial government; restoring safe-haven both in the \nnorthern and southern portions of Iraq so that the people there can \nactually declare themselves free of his influence and control; lifting \nthe sanctions in those areas so that the people can benefit from the \neconomic end, of course, that would result; release frozen Iraqi assets \nto the Iraqis in exile; facilitating broadcasts from U.S. transmitters \nto the people of Iraq; removing vestiges of Saddam's ``legitimacy'' by \nconsidering, for example, whether the United Nations should indict him \nas a war criminal; an air campaign could be a part of this, launched \nagainst the Republican Guard divisions which prop him up; and \ntightening down on the embargo.\n  Right now we know the sanctions are of primary concern to him. And if \nwe tighten down on the embargo so that the black market oil sales \ncannot continue to provide him with significant oil revenues, it will \nsqueeze him further.\n  All of these things could eventually create conditions under which \nthe Iraqi people could retake the Government of Iraq from Saddam \nHussein.\n  So, Mr. President, my concluding point is this: The administration \nnow has some time to develop a strategy which had not been developed \nprior to the time that it was asking for Congress to support a bombing \ncampaign. If that program is developed, with the help of the Congress--\nand it makes sense as a broad strategy to deal with Saddam Hussein--the \nPresident will have all of the authority and the backing that he needs \nand deserves in taking action against Saddam Hussein, I would say, \nwhen, not if, that is called for, as a result of probable Iraqi \nviolation of some part of the international inspection regime.\n  It is a serious business, Mr. President, for us to decide to move \nbeyond a policy of containment to a policy of rollback. It is one which \nought to be debated by this body and by the administration. But the \ntime for it has come because, as we have seen, neither the American \npeople nor the Congress were willing to support a half-measures kind of \naction against Saddam Hussein. We felt something more was required to \nreally deal with the problem.\n  As we learned in Vietnam, and as we have learned elsewhere, halfway \nmeasures--calibrated bombing attacks, and the like--do not seem to \nsolve the problem. When you go to war, I think the maxim from the gulf \nwar, from the Vietnam war, and the new thinking of military strategists \nin this country is: When you go to war, you'd better mean it; you have \nto be able to succeed at what you are doing.\n  That probably requires the imposition of overwhelming force and it \nrequires a broad strategy that will get you where you are going. That \nis why the administration needs to develop this policy, with the \nassistance of the Congress, and be able to implement it if and when the \ntime for action comes.\n  Mr. President, I ask, how much of that remaining time do I have, \nbecause I have one more thing I would like to say?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 16 and a half \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Fine. Mr. President, I know I can conclude these remarks in \nthe time allotted.\n  Mr. President, I want to change the subject in this remaining 2 or 3 \nminutes to discuss the issue of balancing the budget for American \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1177-6", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1182-S1183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BALANCING THE BUDGET FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Milton Friedman once said he would rather \nhave a $1 trillion budget that is way out of balance than a $2 trillion \nbudget that is in balance. I think his point is even more poignant now \nthan when he made it several years ago.\n  If we manage to balance the unified budget this year--and most recent \nrevenue trends suggest we will--we will do so by taxing and spending at \na level of about $1.75 trillion. That is a level of spending that is 25 \npercent higher than when President Clinton took office just 5 years \nago.\n  Despite the claim President Clinton made in his State of the Union \nAddress that we have the smallest Government in 35 years, the fact is \nthat the Government has never been bigger--never. And it will continue \nto grow by leaps and bounds if Congress approves the myriad of new \nspending proposals that President Clinton is proposing in his latest \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\n  It seems to me that although we may have succeeded in balancing the \nbudget, we still have two very different visions of where we should be \nheaded in this country. Is it a balanced budget that is the paramount \ngoal, even if it comes with substantially higher taxes and more \nspending? Or is the real goal of a balanced budget to be more \nresponsible with people's hard-earned tax dollars--to limit \nGovernment's size and give the people more choices and more control \nover their lives? Before we try to answer those questions, let us give \nthem a little context.\n  As I mentioned, the Federal Government has grown 25 percent larger in \njust the last 5 years. It spends the equivalent of $6,700 for every \nman, woman, and child in the country every year. And that is the \nequivalent of nearly $27,000 for the average family of four. But all of \nthat spending comes at a tremendous cost to hard-working taxpayers.\n  The Tax Foundation estimates that the median income family in America \nsaw its combined Federal, State, and local tax bill climb to 38.2 \npercent of income last year--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That \nis more than the average family spends on food, clothing, and shelter \ncombined. Put another way, in too many families one parent is working \nto put food on the table while the other is working almost full time \njust to pay the bill for the Government bureaucracy.\n  Perhaps a different measure of how heavy a tax burden the Federal \nGovernment is imposing would help shed some light here. Consider that \nFederal revenues this year will claim about 19.9 percent of the \nNation's income, its gross domestic product. Next year, the tax take \nwill climb to 20.9 percent, according to the administration's \nprojections. That would be higher than any year since 1945. It would be \nonly the third year in our Nation's entire history that revenues have \nexceeded 20 percent of the national income.\n  As if taxes were not high enough, President Clinton is proposing to \nraise them again. He is proposing a tax increase of $98 billion, which \nwould more than offset the modest amount of tax relief that we approved \njust 7 months ago. It is worth noting that the new taxes the President \nproposes are not needed to balance the budget. We have more than enough \nrevenue to do that given the economy's performance in the last year. \nThe tax increases are intended to finance dozens of new spending \nprograms--$125 billion worth of new spending over the next 5 years.\n  More taxes, more spending, and more Government. That is just the \nopposite of where I believe we ought to be headed. For me, there is no \ngreat achievement in balancing the budget if it means that hard-working \nfamilies continue to be overtaxed. There is no great achievement in a \nbalanced budget if the Government continues to grow, seemingly without \nlimits, taking choice and freedom away from the people in the process.\n  Mr. President, this is the point that I think Milton Friedman was \nmaking. A balanced budget is not the only goal, or even the highest \ngoal. A balanced budget is merely the means of right-sizing the \nGovernment so that it is more respectful of hard-working taxpayers' \nearnings and their desire to do right by their own families. That is \nwhere our paramount concern should be--with families.\n  To those who are suggesting we abandon plans for another tax relief \nbill this year, I say this: Let us not lose sight of our true \nobjective. Families are overtaxed. The Government is still too big. We \nwere sent here to help hard-working families, not to keep them saddled \nwith high taxes or to add to that burden with more spending and more \ntaxes. We will do the right thing by limiting the size of Government so \nthat families have more freedom and more income left in their pockets.\n  Mr. President, thank you. And I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor being patient.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I assure the distinguished Senator that this Senator is \nalways patient, never in too big a hurry. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1182-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1183-S1184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ABRAHAM RIBICOFF\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I grow older I am obliged to bid farewell \nto some friend almost every day, and thus does the circle gradually and \nall too rapidly diminish. That great New England poet James Russell \nLowell said it well:\n\n     As life runs on,\n     The road grows strange\n     With faces new,\n     And near the end\n     The milestones into headstones change,\n     `Neath everyone a friend\n\n  Mr. President, it is with sadness that I take the Floor today to pay \ntribute to the memory of a departed former colleague, Abraham Alexander \nRibicoff, with whom I served from January 3, 1963, to January 3, 1981. \nSenator Ribicoff was a man of many talents. And he was a man who had \nbeen honored by the people of his State and country many times and in \nmany ways. After graduating from the University of Chicago Law School \nin 1933, he was admitted to the bar the same year. He became a hearing \nexaminer, under the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act in 1937, \nand he became a member of the Connecticut legislature in 1938, a judge \nof the Hartford Police Court in 1941, Chairman of the Assembly of \nMunicipal Court Judges for the State of Connecticut in 1941, and he was \nelected to the 81st and 82nd Congresses, a service which extended from \nJanuary 3, 1949 to January 3, 1953. He was Governor of Connecticut \nduring the years 1955-1961, and he was sworn in as Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare in the cabinet of the late \nPresident John Kennedy.\n  Abraham Ribicoff was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962, reelected in \n1968 and again in 1974, and served until January 3, 1981, not being a \ncandidate for reelection in 1980. During this period of Senator \nRibicoff's service in the Senate, I served in the Senate leadership as \nSecretary to the Democratic Conference, Democratic Whip, and Senate \nMajority Leader, during which time Abe Ribicoff was my close friend and \nvalued advisor.\n  Abraham Ribicoff was a man of high character, great character, \nsterling integrity, excellent judgment, with an unusual sense of \nhistory and with excellent political instincts, and with uncommon \nability.\n  His advice was widely sought by other Senators, and it was always \nkindly given. He was a popular Senator, and could easily have won \nreelection to a fourth Senate term. His career of public service \nspanned 42 years.\n  Abe Ribicoff had a very rare sense of timing and political judgement. \nHe was among the first to endorse Senator John F. Kennedy for \nPresident. He nominated John F. Kennedy for Vice President in 1956, and \nwas his convention Floor Manager for the, now legendary, successful \npresidential nomination in 1960.\n  Abe Ribicoff had the air and dignity of a Senator in a classic sense. \nHe always dressed impeccably, he possessed faultless manners, and he \nwas a gentleman in every sense of the word. Yet, he spoke forcefully, \nand he was unafraid of advocating politically difficult positions--\nunafraid. He was among the first to break with the strong-armed tactics \nof certain Israeli lobby groups, and he willingly paid a political \nprice for his courage. In 1978, he conducted the first major Senate \ninvestigation, and produced the first Senate report on the difficult \nproblem of global warming. His report on the subject could well have \nbeen written today, some 20 years later, when global warming has now \nbecome fashionable as an issue. He was also an expert on international \ntrade.\n  I have spoken of his service during the time I was Majority Leader. \nHe was then the Chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \nas well as second ranking Democrat under Senator Russell Long on the \nFinance Committee. I relied heavily on Abe Ribicoff's advice on a broad \nrange of issues, from the creation of the cabinet level Department of \nEducation to the fashioning of major energy legislation during the \nenergy crisis of the late 1970's.\n  Abe Ribicoff was a persuasive speaker, and always gave as well as he \ngot in Senate debates, during the days when the Senate really did \ndebate issues. Yet, his strength was as much in his ability to sense \nthe appropriate compromise, and he knew how to build consensus, and to \ncraft sound solutions to\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\nhighly contentious issues in Committee and on the Senate Floor.\n  His passing, at a ripe old age, is another chapter, rounding out a \nhistory of remarkable men who have graced this chamber, and who have \nmade their individual marks on the minds and memories and hearts of \ntheir colleagues and they have done it on the basis of their character, \ntheir instincts, and their talents. Senators would do well to read the \nstory of Abraham Ribicoff's life. He came from humble beginnings and he \nmade a success from his own resources, his own grit, and his own \ninstincts. His life was one which can be used as a model by others on \nboth sides of the aisle. He stood his ground when it really counted, \nand consequently he claimed the high road in his political life. I have \nmissed Abe Ribicoff's counsel since his retirement, and I wish he had \nremained longer in this body. I wish he were here today.\n  Abe Ribicoff waged many political battles in life. The battle with \ndeath he finally lost, as we must all finally succumb to the onslaught \nof that grim and unrelenting enemy: death. But though that grim reaper \nmay lay claim to ending the battle of this life, the claim of victory \nhas always and will always elude death, even though it stalks each of \nour lives from the cradle to the grave. How sweet the words of thy \ngreat Apostle Paul in his first epistle to the Corinthians:\n\n     O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\n\n  Mr. President, man was not created an animal, as we are taught in our \nuniversities and our high schools. Man was not created an animal, but \nas a living soul within which there is embedded a spark of the \nDivinity, a nexus with the Creator. It is that spark that lives on, a \nsoul that an animal does not have, a soul that goes back, when one \ndeparts this earthly life, to the presence of his Maker. And we all \nhave that journey to travel. Great Grecian and Roman philosophers, by \npure reason and logic, arrived at the conclusion that there is indeed a \ncreating, directing, and controlling Divine power, and an immortality \nof the soul. Throughout the ages, all races and all peoples have \ninstinctively so believed. It is the basis of all religions, be they \nheathen, Mohammedan, Hebrew, or Christian. It is believed by savage \ntribes and by semicivilized and civilized nations, by those who believe \nin many gods and by those who believe in the one God. Atheists are and \nalways have been few in number. But beyond all credulity is the \ncredulousness of atheists, who believe that chance can make the world, \nwhen it cannot build a house!\n  So, Mr. President, as Longfellow said:\n\n     There is no death! What seems so is transition;\n     This life of mortal breath\n     Is but a suburb of the life elysian,\n     whose portal we call death.\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard the story of an old king in the Middle \nAges who had his barons at a great banquet. They were quaffing their \nbumpers of ale. It was a bitter night outside. The storm raged. The \nsnow was falling furiously. Suddenly, into the rude chamber in which \nthey were gathered there flew through some crack or crevice in the roof \na little bird. Blinded by the light and perplexed, it flew wildly here \nand there and beat itself against the rude beams. Finally, it found \nanother crevice and out it went into the night again. The old king, \nadvanced in years, spoke to his barons and said:\n\n       That bird is like a life; it comes from out of the night, \n     it flits and flies around a little while, blinded by the \n     light, and then it goes back out into the night again.\n\n  So, Mr. President, my friend Abraham Ribicoff has gone to what Hamlet \nsaid was ``the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler \nreturns,'' but I have no doubt that the Creator, who stoops to give to \nthe rose bush whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze the \nsweet assurance of another springtime, has received into His bosom a \nman who was my friend, who loved his country, and who loved his fellow \nman--rich and poor, high and low, who neither looked up to the rich nor \ndown on the poor--Abraham Alexander Ribicoff.\n  To his dear wife Casey, a graceful, charming, and noble woman, my \nwife, Erma, and I extend our sympathy and our love.\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past that she cannot destroy,\n     That come in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an old saying that reminds us \nthat\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\nwhen you have no idea of where you're going, any road will get you \nthere. Well, that wisdom explains a lot about our current national drug \nstrategy. It's a poor little lamb that has lost its way. The \nadministration has never made drug control a serious element in its \npolicies. Oh, we have had all the right sound bites. But we have not \nhad the sound efforts. Not now, not from the beginning. We are paying \nthe price for this inattention. In this and a subsequent statement, I \nwill explain in more detail why I believe our national drug efforts are \nin disarray. Why they need more attention, more oversight, and more \nconsistency.\n  I remind you, Mr. President, that this administration opened its \ndoors for business with a move to gut the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy. It then began a process of cutting support to law \nenforcement, interdiction, and international control efforts. That \nprocess continued until the Congress reversed the trend in 1995. Even \nthen, the administration did not change its tune on drug policy until \nthe 1996 campaign. To those who might believe that none of this made \nany difference anyway, let me remind you of some disturbing facts.\n  Let me begin with a reminder of why we have a drug policy. We have a \ndrug control policy because this country has a big appetite for illegal \ndrugs. We have a major problem with addiction because we have a lot of \nhardcore users and new initiates. We have the hardcore user problem \nbecause we ignored all the warning signs about drug use in the 1960's \nand 1970's and early 1980's. It was not until we woke up one morning to \nfind many of our kids hooked and out streets war zones for traffickers \nthat we understood our mistake. Although we began late, we did begin to \naddress the problem of drug use, production, and trafficking.\n  Despite what many believe, the war on drugs in the late 1980's and \nearly 1990's was not a failure. Indeed, there is not a single other \nmajor social program into which we put money and effort that can \ndemonstrate the significant progress we made in reducing teen drug use. \nWe were less successful with hardcore addicts. But, as anyone who knows \nwho has dealt with well-established addiction, there is no cure. Even \nsuccess is measured in multiple treatment episodes.\n  Treatment can stretch over a lifetime with limited results. A typical \naddict may go through treatment a dozen times, and success does not \nalways mean ending addiction--only the moderation of use. Thus, our \nfolly in the 1960's and after in ignoring the dangers of drug use, laid \nthe foundations for an addict population that remains a problem today. \nBut we had made great strides in convincing a new generation of kids to \nsay no to drugs. The results were dramatic and, if sustained, promised \nto return us, gradually, to a largely drug-free community.\n  But, as I have noted here before, we did not sustain the successes. \nWe did not sustain the effort. The present administration shifted our \npriorities and our messages. We were told that we needed more focus on \ntreatment. We were told we needed less talk about enforcement. We were \ntold all these changes would be better. We were assured drug use would \nstay down. What happened? Well, the results are in. They have been \naccumulating for years.\n  They tell a revealing tale: Teen drug use reversed the downward \ntrend. It is now on the rise and getting worse. The age of onset of use \ndropped to younger kids. Negative attitudes about the dangers of drug \nuse went south. The legalization movement found a bag man to fund its \nefforts and is active on many fronts all over the country. We now see \nHollywood and our music moguls back to pushing drug themes in movies \nand music. We see our major companies and advertisers dropping support \nto drug-free advertising. We see our major networks give less attention \nto this advertising. And now we know what happens. The consequence has \nbeen a growing drug crisis among our kids. This is no accident. We saw \ndecisions made on wrong assumptions that have got us to this state. \nIt's embarrassing and it's frustrating. And the administration still is \nlagging behind. It is just not serious. Having said this, let me give \nyou just a few examples to illustrate the point.\n  I started by noting the cuts at the drug czar's office from the early \ndays of the administration. That was not an isolated event. We saw the \nproblem beginning with the White House's whole cavalier attitude toward \ndrug use and drug testing among employees there. We saw it continued by \nthe I-didn't-inhale atmosphere. As a result, we lost the ``Just Say \nNo'' message from the start. But there was more than this. The \nadministration also began to reduce support to interdiction and law \nenforcement. This has been well documented and I won't repeat that now. \nSuffice it to say that the administration substituted reducing supply \nreduction for reducing supply. The legacy of neglect and indifference \ncontinues.\n  Let me illustrate my point with a number of concrete examples. What \nthese various cases I am going to talk about illustrate, when added \ntogether, is the lack of seriousness by the administration on drug \npolicy. They are illustrative of the fragmented, incoherent thinking \nthat has contributed to our growing crisis of teenage use.\n  In these remarks, I will focus on domestic issues. Later, I will \ndiscuss international problems. In either case, we have a peck of \ntrouble.\n  Let me begin with some of those troubles. In the past 5 years of this \nadministration, drug use among kids has doubled over the levels before \nit took office. Those increases came on top of almost a decade of \ndeclines. Although the use numbers are from every major survey of drug \nuse, many the government's own numbers, the administration continues to \nargue that drug use is down. The President did this most recently in \nreleasing the National Strategy and his State of the Union Address. He \ntakes credit for this. How does the administration explain the \ndifference between the claims and the facts? Simple. It charts drug use \ntrends from the 1980's, when the numbers were getting better, in order \nto disguise present trends, when the numbers are getting worse. It also \nplays fast and loose with the figures.\n  They make the numbers work for them by doing what is called ``data \nslicing.'' What that means is that you focus on only one part of the \ndata while ignoring the whole. Thus, in discussing the most recent \nteenage drug use survey, the administration makes much of the fact that \nuse among eighth graders went down. What the administration did not \nsay, however, is that use was up in every other category. And, it \nfailed to note that the indicators of use being down among eighth \ngraders was not statistically significant.\n  This is what the Wall Street Journal had to say:\n\n       Clearly, the recent data from the Monitoring the Future \n     Study are far more discouraging than the president has \n     implied. If the president and his administration insist on \n     talking credit for negligible improvements in relatively \n     small cohorts, then they must accept responsibility for the \n     overall dismal record that they have complied over five \n     years.\n\n  The figures are there for anyone to look at. The Washington-based \nresearch organization, the Statistical Assessment Service, did just \nthat in their annual survey of the abuse of research and statistics. As \nthis research organization noted, someone has being playing with the \nnumbers. I offer a Washington Post story noting their findings and ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this playing with the numbers is of a \npiece with another fact. The administration has consistently avoided \nproviding Congress and the public with accountable standards of \nperformance on drug control as required by law. Although the law \ncreating the national drug strategy requires annual quantifiable \nperformance measures, this administration has not complied with the law \nfrom its first day. Although the present drug czar has repeatedly \npromised such standards, we have yet to see them. And what they propose \nto send us is not a report on performance but a methodology for \nreporting on performance.\n  If that system is ever put into place, we won't seek any \naccountability based on them until after this administration leaves \noffice. Does this oversight strike you as paying serious attention to \ndrug policy? Not to mention the law?\n  But this is not all. What the administration has also proposed is a \nformula\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\nfor downgrading the whole effort to have a national strategy. The \nadministration's proposal for reauthorizing the drug czar's office \ndrops the idea of a national strategy for an annual report. It proposes \na 10-year strategy document instead. The effect of this sleight-of-hand \nis to reduce the drug strategy to a proforma exercise, which, by the \nway, is another means to dodge accountability. This administration will \nleave office without ever having provided a serious accounting for its \ndrug policy. If present trends continue, it will leave office having \npresided over a renewed drug epidemic.\n  It is in keeping with a number of other things the administration has \ndone to signal its real feelings about the war on drugs.\n  In keeping with this pattern, this administration has one of the \nworst records I know of in responding to congressional requests. I am \nnot talking about responding to all the requests for information in \nresponse to major investigations. I am talking about responses to the \nnormal business of Government. I am still waiting for the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service and the Justice Department to respond to \nquestions from a hearing last May. Lest you think the questions were a \nburden, I only asked three. I am still waiting.\n  We only recently received responses from the administration to a \nhearing from last October, and not even all those are in. I also have \nrequests of or correspondence to the Department of Defense, Health and \nHuman Services, Justice, and others that are months old. It routinely \ntakes this administration, 3, 4, 5, even 6 months to answer a letter, \nrespond to a request, or provide answers to complete the record of \nhearings. And the answers are often pretty slim and uncommunicative. \nThis is an administration that needs to do a lot of explaining.\n  The administration is now proposing to undermine the laws on cocaine \nsentencing. Let me note at the outset, that contrary to the impression \nin some quarters, the United States does not, I repeat, does not fill \nits jails with nonviolent drug offenders. It does not fill its jails \nwith simple users. The majority of felons in our jails for drug crimes \nare there for trafficking and violent crimes. In the face of the drug \nepidemic, Congress passed and the public supported tougher sentencing \nfor dealers and traffickers who pushed crack to our kids.\n  Now, however, the administration is planning to walk backwards on \ncrack. The administration plans to deal with a disparity in crack and \npowder cocaine sentencing by reducing sentencing for crack. Instead of \nlowering the boom they're lowering the standards. This is hardly a \nmessage to be sending at a time when use of drugs is on the rise. But \nit is in character with what we have seen.\n  From our borders to our streets, we see a similar image. We see \ndisarray and a lack of seriousness. Let me share with you one last \nexample to illustrate why I am a little frustrated. Recently, $3.5 \nmillion was set aside on ONDCP's budget to assist parent groups in \nprevention work with youth. Keep that number, $3.5 million in mind. \nRemember, it was intended to support parent groups. Also keep in mind \nthat these groups have a long track record of working with parents on \ndrug prevention. Now, here goes. Of that $3.5 million, ONDCP pocketed \n$500,000 that did not go to the parent groups. That leaves $3 million. \nSo far so good. That money was transferred to the Center for Substance \nAbuse Prevention (CSAP) at HHS. Of that, it appears that CSAP kept \n$600,000, presumably for administrative costs. That leaves $2.4 million \nfor parent groups. Of that, CSAP awarded a private contractor, with no \nexperience in parent movements and drug prevention, some $900,000. The \npurpose was to develop a program for parent groups. Never mind that the \nparent groups were the experts. Never mind that the contractor then had \nto spend its money talking to these same parent groups on how to help \nparent groups. Never mind that the parent groups have disavowed the \nresulting study and the proposed prevention effort as unworkable. That \nleft roughly $1.5 million for the parent groups. That is to be spread \nover 2 years. It is to be shared by several different groups. The \nresult? Each group will receive less than $70,000 a year, hardly enough \nto cover their costs. Is it any wonder that so many prevention groups \nhave a hearty dislike for CSAP. This is hardly a reassuring story. It \nis, unfortunately, not atypical. It is a small example that explains a \nlot.\n  These are only some of the examples of problems in our drug control \nprogram. I will have more to say about failures and shortcomings in our \ninternational efforts later. The story there is just as grim.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  Dubious Data Made Headlines in 1997\n\n       Each year at this time, the Statistical Assessment Service, \n     a Washington research organization that abbreviates itself \n     STATS, releases its annual list of the most absurd, amusing \n     and alarming science and statistical news stories of 1997.\n       Herewith, a few of the group's choices. The full list may \n     be found on the World Wide Web at www.stats.org.\n       Study Links Cancer Deaths to Site--Associated Press, Sept. \n     11.\n       The AP reported on a new study that linked low levels of \n     radioactivity to cancer deaths among nuclear workers. The \n     researchers found that 29 percent of all deaths among former \n     employees of the Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field Laboratory \n     were attributable to cancer.\n       Sounds pretty scary, but compared to what? For the general \n     population, 35 percent of all deaths of those between 44 and \n     65 years of age are attributable to cancer, as are 25 percent \n     for all deaths of those over 44, according to the National \n     Center for Health Statistics. So the workers died from cancer \n     at about the same rate as anyone else.\n\n\n                      your child's brain on drugs\n\n       Teen Drug Use Dips Down--Associated Press, Aug. 7.\n       Drug Use Rising Among Young Adults--Associated Press, a few \n     hours later the same day.\n       These dueling headlines were based on the same National \n     Household Study on Drug Abuse survey, which found that \n     illicit drug use among the young was up, alarmingly in some \n     cases. The AP's first headline and the story accompanying it \n     illustrate the perils of data slicing--focusing on only one \n     segment of the study population--and a failure to appreciate \n     a concept called statistical significance. According to the \n     study, young people between ages 12 and 15 did report a \n     slight decline in the use of marijuana.\n       But another age bracket, dubbed ``young adults'' 18 to 25, \n     showed a significant increase in marijuana use. More \n     importantly, the drop among younger people was not \n     statistically significant, which means there's a fair chance \n     that the apparent decrease was due to sampling error.\n\n\n                        younger than springtime\n\n       Premature Puberty: Is Early Sexual Development the Price of \n     Pollution?--E-The Environmental Magazine, Nov./Dec. issue.\n       In April, a study published in the medical journal \n     Pediatrics reported that the mean age of onset of \n     menstruation occurred at 12.2 years for African American \n     girls and 12.9 years for white girls.\n       As The Washington Post correctly reported, this meant that \n     American girls were ``developing pubertal characteristics at \n     younger ages than currently used norms,'' which were based on \n     a study of British girls in the 1950s.\n       But many journalists interpreted the findings as an \n     alarming new trend toward lower ages for puberty.\n       This produced scary headlines such as ``Girls Facing the \n     Perils of Puberty Earlier'' (Hartford Courant), ``Puberty \n     Find Could Point to Danger'' (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette) and \n     ``Girls Hitting Puberty at an Earlier Age; Some Worry \n     Environmental Estrogens Could be Behind a New Study's \n     Findings'' (Des Moines Register).\n       These fears of pollution-induced puberty ignored the fact \n     that, as The Post reported, ``the age at which girls first \n     menstruate hasn't changed much since 1950.''\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, my attention was called to an article, an \nop-ed article, in the New York Times for Wednesday, February 4, of this \nyear entitled: ``NATO: A Debate Recast.'' It was authored by Howard \nBaker, Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye.\n  I read the article with great interest and asked the question of \nwhether this had been inserted in the Record at the time it was \nwritten. I am informed that that was not the case, that it has not been \nput in the Record, not been called to the attention of the Members of \nthe Senate.\n  I call the attention of the Members in the Senate to this article \nbecause I\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nthink it makes some very good points about NATO expansion. I \nparticularly want to quote this one provision. These writers said:\n\n       The Senate would be wise to link NATO and European Union \n     expansion. If that link is made, it is essential to stipulate \n     that admission to the European Union is not sufficient \n     qualification for entry into NATO. NATO should weigh any \n     future applicant against the contributions and burdens its \n     membership would entail. What is called for is a definite, if \n     not permanent, pause in this process.\n\n  Mr. President, we soon will be, I assume, taking up the debate on \nNATO expansion. I do ask that Members pay attention to the words of our \ntwo former colleagues, Senator Baker and Senator Nunn; and also Brent \nScowcroft, who was the National Security Advisor to Presidents Ford and \nBush; and Alton Frye, who is senior fellow of the Council on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 4, 1998]\n\n                         NATO: A Debate Recast\n\n    (By Howard Baker, Jr., Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye)\n\n       The looming Senate debate over NATO enlargement marks a \n     historic encounter between good intentions and sound \n     strategy. Despite momentum toward admitting three more \n     members--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--the \n     fundamental interests at stake demand probing examination of \n     the specific candidacies, the approach that has brought the \n     alliance to this fateful juncture and the troubling \n     implications of that approach. Along with many who have \n     worked to build a strong NATO, we harbor grave reservations \n     about the pending expansion and the direction it points.\n       Far from being a cold war relic, NATO should be the \n     cornerstone of an evolving security order in Europe. It \n     provides the infrastructure and experience indispensable to \n     coping with instabilities--Bosnia today, and other \n     troublespots tomorrow. NATO is vital to insuring arms control \n     and maintaining the kind of industrial base that provides a \n     solid defense. Perhaps most important, NATO provides the \n     institutional home for coalitions to meet crises beyond \n     Europe.\n       But a cornerstone is not a sponge. The function of a \n     cornerstone is to protect its own integrity to support a \n     wider security structure, not to dissipate its cohesion by \n     absorbing members and responsibilities beyond prudent limits. \n     A powerful NATO undergirds other institutions, including the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the \n     Western European Union. It makes possible the Partnership for \n     Peace to promote cooperation among countries that are not \n     NATO members.\n       The rush to expand the alliance has put the cart before the \n     horse. Advocates and skeptics of NATO enlargement agree that \n     the transformation of Europe's security structure should be \n     related to the transformation of its economy. As James Baker, \n     the former Secretary of State, has testified, European Union \n     membership ``is just as important as membership in NATO for \n     the countries involved,'' and ``we must make clear that NATO \n     membership for the countries of Central Europe is not a \n     substitute for closer economic ties to the E.U.''\n       In our view, it would have been preferable not to invite \n     more countries to join NATO. At the very least, it would be \n     desirable for the European Union to proceed with its planned \n     expansion before NATO completes the acceptance of the new \n     members.\n       The European Union has now decided to begin negotiations \n     with six aspirants, including the three candidates NATO is \n     considering. Linking NATO expansion to the expansion of the \n     European Union would accomplish several things:\n       It would underscore the connection between Europe's \n     security and its economy--and offer certification that \n     entrants to NATO could afford to meet its defense \n     obligations.\n       It would permit the Partnership for Peace to demonstrate \n     that it should be the proper association for countries \n     outside NATO. So long as the option to join NATO remains \n     open, it utterly undercuts the partnership as the preferred \n     mode of cooperation.\n       It would allow the United States and Russia to focus on the \n     gravest security problem still before us, the formidable \n     hangover of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. \n     The cooperative framework provided by the NATO-Russia \n     Founding Act may be useful, but frictions over NATO distract \n     Moscow and Washington from profound common dangers. Even if \n     everything goes right in expanding NATO, we will have \n     misplaced our priorities during a critical window of \n     opportunity to gain Russian cooperation in controlling \n     nuclear arsenals and preventing proliferation. Russian \n     antagonism is sure to grow if the alliance extends ever \n     closer to Russian territory.\n       The Senate would be wise to link NATO and European Union \n     expansion. If that link is made, it is essential to stipulate \n     that admission to the European Union is not sufficient \n     qualification for entry into NATO. NATO should weigh any \n     future applicant against the contributions and burdens its \n     membership would entail. What is called for is a definite, if \n     not permanent, pause in this process.\n       By leading the charge for NATO expansion, the Clinton \n     Administration may well elicit hasty proposals and \n     considerable pressure to admit other countries. Other Central \n     and East European countries are hoping that they, too, will \n     soon be welcomed into allied ranks.\n       But a military alliance is not a club, and the \n     Administration's rhetoric and policy risk converting NATO \n     into an organization in which obligations are diluted and \n     action is enfeebled. Pursuing that path may simultaneously \n     spur Russian animosity and weaken the alliance's capability \n     to contain it, if required. William Perry, the former Defense \n     Secretary, and Warren Christopher, the former Secretary of \n     State, acknowledge the problematic situation in which the \n     country finds itself. In their words, ``there is no consensus \n     on the wisdom of the path taken so far by the alliance and \n     spearheaded by the Clinton Administration.''\n       While Mr. Perry and Mr. Christopher state that NATO should \n     remain open ``in principle,'' they contend that no additional \n     members should be designated until the three current \n     candidates ``are fully prepared to bear the responsibilities \n     of membership and have been integrated into the alliance.'' \n     That reads to us like advice to slow this train down. We are \n     in accord with that view, and with their argument that NATO \n     should make the experience of Partnership for Peace \n     membership for non-NATO members ``as similar as possible to \n     the experience of NATO membership.''\n       We are dubious, however, that consensus can be found on the \n     Administration's premise that NATO should be receptive to \n     many additional members. That is a prescription for \n     destroying the alliance. It guarantees future discord with \n     present allies, few of whom are prepared to follow the \n     Clinton policy to its logical end, the inclusion of Russia.\n       The task is to build a security structure in which Russia \n     assumes a place commensurate with its geostrategic importance \n     and its progress toward democracy and a market economy. With \n     due respect, those campaigning to expand NATO confuse the \n     longer term challenge of shaping a comprehensive security \n     system with our continuing responsibility to sustain a robust \n     NATO as our principal security bulwark.\n       The question confronting the Senate is not only whether to \n     enlarge NATO, but how, when and on what terms. The imperative \n     now is for the Senate to bring to bear the independent \n     assessment mandated by the Constitution. In that assessment \n     it has several options, including linking alliance expansion \n     with enlargement of the European Union and laying down a \n     marker against an excessively elastic NATO.\n       The Senate has constructive leverage to shape a wiser \n     outcome than simple acquiescence in the President's plan. The \n     widespread grumble that ``NATO expansion is a bad idea whose \n     time has come'' is no basis for policy. This is not a dose of \n     medicine one can swallow and be done with. It is a \n     fundamental extension of American security guarantees, an \n     ill-defined invitation for new members unrelated either to \n     military threats or military capabilities.\n       A final caution to the Administration: It is no service to \n     candor or consensus to invoke the shadow of Versailles, \n     implying that resistance to NATO enlargement would be \n     comparable to Senate rejection of the League of Nations. One \n     doubts that senators will respond well to overdrawn \n     analogies. As John Maynard Keynes noted at the time, the \n     central failure of Versailles lay in the fatal miscalculation \n     of how to deal with a demoralized former adversary. That, \n     above all, is the error we must not repeat.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the key to \nour children's future, and to commemorate an individual who dedicated \nhis life's work to this great cause. Through a resolution sponsored by \nmy good friend Senator Chuck Robb, and co-sponsored by myself and 91 \nother Senate co-sponsors, today has been proclaimed Read Across America \nDay. The day to celebrate the 94th birthday of Dr. Seuss and a day when \nall across the country adults will be reading out loud to children.\n  In fact, Senator Robb is unable to join me right now because he spent \nthe\n\n[[Page S1188]]\n\nmorning reading to kids at a local elementary school, but I know that \nyou will be hearing from him later. First, I would like to say a few \nwords about the crisis we face as a nation if we don't all work toward \nimproving literacy in this Nation.\n  Reading is the key to our children's future. There is an easy way to \nthink about this: from first to third grades you learn to read--from \nthird grade on you read to learn. Now, we have heard some frightening \nstatistics as of late, about our children's performance in various \nsubjects compared to other nations. I want to remind my colleagues and \neveryone in every community around the country--we have a 51 percent \nfunctional illiteracy rate in kids who are graduating from high school. \nThat means, these kids can't read a newspaper, balance a checkbook or \nread a bus schedule to get themselves to a job, let alone hold down a \ngood job. This, in America, is a tragedy. And we must stop it. We must \nall be a part of the solution.\n  Reading aloud to children, beginning at the youngest age, is a big \npart of the solution. A national commission on reading found that \nreading out loud to a child for at least 30 minutes a day is the single \nmost important factor to the child learning to read and loving to read. \nAnd so, on what would have been his 94th birthday, I say thank you to \nDr. Seuss, whose given name was Mr. Theodor Geisel, for all the \nfantastic, creative and wonderful books he gave to countless numbers of \nparents and children to enjoy in this most significant activity for a \nchild's success.\n  Many pro-literacy groups have sponsored activities so that every \nchild in the country is read aloud to by an adult for at least a half \nhour today. I endorse this activity whole-heartedly--and I try to lead \nby example by read-ing to my reading partner in the Everybody Wins! \nprogram that I launched here in Washington three years ago.\n  The Everybody Wins! program pairs adult reading mentors with young \nchildren in elementary schools to foster a love of reading and of \nlearning and to provide that critical reading aloud activity. I am so \nproud of all the Congressional Members and staff participating in the \nprogram--now totaling more than 450 reading every day of the week \nduring lunch hour at two schools here on Capitol Hill. In all we now \nhave 10 schools and 1200 reading partners and students participating in \nthe Everybody Wins! program. But we must reach many, many more \nchildren. We need 10 times that if we are going to do what we should be \ndoing in the District of Columbia.\n  The Everybody Wins! program has benefitted enormously from corporate \nsupport to help us reach more children.\n  As it happens, tomorrow night is the third annual event that makes \nexpansion of Everybody Wins! possible--it is called Links to Literacy \nand takes place just a stone's throw from here in Union Station. With \ncomplete bi-partisan support, and sponsored by the PGA tour we hope to \nbe able to impact many more children in the year to come. I want to \nthank all of my colleagues who joined with me in lending their names to \nLinks to Literacy and I look forward to seeing all of you tomorrow \nnight.\n  Also, I want to commend some extraordinary programs at work in my \nhome state of Vermont: Mother Goose Logs On, a collaborative effort \nbetween Nynex and IBM that improves literacy through interactive \ntechnology; the America Reads program that so many of our college \nstudents are tutoring in and the Vermont Center for the Book which has \nworked to improve access to books for kids in so many ways.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to my \nfriend Senator Abraham Ribicoff and his remarkable legacy. His passing \nhas left a void in public service that will be difficult to fill. Over \nmore than 40 years of public service, he set a standard for integrity, \ndedication, and wisdom that is difficult to match.\n  Abe Ribicoff's journey to the Senate was an arduous one. He was born \nnot to power, but rather to poverty. His father was a Polish Jewish \nimmigrant who worked in a factory and as a peddler. After graduating \nfrom high school, young Abraham Ribicoff worked for a year at a zipper \nand buckle factory in New Britain, Connecticut, to earn money to attend \nNew York University. After a year, he transferred to Chicago. There, he \nwas such an assiduous and gifted student that he was admitted to the \nUniversity of Chicago law school--one of the most prestigious in the \nnation--without an undergraduate degree.\n  After graduating from law school, Abraham Ribicoff realized his \ncalling was that of the public servant. He entered politics at an early \nage, but without the benefit of well-placed connections or cronies. He \nworked his way up from the lower house of the Connecticut legislature \nby mastering complicated legislation and earning the respect of his \npeers, and after ten years he was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In 1954, Abraham Ribicoff was elected Governor of \nConnecticut.\n  His personal experience of poverty instilled in Sen. Ribicoff a \ncompassion and a desire to serve the public good that never faded. The \ndesire to help the unfortunate and marginalized members of our society \nwas the hallmark of his political career. As Governor of Connecticut, \nhe established a strong, progressive record. As the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare in the Kennedy \nadministration, he promoted policies to improve the living conditions, \nworking environment, and health care of all Americans. And as a Senator \nduring the 1960s and '70s, he was one of the strongest supporters of \nMedicare, education funding, environmental protection and regulation, \nand auto safety standards.\n  Most of all, I remember Abe Ribicoff as a man of integrity who never \nwavered from his convictions or sacrificed his principles for political \nexpediency. He was a statesman who disregarded opinion polls and \ngoverned by\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nconscience. His death marks the passing of a great public servant, and \nit reminds us that America could use many more like him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1188-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEW MEXICO'S CUARTO-CENTENARIO CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about a \nvery special anniversary this year in New Mexico, and to share a \nmessage from President Clinton to everyone celebrating the state's \nCuartocentenario.\n  The date July 1, 1998, marks 400 years since a small group of Spanish \npioneers ventured north from Mexico, up the Rio Grande Valley and \nsettled in what is now North-Central New Mexico. The settlers, led by \nDon Juan de Onate, established a small mission at the confluence of the \nRio Chama and the Rio Grande and next to an Indian Pueblo the \ninhabitants called ``Ohke''. The Spanish settlers named their mission \nSan Gabriel de los Espanoles.\n  This year is not just about recognizing these early Spanish \nsettlements, but about celebrating the Hispanic people themselves and \nthe many contributions they have made to the history of this continent \nand this country over the last 400 years. Indeed, we can point to all \naspects of American culture, from literature to sports, and identify \nmany Hispanic individuals who have made significant contributions.\n  I look forward to celebrating this anniversary and the Hispanic \nculture throughout this year in New Mexico. I ask that a copy of \nPresident Clinton's message to all who are celebrating this historic \noccasion be printed in the Record.\n  The message follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, February 24, 1998.\n       Warm greetings to everyone celebrating New Mexico's \n     Cuartocentenario.\n       In 1598, when Juan de Onate led a band of soldiers and \n     Franciscan priests to the land we now know as New Mexico, few \n     could have foreseen the impact of their expedition. The chain \n     of events that would ultimately lead to statehood for New \n     Mexico in 1912 had begun and would change our country \n     forever.\n       This year's celebration of the 400th anniversary of New \n     Mexico reminds us all of the long and rich history of this \n     beautiful place. Today's New Mexicans live with that history. \n     The state's original peoples, who are represented by 21 \n     pueblos and tribes ranging from Apache to Zuni, would \n     consider four centuries a blink in time, for their ancestors \n     arrived more than 10,000 years ago. And the remains of \n     earlier civilizations can still be seen in New Mexico.\n       Our 47th state is a fascinating mixture of old and new, \n     deserts and forests, mountains and valleys, small towns and \n     urban centers, cattle ranches and microprocessor plants, \n     scientists, artists, and farmers. While taking pride in their \n     colorful past, New Mexicans also look to the future with \n     vision and confidence. With a strong dedication to quality \n     education and a clean environment, with thriving agriculture, \n     expanding industry, and a growing, ethnically diverse \n     population, New Mexico is approaching the 21st century with \n     energy and enthusiasm. This milestone anniversary offers a \n     wonderful opportunity to reflect on the extraordinary \n     achievements of New Mexico's people, remembering their \n     accomplishments in the past and celebrating the promise of \n     the future.\n       Best wishes to all for a memorable celebration.\n     Bill Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1189-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1189-S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1173.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1173) to authorize funds for the construction of \n     highways, for highway safety programs, and for mass transit \n     programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill with a modified \ncommittee amendment in the nature of a substitute (Amendment No. 1676).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this as you know is the so-called surface \ntransportation legislation, sometimes called the highway bill, \nsometimes called ISTEA II. We are ready to do business here. Anybody \nwho has amendments I hope will come over and present them. We are ready \nto take them up. There is no waiting. There is plenty of opportunity. \nSo I hope those within listening distance will heed this very kind \ninvitation to please report for duty.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me ask Senator Chafee a question. Did Senator Chafee \nwant to outline the agreement we have reached?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor this \nafternoon to talk about an agreement that has been reached with regard \nto the highway bill, to talk about where we are and what the highway \nbill is going to look like, and, obviously as each of us will do, I \nwant to talk about the impact on my own State of this very important \nagreement.\n  Let me give people a little history to sort of define how we came to \nthe moment of reaching this agreement. First of all, last year in the \ntax bill I offered an amendment to take the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on \ngasoline that had, under the 1991 budget agreement, gone into general \nrevenue and been spent. It was the first tax on gasoline since we had \nthe Highway Trust Fund that went to general Government. What my \namendment in the tax bill last year did was it took that 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon tax on gasoline and took the money away from general revenue and \nput it back into the trust fund where it belonged.\n  All over America, when Americans go to the gas pump and put that \nnozzle into their tank and pump gas, right on the gasoline pump it says \nthere is bad news and there is good news. The bad news is that roughly \na third of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes; the good news is \nthat the money goes to build roads. The only problem is, prior to today \nthe good news was not true. Between 25 cents and 30 cents out of every \ndollar of gasoline taxes was being siphoned off to spend on things \nother than roads. We have reached an agreement today that will, over \nthe next 6 years, end that process. We have reached an agreement today \nthat will guarantee that over the next 6 years every penny collected in \nthe 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline will go to build roads and only \nto build roads. What that will mean is that we will raise the total \nlevel of spending in the bill that is before the Senate, in terms of \ncommitted obligations, by $26 billion.\n  For people who are trying to figure out what that means to them and \ntheir State, let me give you a couple of numbers. That will mean that \nover this 6-year highway bill, we will spend on roads roughly 45 \npercent more than we spent in ISTEA, our previous highway bill. For my \nState, because of the leadership of the chairman of this committee, \nSenator Chafee, in trying to eliminate the unfairness to donor States, \nwhen you combine the new funds that are available with the fact that \nunder the Chafee bill donor States will receive a minimum of 91 cents \nout of every dollar they send to Washington in gasoline tax back to \ntheir States, what it will mean is that my State will, under the new \nbill, receive 54 percent more funding than it received under the last \nbill.\n  That, in Texas, will mean an opportunity to rebuild our crumbling \nhighway system. We have 31,000 miles of substandard highways. We have \ntens of thousands of substandard bridges. That 54 percent increase in \nfunding for Texas will mean our ability to improve our highways. It \nwill mean that thousands of people who are dying because of poor roads \nwon't die. It will mean an improved infrastructure that will mean more \njobs, more growth, more opportunity all over the country. It will mean \nthat people will spend less time in traffic and, obviously, have the \nopportunity to spend more time at work or more time with their families \nor more time doing what they choose to do.\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\n  So, I believe that this is a major step forward. It is a step forward \nin terms of building roads. It is a step forward in people seeing the \nGovernment do what they believed it has committed to do. Now that we \nhave all the gasoline taxes going into the highway trust fund, we will, \nunder this bill, for the first time, be in a position to say to people \nthat every penny we are collecting in gasoline taxes under this bill \nwill be spent on highways; that money will not be siphoned off to pay \nfor other programs; that we will not use the trust fund as a slush fund \nfor other forms of Government spending; and that when Americans pay \ngasoline taxes, the bad news is, a third of the cost of a gallon of \ngasoline in America is taxes, but the good news will be that, for the \nfirst time in a long time, every penny of those taxes will end up being \nspent on roads. I believe that is a very good piece of news.\n  Finally, let me say there is one additional piece of good news that I \nthink every Member should understand, and that is this agreement does \nnot bust the budget. We have agreed to use the gasoline tax to fund \nhighways and only to fund highways for that portion that goes to roads. \nAnd we have agreed that in writing a budget, we will offset this dollar \nfor dollar, so that we will not bust the spending cap.\n  I hope that the House will decide to do it this way as well and that \nwe will have an opportunity to use gasoline taxes, that portion that \ngoes to highway construction in the highway trust fund, for roads and \nonly for roads.\n  So I thank the majority leader. I thank Senator Chafee, Senator \nBaucus and Senator Warner. I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership. I \nbelieve that this amendment, which is now scheduled to come up \ntomorrow, will be adopted by an overwhelming vote. I believe, based on \nthat vote, that 85 or 90 percent of the pending amendments will go \naway. I believe it will put us on the road to passing a highway bill \nthat will benefit everybody in America, and we are doing it the way \nfamilies make decisions about priorities. We are doing it by deciding \nthat this is a high priority.\n  We collected the tax for the purpose of building roads, and we are \ngoing to build roads with those taxes, and we are going to pay for it \nby not spending as much on other things. It seems to me that this is a \nrare example of Government really working the way people believe it \nshould. I congratulate everyone involved. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas \nfor his hard work in connection with this highway legislation. He was \nright when he said that it was his efforts that brought what was \nconsidered the 4.3-cent gasoline tax, that then went in the general \nfund, into the highway trust fund.\n  I have to confess that I was not an enthusiastic supporter of that \neffort, but I can certainly see the rationale behind it. The Senator \nhad the votes and, as I recall, won that vote rather overwhelmingly.\n  The Senator has been intensely interested in the situation that not \nonly affects his State but a series of States leading to the border, \nthe additional traffic that has been generated by a program I was for, \nhe was for and that I believe has been a great benefit overall for our \ncountry but has been very difficult on his State and some of the \nneighboring States, and that is the so-called NAFTA truckloads, where \nthese trucks are rumbling down into Mexico and from Mexico up into the \nUnited States carrying goods, which was the whole objective of what we \nsought when we passed the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Texas has worked very hard to \nprovide some extra money to take care of those roads that are taking an \nincredible pounding from the NAFTA trucks. In the agreement that we \nhave reached, we have provided, as a result of the pressing of the \nSenator from Texas, some $450 million, which we will be presenting to \nthe committee tomorrow, and it is my hope and belief that the committee \nwill approve that additional money.\n  I tip my hat to the Senator from Texas. He is a veritable bulldog in \nconnection with these matters. When he and the senior Senator from West \nVirginia team up, it is a formidable aggregation. I salute both of \nthem. As a matter of fact, they came away with everything they sought. \nBut in the agreement that we reached, they made some concessions to \nother programs that they might not have been too enthusiastic about. So \nthe whole thing was a compromise. All of us had to give, and I think \nthe result is a good one for our country.\n  What will happen next, Madam President? I and the distinguished \nranking member of the Environment Committee will take this to our \ncommittee tomorrow. We are both for it. We will be salesmen for it. We \nare not just messengers; we are salesmen for this program. The staffs \nhave met and appear to be enthusiastic about what we are undertaking \nhere. We look forward to our meeting tomorrow. If all goes well, we \ncould report it out, and then I believe that we cannot bring up \nfinancial matters until Wednesday, that is, amendments that deal with \nfinancial matters to this bill. But that can be changed, and we can, \nhopefully, bring up this amendment that the Senator from Texas was \ndiscussing.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield or if I \nmay have some time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. Yes, I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, we have completed today what I consider to \nbe one of the most remarkable group of meetings that I have \nparticipated in during my nearly 40 years in the Senate. Those meetings \nwere called by the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott.\n  What brought us to the meetings were these circumstances: A 6-year \nhighway authorization bill had been reported to the floor. Numerous \nSenators came to me and said to me, ``Senator, we need more money.'' I \nam not on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am not on the \nBudget Committee. So I suppose I am a player who, in a way, has just \ncome in from the outside.\n  But working with the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, \nwhose amendment in the Finance Committee last year effected the \ntransfer of the 4.3-cent gas tax into the highway trust fund, he and I \nand Senator Baucus and Senator Warner joined together in an amendment \nwhich would have provided $30.9 billion in additional contract \nauthority for highways and bridges. Am I correct?\n  It was our desire to see this money that was building up in the \nhighway trust fund spent on highways and bridges. Now, of the 4.3-cent \ngas tax that goes into the highway trust fund, 3.45 cents is intended \nto go for highways and bridges and 0.85 cents goes for mass transit.\n  Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner, and I worked hard last fall in an \neffort to get cosponsors of our amendment. As a final result, we got 50 \nother cosponsors which, added to the four of us, made a total of 54 \ncosponsors of the amendment. And we had a good many Senators who told \neach of us that they would vote for the amendment even though they \nwould not cosponsor it, if and when it came to a vote.\n  The majority leader then made the highway bill the pending business, \nand called certain Senators to meetings in his office, and we have had \nseveral such meetings. The participants have been the majority leader, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Warner, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, and \nmyself. On at least one occasion, Mr. D'Amato was included.\n  In any event, those were difficult meetings. In the final analysis, \neverybody sacrificed something. In the end, we agreed to increase the \namount in the bill $26 billion for highways. I ask my colleagues, am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Twenty-six.\n  Mr. BYRD. Twenty-six. All right. I thank from the bottom of my heart \nmy friend, that old crusty New Englander who wins our admiration and \nrespect, Mr. Chafee. He and I have gone round and round about this, but \nin the final analysis, we have joined hands. So, the people of \nAppalachia, who constitute 22 million people in 399 counties of 13 \nStates--those people who have been promised these corridors now for 32 \nyears--can now see the light at the end of the tunnel, because what we \nhave agreed to here will be the $300 million that is already in the \nreported highway\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\nbill, plus $1.89 billion, which will be added according to our \nagreement, thus making a total of $2.19 billion, which conforms to the \nPresident's request.\n  For the entire cycle 1998-2003, then, there will be $2.19 billion for \nAppalachian highways. That is not going to be earmarked money. That \nmoney is going to those 13 States on the basis of the Appalachian \nhighway mileage that remains to be constructed and considering the \ncosts of completion. Throughout the region, of the total Appalachian \ndevelopment highway system, 78 percent of the system has been completed \nor is under construction.\n  Beside and beyond the Appalachian portion, this agreement will \nbenefit every State in the Union in terms of additional dollars for \nhighways. I believe I am making a correct statement. The distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, is nodding his head in the \naffirmative.\n  Let me close by thanking him again and by thanking the majority \nleader, by thanking Mr. Gramm of Texas, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \nDomenici. It has been a beautiful exercise in give and take and finally \ncoming to a consensus and shaking hands and saying, ``We are going to \nstand by this agreement.''\n  I thank all Senators, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I salute the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia for the tremendous work he did in connection \nwith this, not only just the Appalachian regional highway portion of \nthis bill but the overall bill.\n  As the Senator mentioned, he was in on all the negotiations and \npressed forward to conclusion. He outlined vigorously the needs of, and \nI don't want to say just West Virginia, because West Virginia is just \npart of the Appalachian region, he stressed the needs for all the \nAppalachian regional area and prevailed. I salute him for the work he \ndid.\n  If he can fit it in, I would like to be asked down to the dedication \nof one of those roads. I have never seen them, to tell you the truth. I \nthink I will go down and take a look. I have heard about them.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. He will receive an invitation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you. Thank you.\n  If it is anything like when we used to build roads at home when I was \nGovernor, we would have a ribbon-cutting about every 2 miles of road we \nbuilt. In any event, I look forward to it. And I salute the \ndistinguished Senator with whom I have had such pleasure serving in the \nSenate ever since I came here. He had been here long before I ever got \nhere. It has been one of the real treats of my experience in the Senate \nto have served with Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can only but add to the remarks that have already been \ngiven, first, on the substance of the agreement and, second, in my \nthanks to all the Senators who have participated so intensely, so \nvigorously in the last week, or so.\n  The amendment that has been agreed to, first, is a significant \namendment. It is an increase of about $26 billion in contract authority \nover 6 years, from $145 billion to about $171 billion for highway \nprograms, plus about $2 billion for safety programs. So the agreement \nis very significant. It increases highway spending by roughly 20 \npercent over the committee-reported bill.\n  Now, the actual spending by the States, that is, the outlays, may be \na little less than that. I hope not, but that amount is up to the \nBudget Committees and the Appropriations Committees.\n  Where did we come up with this money? Well, it started with Senator \nGramm's amendment last year, which transferred the 4.3-cent gasoline \ntax to the highway trust fund. That solved the first problem, namely \nputting that revenue in the Highway Trust Fund. But the second problem \nwas that the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has \njurisdiction over highways, could not increase the contract authority \nin order to spend that 4.3 cents without an agreement on the budget.\n  I am pleased that the agreement we reached today allows most of the \n4.3 cents, namely the 3.45 cents that goes to the highway account, to \nbe spent on highways. So the agreement provides for an increase from \n$145 billion in contract authority in the committee bill, to $171 \nbillion. There is an additional $2 billion that goes to safety programs \nunder the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, for a total increase \nof $173 billion.\n  This agreement is fair to all regions of the country. I know a lot of \nSenators were thinking, ``What are those Senators doing in Senator \nLott's office? What have they agreed to? Aren't they just taking care \nof their own States? And are they being fair to us, too?'' The fact is \nthat Senator Chafee and I made an extra effort since the committee \nreported the bill out last fall, to talk to Senators who have had \nspecific concerns with the bill--and meritorious concerns, I might add. \nThis agreement, which will be incorporated into a committee amendment \ntomorrow, by and large, addresses those concerns.\n  Now, I cannot say it totally accommodates everybody. No amendment on \nhighways can totally accommodate everybody. In fact, among the group \nthat have been working on this agreement--Senator Gramm; myself; \nSenator Byrd; the leader; the chairman of our committee, Senator \nChafee, certainly; and Senator Warner--each of us would have fashioned \nthis agreement a little bit differently if left to our own devices. But \nwhen the Senators see what is in the amendment and reflect on it and on \nthe competing interests of other Senators, I daresay they are going to \nrealize that this is fair. I would like to also add what this agreement \nwill mean to the economy. It will give it a big boost. The Department \nof Transportation statistics indicate that for every billion dollars in \nadditional highway spending, there are 42,000 more jobs in America--a \nbillion dollars equal 42,000 jobs. That is in addition to the benefits \nderived from relieving congestion and helping America's competitive \nplace in the world with better transportation systems. Furthermore, \nthere is investment in intelligent transportation systems, new \ntechnologies which are going to further improve our transportation \ncapabilities.\n\n  Let me add too that this agreement is within the budget. It is very \nimportant that this increase be within the budget, within budget caps. \nAnd I say that, Madam President, because this morning one of the \nnewspapers had a headline, page 1, saying, in effect, ``Uh-oh, there \ngoes Congress again. It is going to bust the budget.''\n  I appreciate the concern about busting the budget. I think all of us \nin the Senate do not want to break the budget caps or the provisions \nand the amounts that are in the budget. This amendment is consistent \nwith the budget. We do not break the budget. It is true there is an \nincrease in highway dollars as a consequence of this amendment, but it \nis also true that we are within the budget.\n  Senator Domenici, the very able chairman of the Budget Committee was \nvery clear: We have to live within the budget. And we do.\n  I have the highest regard for him. He is a tough fighter. He is a \nvery intelligent opponent. In fact, I learned a lot, Madam President, \nwatching Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nChafee. And what I learned is not only how tough and intelligent and \nfair-minded they are, but how committed they are to the legislative \nprocess. At the end of the meeting we all said, ``Hey, this is within \nthe ballpark. It may not be perfect. Each of us would probably prefer \nto do it a little differently. But it's a good outcome for all.''\n  I am, frankly, very honored to be a part of the process. I will not \nbelabor the point, but Winston Churchill once said that--and let me \nparaphrase here, Democracy, with all of its delays and inefficiencies \nand faint starts, is absolutely the worst form of government, except \nthere's none better.\n  I think that the meetings we have been having over the last week or \nso are a good example of that. And I only hope now that we can get this \nadopted,\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\nfinish with the highway bill, get on to conference, and, most \nimportantly, put it on the President's desk so that all of our work \nwill come to fruition.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Did the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator, could \nI speak for 2 minutes on this bill? I was part of the negotiating.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Madam President.\n  We have reached, to the extent that the budget chairman could have \nsome kind of influence, agreement on making sure that we fund this new \n4.3 cents, which Senator Gramm last year had moved from the general \nfund to the trust fund for highways. My role was to make sure that we \ndid not spend any more than the 4.3 cents portion of that which goes to \nthe highway programs of this country.\n  You would be surprised what differing opinions there were about what \nis the right dollar number, because there are different versions of \nwhat one was trying to do with the Byrd-Gramm bill and what Senator \nChafee was trying to do with his bill and what I was trying to \nadvocate.\n  But let me say to the Senators--some of whom have not gone on the \nByrd-Gramm bill because they were wondering what its impact on the \nbudget would be--I cannot say it will not have any impact, because if I \nshowed up here and said that, knowing what I know about the budget, I \nwould be laughed off the Senate floor, because it is a substantial \naddition to the trust fund, which would not have been there had Senator \nGramm not moved that 4.3 cents from the general fund, where it was \nbeing used before for deficit reduction as part of President Clinton's \nfirst budget, and there would not be this additional money.\n  So I had a difficult problem with it. And some Senators were waiting \nfor me to suggest that we would not have to break the caps, that is, \nthe agreed upon annual expenditure levels written into law for the next \n5 years which, as I will repeat over and over on this floor, are dollar \nnumbers. And that is not a process. That means we have written into \nstatute, law, how much we can spend in appropriated expenditures--the \n13 bills we do plus the highway bill and a few other things. That is \nthe total amount each year. If you spend more than that, then all of \nGovernment gets an across-the-board sequester cut.\n  We did our best to arrive at, what is the number. I think it is fair \nto say that it was somewhere between a total of $171 billion and $174 \nbillion or $175 billion; and then we settled on $173 billion. That is a \npretty fair number from the standpoint of asking the Congressional \nBudget Office: How much will it spend? How much contract authority do \nyou need to have all of that money obligated? And that is where we are.\n  Now, that will be divided over the 6 years. The first 6 years is \nalready settled, because we have completed it. But the next 5 will have \nnew activity. And I think by the time Senator Chafee's committee \nproduces the bill, each State can look and see what it is going to get \nin relation to donor and donee States. And I believe it is going to be \na very satisfactory bill.\n  There are a lot of other things that have to be done besides just \npour highways in the country. There is some research that has to be \ndone. There is some money that has to go to States that have special \nproblems because they have an awful lot of public lands in their \nStates. There are Indian roads, which in the last 6 years we have \nstarted funding. They are the poorest, in roads, of any group in \nAmerica, and their reservations are the poorest, in terms of \ntransportation, of any. That money has to be in here.\n  But I think under Senator Chafee's leadership there will be no donor-\ndonee disparity exceeding 91 percent. They will get 91 percent of the \nmoney back. And the other part will go to the various programs that are \nnational in scope or specific. I think that is a rather good final \nconclusion. I regret having to have stood in the way of this bill for \nso long. But when it finally comes down to it, I think we all \nunderstand better what we are going to do.\n  Now, to the final observation: Can we fund this bill and not have to \nbreak the caps? I can tell you that we certainly will be able to in the \nyear 1999 in the budget that we are going to write. Now, this money \nspends out more rapidly as years go on. I am just bound to do the best \nI can and to tell it as honestly as I can.\n  I believe we will be able to meet the caps and do this, but it may \nvery well be that in a few years we will not be able to do that. I do \nnot think it is going to be a big disparity. And I think that everybody \nunderstands that the people of this country deserve that highway trust \nfund moneys be spent on highways. That is why it has been very \ndifficult to say, we should not have this program. Because that money \nis there, what can it be used for? Since we voted overwhelmingly to put \nit in that trust fund, we ought to spend it for highways. There is \nnothing by way of infrastructure in our Nation--to use the word as \ngenerously as you want--there is nothing more wanting in the country \nthan the highway infrastructures of our respective sovereign States. \nAnd we will make a pretty big dent in catching up with this bill.\n  So I am pleased to be a part of it. I didn't write the bill, but it \nwas a good experience. And I want to close by saying in particular, \nwhen you have a leader who wants to get things done--Trent Lott, our \nleader, wants to get things done. We could have gone on for I don't \nknow how many more days, but we finished in about 3 or 4 days of rather \nlengthy sessions getting as much input as we could.\n\n  Now the Senate will speak. We will look at this bill that Senator \nChafee will produce, a substitute that reaches the conclusions that \nthis negotiating team had, and then the Senate will decide what it is \ngoing to do. I, for one, have committed that I am going to support the \nproduct that is forthcoming. Not every bit of it is what I would do, \nbut I think overall it is probably the best we could do for our \ncountry. I hope it leaves the Senate with a very large majority. The \nHouse still has to do theirs. We have to go to conference. And States, \nby May 1, ought to be getting some additional obligational authority.\n  I thank the Senators for their participation, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I want to salute the Senator from New \nMexico for his part in this. He had responsibilities. He had \nresponsibilities to guard the budget. And he carried out those \nresponsibilities. I felt very strongly allied with him in connection \nwith those efforts, and I think what we came out with was a \nsatisfactory solution. Are all of us totally satisfied? Of course not. \nBut we are totally satisfied that the end result was as good as we \ncould get under the pressing problems we are faced with. So I am going \naway happy and hope that the Senator from New Mexico is likewise.\n  I also want to join his tribute to the majority leader. The majority \nleader was the one who got us in there and actually proposed the final \ncompromise that we agreed to. So he deserves a lot of credit for moving \nus along.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \npatience.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. It is good to be of service.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized for 7 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell and Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1695 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I also want to say I was here on the \nfloor during the recent agreement that was made on the highway bill. I \ncommend my fellow Senator, my colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, for \nworking with Senator Byrd in what I think\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\nis a very important accomplishment not just for my State but for all \nAmericans.\n  Many of us feel that our transportation infrastructure is the key to \nour continued economic viability in this country. Many of us have been \nvery concerned that we have shortchanged that infrastructure by putting \nmoney in other areas.\n  What Senator Gramm and what Senator Byrd did today was to assure that \nwe are going to have the money that people pay in their gasoline taxes \neach day when they go to work, assure that it comes back in the form of \na user fee to help ease the transportation congestion in our urban \nareas and to make it easier to access our rural areas in this country.\n  I commend Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus for working with Senator \nGramm and Senator Byrd to come out with a very fair agreement that will \nbenefit everyone. I especially thank also Senator Domenici, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, for helping to make sure that would \nhappen without busting the budget caps because that is also our \nresponsibility as stewards of our Nation.\n  I think we had a very important agreement, and I look forward to \nvoting for this agreement tomorrow on the floor. I think everyone will \nbe pleased that we are going to have the money that is paid every day \nby Americans, that 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, go right where it \nshould go, and that is to ease our transportation byways and highways \nand the transit systems that keep us from having congestion and \nenvironmental pollution in our cities.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her very kind comments. We appreciate those remarks.\n  She is absolutely right. The senior Senator did do a splendid job not \njust for his State but all the trucks coming and going in connection \nwith the NAFTA agreement, particularly the border crossings down in her \nState. We are pleased things came out the way they did. We look forward \nto her support when we bring the bill up on the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator from Rhode Island would yield, I am \nhappy he mentioned the corridors, the trade corridors, that were also \nincluded in the recent agreement.\n  As we have opened our trade with Mexico, it has caused a huge \ncongestion on the NAFTA corridors that come through my State but also \nthrough other States that are on the border and also up into the rest \nof our country.\n  I am very pleased you have allocated an extra amount for wear and \ntear because it will ease the congestion and stop some of the long \ndelays that we are seeing at the border because we don't have enough \nbridges and gateways. This will help alleviate that and make it even \neasier to trade with our neighbor to the south.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I have seen those jams down there. I \nhave seen them in California by Tijuana. The trucks were all lined up. \nIt is incredible. I saw a little bit of it in Texas, but that was just \na sampling of what later has occurred as the NAFTA agreement has come \ninto full flower with the jam-ups on both sides of the border, trucks \ntrying to come across, customs inspectors trying to do their job. It \ntruly is tremendously congested.\n\n  Both Senators from Texas are absolutely right in addressing this \nproblem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1189-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to talk about a point \nof history as well. That is to commemorate, today, from 162 years ago, \nTexas Independence Day.\n  Each year I look forward to March 2. This is a special day for \nTexans, a day that fills our hearts with pride. On this day, 162 years \nago, a solemn convention of 54 men, including my great great \ngrandfather Charles S. Taylor, met in the small settlement of \nWashington-on-the-Brazos. There they signed the Texas Declaration of \nIndependence. The declaration stated:\n\n       We, therefore . . . do hereby resolve and declare . . . \n     that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign \n     and independent republic . . .\n\n  At the time, Texas was a remote territory of Mexico. It was \nhospitable only to the bravest and most determined of settlers. After \ndeclaring our independence, the founding delegates quickly wrote a \nconstitution for the new born republic. Then they organized an interim \ngovernment.\n  As was the case when the American Declaration of Independence was \nsigned in 1776, our declaration only pointed the way toward a goal. It \nwould extract a price of enormous effort and great sacrifice.\n  While the convention sat in Washington-on-the-Brazos, 6,000 Mexican \ntroops were marching on the Alamo to challenge the newly created \nrepublic. Several days earlier, from the Alamo, Col. William Barrett \nTravis sent his immortal letter to the people of Texas--and to all \nAmericans. He knew the Mexican Army was approaching. And he knew that \nhe had only a very few men to help defend the San Antonio fortress. \nColonel Travis wrote:\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall--I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days.\n       If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain \n     myself as long as possible and die like a solder who never \n     forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his \n     country--Victory or Death. William Barret Travis, Lt. Col. \n     Commander.\n\n  What American, Texan or otherwise, can fail to be stirred by Col. \nTravis' resolve? In fact, Col. Travis' dire prediction came true--4-\n5,000 Mexican troops laid seize to the Alamo. In the battle that \nfollowed, 184 brave men died in a heroic but vain attempt to fend off \nSanta Anna's overwhelming army. but the Alamo was crucial in Tax \nindependence. Because those heroes at the Alamo held out for so long, \nSanta Anna's forces were battered and diminished.\n  Gen. Sam Houston gained the time he needed to devise a strategy to \ndefeat Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, just a month or so \nlater, April 21, 1836. The Lone Star was visible on the horizon at \nlast.\n  We Texans continue to commemorate the heroic times during which we \nwon our independence, when we existed as a republic and finally joined \nthe Union.\n  Each year, on March 2, there is a ceremony at Washington-on-the-\nBrazos State Park where there is a replica of the modest cabin where \nthe 54 patriots laid down their lives and treasure for freedom.\n  Each year, as close as possible to March 2, I read Colonel Travis' \nletter to my colleagues in the Senate, a tradition started by Senator \nJohn Tower. This is a reminder to them and to all of us of the pride \nTexans share in our history and in being the only State that came into \nthe Union as a republic.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to continue the tradition that was \nstarted by Senator Tower because we do have a unique heritage in Texas \nwhere we did fight for our freedom. Having grown up in the family and \nhearing the stories of my great-great-grandfather, it was something \nthat was ingrained in us--fighting for your freedom was something that \nyou did. We did it for Texas and we have done it for America.\n  I think it is very important that we remember the people who \nsacrificed, the 184 men who died at the Alamo, the men who died at \nGilliard, who made it possible for us to win the battle of San Jacinto \nand become a nation which we were for 10 years before we entered the \nUnion as a republic.\n  Now we fly both flags proudly--the American flag and the Texas flag--\nover our capital. I am very pleased to once again commemorate our great \nheritage and history.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1193-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1193-S1194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORTING IMF REPLENISHMENT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to discuss the President's \nrequest\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nto provide new support for the International Monetary Fund.\n  Last December I spent two weeks in Southeast Asia, visiting the \nPhilippines, Brunei, Thailand and Indonesia.\n  Two of these countries, Thailand and Indonesia, are among the nations \nhardest hit by the currency crisis. They, along with the Philippines \nand South Korea, are working with the IMF to reform their financial \nsystems and promote an early recovery.\n  I believe it is very much in our interest to help them through this \ncrisis, and to provide insurance against a new one by supporting the \nfull request for IMF replenishment.\n\n\n                       ECONOMIC STAKES FOR THE US\n\n  Why is this?\n  First, all the countries suffering from the crisis are important \nmarkets. South Korea is our sixth largest export market. Thailand \nbought nearly $9 billion worth of American exports last year. And the \nlonger this crisis continues, the less they will be able to buy.\n  So economists predict that our economy will lose a half point to a \nfull point of growth next year, meaning $40 billion to $80 billion. \nBringing it home, I got a letter last month saying a Montana \nsemiconductor company has just laid off 85 people because of this \ncrisis. If we fail to stop the crisis now, we could well see worse, as \npressure grows on China to devalue its own currency. The result of that \nwould be new panics and currency crashes, coupled with greater economic \nlosses for America.\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SECURITY STAKES\n\n  National security should be an even greater concern in this crisis.\n  In the past century, we fought seven foreign wars: the Spanish-\nAmerican War, the ``Philippine Insurrection'' which followed it, World \nWar I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War. And of these \nseven wars, we fought no less than five in countries affected by the \nAsian financial crisis. Even today, we have 37,000 troops in South \nKorea to deter a North Korean invasion.\n  Since the 1970s, economic growth has helped make Asia more \nprosperous, stable, and peaceful. And that has been of immense national \nsecurity benefit to us. If the region falls into depression, that could \nchange. Southeast Asia could become destabilized; North Korea could see \nan opportunity in an unstable South; and we could see other \nconsequences we cannot now predict.\n\n\n                            FOUR CONDITIONS\n\n  So it is in our interest to end this crisis. And we should contribute \nto the IMF's effort to do so, under four conditions.\n  First, we should not simply bail countries out; instead, we should \nhelp those people who are willing to help themselves.\n  And that is what we see in most affected Asian countries. Thai \ncitizens, through the ``Thai Helping Thai'' campaign, have contributed \nmillions of baht to help the country pay off foreign debts. In Korea, a \nsimilar campaign has brought in donations of gold from sixteen million \nof the country's forty-two-million people. As the President of the \nInstitute of Korean-American Affairs told me in a letter she sent last \nmonth:\n\n       With every ounce of gold that is collected, there lies a \n     pool of personal memories. Married couples are giving their \n     gold wedding rings and parents are surrendering gold items \n     they had hoped to pass on to their children.\n\n  Likewise, governments are taking very tough and courageous reforms--\nclosing failing financial institutions, ending subsidies and opening \ncapital markets. Having spoken first-hand with Prime Minister Chuan and \nhis team, I believe the Thai government is of high quality and has a \nconvincing plan for recovery. While I have not visited South Korea \nsince the crisis began, my impression is that President Kim Dae-jung \nalso has an aggressive reform agenda and deserves our support.\n  Second, other countries should share the burden. And, in contrast to \nthe Mexican crisis three years ago, they are doing so.\n  Japan has pledged $19 billion, about double our pledge of $9.7 \nbillion. While Japan should do more to promote imports from affected \ncountries than it has, its financial contribution in time of recession \ndeserves credit.\n  Other countries are also doing their part. Australia has pledged $5 \nbillion, Singapore also $5 billion, the European Union $3 billion, and \nChina $1 billion. And China should be applauded for sticking by its \npromise not to devalue its own currency despite intense pressure on \nChinese exports.\n  Third, the new IMF funding should be part of a long-term strategy to \nupdate the international financial institutions.\n  Between 1986 and 1995, world GDP grew from $26 trillion to $33.5 \ntrillion, or 25%. During the same period, world capital flows grew from \nabout $188 billion to $1.2 trillion per day--about 630%. So the \nfinancial world has fundamentally changed in a way the world productive \neconomy has not.\n  International financial policies and institutions have not kept up. \nOur failure to anticipate two large crises in three years--Mexico and \nAsia--shows that beyond any doubt. So as we approve funding for the IMF \nas today's leading financial institution, we also need a serious, \nprofound effort to understand what changes we need to make to adapt \nourselves to a new world.\n  Finally, we must be ready to say ``no'' when governments will not \nreform. In this regard, I am very concerned about Indonesia.\n  Indonesia's finances are no worse off than are Thailand's or Korea's. \nBut the government has been far slower to implement the reforms it \npledged last year, and has recently cast about among several new plans. \nThe result has been a prolonged crisis, continued capital flight and \nthreats to political stability.\n  We should work very closely with Indonesia's government to fix these \nproblems. But if the government will not implement its promises, we \nwill have no choice but to back off.\n  On the whole, I believe the Administration is acting in the spirit of \nour national interest and good common sense by working with the IMF to \nend the financial crisis. So far, when governments have implemented the \nIMF programs, the results have been good. The Thai currency has \nrecovered from a low of 57 to the dollar to 43 today, and the Thai \nstock market has rebounded by more than 50% since January. Korea is \nalso seeing good results; and countries with less financial trouble--\nSingapore, the Philippines, Brunei--are benefiting from their \nneighbors' recovery.\n  So we should stick with a plan that is working. We should approve the \nAdministration's request for IMF replenishment. It is appropriate for \nCongress to add some conditions relating to market access or greater \nopenness on the part of the IMF. But it is not appropriate to turn the \nrequest down or to link it to totally unrelated issues like abortion, \nas some in the House hope to do.\n  Madam President, this is a critical issue of American leadership; of \nAmerican national interest; and also of jobs and prosperity for \nAmericans at home. I hope the Senate will approve the Administration's \nrequest.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1193-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1194-S1195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SCHUYLKILL VALLEY METRO LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition for two \nreasons:\n  First, to comment about the Schuylkill Valley Metro Light Rail \nSystem, which I visited this morning. It is a very fine example of what \ncan be accomplished with light rail, for many purposes. It seeks to \nestablish a light rail commuter line from city hall in Philadelphia to \nReading, Pennsylvania, a stretch of some 72 miles, which would be \nenormously helpful in transporting people from the inner city to the \nsurrounding counties in the Philadelphia area where there is a labor \nshortage, to move people from areas where people need jobs to areas \nwhere employers need people to fill jobs. This line would further be \nenormously helpful, to take pressure off of the Schuylkill Expressway, \nan alleged high-speed line in the\n\n[[Page S1195]]\n\nPhiladelphia area which is more frequently a parking lot as opposed to \na high-speed line. It would further be enormously helpful on the \nproblems of air pollution, as a tremendous stream of traffic moves from \nthe suburbs over the Schuylkill Expressway and U.S. route 422.\n\n  The cost of this light rail system would be $720 million, with the \nFederal share being $576 million. Congressman Jon Fox joined me today \nat the area where we took a look at the proposal, and I think it is \nreally a very, very useful use of ISTEA funds. It is my hope that, as \nwe move ahead with the so-called ISTEA legislation, we will make a very \nsubstantial investment in infrastructure and that the higher figure \nwill be adopted by the Senate, by the House, and by the conferees as we \nmove through this important legislation.\n  I have joined over the years in efforts to take the highway trust \nfund off budget so it will be used for the specific purpose for which \nit was intended. I know in my State there are an enormous number of \nimportant projects which could be funded if the highway trust fund were \nto be used for highways, bridges and mass transit. I have confidence \nthat the same exists around the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1194-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1195-S1197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE ESCALATING WAR BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I now seek to discuss, or comment, on \nthe escalating war between the President and independent counsel and to \nurge the independent counsel to reply forcefully in the public forum to \nattacks, as opposed to the use of the grand jury as a means of \ninvestigating the people who are proposing and undertaking those \nattacks. My own sense is that independent counsel would be well advised \nto reply to his critics in a public forum, and by that I do not mean in \nhis driveway in the morning, but, when criticized, to reply. I have had \nsome experience as a prosecutor running grand jury investigations, and \nit is an inevitable consequence that, when someone is under \ninvestigation, that person, persons or entity, will not like the \ninvestigation. I think it would be enormously useful if the American \npeople knew, for example, why Mr. Starr is in the investigation on \nPresident Clinton's personal affairs.\n  People ask the question, how did he move from the investigation of an \nArkansas land deal, where he has been engaged for many years at very \nsubstantial cost, over to the investigation of the President on his \npersonal matters? There is a very direct answer, but one which I think \nvery few people know. That is that Attorney General Reno asked Mr. \nStarr to conduct this investigation. That request was made by the \nAttorney General about 6 weeks ago. We all know that Attorney General \nReno is very reluctant to authorize investigations by independent \ncounsel, with many of us having urged her to do so on campaign finance \nreform to no avail. So, when Attorney General Reno authorizes an \ninvestigation, there is a good indication that it is for a very, very \nstrong cause. But people do not know that Mr. Starr got into this \nmatter in relation to his authorized investigation of Webster Hubbell. \nAnd information came to Mr. Starr from Linda Tripp about an effort to \nsecure employment for Ms. Monica Lewinsky under circumstances identical \nfor Webb Hubbell, with the allegation being, and the inference being, \nthat it was hush money for Webster Hubbell.\n  Linda Tripp came to Mr. Starr and Mr. Starr knew Ms. Tripp from his \nprevious contacts with her when she was a witness in the Foster suicide \nand on Filegate. Ms. Tripp told Mr. Starr that Ms. Lewinsky had stated \nthat a given individual had sought employment for Ms. Lewinsky outside \nof Washington, DC, with a specific firm, and that happened to be an \nidentical firm--an identical individual who had made similar \narrangements for Mr. Hubbell.\n  Mr. Starr then put a consensual electronic surveillance on Ms. Tripp, \nthat is, consensual by Ms. Tripp. And Mr. Starr has been continually \ncriticized for having conducted an unlawful electronic surveillance as \nrecently as yesterday's TV talk shows. The fact of the matter is, Mr. \nStarr ought to make this point and ought to make it emphatically, that \nthe one-party consent to the electronic surveillance was perfectly \nlawful under the law of Virginia where it took place.\n\n  After the electronic surveillance confirmed for Mr. Starr what Ms. \nTripp said, Mr. Starr then took the matter to the Public Integrity \nSection of the Department of Justice and said, here is the evidence. \nThere are a number of alternatives. One is the Justice Department can \nhandle the matter itself. Second, the Justice Department can seek other \nindependent counsel. Or, third, the Justice Department could refer, Mr. \nStarr recounts, to Mr. Starr. The matter was then taken to Attorney \nGeneral Reno, who said it was her decision to authorize Mr. Starr to \nconduct further investigation related to the Ms. Monica Lewinsky \nmatter, and that was then confirmed by the three-judge court which \nauthorizes Mr. Starr's conduct.\n  Now, at that time, obviously, Attorney General Reno knew about the \nelectronic surveillance and, in asking Mr. Starr to conduct the \ninvestigation, there was, I think, fairly stated, more than implicit \napproval of what Mr. Starr had done, but really explicit approval of \nwhat Mr. Starr had done.\n  There has been very, very substantial comment on the question of \nexecutive privilege. And, in looking at the news media reports on \ncomments about this legal issue, they appear, really, to be authored by \npeople who are advocates for the President's position. The law on \nexecutive privilege is well established, has been since the case of \nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, and it applies, as outlined by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States on page 706 of U.S. Reports, \nvolume 418, executive privilege applies to ``protect military, \ndiplomatic or sensitive national security secrets.'' Well, there is \nnothing of that nature involved in the investigation of the President's \npersonal activities. Executive privilege applies to matters which are \ncarried out by the Executive in his official capacity, again, not in \nhis personal capacity.\n  There have been commentaries on the issue of the lawyer-client \nprivilege as it would apply to a number of witnesses now appearing \nbefore the grand jury, and the speculation is that it is on Mr. Bruce \nLindsey. Just as the claim of executive privilege might be applied to \nMr. Bruce Lindsey, or perhaps to Mr. Blumenthal, we are not really \nsure, but there is very strong legal authority in a case decided by the \nEighth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down on May 2, In re--Grand Jury \nSubpoena Decus Tecum, 112 F.3d 910. This is part of the controversy and \ncontest between the White House and Mr. Starr--this case lays out, at \npage 920 of 112 Federal Reporter on the Third Series: Executive branch \nemployees, including attorneys, are under a statutory duty to report \ncriminal wrongdoing by other employees to the Attorney General.\n  Mr. Lindsey, who is an attorney, can hardly be in an attorney-client \nrelationship to the President when he is a governmental employee. The \ncourt goes on to point out that the way a person retains a lawyer to \nhave the attorney-client privilege is a very direct way, and that is \nthe person retains his own counsel and not looking to a governmental \nemployee to be the counsel. A governmental employee like Mr. Lindsey or \nother attorneys have their fiduciary obligation running to the \nGovernment of the United States. It does not run to anyone else with \nwhom they have contact, even the President of the United States. The \nexpress statutory authority set out in 28 U.S.C, section 535(b) \nestablishes the obligation of any governmental employee, including \nattorneys, to report evidence of wrongdoing to the Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  The way these matters are commented upon on the talk shows and in the \npress and in the media, it appears that there is some strong ground to \nassert executive privilege. To call it frivolous would be elevating it \nto a higher level than it deserves. It is absolutely, positively a \nstalling tack, nothing more and nothing less. It could not possibly \napply. Some may argue that the Eighth Circuit opinion is not binding on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, but those who \nhave referred to it in the media make the suggestion that it applies \nonly in St. Louis. The fact of the matter is that it's a Circuit court \nopinion, it is very persuasive, and there is no authority to the \ncontrary. It is based\n\n[[Page S1196]]\n\nupon a principle of law which is hard to dispute, and that is that an \nattorney employed by the Government and paid by the Government owes a \nduty to the Government and has a statutory duty to report crime to the \nAttorney General, not to another governmental employee, even the \nPresident of the United States, who happens to employ him.\n\n  So we have a series of events where there is a very, very strong \nproposition that what is being undertaken here in this war, this \nescalating war between the President and independent counsel, really \ntalks about legal propositions which are spurious and frivolous at \nbest. It would be my hope that the independent counsel would respond to \nthe President in the public news media. I know that prosecutors who are \ninvestigating cases do not like to disclose what is going on in a \npending prosecution, and there are good reasons as a general matter for \ninvestigators or prosecutors on an investigative matter not to make \ndisclosures but to keep those matters confidential. But when those \nprosecutors conducting these investigations are attacked in the public \nnews media, there is absolute justification for a response.\n  I believe that Mr. Starr made a mistake when he called people before \nthe grand jury last week such as Mr. Blumenthal, in giving Mr. \nBlumenthal a platform. I made mistakes myself when I was District \nAttorney of Philadelphia. I made some in the U.S. Senate. And just \nbecause Mr. Starr made a mistake does not mean that he is disqualified \nfrom carrying on as independent counsel. It does not mean that he ought \nto resign, as some Members of the other side of the aisle have \nsuggested. The fact is that the Attorney General of the United States \nhas the authority, under the independent counsel statute, to remove Mr. \nStarr for cause, and the President has the authority, through the \nAttorney General, to remove Mr. Starr for cause. We have already gone \nthrough that once in our Nation's history under a circumstance, the so-\ncalled Saturday Night Massacre. But if Mr. Starr is doing things which \nrequire his discontinuance in office, that can be handled by the \nAttorney General. And no suggestion has been made that he ought to be \nremoved. Nor do I think there is any basis for saying that.\n  When Mr. Starr has found his assistants under attack, it is \nunderstandable that there would be a very strong reaction.\n  Two of his assistants were attacked, one a Mr. Emmick. The \ninformation was spread broadly in the news media that an assistant \nindependent counsel, Mr. Emmick, was criticized by a judge for using \n``threats, deceit, and harassment to get testimony in a 1994 police \ncorruption case.'' But the fact of the matter is that the court \ntranscript showed that the ``threats, deceit, and harassment'' had been \ndirected at another Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, and the same \njudge called Mr. Emmick ``a man of integrity'' at a hearing a year \nlater.\n  These matters do not come out. I think that what Mr. Starr has to do \nis make a very forceful defense of his assistants.\n  Similarly, an associate independent counsel, a Mr. Udolf, had been \nreputedly fined some $50,000 in a Georgia civil proceeding for \nviolating the civil rights of someone who was wrongfully held in jail \nfor 4 days in 1985. But others have come to his defense. The retired \nFederal chief judge, Judge A. R. Kenyon, said that Mr. Udolf ``was very \nsensitive and always had compassion for people even though he had to \nprosecute them.''\n  The point is that there are going to be criticisms, and in the course \nof a legal career, prosecuting attorneys may be censured, and the \nnature of a criminal proceeding very frequently is very highly charged, \nvery emotional, a lot of things are said by both sides with frequently \nconsiderable provocation. But whatever is said, it is my view that Mr. \nStarr ought to respond in a public contest and ought to do it very, \nvery promptly, again, without resorting to the matter of the grand jury \nto bring people in there.\n  The stepped-up attacks on Mr. Starr may carry the suggestion that he \nis getting closer. Dick Morris observed last week that the testimony of \nformer Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker might prove to be very, very \nsignificant, perhaps decisive in the Arkansas land deal. I do not know \nwhether that is true or not, but I do know that if you take a look at \nthe chronology of events which lasted for years before Mr. Starr could \nbring former Governor Tucker to trial, it was a long, tough road which \ntook a very protracted period of time, including overturning a judgment \nwhere an Arkansas Federal judge dismissed the indictment, the \nindictment later being reinstated by the court of appeals, and the \ncourt of appeals even granting the independent counsel motion to have \nthat judge removed from the case.\n  So where you have a protracted period of time and very considerable \nmoney spent, it is relevant to note what has happened in the matter, \nthese facts really not being known at all by the public and not being \nknown by me unless I take a look to see exactly what is going on behind \nthe veil.\n  When Attorney General Reno appointed Mr. Starr to expand the \njurisdiction to cover the President's personal activities, I made a \ncomment that was widely misinterpreted and widely misconstrued. I said \n2 weeks ago that Attorney General Reno had erred in appointing Mr. \nStarr because people would not understand what he was doing in that \ncase in light of the fact that he started off a long time before in the \nArkansas land deal and that it was unfortunate because Mr. Starr has \nbecome a lightning rod.\n  No longer is there a focus of attention on what President Clinton has \ndone, and he is, allegedly, supposedly the object of the investigation, \nbut the attention has been focused only on Mr. Starr. I do not believe \nthat Attorney General Reno had in mind when she appointed Mr. Starr \nthat the appointment would prove to be such a formidable public \nrelations defense for the President, directing attention away from the \nPresident as the focus of the investigation to Mr. Starr. But that is \ncertainly what has happened. It is in no way a criticism of Mr. Starr \nthat the Attorney General asked him to take over the investigation and \nthat he has become a lightning rod.\n  That is where we find this matter. I believe the lightning rod has to \nexchange and reply in kind, and if it calls for lightening, so be it.\n  I went to high school in a small town in Russell, KS--Russell High \nSchool, which had a football team known as the Broncos. There is \nanother football team not too far from Russell called the Broncos, the \nDenver Broncos, who were the Super Bowl champions. When I look at this \nbattle, this war being waged with the President, on one hand, and the \nindependent counsel on another, I analogize it to a football game \nbetween the Broncos who are the Super Bowl champs and the Broncos from \nmy old high school football team.\n\n  If the playing field is to be leveled to any significant extent at \nall, I believe that Mr. Starr has to respond. The appropriate way to \nrespond is exactly when these criticisms are made.\n  It is my hope and my understanding that Mr. Starr is not going to \npursue the business of calling his critics before the grand jury. I \nthink Mr. Starr, a former Federal judge, a former solicitor general, \nknows better than to argue that the first amendment is only for \narticulating the truth. Who knows what the truth is when you have a \ncontroversy, or who knows what the eye of the beholder is as to what \nthe truth is? The first amendment is to protect freedom of speech. You \ncannot get involved in limiting it to who is telling the truth or it \nwould be a never, ever ending controversy.\n  I hope that we will put this war between the President and the \nindependent counsel on the back burner. I hope that we will presume the \nPresident to be innocent and that we will presume Mr. Starr to be \ninnocent and to let the investigation go forward until it is concluded \nso that the President and the rest of us can focus our attention on the \nimportant items facing the country, like this important legislation, \nISTEA, on the infrastructure spending of America for the next 6 years; \non the enormous problems we are facing in Iraq; on the problems we are \nfacing in balancing the budget and how to handle the $1.7 trillion \nfunding which we now have to apply to America's problems.\n  But if the debate is to rage and if it is to continue, it is my hope \nthat the grand jury will not be the place where Mr. Starr's critics \ncome, but that he\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\nwill engage in forceful, lusty debate and express himself and answer \nhis critics and let the chips fall where they may.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1195-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1197-S1198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, are we on ISTEA?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I would like to speak for 10 minutes on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I want to say--which has already been said a number \nof times--how pleased I am that we are moving forward on this important \nlegislation. I am a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and we worked very hard last year to bring this to the \nSenate. Of course, as you know, we found some problems, particularly \nwith the House version, and ended up with a temporary bill. That \ntemporary bill expires the first of May, and all of us, I think, are \naware of how important it is for us to get on into the permanent \nreauthorization of this bill so that our various State highway \ncommissions can go forward with their plans.\n  The current ISTEA law has certainly, over the years, made some \nimportant changes in our whole transportation program, our \ntransportation policies. It has changed things a great deal. We have \ncome up with a national system of Federal highways. We have found a way \nto protect this system and to cause it to be effective. But as we move \ninto the 21st century, we need, of course, to update this law as it was \npassed to make it more flexible, to make it such that the States can \ndeal with the unique issues that they have.\n  I am from Wyoming where we have probably more miles and fewer people, \nmore miles per person than, I suspect, most any other State in the \nUnion. So our needs are quite different than they are in California, \nthan they are in New York or Rhode Island. And this ISTEA bill tends to \nrecognize that with more flexibility and more efficiency by reducing \nsome of the regulations that go with it, by putting programs together \nand helping us to meet the challenges that are before us. It is not \nperfect, of course.\n  I believe ISTEA II achieves this goal of efficiency and flexibility, \nand creates ``new rules of the road'' that serve the national interest \nand will help us to build the highways--I hate to be repetitive--and \nbridges of the 21st century. I heard that somewhere before.\n  At any rate, my State, as is the case with all other States, has road \nneeds. And our roads are in a condition such that they need a good deal \nof repair, a good deal of maintenance.\n  Again, Wyoming is unique. Wyoming taxpayers contribute more to the \nhighway trust fund per person than any other State in the country \nbecause we drive more--nearly $200 per person in Federal gas taxes. And \nyet we have a deteriorating bridge and road system. According to the \nbest figures I get from our highway department, 44 percent of our roads \nand bridges are in a deteriorating condition, in a fair to poor \ncondition. So we have a great deal to do.\n  These shortfalls, of course, in the roads of Wyoming, as in other \nStates' roads, are a detriment to all taxpayers. If we are to have a \nnational system, then, of course, you have to cross all the States to \nget there.\n  A set of efficient and well-maintained roads is important to the \ncities that export goods around the country, as they are to us in \nWyoming. This bill, of course, and all of the activities and dollars \nthat go with it are a very direct contribution to the Nation's economy. \nThese dollars move out quickly. These dollars move to fill the needs of \npeople throughout the country, provide jobs, and are very efficiently \nused in a very quick fashion. So ISTEA II will help the flow of goods \nand services in our country.\n  We worked very hard. I want to salute the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Chafee, who worked so hard to find, along with others, a fair \nsolution. This is a difficult issue. Through the years, as everyone \nknows now, we have taken in more money from Federal highway taxes than \nwe have spent. We kept it in the trust fund, at least partially, to \nhelp balance the budget.\n  We have a unified budget, so if you spend the money, even if it is in \nthe trust fund, you spend the money in the highway fund, then you have \nto reduce the spending somewhere else in order to stay within the \nspending caps. That is not easy. So the first discussion we have had--\nit has been a very difficult one--is how much of that money do you \nspend without impeding on the other spending?\n  The second difficult one, of course, is that of the formula in which \nthere is distribution. There is always great controversy about the \nformula. There are States that pay in more than they, frankly, get \nback. There are States that get more than they pay in. There are those \nwho believe all the dollars should go to highways.\n  There are others who believe part of the money--this is, after all, a \nsurface transportation bill--some of the dollars ought to go for public \ntransportation, some ought to go for Amtrak, some ought to go for \nbicycle trails, and those kinds of things. So I suspect, of all the \nbills that we deal with, No. 1, everyone wants to pass it, everyone \nknows that it needs to go forward. But there are so many different \nkinds of interests that are represented here--and legitimate, all \nlegitimate.\n  So finding a fair funding formula, based on the national interests, \nis most difficult. I admire very much what the leadership of this \ncommittee has done. And it is there to emphasize a National Highway \nSystem. I think that is key--a National Highway System.\n  Let me talk just a minute about an issue that I guess I would have to \nadmit is particularly important to me, but I think to others as well. I \nhappen to be chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. We find \nourselves with national parks that are being loved to death. More and \nmore people like to go to parks, but at the same time we find ourselves \n$5 billion to $8 billion in arrears in infrastructure. Nearly $2 \nbillion of that backlog is in highways.\n  And, of course, parks only have one source of revenue, really, for \nthe maintenance of their highways, and that is Federal taxes. Counties \ndo not come in to Federal parks and build roads as they do in some \nother public lands. The State does not contribute to the highways \ninside of parks. So we have found that a high percentage of existing \npark roads and bridges are in poor condition. And therefore, we need to \ndo something about it.\n\n  In my State of Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park alone is $250 \nmillion behind for the care of highways. It is very difficult. First of \nall, they are built in difficult places. Their season is rather short \nto reconstruct. So it is hard to keep highways moving.\n  We are very pleased that in this particular bill we make a step \nforward--we make a step forward--and have moved up from about $70 \nmillion a year, which has been traditional, to about $180 million. So \nit makes a great deal of difference. And then the Park Service will \ndecide where those allocations are made.\n  The same is true of other Federal lands. Wyoming is 50 percent \nFederal lands. Some States are much higher. Nevada, for example--86 \npercent of that State is owned by the Federal Government. So you have \nBLM lands. You have forest lands. You have refuge lands. All of these \nare lands that we look forward to helping through this program. And \nthey will receive a small, relatively small increase, relatively small \nin terms of the problem, but a sizable increase.\n  Senators Chafee and Warner and Baucus have been working with us on \nthis issue. I feel confident that these park needs will very much be \naccommodated. I thank the Senators for their willingness to do that.\n  ISTEA II will streamline the program structure and give States and \nlocalities more flexibility. I believe that is very important. There is \na consolidation of five programs into three, which\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\nhelps to make it more efficient, provides more flexibility and gives \nthe States more of a chance to decide where their dollars ought to go. \nI think that is very important.\n  Again, I thank Senators Warner, Chafee and Baucus. They have worked \nvery hard through this time.\n  Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and I introduced an ISTEA II \nreauthorization bill. We called it STARS 2000. It was a shining example \nof what we ought to do. That was earlier this year. I thank them and \ntheir staffs for putting it together. Then Senator Chafee used that as \none of the alternatives, we came together with a bill that I think is \ntop-notch and one that I think we should move forward with as soon as \npossible.\n  There are some complications, of course. And they have been going on \nfor years. One of them is the idea of using Federal funds to require \nthat States behave in certain ways in order to get their money. We will \nbe talking about that. I suppose in a number of areas--one of them will \nhave to do with drunk driving, having to do with alcohol content. No \none is for drunk driving. Everyone wants to do everything they can to \nput a cap on that, eliminate it, if possible. But I have to tell you, \nMadam President, that I find it very difficult to explain why the \nFederal Government has to tell the States how to do these various \nthings.\n  I happen to have been in the Wyoming legislature. Most of us here \nhave been in our State legislatures. I think legislatures are perfectly \ncapable of deciding what those kinds of things ought to be, whether it \nis motorcycle helmets or speed limits or drunk driving, alcohol \ncontent.\n  It seems to me those are the kinds of things that States really ought \nto do. And I can tell you that folks resent very much the idea of using \nwhat they call ``blackmail'' in terms of Federal money to do that. So I \nhope we can avoid that. I hope we can be for all the things we ought to \nbe for. But the idea of us deciding here seems to me to be \ninappropriate.\n  So I really am pleased that we are moving, and I am glad the leader \nhas brought this forward. Certainly, much of that is a result of the \nefforts made by the Senators from Texas and West Virginia as they \npushed very hard to do this.\n  ISTEA II maintains the integrity of the ISTEA law. It improves it by \nmore equitable investment of user fees. It ensures that people can \ncross the country with goods and services. And ``bridge'' States are \ninvolved as well. It increases flexibility.\n  Again, obviously, nothing is perfect. A bill of this kind is never \ntotally suitable to everyone. But that is the way it is. That is what \nwe are here for. That is why we have a system of deciding and voting--\nso that we can come up, by a majority vote, to the thing that we think \nbest serves this country and serves it on the intermodal surface \ntransportation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming very much \nfor his kind comments on the work we have done. The Senator from \nWyoming is a very valuable member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. He has worked with us. As he pointed out, he had one of the \nmajor bills that went into the final amalgamation we had here--the STAR \nbill. And he had deep concerns, as he has outlined here, in certain \nparticular areas. I am glad that we were able to take care of those \nareas.\n  Indeed, when we meet tomorrow, I believe we will be, as I pointed out \nto the Senate a little earlier, able to do even better in some of those \nparticular areas he is concerned with. So our committee will be meeting \ntomorrow at 9:30. And I look forward to working with the Senator from \nWyoming as we proceed with an amendment incorporating some of the \nprovisions that have come about as a result of the additional money \nthat has come forward just in the last--well, just agreed to earlier \nthis afternoon. So, again, I thank the Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1197-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1198-S1199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    NOMINATION OF RICHARD L.

So that's \ntwo judges a month. I don't want to strain the capabilities of the U.S. \nSenate, but there are 85 vacancies. There are 85 vacancies and now, in \nMarch, we will confirm the sixth Federal judge.\n  Justice denied is justice lost.\n  We are not seeing our responsibility to the Federal judiciary. As \nlong as the Senate maintains a stall on the confirmation of Federal \njudges, we are not being responsible, we are not even upholding our \noath of office. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee for getting another judge here to be confirmed. I \nask the Senate to remember that we have responsibilities to the \nConstitution, and we have a responsibility to the integrity and \nindependence of the third branch of Government. We are not fulfilling \nit.\n  Mr. President, I am going to withhold the rest of my time because the \ndistinguished chairman is not here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be allowed to withhold its \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the \ntime not charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that the ranking \nmember of the committee would like to make some comments. I suggest he \nproceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is there for the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I certainly won't take any more than that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I suggest then that the Senator have 5 minutes, and then, \nif a Member from this side wishes 5 minutes thereafter, we will face \nthat problem then. So why don't we have 5 minutes for the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that I am taking 5 minutes \nthat was there for me in any event. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has decided \nto take up the nomination of Richard L. Young to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of Indiana.\n  This is one of seven judicial nominations that is currently pending \nbefore the Senate. I spoke a little earlier this afternoon about this.\n  I want to note that, unfortunately, the Senate continues to pass over \nthe\n\n[[Page S1199]]\n\nnominations of G. Patrick Murphy for a vacancy on the Federal bench of \nthe Southern District of Illinois and Michael P. McCluskey for a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the Federal bench for the Central \nDistrict of Illinois.\n  Nor is the Senate today taking action on the nomination of Edward \nShea to the Federal bench for the Eastern District of Washington, Judge \nJeremy Fogel to the judicial emergency vacancy on the Federal bench for \nthe Northern District of California or Margaret McKeown to a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Judge Young has been with the Vandenburgh Circuit Court of Indiana \nsince 1990. After Senator Lugar came to the Judiciary Committee to \ntestify in his behalf, Judge Young was reported by the Committee \nwithout a single dissenting vote. The American Bar Association gave \nJude Young its highest rating.\n  I believe there will be a unanimous vote in support of this \nnomination and want to congratulate him and his family.\n  The Senate returns this week facing 85 Federal court vacancies--85. \nDespite the Senate's dismal record for 2 years running in acting on \njudicial nominations, I finally saw reason to hope that the extremism \nthat has bedeviled this process might be losing a tiny bit--a tiny \nbit--of its hold on the Senate.\n  Few nominees have been targeted as heavily for defeat as was Margaret \nMorrow, a superbly qualified nominee for a district court judgeship in \nSouthern California. She endured waves of questions, protracted \nstalling and mysterious holds that prevented an up-or-down vote. \nFinally, 2 years after she was nominated, she got an overwhelming, \nsuper majority, positive vote here in the Senate. I wanted to take that \nas a signal that public concerns about these logjams were beginning to \nregister with the Senate.\n  But, unfortunately, that nomination was the last nomination confirmed \nby the Senate in February. We closed out our first 2 months this year \nwith only five confirmations for article III judges.\n  Chief Justice William Rehnquist spoke forcefully on the judicial \nvacancy crisis that is plaguing the Federal courts. He warned: \n``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \neroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated \nwith the Federal judiciary.''\n  Justice delayed means justice denied, because without judges courts \ncannot try cases, sentence the guilty or resolve civil disputes. \nPartisan and narrow ideological efforts to impose political litmus \ntests on judicial nominees and to shut down the judiciary must stop.\n  We began this year facing vacancies in about one out of every 10 \njudgeships, and about one-third were judicial emergency vacancies which \nhave been empty for more than a year and a half.\n  Mr. President, if all we are going to do so far is two judges a \nmonth, and we have 85 vacancies, the Senate is not living up to its \nresponsibilities. The Senate is not upholding the Constitution of the \nUnited States and not fulfilling our responsibilities to the judicial \nbranch or the American people.\n  The first week of this session I challenged the Senate to maintain \nthe pace that it reached last fall when we confirmed 27 judges in the \nlast nine weeks of the session. In the first four weeks of this new \nsession, however, we have acted to confirm only five judges. Judge \nYoung will be the sixth judge confirmed in this our fifth week in \nsession. We are well short of the mark and not measuring up to the pace \nthis very Senate attained last fall. I, therefore, urge the Majority \nLeader to take up the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy, Michael P. \nMcCluskey, Edward F. Shea, Jeremy D. Fogel and M. Margaret McKeown \nwithout further delay.\n  Mr. President, I withhold my time remaining, and, if we are ready to \ngo for a vote, I will yield it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have time on this side. I am prepared \nto yield all that time and go to a vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded. The question is, Will the \nSenate advise and consent to the nomination of Richard L. Young to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Southern District of Indiana? On \nthis question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the \nSenator from New York (Mr. D'Amato), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Faircloth), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms), the \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. \nMurkowski), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Nickles), the Senator from \nAlabama (Mr. Shelby), the Senator from Maine (Ms. Snowe), and the \nSenator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend my colleagues on adopting Senate Resolution 96, which \ndesignates March 15 through 21 of this year as ``National Safe Place \nWeek.''\n  Project Safe Place is a unique union of community agencies and the \nprivate sector that promotes the well-being of our nation's youth. It \nis an innovative network of nonresidential community locations where \nyouth who are at-risk or in crisis situations can obtain help quickly \nand find shelter if necessary. Safe Place cultivates community \ninvolvement to combat child abuse, substance addiction, and crime.\n  Since its creation in 1983 in Louisville, Kentucky, the scope of \nProject Safe Place has spread to include more than 8,000 Safe Places \nnationwide, and more than 27,000 young people have sought help at these \nlocations. We all agree that our nation's youth are our most valuable \nresource. Project Safe\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\nPlace volunteers have been quietly tending to this resource for fifteen \nyears, offering help to youth who are threatened or in trouble. The \nrecognition Project Safe Place deserves is long overdue.\n  Senate Resolution 96 celebrates this outstanding program and also \nhonors the efforts of over 2,500 dedicated Safe Place volunteers, who \nselflessly devote time and resources to protect our nation's young \npeople. Two of these individuals--Sandy Bowen, the National Safe Place \nDirector, and Mickie Adler, who has spearheaded Safe Place efforts in \nthe state of Idaho--have been instrumental in making ``National Safe \nPlace Week'' a reality.\n  Sandy Bowen has been involved with Project Safe Place for 13 years. \nWhen the program began to gain momentum and become a nationwide effort \nin 1986, Sandy stepped in as the National Director. Over the years, her \nhard work, dedication, and concern have helped to bring Project Safe \nPlace out of its infancy, transforming a simple idea into a nationwide \nforce that is now present in over 300 of our communities.\n  Mickie Adler has been the driving force behind the Safe Place \nmovement in Idaho for four years. In fact, this month marks the four-\nyear anniversary of Safe Place in Idaho. Last year, Mickie brought \nthree students to my Washington office to sell me on the idea of a \n``National Safe Place Week.'' Victoria Smith, Caroline Reams, and \nJessica McCaleese--all of whom are either High School or Junior High \nSchool students from Bannock County--were articulate and poised as they \nconveyed the idea of promoting Project Safe Place. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to thank these fine young ladies for bringing their \nideas to my attention.\n  Mickie first got involved with the Safe Place movement after Jerelee \nUnderwood, an eleven year old girl, was abducted in Southeast Idaho. \nShe committed herself at that time to preventing future violence \nagainst Idaho's children by initiating the first Safe Place site in \nIdaho four years ago. Since that time, Project Safe Place in Idaho has \nexpanded to include 250 Safe Places in Bannock County--including my \nregional office there--and 18 sites in the Twin Falls area. Mickie has \nrecently been called upon to implement the program statewide, with new \nSafe Places to be added in Coeur d'Alene, Burley, Caldwell and Idaho \nFalls. I want to do my part by offering each of my Idaho offices as \nSafe Place sites. I encourage my colleagues to do the same nationwide.\n  There are thousands of people just like Mickie and Sandy who work \nhard every day because they care too much to let our children endure \ndifficult times alone and without guidance. In part, ``National Safe \nPlace Week'' will serve to honor and recognize these humanitarians.\n  More than that, though, ``National Safe Place Week'' will build \ncommunity awareness, increasing not only the number of young people the \nprogram might help, but also the number of those who themselves might \ncontribute to the effectiveness of the program. As a father, a \ngrandfather, and a concerned citizen, I would like to personally extend \na sincere and heart-felt ``thank-you'' to all those who make Project \nSafe Place such a successful program. And, to my colleagues in the \nSenate: Thank you for working with me on this resolution. If passage of \n``National Safe Place Week'' helps only one more youth by keeping him \nor her from turning to drugs, suicide, or the streets, then I know that \nour time in passing Senate Resolution 96 will have been well spent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1199-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE 1998 TRADE POLICY AGENDA AND 1997 ANNUAL REPORT ON THE \n      TRADE AGREEMENTS PROGRAM--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 101\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 163 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 \nU.S.C. 2213), I transmit herewith the 1998 Trade Policy Agenda and 1997 \nAnnual Report on the Trade Agreements Program.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to establish the Sand Creek Massacre National \nHistoric Site in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\nthe sand creek massacre national historic site preservation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today I introduce legislation that is \nvery, very special to me, and which in my opinion is a long time in \ncoming to this Nation, to the State of Colorado, and particularly to my \nown ancestors. This bill is entitled the Sand Creek Massacre Site \nHistoric Preservation Act of 1998. This legislation would authorize the \nFederal acquisition of property located within Kiowa County, CO, \ndesignated as a point of interest on virtually every map in this Nation \nand infamously known as the site of the ``Sand Creek Massacre.''\n  Today, this property is owned by a private individual, who has strong \ninterest in selling the land. The bill I introduce today would \nauthorize the National Park Service to acquire this land for fair \nmarket value in compliance with the agency's standard rules and \nregulations. My bill would permit full public access to this hallowed \nsite to the public, and more importantly to the descendants of those \nwho lost their lives at Sand Creek.\n  To provide some perspective, I would like to briefly explain the \nhistorical facts surrounding one of the most disgraceful events in \nAmerican history--the Sand Creek Massacre.\n  During the early morning hours on the shameful day of November 29, \n1864, a Colonel in the Colorado Militia, religious zealot, by the name \nof John\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\nChivington, led a regiment of Colorado Volunteers to the Cheyenne's \nSand Creek campsite, where a band of Cheyenne led by Black Kettle, a \nwell-known ``peace'' chief, was encamped and unsuspecting of his fate \nforthcoming on this date. Federal army officers had promised Black \nKettle safe passage if he would stay at his campsite and fly the \nAmerican flag along with a white flag of truce over his lodge, but \nColonel Chivington disregarded that flag, and ordered an attack anyway \non the unsuspecting village. After many hours of brutal and cowardly \nfighting, the Colorado volunteers lost only nine men in the fight but \nmanaged to murder over 200 Cheyenne, most of them innocent and unarmed \nwomen and children. Most men were out hunting and were not in camp. \nWhen the skirmish ended, the Colorado volunteers scalped and sexually \nmutilated many of the bodies of my people, proudly displaying their \ntrophies to cheering crowds in the streets of Denver while desecrating \nthe Cheyenne Heritage.\n  One report said that Colonel Chivington admonished his soldiers to \nkill the babies in the camp because, according to him, ``nits make \nlice.''\n  Many of these facts are not disputed. Congress held an inquiry, in \nfact, after that fatal date and heard extensive testimony on the \nactions of Colonel Chivington, resulting in a discharge of both him and \nthen territorial Governor Evans. But since Colonel Chivington's unit \nwas not a regular Army unit but rather a Colorado militia which soon \ndisbanded after the fateful day, not one of the people were ever \nbrought to justice.\n  Mr. President, this description of the events cannot begin to \ndescribe the horror that must have taken place on that day. But this \nbill authorizes our Government to preserve a significant piece of \nhistory that I believe is needed to remind us not just of the horrible \ndeeds that took place in this country to many people in our history, \nbut to the Native Americans, and to honor that memory. In fact, at Bent \nFort, a national historic site just about 30 miles from the location of \nthe massacre, National Park officials tell me that the single most \nasked question at the fort is, Where was the Sand Creek massacre \nlocated?\n  I believe that with this property being considered for sale, a rare \nopportunity exists for us to save an important piece of American \nhistory. We should move forward and try, through whatever means we can, \nto acquire this very sacred site. This action will provide remembrance \nof the event, allow present and future generations of Americans to \nlearn from our history, which includes much more glory than disgrace.\n  In closing, I do not know of anybody of my own ancestry who did not \nhave a relative at that terrible place.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very important preservation \npiece.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the General Services Administration to \nclear the site of the old Alaska Native Health Center and convey the \nproperty to the\n\n[[Page S1202]]\n\nMunicipality of Anchorage; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n       the old alaska native health center conveyance act of 1998\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk for proper referral \nthe Old Alaska Native Health Center Conveyance Act of 1998 to address a \nserious issue in Anchorage, Alaska.\n  The Federal government finished construction of the Alaska Native \nHospital Center in 1953. This facility is situated on a 15-acre parcel \nof land near downtown Anchorage. It was substantially affected by the \n1964 Alaska earthquake, but was patched up and maintained until it \ncould be replaced. In 1997 a new Alaska Native Health Center was \nopened. The old facility was boarded up and abandoned after being \nstripped of fixtures, wiring, heating, and ventilation systems, and \nother components. It now awaits disposal action by the General Services \nAdministration. The facility is unsalvageable in its present condition \nand is in violation of multiple safety codes. A recent environmental \nassessment found not only the presence of asbestos but also lead-\ncontaining paint.\n  Anchorage has a unique and pressing need for this site. The Port of \nAnchorage is the largest port in Alaska and the 17th largest in the \nnation--it has grown steadily in recent years, and the tonnage of goods \nmoving through our major port is expected to continue to increase. \nHowever, truck access to the Port is limited to either a single two-\nlane road or through the streets of downtown Anchorage. This is a \nlimiting factor to continued growth, and is already negatively \naffecting the transfer of goods on and off the domestic and \ninternational container ships that call on the Port of Anchorage. The \nsolution is to have new access to the port through the land now \noccupied by the abandoned hospital center.\n  My bill would assist the Municipality of Anchorage with this plan by \ninstructing the General Services Administration to clear the land and \ntransfer it to the Municipality of Anchorage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act shall be known as ``The Old Alaska Native Health \n     Center Conveyance Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act the term ``property'' means \n     the land parcel recorded as Block 35 and Lot 2 of Block 36, \n     Anchorage Original Townsite East Addition, in Anchorage, \n     Alaska on which the old Alaska Native Health Center is \n     situated, but does not mean any portion of such parcel \n     dedicated for use by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention.\n\n     SEC. 3 FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the old Alaska Native Health Center was closed and \n     vacated in 1997 when a new Alaska Native health facility was \n     opened;\n       (2) the buildings and property formerly used for such \n     Center are scheduled to be disposed of as surplus by the \n     Administrator of the General Services Administration;\n       (3) asbestos and lead contamination were found in the \n     buildings and on the property during environmental \n     assessments;\n       (4) the buildings have been stripped of fixtures, wires, \n     and other materials, and any development of the property will \n     require the removal of the buildings and of all asbestos, \n     lead, and other contamination; and\n       (5) due to the limited availability of land in the area in \n     which the property is situated, the Municipality of Anchorage \n     has a unique interest its future use.\n\n     SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF BUILDINGS AND DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) Removal of Buildings.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration shall, not later than 18 months after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, demolish and remove all \n     buildings, structures and other fixtures on the property, \n     including all asbestos, lead, and any other contamination, \n     and restore the property, to the extent practicable, to an \n     undeveloped condition.\n       (b) Disposal.--Upon completion of the activities required \n     under subsection (a), and notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration shall convey to the Municipality of Anchorage, \n     without reimbursement, all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States to the property.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1697. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to improve the availability of child care and development \nservices during periods outside normal school hours, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                      the america after school act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators Kerry, Reed, Akaka and I \nare introducing the America After School Act. With this legislation, I \nhope that we can do more to provide the care and activities that \nchildren need when they are not in school.\n\n  Millions of parents today have no choice but to work outside the \nhome. Over 17 million parents need someone to care for their children \nwhen the children are not in school. Many are able to find child care \nthrough friends or family, local centers, or school-based programs. But \nover 5 million ``latch-key'' children have no such arrangements and are \nleft home alone. Our goal in this legislation is to encourage \ncommunities to develop activities that will engage our children and \nkeep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble.\n  In many cases, parents know the importance of enrolling their \nchildren in after-school programs, but cannot afford to do so. Child \ncare costs thousands of dollars each year and is therefore out of reach \nfor many families. Congress has responded by supporting an array of \nchild care programs over the years, but the funding has not kept pace \nwith the need, especially under The Welfare Reform Act which requires \nmore and more parents each year to enter the workforce. As a result, \nhundreds of thousands of children are now on waiting lists for child \ncare and after school activities. Help for these families and their \nchildren cannot come too soon.\n  The entire country benefits when children get the care that they \nneed. Health costs are lower. Parents' productivity at work improves. \nEducation costs decline when children learn to cooperate in group \nactivities, and when they can obtain help with their homework during \nafter-school programs. The massive costs associated with juvenile \ndelinquency, such as injuries to people, damage to property and police, \ncourts, and corrections--are reduced when responsible after-school \nactivities are available. By expanding after-school programs, we \nliterally are investing in children, their future, and the country's \nfuture.\n  Our legislation significantly expands after-school care, enabling \nmore parents to choose safe, quality programs for their children. We \nprimarily accomplish this goal by increasing the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grants available to states, which subsidize child \ncare for low-income families. Under Title I of this bill, we authorize \na $5 billion increase in that program over the next 5 years. This level \nof investment is necessary to end the waiting lists, and provide after-\nschool care for an estimated 2 million children from low-income working \nfamilies.\n  Communities with high concentrations of poverty and at-risk children \nwill get priority in this funding, so that help will be available where \nit is needed most. No parent should have to make the cruel choice \nbetween pressing needs such as food, heat and shelter. The needs of \ndisabled children are also specifically addressed.\n  Our proposal builds on the experience of the Defense Department, \nwhich operates the world's largest child care program for members of \nthe armed services. Over the past decade, they have developed a widely \nacclaimed model program. They have found that child-care quality is \nmost effectively achieved through salary incentives tied to training. \nWe get what we pay for. Child care workers are notoriously underpaid in \ntoday's society. Stronger incentives are needed in order to develop and \nretain a quality child care workforce. Our bill designates 25% of the \nblock-grant increases for indirect services that include salary \nincentives tied to training for those who provide care.\n  In addition, our bill enacts President Clinton's proposal to expand \n21st Century Learning Centers which have proved highly successful in \nusing schools as places where members of the community can engage in \ncontinuing education, recreation, community building activities and \nothers. This program now only serves 100,000 children nationwide. Our \nbill contains a\n\n[[Page S1203]]\n\nfive-fold increase in grants by the Department of Education to local \npublic schools. Under this increase, 500,000 more children will be able \nto participate in school-based programs before and after school.\n  This bill also provides $1.25 billion over the next five years to \nexpand grants by the Justice Department for after-school programs to \nprevent juvenile crime. Public and private agencies may apply for these \ngrants, and awards will be made on a matching basis. Recipients must \ncoordinate their efforts with state or local law enforcement to achieve \nmaximum effectiveness in fighting crime. After-school educational and \nrecreational programs in high crime neighborhoods will receive priority \nsince children in these inner city neighborhoods face the highest \nrisks.\n  Hundreds of police chiefs, prosecutors, and crime victims have \ncreated an organization called ``Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,'' \ndedicated to promoting increased federal investment in after-school \nprograms. A 1995 National League of Cities survey reported that 92% of \nrespondents rank before- and after-school care as one of the most \npressing needs for children and families--ahead of crime, welfare \nreform, education, housing and drug abuse. Over 70% of people recently \nsurveyed by the Children's Defense Fund--Democrats and Republicans, \nwomen and men, young and old alike--believe that revenues from tobacco \ncompanies should be invested in child care programs. Hundreds of \nthousands of parents have put their children's names on waiting lists \nfor child care and after school activities. The need is urgent and \nwidespread, and Congress has a responsibility to act.\n  The America After School Act, can be effective in meeting these needs \nand I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill may \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``America After School Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) children spend less than 20 percent of their waking \n     hours in school, and their activities during the remaining 80 \n     percent of these hours have a critical impact on their long-\n     term success in school and work;\n       (2) approximately 24,000,000 children require care after \n     school while their parents work;\n       (3) during 1991--\n       (A) there were 36,700,000 school-age children in the United \n     States;\n       (B) approximately 21,200,000 of the children described in \n     subparagraph (A) lived with working mothers (including \n     mothers seeking employment) and 999,000 lived with mothers \n     who were enrolled in school; and\n       (C) approximately 912,000 of the children described in \n     subparagraph (A) lived with single working fathers, 61,000 \n     with single unemployed fathers, and 9,000 with single fathers \n     who were enrolled in school;\n       (4) the General Accounting Office estimates that the \n     current supply of child care for school-age children will \n     meet as little as 25 percent of the demand in some urban \n     areas by 2002;\n       (5) children who attend quality after-school programs while \n     their parents work--\n       (A) experience positive effects on their development;\n       (B) have better peer relations, emotional adjustment, \n     grades, and conduct in school than their peers in other care \n     arrangements;\n       (C) have more learning opportunities and enrichment \n     activities than their peers in other care arrangements; and\n       (D) are less likely to engage in juvenile delinquent \n     activity;\n       (6)(A) most juvenile delinquent activity occurs between 3 \n     p.m. and 8 p.m.; and\n       (B) from 1988 to 1992, juvenile arrests for violent acts \n     increased by 50 percent;\n       (7) survey data confirms public support for expansion of \n     programs to assist school-age children, as evidenced by the \n     fact that the need for child care, including before- and \n     after-school care, was rated as one of the most pressing \n     needs for children and families by 92 percent of respondents \n     to a 1995 National League of Cities survey, ranking as the \n     highest rated need in the survey, which inquired about crime \n     prevention, welfare reform, education, housing, family \n     stability, drug and alcohol abuse prevention, and a host of \n     other issues;\n       (8) 1996 survey data indicate that parents overwhelmingly \n     support using school-based after-school programs for learning \n     and enrichment programs, but 70 percent of all public \n     elementary schools do not offer such programs; and\n       (9) parents want more than babysitting from after-school \n     programs, and computer classes, art and music courses, \n     tutoring, and community service activities rank high among \n     parental choices for activities for after-school programs.\n              TITLE I--CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION #78--RELATING TO THE INDICTMENT AND \n              PROSECUTION OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FOR WAR CRIMES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78.\n\n       Whereas the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg \n     was convened to try individuals for crimes against \n     international law committed during World War II;\n       Whereas the Nuremberg tribunal provision which held that \n     ``crimes against international law are committed by men, not \n     by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who \n     commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be \n     enforced'' is as valid today as it was in 1946;\n       Whereas, on August 2, 1990, and without provocation, Iraq \n     initiated a war of aggression against the sovereign state of \n     Kuwait;\n       Whereas the Charter of the United Nations imposes on its \n     members the obligations to ``refrain in their international \n     relations from the threat or use of force against the \n     territorial integrity or political independence of any \n     state'';\n       Whereas the leaders of the Government of Iraq, a country \n     which is a member of the United Nations, did violate this \n     provision of the United Nations Charter;\n       Whereas the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of \n     Civilian Persons in Times of War (the Fourth Geneva \n     Convention) imposes certain obligations upon a belligerent \n     State, occupying another country by force of arms, in order \n     to protect the civilian population of the occupied territory \n     from some of the ravages of the conflict;\n       Whereas both Iraq and Kuwait are parties to the Fourth \n     Geneva Convention;\n       Whereas the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Article 27 of the \n     Fourth Geneva Convention by their inhumane treatment and acts \n     of violence against the Kuwaiti civilian population;\n       Whereas the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Articles 31 and 32 of \n     the Fourth Geneva Convention by subjecting Kuwaiti civilians \n     to physical coercion, suffering and extermination in order to \n     obtain information;\n       Whereas, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, from \n     January 18, 1991, to February 25, 1991, Iraq did fire 39 \n     missiles on Israel in 18 separate attacks with the intent of \n     making it a party to war and with the intent of killing or \n     injuring innocent civilians, killing 2 persons directly, \n     killing 12 people indirectly (through heart attacks, improper \n     use of gas masks, choking), and injuring more than 200 \n     persons;\n       Whereas Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states \n     that persons committing ``grave breaches'' are to be \n     apprehended and subjected to trial;\n       Whereas, on several occasions, the United Nations Security \n     Council has found Iraq's treatment of Kuwaiti civilians to be \n     in violation of international law;\n       Whereas, in Revolution 665, adopted on August 25, 1990, the \n     United Nations Security Council deplored ``the loss of \n     innocent life stemming from the Iraq invasion of Kuwaiti'';\n       Whereas, in Revolution 670, adopted by the United Nations \n     Security Council on September 25, 1990, it condemned further \n     ``the treatment by Iraqi forces on Kuwait nationals and \n     reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to \n     Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Resolution 674, the United Nations Security \n     Council demanded that Iraq cease mistreating and oppressing \n     Kuwaiti nationals in violation of the Convention and reminded \n     Iraq that it would be liable for any damage or injury \n     suffered by Kuwaiti nationals due to Iraq's invasion and \n     illegal occupation;\n       Whereas Iraq is a party to the Prisoners of War Convention \n     and there is evidence and testimony that during the Persian \n     Gulf War, Iraq violated articles of the Convention by its \n     physical and psychological abuse of military and civilian \n     POW`s including members of the international press;\n       Whereas Iraq has committed deliberate and calculated crimes \n     of environmental terrorism, inflicting grave risk to the \n     health and well-being of innocent civilians in the region by \n     its willful ignition of 732 Kuwaiti oil wells in January and \n     February, 1991:\n       Whereas President Clinton found ``compelling evidence'' \n     that the Iraqi Intelligence Service directed and pursued an \n     operation to assassinate former President George Bush in \n     April 1993 when he visited Kuwait;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials have \n     systematically attempted to destroy the Kurdish population in \n     Iraq through the use of chemical weapons against civilian \n     Kurds, campaigns in 1987-88 which resulted in the \n     disappearance of more than 182,000 persons and the \n     destruction of more that 4,000 villages, the placement of \n     more than 10 million landmines in Iraqi Kurdistan, and ethnic \n     cleansing in the city of Kirkuk;\n       Whereas the Republic of Iraq is a signatory to \n     international agreements including the Universal Declaration \n     on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the POW Convention, \n     and is obligated to comply with these international \n     agreements;\n       Whereas section 8 of Resolution 687 of the United Nations \n     Security Council, adopted on April 3, 1991, requires Iraq to \n     `unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or \n     rendering harmless, under international supervision of all \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support, and manufacturing facilities;\n       Whereas Saddam Husseinn and the Republic of Iraq have \n     persistently and flagrantly violated the terms of Resolution \n     687 with respect to elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction and inspections by international supervisors;\n       Whereas there is good reason to believe that Iraq continues \n     to have stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions, \n     missiles capable of transporting such agents, and the \n     capacity to produce such weapons of mass destruction, putting \n     the international community at risk;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 808 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of violations of \n     international law in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas, on November 8, 1994, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 955 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of the commission of \n     violations of international law in Rwanda;\n       Whereas more than 70 individuals have faced indictments \n     handed down by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia in the Hague for war crimes and crimes \n     against humanity in the former Yugoslavia, leading in the \n     first trial to the sentencing of a Serb jailer to 20 years in \n     prison;\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has \n     indicted 31 individuals, with three trials occurring at \n     present and 27 individuals in custody;\n       Whereas the United States has to date spent more than $24 \n     million for the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia and more than $20 million for the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda;\n       Whereas officials such as former President George Bush, \n     Vice President Al Gore, General Norman Schwarzkopf and others \n     have labeled Saddam Hussein a war criminal and called for his \n     indictment;\n       Whereas a failure to try and punish leaders and other \n     persons for crimes, against international law establishes a \n     dangerous precedent and negatively impacts the value of \n     deterrence to future illegal acts;\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring,)\n       That the President should--\n       (1) call for the creation of a commission under the \n     auspices of the United Nations to establish an international \n     record of the criminal culpability of Saddam Hussein and \n     other Iraqi officials;\n       (2) call for the United Nations to form an international \n     criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, prosecuting, \n     and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials who \n     are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and \n     other violations of international law; and\n       (3) upon the creation of such an international criminal \n     tribunal, seek the reprogramming of necessary funds to \n     support the efforts of the tribunal, including the gathering \n     of evidence necessary to indict, prosecute and imprison \n     Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Wellstone, Mr. Helms, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Abraham, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Ashcroft) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n[[Page S1207]]\n\n                              S. Res. 187\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas according to the United States Department of State \n     and international human rights organizations, the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China engages in widespread human \n     rights violations; and\n       Whereas President Clinton pledged that the United States \n     would step up its efforts in cooperation with other states to \n     insist that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     pass a resolution dealing with the serious human rights \n     abuses in the People's Republic of China: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should introduce and make all efforts necessary \n     to pass a resolution criticizing the People's Republic of \n     China for its human rights abuses in China and Tibet at the \n     annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution calling \nfor the United States to introduce and make all efforts necessary to \npass a resolution at the annual meeting of the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights criticizing the People's Republic of China \n(PRC) for its atrocious human rights record in China and Tibet. This \ncommission will meet on March 16, so I am here today with a sense of \nurgency.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton reversed his position in 1993 and \nchose to de-link trade and human rights in 1993. This decision \nsacrificed important leverage in our relationship with the PRC to \naddress America's human rights concerns. At the time of the President's \ndecision, however, he promised the American people that he would \nstrengthen his efforts to obtain an international condemnation of \nBeijing's violation of international human rights standards in China \nand Tibet. Specifically, he pledged that the United States would step \nup its efforts in cooperation with other states in insisting that the \nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights pass a resolution dealing \nwith the serious human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, this Human Rights Commission meets in Geneva on March \n16, and to date, the President has not demonstrated his commitment to \nkeep his pledge to the American people. It appears that no other nation \non the Commission will initiate this resolution without U.S. support \nand leadership. It is time for the United States to provide that \nleadership--the leadership which the people of China depend upon. We \nmust take action to introduce the China resolution at the Human Rights \nCommission and build international support for its passage.\n  The U.N. Human Rights Commission is the only international body which \noversees the human rights conditions of all states. Even though the \nresolution may not pass, simply the debate of human rights in China and \nTibet at the U.N. Commission makes a difference.\n  I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet Wei Jingsheng in \nFebruary. Mr. Wei is a Chinese dissident who has spent most of his life \nin Chinese prisons for his pro-democratic political writings. He was \nrecently exiled from his country, and is now living in the United \nStates. Unfortunately, while he considers this exile cruel, some want \nto give the government in Beijing credit for releasing Mr. Wei; they \ncall this an example of ``progress.''\n  Mr. President, Mr. Wei articulates clearly and convincingly our call \nto action. His words are appropriate today, and every day we come to \nwork here in the Senate of the United States. In an article by Patrick \nTyler in the New York Times on November 22, 1997, Mr. Wei states, \n``Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and \nthey are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who already enjoy \ndemocracy, liberty and human rights, in particular, should not allow \ntheir own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many \nothers who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery and poverty, \nand all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of \noppression, exploitation and massacres.''\n  Mr. President, the United States must not take our freedom for \ngranted. We must take action. We must not shy away from leadership in \nthe world when our leadership is so badly needed. The United States \nmust sponsor and lead the international effort to condemn the human \nrights situation in China and Tibet. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in passing this resolution calling upon the President to keep \nhis promise to the American people, and insist that the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights pass a resolution dealing with the serious \nhuman rights abuses in the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Connie Mack from \nFlorida, and I have submitted a resolution that deals with the upcoming \nU.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in March and the position that our \ncountry needs to take in relation to human rights, or lack of human \nrights in China. This resolution, my understanding is, will be marked \nup tomorrow in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Senator Mack and I submitted a resolution urging the Clinton \nadministration to make every effort to pass a resolution on China at \nthe U.N. Commission on Human Rights gathering which meets this month in \nGeneva. For the past 30 years, this Commission has monitored the \ncompliance of different countries with human rights standards. It has \ninvestigated violations in countries in all parts of the world, rich \nand poor, weak and powerful alike.\n  Almost 4 years ago, the Clinton administration announced its decision \nto renew most-favored-nation status for China and laid out a new human \nrights policy toward China. At the heart of this policy was the United \nStates commitment, at least in words, to step up efforts to ``insist \nthat the U.N. Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with \nserious human rights abuses in China.'' Since that time, the Clinton \nadministration has made it clear that only significant, concrete \nimprovements in the human rights conditions would justify a \nreconsideration of that commitment.\n  China has failed to improve their human rights record, and, in fact, \nas we turn a blind eye to abuses, the situation appears to be \ndeteriorating. China continues to wage war against individual freedoms \nand human rights. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of dissidents and \nadvocates of political reform were detained just this past year. They \nincluded human rights and prodemocracy activists and members of \nreligious groups. Many have been sentenced to long prison terms where \nthey have been beaten, tortured, and denied medical care.\n  Harry Wu, a man of extraordinary courage and character, has \ndocumented China's extensive prison-enforced labor system. According to \nAmnesty International, throughout China, mass summary executions \ncontinue to be carried out. At least 6,000 death sentences and 3,500 \nexecutions were officially recorded in 1996 alone. The real figures, \ncolleagues, are believed to be much higher.\n  According to the New York Times last week, with the help of Harry Wu, \nthe FBI conducted an uncover investigation, which confirmed claims that \nthe Chinese are selling organs from executed prisoners for transplant.\n  Furthermore, repression has increased steadily. Scores of Roman \nCatholics and Protestants were arrested. Crackdowns continue in Tibet. \nAuthorities ordered the closure of monasteries in Tibet and banned the \nDalai Lama's image, and arrests of political dissidents continue. China \ncontinues to violently threaten the unique culture, religious, and \nlinguistic identity of the Tibetan people. Taking a firm stand against \nhuman rights abuses in China, and around the world, is an expression of \nour solidarity with people who risk their personal safety to champion \nthese principles.\n  As an aside, in what travels I have been able to do around the \nworld--and I wish I could do more of it, Mr. President--I do not think \nthat I have ever been more moved in my life than by the courage of \npeople who live in countries with repressive governments, whether they \nbe left or right, and who have the courage to stand alone, and the \ncourage to speak up, even when it could mean they could end up serving \nlong prison sentences, or their loved ones, their wives, husbands, and \nchildren, can be rounded up, tortured, raped or murdered. These \ncitizens throughout the world continue to have the courage to speak up \nfor basic freedom. Our country ought to be there\n\n[[Page S1208]]\n\nsupporting these courageous individuals.\n  One such person is Kalsang Lhamo, a Tibetan exile living in my home \nState of Minnesota. I recently met her. She told me how her parents \nwere both detained and tortured by the Chinese PLA when she was a \nchild. Their crime? What was the crime of her parents? As she was \nspeaking to me, Mr. President, there were tears in her eyes. She was \ncrying. The crime of her parents was the possession of photographs of \ntheir religious leader. The crime of her parents in Tibet was the \npossession of photographs of their religious leader. After watching her \nparents starve to death in detention and her neighbors executed, she, \ntoo, was beaten nearly to the point of death by Chinese soldiers during \na demonstration.\n  China's release of Wei Jingsheng and its invitations to the U.N. High \nCommission for Human Rights to visit are welcome steps. A Commission \nresolution can certainly acknowledge these developments.\n  Mr. President, our Government can lead the way. The resolution that \nwe must pass at this Commission meeting on human rights can acknowledge \nthis. But they are not in themselves enough to bring about real changes \nin the lives of the people in China and Tibet, and the human rights \nsituation their remains urgent.\n  Also, while we are thankful that Wei Jingsheng is out of prison and \nsafely in the United States, it would be a cruel irony if his release \nwere used as a justification for giving up the fight for human rights \nin China and for our Government not taking a strong position at this \nU.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva. First, of course, Mr. \nWei's release does not represent systematic change. Second, he was not \nreleased unconditionally from his unlawful imprisonment, and he can be \nrearrested, if he ever returns to China. He can't go back to his \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, as an aside, though I think it is relevant, my father \nfled persecution, was born in Odessa, Ukraine, but he grew up in \nSiberian Russia, and then he fled the country when he was 17 years old, \nin 1914. Then, after the revolution, he thought he would go back. Then \nhis parents told him not to and the Bolsheviks took over, or the \nCommunists took over, and he never saw his family again.\n  My father and my mother both had advanced Parkinson's at the end of \ntheir lives, and so we used to spend a lot of time staying over at \ntheir apartment taking care of them. My father had lived in the United \nStates, now, for 65 years. He had no accent at all. He spoke 10 \nlanguages fluently, as a matter of fact. He was an amazing man. And \nyet, when I would spend the night in his room with him, all of his \ndreaming was in Russian. Talk about the child being the father of the \nman or the child being the mother of the woman, all of his dreaming was \nin Russian. And the terrible thing was that it was shouting and it was \nscreaming and it was anguish. I just had to believe that the reason for \nthis, which many Americans can't experience, is how traumatic it must \nbe when you can never go back to your homeland. How traumatic it must \nbe when you can never go back to your country, never see your mother or \nfather.\n  My father, at 17, was separated from his family. I am absolutely \nconvinced that his mother and father and sister were murdered by \nStalin. All correspondence ended during the Stalin years. Wei Jingsheng \nhas been released, but he can never go back to China. He would be \nimmediately arrested and imprisoned. That hardly represents a standard \nof human rights.\n  One of the reasons I speak on the floor of the Senate about human \nrights is to honor the memory of my father. He could never go back, \nnever saw his family again. And at the end of his life, his dreams, I \nthink, were full of anguish, all in Russian, because of that.\n  Finally, Mr. Wei has told me personally that he believes in the \ncritical importance of our effort to push for a resolution at the \nsession of the Commission this month. Let me repeat that for \ncolleagues. It's a sort of sleepy Monday afternoon on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. We will mark this resolution up tomorrow in committee. One \nway or another, I certainly am going to bring this out as an amendment \nand we are going to pass it with an overwhelming vote, giving direction \nto the President and direction to the administration to, at this human \nrights Commission in Geneva, be sure to pass a resolution which will \nstrongly pressure China on human rights. For God's sake, if Wei \nJingsheng--who spent, I don't know, 16 or 17 years in prison because he \nhad the courage to speak up--can put to us this small request that we \nspeak about this on the floor of the Senate, that we try to pass some \nresolution supporting human rights in his country, we ought to be able \nto do that. That's the least we ought to be able to do.\n  For years we have pressured the Chinese on human rights, though I \ndon't think with nearly as much force and commitment as we should have. \nBut to let up now, as the U.N. Commission meets, would be tantamount to \ndefeat for the cause of human justice. Dissidents like Wei Jingsheng, \nwho have been freed and have come to the United States, have thanked \nadvocates for keeping them alive by keeping the pressure on and by \nfocusing attention on their plight. As Senators and as Americans, it is \nour duty and in our interest to make the extra effort to promote \ndemocracy in China and, for that matter, in countries throughout the \nworld, and to bring China in compliance with international standards of \nhuman rights.\n  So, I just want to say today that I am proud to introduce this \nresolution with my colleague, Senator Connie Mack from Florida. This \nwill be marked up tomorrow. One way or another, I will get this to the \nfloor of the Senate as an amendment. I want us to vote as a Senate. I \nwant us to give direction to the administration. I want our Government \nat this U.N. Commission on Human Rights to talk about human rights and \nto have a resolution which really puts the pressure on China for all of \nus. Whether we are Democrats or Republicans, we ought to at least, \nthrough resolutions and through amendments and through votes and \nthrough speaking--it is the very least we can do, to support these very \ncourageous people. That is the purpose of this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to the \nresolution that I have submitted with Senator Mack, Senator Helms, \nSenator Ashcroft, Senator Thomas, Senator Abraham, Senator Boxer and \nSenator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, those Senators will be \nadded as original cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1206-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 committee on labor and human resources\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments \ntoday on the\n\n[[Page S1209]]\n\nsubject of bankruptcy reform. It is an issue that we will be dealing \nwith shortly in the Judiciary Committee. The House of Representatives \ncould vote on a reform bill as early as next month.\n  Mr. President, bankruptcy filings have been skyrocketing. We have \nseen a nearly 60 percent increase in personal filings around the \ncountry during the last two years, resulting in a discharge of about \n$40 billion in debt. In Arizona alone, Chapter 7 filings have increased \na staggering 81 percent during the same period.\n  The number of bankruptcy cases filed in my home state last year \nexceeded the previous record that was set back in 1990, when our real \nestate market was in serious trouble. What is particularly alarming \nabout the number of filings today is that they are occurring in \nrelatively good economic times.\n  Now let me say at the outset that there are obviously some people who \nlegitimately need the relief that Chapter 7 was set up to provide. A \nserious illness or death in the family may have wreaked havoc on the \nfamily finances. Maybe there has been a fire or flood that has wiped \nout the family business or home. In cases like that, where there is \nextraordinary hardship, there ought to be an opportunity to seek relief \nand a fresh start. No one disputes that. And I suspect that most \ncreditors are willing to work with someone when such tragedy strikes.\n  The problem is, too many people appear to be abusing the system of \nlate. A recent study conducted in Phoenix found that a significant \nnumber of people who file for relief under Chapter 7 actually have the \nability to pay back some, or even all, of what they owe. Let me say \nthat again: they actually have the ability to repay some or all of \ntheir debts.\n  A study by Michael Staten of the Georgetown School of Business \nsuggests that as many as 25 percent of Chapter 7 filers could pay at \nleast 30 percent or more of their non-housing debt. But filing under \nChapter 7 allows them to escape all of such debt, regardless of their \nability to repay.\n  Now I know defenders of the status quo prefer to put the blame on \ncreditors, suggesting that they extend credit far too easily, even to \nindividuals who may have difficulty repaying their debt. But let us \nkeep a few points in mind. First, the vast majority of people--an \nestimated 96 percent--pay their bills on time. So creditors must be \ndoing something right. I am sure that if there were a way for creditors \nto weed out more of the riskiest accounts, they would do so.\n  Second, no one is forced to open a credit account, take a loan, or \nbuy something on credit. In fact, millions of hard-working Americans \nmake due without many of the things they would like to have because \nthey cannot afford them--even on credit. Many others delay a purchase \nuntil they are better situated to repay.\n  Third, and perhaps this is the most important point I would make: The \npeople who need credit most are not the wealthiest Americans, but those \nwith moderate or low incomes. If creditors tighten up credit too much, \nit will be the people closer to the margins--those who need it most--\nwhose access to credit will be impeded.\n  In my view, the issue really boils down to this: personal \nresponsibility. If someone freely accepts the terms of a credit \naccount, he or she ought to abide by those terms when it comes time to \nmeet the obligations and pay back what is owed. If extraordinary \ncircumstances strike, debtors ought to work in good faith with their \ncreditors to establish a reasonable repayment plan, assuming they have \nthe means to do so.\n  The irresponsible thing is for people to take something on credit \nthat they have no intention of paying for. And our laws should not \nsanction that sort of behavior.\n  Mr. President, let me turn for a moment to a few different cases that \nillustrate the point I am making here. These are cases that were \nprofiled in recent news reports.\n  First, there was the case of a New York couple with three children. \nThe husband was on disability. They could easily have qualified for a \nChapter 7 discharge of their debt, but they did not want to walk away \nfrom their obligations. They chose to repay what they could under a \nChapter 13 payment plan, and they are now paying $375 of their $2,125 \nmonthly income to satisfy part of their debt.\n  An Arizona teacher ended up with $45,000 worth of credit-card debt, \nbut she was determined to find a way to avoid bankruptcy altogether. \nShe put it this way: ``When I signed my name, that was my promise.'' \nShe found a consumer-credit counseling service to help her through \ntough times, and she is now on her way to paying back her debt and \nrestoring her credit.\n  Compare the New York couple and the Arizona teacher to debtors who \nreportedly used credit to buy several thousand dollars worth of \ncomputer equipment, furniture, and an entertainment center. Shortly \nafter buying the goods, they sold them, pocketed the proceeds, and \nwithout applying anything toward their bills, filed for Chapter 7 to \nerase their debts.\n\n  In another case, a couple allegedly ran up more than $2,000 on a \ncharge card at the very time they were involved in foreclosure \nproceedings on their home. They apparently knew they could not avoid \nthe foreclosure or pay off the credit-card charges they were incurring. \nYet they went ahead and ran up their charge cards with the expectation \nthat they could escape the obligation to repay their debt under Chapter \n7.\n  Mr. President, in the first two instances, we had individuals who \nstepped up to the plate and tried to make good on their obligations. In \nthe latter two cases, we have individuals who seem to be abusing the \nsystem, running up debt they had no intention of repaying. And the way \nthe law works now, it is the abusers who benefit most. And that abuse \ncosts those who responsibly pay their bills as much as $400 per \nhousehold a year.\n  What is fair about allowing people who have the ability to pay back \nsome of their debt to walk away free and clear, while the vast majority \nof people pay their bills on time? What is fair about letting some \npeople avoid their obligations for no good reason, while others who \nexperience credit problems make some effort to repay? I want to \nemphasize that we need to find a way to deal with people who have the \nability to repay their debt, not those who are in such dire straights \nthat their lives are totally upended.\n  Probably the best thing we could do would be to establish a simple, \nup-front means test to direct bankruptcy filers to the chapter of the \nBankruptcy Code that best meets their needs. I am talking about setting \nup an objective, administrative test to separate those who are in \nsevere financial straits and truly need complete relief under Chapter 7 \nfrom those who are able to repay some or all of their debts.\n  Here is how this front-end approach would work. People who have \nannual incomes of less than 75 percent of the national median family \nincome could choose between a Chapter 7 discharge and a Chapter 13 \nrepayment plan, just as they could now. It would be their choice. In \nother words, there would be no change at all for people with modest \nincomes.\n  But for people who have higher incomes, a second test would be \napplied: could they repay all of their secured and priority debts and \nat least 20 percent of their unsecured debts over five years? If so, \nthey would have to establish a repayment plan. If not, they could still \nget protection under Chapter 7. It is as simple and straightforward as \nthat.\n  We should also create an incentive for people who have a pretty good \nidea that they are running into financial trouble to avoid running up \nadditional debts they will not be able to repay. We could do that by \nmaking sure that debts run up on the eve of bankruptcy filings--within \n90 days of the filing--are non-dischargeable.\n  A longer period of time for higher income debtors to pay off their \ndebts is also worth considering, as is a stop to the so-called ``cram \ndowns'' of goods to values below which any other American would have to \npay.\n  Mr. President, if someone has the ability to repay, he or she should \nhave to do so. Bankruptcy protection ought to be reserved for those who \ntruly need it. I intend to work in the Judiciary Committee with \nSenators Hatch and Grassley to craft common sense bankruptcy-reform \nlegislation that addresses these and other concerns. I hope my\n\n[[Page S1210]]\n\ncolleagues will join this effort to ensure that a reform bill can be \nenacted this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1208-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JOHN DaPONTE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on December 31, 1997, John DaPonte \nretired from U.S. Government service and returned to his home state of \nRhode Island after having served at the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board \nsince 1968. The retirement of a federal official happens several times \nevery day. However, it is important that John DaPonte's career in \ngovernment be remembered because of the impact that he and the Foreign-\nTrade Zones Board have made on U.S. trade policy, U.S. companies in the \nglobal marketplace, and the economic development of a wide range of \ncommunities in the United States. There are few federal government \nofficials who have made such a direct positive impact on the subject \nthey manage.\n  The agency for which John DaPonte worked, the Foreign-Trade Zones \nBoard, is one of the smallest federal agencies in Washington, D.C. with \nonly nine employees. It is so small that it does not have a line item \nin the federal budget. In 1968, Zone projects existed in only 6 states \nand Puerto Rico and were very modest in size. Today, Foreign-Trade \nZones Board activity is in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. During his \ntenure at the Board, the agency's Zone projects increased from 9 in \n1968 to 560 in 1997, a yearly growth rate of 221%; domestic merchandise \nreceipts grew from $18 million in 1966 to $125.6 billion. An average \nyearly rate of 24,933%; and employment increased from 1200 jobs in 1968 \nto 370,000 jobs an average yearly growth rate of 1,138%. There are few, \nif any, federal agencies with this growth record. John DaPonte deserves \na thank you for managing an important U.S. trade program that grew \nrapidly over the last 30 years with very modest resources.\n  The Foreign-Trade Zone Program is an economic development tool for \ncommunities providing financial assistance to many troubled U.S. \nindustries, as well as to foreign-based firms interested in \nestablishing U.S. production operations, by helping them be competitive \nin the global marketplace. Foreign-Trade Zones place U.S. production \nfacilities on an equal footing with foreign operations. The benefit of \nthis investment is the creation of jobs in the U.S. Industry groups \nbecome involved in the Foreign-Trade Zone Program in order to solve \ntrade problems. Major industries involved in the program include \nshipbuilding, motor vehicles, oil refining, pharmaceuticals, and \ninformation technology.\n  The growth of the Foreign-Trade Zone Program required a very \nsignificant amount of effort by the staff of the Foreign-Trade Zones \nBoard. The Foreign-Trade Zones Act, and laws pertaining thereto, were \namended in the 1968 to 1997 period on thirteen (13) occasions. Mr. \nDaPonte implemented many new procedures at the Foreign-Trade Zones \nBoard including minor boundary modifications and grant restrictions to \nassist in managing the very rapid growth of the program in a balanced \nmanner and without major funding or personnel. In 1968, 2 applications \nfor new projects were filed. In 1997, 85 applications were filed. Board \nOrders approving new Zone projects grew during the period from 3 Board \nOrders issued in 1968 to 78 Board Orders issued in 1997.\n  In order to operate effectively, the Foreign-Trade Zones Board works \nclosely with a wide range of U.S. government agencies. Most important, \nis the Board's continuing involvement with state and local governmental \norganizations that implements most zone activity. At a time when we in \nWashington are trying to empower states and localities, we would do \nwell to look at the positive program developed under John DaPonte's \nleadership. The Foreign-Trade Zones Program, from the beginning, has \nbeen one that actively engaged states, counties, cities, and port \nauthorities on all levels to encourage local economic development \nactivities.\n  It is clear that during John DaPonte's tenure at the Foreign-Trade \nZones Board, the program experienced extraordinary growth. He managed \nthis high level of growth effectively with extremely modest personnel \nand budget resources. No other Federal agency has created such a \npositive impact on our nation's balance of trade with such limited \nresources. John DaPonte's involvement in the federal government is a \nclassic example of the federal government at its best. Today, we \nremember the positive contributions of John DaPonte to U.S. trade. This \nCongress thanks him for his efforts and wishes him well in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1210-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1210-S1211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, today marks what would have been the 94th \nbirthday of the late Dr. Ted Geisel, better known to most of us as Dr. \nSeuss. Dr. Seuss has touched and continues to touch the lives of \nmillions of people with books like ``Horton Hears a Who,'' ``One Fish, \nTwo Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish,'' ``The Cat in the Hat,'' ``Green Eggs \nand Ham.'' Dr. Seuss' work continues to make reading fun for children \nand their parents.\n  While the good doctor is no longer with us, he left an invaluable \ngift: works which foster in our children a joy and appreciation for \nbooks and the wonderful treasures contained in them.\n  To honor Dr. Seuss and his legacy, today has been declared ``Read \nAcross America Day,'' a day when millions of students and parents, \neducators, many of our colleagues and others across the country have \nbeen engaged in hundreds of events to renew our Nation's commitment to \nliteracy and to teach every child the importance and joy of reading.\n  Today, every child should be in the company of an adult who will read \nto him or her.\n  Last week, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution I submitted, \nalong with Senator Jeffords, in recognition of this very special day, \nand I thank the Senator from Vermont for his comments this morning \nabout this particular event, and several of our colleagues who \nparticipated actively in it.\n  In addition to my 92 colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \ncosponsored this resolution, I commend the efforts of groups like the \nAmerican Library Association, the National Family Literacy Council, the \nNational Association of Elementary School Principals, Reading is \nFundamental, the International Reading Association, the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America, the I Have a Dream Foundation and the National \nEducation Association that have organized events across the country in \nsupport of this very special day.\n  In communities and schools in my home State of Virginia, there are at \nleast 40 events that I know of to promote literacy and reading. Tonight \nin Culpeper County, dozens of families will attend an event called \n``Culpeper Reads,'' where parents and children will attend a community \ndinner dressed as their favorite storybook characters.\n  Parents will have the chance to sign their children up for library \ncards, and community members will read with families and explain how \nreading is used in their occupations.\n  In Hampton, VA, Cooper Elementary has planned an all-day event where \nindividuals will read Dr. Seuss' books to children. And just across the \nriver in Alexandria, Mt. Vernon Elementary School hosted hundreds of \nhigh school students and community volunteers as they read with \nelementary students there.\n  This morning, I visited Mt. Vernon Elementary School, where I read \nsome of my daughters' favorite books to a class of first graders and to \na class of fourth graders.\n  After that, I also had the pleasure of reading to about 50 third \ngraders at Patrick Henry Elementary School in Arlington.\n  This morning, Mr. President, I was reminded of how much fun it is to \nsee children's faces light up when you read to them. I was delighted to \nsee so many individuals at each school committed to promoting literacy \namong our children.\n  It is my hope that today's activities will motivate individuals to \nread across America, not just today but every day.\n  Mr. President, the best way we can help a child learn to read and \nwant to read is by reading to them and with them as often as possible. \nTime and again, research has shown that children who read aloud in the \nearly years with their parents perform better in school.\n  Experts say that the single most important activity for building the \nknowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to \nchildren. Likewise, the effects of illiteracy can be devastating. We \nknow now that 85 percent of high school dropouts and 85 percent of \nthose in juvenile courts are functionally illiterate. Just as alarming \nis the fact that 51 percent of American high school graduates are \nfunctionally illiterate as well.\n  In a country with resources as plentiful as ours, the fact that our \nliteracy rates are so low is not only shocking; it is shameful.\n  Mr. President, the earlier in life we can interest children in books, \nthe sooner we can get children into the habit of reading. When children \nhave access to books, when their parents are involved, and when their \ncommunities are invested in education, children turn to books for \ninformation and enjoyment.\n  Reading means empowerment. Helping our children understand the value \nand the pleasure of reading is one of the greatest gifts we can ever \ngive them. Whether it is to obtain knowledge or to understand history, \nto experience adventure or gather inspiration, we need our children to \nlove reading. But eager and competent readers are made, not born. By \ntaking just a half hour every day to read with our children, we can \nfoster a genuine interest in reading that will stay with our children \nthroughout their lives.\n  In celebrating Dr. Seuss' birthday today, Read Across America Day \nwill generate new enthusiasm for reading nationwide. I urge every \nAmerican today to spark and rekindle our children's and our \ncommunities' and our own interest in reading.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask the Senate to \nproceed under the order already agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/02/senate-section/article/S1212-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
