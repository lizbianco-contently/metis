Mr. President, often we rise on the floor of the Senate \nto pay tribute to a former Member of Congress or former Member of the \nU.S. Senate who has passed away, talking about their career and their \ncontributions to our country.\n  Today I rise to pay tribute to a former Member of Congress from my \nState of Mississippi who will reach his 95th birthday on Saturday. \nThomas Gerstle Abernethy is the last surviving member of our State's \ndelegation of his generation that was very distinguished, indeed, and \nincluded in the House of Representatives: Jamie Whitten, Frank Smith, \nArthur Winstead, John Bell Williams, and Bill Colmer. In the Senate at \nthat time, Jim Eastland and John Stennis represented our State.\n  For 30 years, Thomas Abernethy was viewed as a prominent and \ninfluential Member of Congress from our State, and indeed he was. He \nwas a member of the Agriculture Committee. He was not reticent or \nbashful in any way. He often spoke on the floor of the House on a wide \nand varied range of subjects, with intelligence, energy, and in a \nconscientious way to serve the interests of our State. He truly was an \ninfluence in national affairs in the Congress.\n  He was born in Eupora, MS, on May 16, 1903. He attended the \nUniversity of Alabama and the University of Mississippi and graduated \nfrom the Law Department of Cumberland University in Lebanon, TN, in \n1924. He was admitted to practice law in the State of Mississippi that \nsame year and began practice in his hometown of Eupora in 1925. He was \nelected mayor of Eupora in 1927. Then in 1929 he moved to Okolona, MS. \nHe continued to practice law there, was elected district attorney, the \nprosecuting attorney for several counties in that part of the State of \nMississippi, in 1936. He served until he was elected to Congress in \n1942. That was the 78th Congress that convened on\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\nJanuary 3, 1943, a turbulent time in the history of our country. For \nthree decades, until his retirement in 1973, Thomas Abernethy served \nwith distinction as a member of our House delegation.\n\n  One of the highlights of his career politically came very soon after \nhe was elected to Congress. Our State, during the census of 1950, was \nreapportioned and lost a Member of Congress. He was put in a \ncongressional district by the State legislature's reapportionment plan, \nwith one of the most senior and best known members of the State's \ndelegation at that time, John Rankin. Many expected that John Rankin \nwould defeat Tom Abernethy in the Democratic primary in 1952. But as it \nturned out, Tom Abernethy won that race and he served for 20 more years \nas a member of our House delegation.\n  He retired the same year that I was elected to the House with two \nother new Members of our House delegation--David Bowen, who replaced \nTom Abernethy; and Trent Lott, who replaced the retiring Bill Colmer.\n  Interestingly enough, Tom Abernethy became a close friend and advisor \nto me. I sought his advice on matters involving agriculture, the \nNatchez Trace Parkway, and other issues of importance to me and to our \nState. I always found his advice and counsel very valuable and helpful.\n  When I became a candidate in 1978 for the Senate, Tom Abernethy \ncontinued to be my friend and advisor, for which I was very grateful. I \nwill always recall accompanying him to his hometown of Okolona during \nthat campaign, meeting with friends of mine and his who had decided to \nbecome active in my campaign for the Senate. I could tell that he \nenjoyed that occasion. I enjoyed it very much too and benefited greatly \nfrom his support throughout that campaign.\n  Today, I'm pleased to advise the U.S. Senate that Tom Abernethy is \ngoing to be celebrating his 95th birthday on Saturday. I encourage \nthose who remember him as I do and appreciate him as I do to wish him \nwell on his birthday on Saturday. I congratulate him for his \nconscientious and effective service to our State and our Nation as a \ndistinguished Member of Congress and as a wise and valued citizen in \nhis role as a former Member of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have been \nallocated 15 minutes this morning for comments under morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Allard, is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4845-6", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4846-S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REDUCTION IN THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, earlier this year, I introduced S. 1635, \nlegislation to reduce the capital gains tax to 14 percent and to \nprovide indexing of capital gains.\n  This legislation builds on last year's tax bill, which moved the \ncapital gains rate down from 28 percent to 20 percent. Last year's tax \nchange was a good first step, but I favor a more aggressive approach to \ntax reform.\n  The U.S. level of tax on capital has been among the highest in the \nworld. I am dedicated to seeing that it becomes one of the lowest in \nthe world. A low rate of tax will encourage capital investment, \neconomic growth, and job creation.\n  This is no time for the United States to sit on its lead; We must \ncontinue to ensure that America is the premier location in the world to \ndo business. A low capital gains tax will help our economy, but it will \nalso help America's families by reducing their tax burden.\n  Mr. President, the profile of the average stock market investor is \nchanging rapidly. To make this point, I would like to refer now to a \nchart that outlines the tremendous growth in stock ownership among \nmiddle class Americans. This reflects a recent study commissioned by \nthe NASDAQ stock market, which determined that 43 percent of adult \nAmericans now invest in the stock market. This is double the level of \njust 7 years ago.\n  Investing is no longer the exclusive province of the elderly, \naffluent, or male. A majority of the investors are under 50 years of \nage, 47 percent of the investors are women, and half of the investors \nare not even college graduates. Most working-age investors describe \nthemselves as blue- or white-collar workers rather than managers or \nprofessionals. I think that this rather dramatically reflects the \nchange in the makeup of the investor on the stock market.\n  In addition to investing in the stock market, millions of Americans \nown small businesses and farms, and they certainly feel the impact of \nany tax on capital assets.\n  Mr. President, while a cut in the capital gains tax rate would help \ninvestors and their families, it is also likely to increase tax \nrevenues. At first, this may seem odd, but there are two principal \nreasons that a cut in capital gains taxes increases revenues. First, \nthere is the short-term incentive to sell more capital assets. Second \nis the long-term progrowth benefit from a capital-friendly tax policy.\n  Let me first discuss the short-term incentive to sell more assets. In \norder to understand this concept, one has to first recognize that the \ncapital gains tax is largely a voluntary tax; the tax is only paid if \nthe investor chooses to sell the asset. If taxes are high, the investor \ncan hold on to the asset for years. But when taxes are dropped down, \nlowered, investors will often decide to sell the assets and realize the \ncapital gain.\n\n  History confirms this pattern. In 1978, when the capital gains tax \nrate was reduced from 40 percent to 28 percent, capital realizations \nincreased by 50 percent and tax receipts increased. In fact, it was \ndone at that particular point in our country's history to stimulate the \neconomy.\n  In 1981, Congress and President Reagan further reduced the capital \ngains tax rate to 20 percent. Once again, capital realizations \nincreased dramatically. And by 1983, they were again up by 50 percent. \nIn fact, during the period from 1978 to 1983, capital gains tax rates \nwere cut in half. But by the end of the period, the Federal Government \nwas receiving twice as much revenue from capital gains taxes.\n  I would like to emphasize that point by turning to a chart which \ncompares the level of capital gains tax with tax revenue over a 20-year \nperiod, running from 1976 and projecting out to the end of 1997. As the \nchart clearly shows, the tax rate was cut in half between 1997 and \n1983, right in this time period here, and the revenues more than \ndoubled, from $9 billion in 1978 to nearly $19 billion by 1983. This \nwas not a temporary blip. As the chart shows, revenues continued to \nrise through the 1980s.\n  The underlying point is proven dramatically, I think, in 1986. What \nhappened in 1986 is this: Congress voted to increase the capital gains \ntax to 28 percent. This was a 40 percent increase in the tax rate then \nin place. But the new, higher rate was delayed until January 1 of 1987. \nWhat we saw then was a massive sale of assets through 1986, while the \nrate was still 20 percent. Investors rushed to sell their assets before \nthe higher 28 percent went into effect.\n  If we look again at the chart, we find that capital gains revenues, \nafter 1986, began a nearly 5-year decline. In fact, despite the much \nhigher tax rate, by 1991, capital gains revenues were actually at their \nlowest level since 1984.\n  Mr. President, the pattern should be clear by now. But I would like \nus to take one more look at this issue by reviewing the revenue \nestimates associated with last year's cut in the capital gains tax \nrate. Any time Congress considers tax changes, it is required to \nestimate the revenue impact of those changes. This task falls \nprincipally on the Joint Committee on Taxation, which relies on data \ncompiled by the Congressional Budget Office. Current law requires \nrevenue estimates to stretch 10 years into the future.\n  Last year, when Congress proposed to cut the capital gains rate from \n28 to 20 percent, the Joint Committee on Taxation submitted its revenue \nestimate.\n  Despite forecasting an initial pick up in revenue due to greater \nrealizations, JCT forecast a 10 year revenue loss from the rate cut of \n$21 billion.\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\n  The JCT and CBO estimates now appear to have dramatically \nunderestimated the strength of the economy and the positive response to \nthe tax rate cut.\n  The JCT forecast last July that capital gains revenue for 1998 would \nbe $57 billion after the rate cut.\n  Again, this is reflected here on the chart projecting a much lower \nimpact, actually a loss that we will end up with. In the shaded area \nover here with the lines drawn we see a dramatic increase in revenue \nthat happened to the Federal Government, just contrary to what our \n``budgeteers'' were projecting when we initiated the capital gains \nreduction in rate.\n  Recently, I contacted the CBO and JCT to determine how the forecast \nwas holding up.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is now anticipating that both the \n1997 and 1998 capital gains realizations will be much higher than \npreviously thought.\n  It is therefore reasonable to assume that even with a lower tax rate, \ncapital gains tax revenues for 1997 and 1998 will be a good deal higher \nthan previously forecast.\n  The irony here is that the entire 10 year revenue loss that was \nforecast may be made up for in the first several years of the rate cut.\n  Once again, we will have a situation where a tax rate cut leads to \ngreater revenues.\n  Mr. President, what does all this tell us?\n  In my view, a review of the last twenty years of capital gains tax \nrates and the associated revenues suggests that the model used by JCT \nand CBO to estimate capital gains revenues is flawed.\n  At minimum, it would appear that when tax rates are lowered the model \nsignificantly exaggerates the revenues losses.\n  In fact, in no single year after a rate cut has there ever been a \nloss of revenue.\n  Conversely, when tax rates are increased, the model significantly \nexaggerates the level of revenue gains.\n  Not only do the Congressional models fail to accurately measure the \nresponse of taxpayers to changes in tax rates, they completely exclude \nany estimate of the impact of tax changes on economic performance.\n  Mr. President, up to this point we have only been discussing the \nshort term behavioral changes that come from changes in the capital \ngains tax rate.\n  What about the longer term impact on economic growth? Congress is \nlargely in the dark when it comes to any estimate of this benefit.\n  It is logical to assume that a lower tax rate on capital encourages \ncapital formation. A higher rate of capital formation clearly benefits \nthe economy. As a consequence the federal government will realize \ngreater income, payroll, and excise taxes. In addition, state and local \ntax revenues will also rise.\n  Admittedly, all of this is difficult to measure. However, I would \nlike to see some attempt made to include these factors in revenue \nmodels.\n  At a minimum they should be appended to the official revenue \nestimates. This would give Congress a more complete picture of the \nimpact of tax changes on revenues.\n  As I review the issue of capital gains tax revenues I am struck by \nseveral things.\n  First, capital gains tax rate cuts do not appear to cost the \ngovernment revenue, and may in fact increase revenue rather \ndramatically.\n  Second, the current revenue estimating model should be updated to \nreflect evidence that the model exaggerates losses from rate cuts, and \nalso exaggerates the gains from tax rate hikes.\n  In addition, some attempt should be made to measure the impact of tax \nchanges on the level of economic performance.\n  Third, less emphasis should be placed on the revenue models.\n  Instead, greater emphasis should be placed on the impact that changes \nin the tax treatment of capital gains will have on the private economy.\n  Economic growth, job creation, and international competitiveness \nshould be our focus, not projections of government revenue.\n  This is particularly true when we know that the revenue projections \nare not likely to be terribly accurate.\n  This is not intended as a criticism of those whose job it is to make \nthe estimates. This is difficult work. I certainly recognize this \nhaving served on the House Budget Committee for several years. And \nthose who do the work are professionals who work hard at getting it \nright.\n\n  Unfortunately, this business is a bit like gazing into a crystal \nball. There are just too many factors at work to think we can \naccurately project the revenue impact of changes in capital gains tax \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to capital gains taxes I suggest that \nCongress spend less time gazing into the crystal ball of revenue \nforecasting, and more time focusing on the real world impact of taxes \non capital formation, job creation, and economic growth.\n  I think it will then be abundantly clear that we should continue to \nreduce the tax on capital to 14 percent. This will continue the good \nwork that we began last year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks the 10th anniversary of the \nmost tragic drunk driving case in our Nation's history. Ten years ago \ntoday, on Saturday, May 14, 1988, a school bus filled with children \nheading home to Radcliff, KY, after having spent a day at King's Island \nAmusement Park in Ohio--that school bus was hit head-on by a drunk \ndriver heading the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, KY, 10 \nyears ago today. The collision caused the front gas tank of the bus to \nexplode in flames. The crash caused the death of 24 children and three \nadults, and left many of the 36 survivors burned and disfigured.\n  This crash did not just affect the 63 innocent victims who were on \nthe bus that day. It had significant impact and changed forever many of \nthe victims' families, friends and their community. This horrible \ntragedy helped fuel a nationwide movement which has helped to change \nour Nation's attitudes towards drinking and driving. This horrible \ntragedy helped spur State legislatures to enact more stronger drunk \ndriving laws. It led to tougher enforcement and has caused people to \nthink twice before drinking and driving. In short, it is no longer \n``cool'' or ``neat'' in our society to drink and drive. And this \nhorrible, horrible tragedy did impact people and has helped to \ngalvanize public opinion in regard to drunken driving.\n  The effects of this attitude change are well documented. In 1986, \n24,050 people lost their lives in alcohol-related traffic crashes. A \ndecade later that number had dropped by 28 percent; 17,274 people lost \ntheir lives in 1995 in\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nalcohol-related accidents, a drop of 28 percent. This reduction is not \nattributable to one single event. It is not attributable just to this \nhorrible accident, this horrible tragedy we are commemorating and \nthinking about today. It was a whole series of actions taken by people \nacross this country--Mothers Against Drunk Driving, SADD chapters, \ngrassroots efforts of survivors, grassroots efforts of victims and \nmembers of victims' families.\n  We have begun, over that decade, to significantly change public \nattitudes. Unfortunately, after 10 years of improvement, after 10 years \nof fewer people dying every year due to drunken driving, these trends \nhave now been reversed. I think our Nation has lost its focus. We no \nlonger focus on this as a national issue. From 1994 to 1995, fatalities \nin alcohol-related crashes rose--did not decline--rose, and they rose \nby 4 percent. That was the first increase in over a decade. In 1995, 41 \npercent of the 41,798 motor vehicle crash deaths were attributable to \nalcohol use. Alcohol involvement is the single greatest factor in \ntraffic-related deaths and injuries. In short, the trend is now moving \nin the wrong direction. We have not done enough. We must move to \nreverse this trend.\n  I think what we have to do is to refocus and to put the emphasis \nback, again, and public debate, on this horrible, horrible problem. \nThis year, Congress has the opportunity to help renew our Nation's \nfocus on the evils of drinking and driving. During the Senate's \nconsideration of ISTEA, we took the lead in helping our Nation refocus \non the consequences of drinking and driving.\n  Mr. President, there is no one single thing in the Senate's version \nof ISTEA reauthorization which will change attitudes by itself. Rather, \nthe Senate did a number of things which, when taken together, will help \nrenew our Nation's focus on this effort.\n  First, the Senate voted to adopt an amendment which would encourage \nStates to enact a statute that would make it illegal, in and of itself, \nto operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or \nhigher. This amendment was adopted by a 2-to-1 margin in this Senate \nChamber. This was one of the few times I stated on the floor that day \nthat Members of the Senate could come to the Senate floor and cast \ntheir vote and know that a ``yes'' vote would, in fact, clearly save \nlives. The individuals we will never know, but it is clear this \nlegislation, if enacted into law, will save hundreds and ultimately \nthousands of lives over the next few years. Sixty-one of our colleagues \nchose to take advantage of that opportunity.\n  Further, in the same bill, the Senate voted to adopt an amendment \nwhich would make it illegal to drive with one hand on the steering \nwheel and the other wrapped around a bottle of whiskey or beer. That is \nstill legal in many places in this country. Under this legislation, it \nno longer would be tolerated.\n  Finally, we included a provision which would establish mandatory \nminimum penalties for repeat drunk drivers--the worst of the worst of \nthe worst.\n  I can think of no better way to honor the memories of the victims of \nthe deadliest alcohol-related traffic crash in our Nation's history, as \nwell as the memories of all victims of drunk drivers, than to include \nthese reasonable provisions aimed at renewing our Nation's focus on the \ntragedy resulting from drinking and driving in the final bill to \nreauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.\n  This matter is in conference committee right now. The conferees are \ndealing with a number of very contentious and very difficult funding \nissues. We all have our own opinions about those issues. They are very \ncontentious. But there is one issue where the overwhelming majority of \nthe American people have spoken in public opinion poll after public \nopinion poll, and that has to do with the .08. There is one issue where \nthe members of the conference committee can know that their vote to \ninclude the .08 provision will, in fact, save lives.\n  Let me repeat, this Senate has spoken. Sixty-one of the Members of \nthis Senate voted ``yes'' for a nationwide .08 standard. The House of \nRepresentatives did not have the opportunity to vote; they were blocked \nfrom voting on this measure. But I think anyone who has looked at this \nclearly understands that the House of Representatives also, if they had \nbeen permitted to vote on this, would have approved the .08.\n  What we are asking the conference committee to do is very simple: \nInclude this provision, which passed so overwhelmingly in the U.S. \nSenate, in the final version of ISTEA. If the members of the conference \ncommittee will do that, they will save lives. It has been estimated \nthat between 500 to 1,000 lives in this country will be saved every \nyear by going to a .08 standard.\n  Mr. President, the statistics and facts are clear. The evidence is \noverwhelming. No one who tests .08 has any business being behind the \nwheel of a car. Think about it. If you were at a party at a neighbor's \nhouse or your own house, and you saw someone, an adult male weighing \n160 to 165 pounds, and you watched him drink over an hour period of \ntime--you timed it--four beers or four shots of liquor or four big \nglasses of wine on an empty stomach, then that person looked at you and \nsaid, ``I want to take your little girl Anna to get an ice cream \ncone,'' would you let your daughter get in the car with that person? We \nall know the answer. The answer is absolutely not--``Don't get near \nher; she can't go with you.''\n\n  That is all we are saying. Mr. President, it takes that much alcohol \nconsumption to reach .08. What we are saying is, we set a nationwide \nstandard so that, no matter where we go in this country, we have some \nlevel of assurance that the laws of whatever State we are in--in my \ncase, whether I drive out of Ohio into Kentucky or Indiana or Michigan \nor West Virginia, wherever I go, when I put my family in a car, I will \nhave an assurance there is a national .08 standard, a bare minimum \nstandard to protect our families.\n  That is what we are asking for in the conference committee. I again \nurge the members of the conference committee to do what is right: \nFollow what the Senate has said, follow the vote in the Senate, and \ninclude this very reasonable measure.\n  For my friends, my conservative friends, such as myself--we consider \nourselves conservatives--I simply point out, this is the same type \nlegislation that Ronald Reagan approved and supported and pushed \nthrough the U.S. Congress, when he was President of the United States, \nto go to a nationwide standard of 21 as being the age for drinking. It \nis the same mechanism, the same procedure, and the same basic \nprinciple.\n  What Ronald Reagan said then, and I will paraphrase, is very simple: \nThat in some areas of national importance, national concern, we can \nmake small intrusions into States rights, small changes that will have \nmonumental effects to save lives across the country, and in some areas \nwe do need a national minimum standard. I urge the conferees to include \nthis in the legislation.\n  I see my friend, Senator Lautenberg, who has been a tremendous \nadvocate over the years for highway safety, who sponsored the bill I \njust referenced that Ronald Reagan pushed through and Senator \nLautenberg pushed through. Senator Lautenberg was the author of that \nbill in the 1980s. He and I were at the White House yesterday with the \nVice President. We have been there with the President to support this. \nThis is a bipartisan effort to save lives in this country.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine.\n  Senator DeWine has experience as a prosecutor. He has seen what \nhappens when alcohol and driving try to mix. The result is terrible \ntragedy so often. His work here, together with mine, has enabled us to \nassemble a bipartisan group to support our effort to reduce the blood \nalcohol content to .08 at which point someone can be declared driving \nwhile impaired.\n  Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Nation's most deadly drunk \ndriving crash. On the night of May 14, 1988, a bus packed with sleeping \nchildren was driving south on Interstate 71 to the First Assembly of \nGod Church in Radcliff, KY. Thirty-five girls, twenty-eight boys, and \nfour adults were returning from a day at the King's Island amusement \npark near Cincinnati.\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\n  According to newspaper accounts, the group said a short prayer before \nthey began their return trip. I quote him. He said, ``Please grant us a \nsafe trip. May God have his hand on this bus.'' That is what he prayed.\n\n  But prayers were not enough that day. At 10:55 p.m., as the bus \nneared the northern Kentucky town of Carrollton, the driver of the bus \nspotted a pickup truck barreling north in his southbound lane. Moments \nlater a collision and the bus burst into flames.\n  Twenty-four children and 3 adults were killed in that devastating \nschoolbus crash, and 30 more were injured. The lives of so many \nfamilies and friends were destroyed.\n  The current president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Karolyn \nNunnallee, lost her daughter Patty in that terrible crash. She was on \ntelevision this morning trying to explain the impact of losing that \nchild. This day across the Nation thousands of mothers, fathers, \nbrothers, and sisters will join in a moment of silence to honor those \nthousands of victims who die on our highways each year at the hands of \ndrunk drivers.\n  We will honor Patty and the others who died that night and those who \nwere injured during this moment of silence.\n  Sadly, the death toll visited upon us by drunk driving mounts up each \nyear with an appalling clock-like efficiency. Every 30 minutes a family \nloses a loved one to a drunk driver. That means in the decade since the \nCarrollton crash 175,000 people have died. That is almost twice the \npopulation of the capital of my home State of New Jersey, Trenton, NJ. \nThese deaths need not have happened.\n  If we also take into consideration that each of these victims had \nfamily and friends, we are talking about more than--more than--a \nmillion people grief stricken, which is more people than who live in \nWashington, DC. And this grieving should never have occurred.\n  Drunk driving also takes an enormous economic toll, as well, on our \nNation. Alcohol-related crashes cost society over $45 billion each \nyear. One alcohol-related fatality is estimated to cost society about \n$950,000; and an injury averages about $20,000 in emergency and acute \nhealth care costs, long-term care and rehabilitation, police and court \nservices, insurance, lost productivity, and social services.\n  Just look at this toll of needless death, needless grief, and \nneedless spending. These facts should move us to rage. And our rage \nshould move us to action.\n  Mr. President, we can act. Right now, the House-Senate conference \ncommittee is meeting to resolve the competing ISTEA reauthorization \nbills. I sit on that conference committee. As part of this process, the \nCongress is going to make one decision--will we get tougher on drunk \ndriving and enact laws that will save lives or will we fall prey to the \nliquor and restaurant lobbyists?\n  Mr. President, this body has spoken about this issue. Two months ago, \nthe Senate passed an amendment to prohibit open containers of alcohol \nin motor vehicles. It adopted a tough program to combat repeat \noffenders of drinking and driving. And by a 2 to 1 margin, the Senate \nvoted to set a strict national drunk driving standard at .08 blood \nalcohol content. The Senate voted 62 to 32 for this life-saving \nmeasure. The House was not even able to vote on this issue. They were \nprevented from it.\n  We can ask the question, Why? But we must carry the will of the \nSenate--of the people--through to completion. We want ``.08 in '98.'' \nWe are now at the crossroads, and it is time to decide. The question \ncomes up, Why? Why aren't the House Members permitted to vote on this \nissue? Well, it stops at a committee over there. The process is \ndifferent than it is over here, and they do not even have to let a \npiece of legislation come up on the floor.\n\n  And why? Why would they say no to a vote on this issue when parents \nlose children and children lose parents across this country in numbers \nthat compare to our worst year in Vietnam? In full combat we lost about \n17,000 of our soldiers. In our country every year we lose more than \n17,000 people to drunk driving, and it does not have the same impact on \nour society. So we have to say, Why is it that it does not?\n  If after coming so close we fail to enact .08 this year, the American \npeople should charge this Congress with something I will call ``VUI,'' \nvoting under the influence of the liquor lobby. That is where it stops. \nThey say, ``You're going to kill our business,'' that ``You're going to \narrest social drinkers.'' No, no, no. We are not saying anybody can't \ndrink. They can drink as much as they want. They can fall off the bar \nstools, as long as they don't fall on me or my kids.\n  The issue is whether, after having had a blood alcohol content level \nof .08, they ought to get behind a wheel. And we say no. I think the \nSenator from Ohio made it very clear. He said if he watched someone at \na party or someone at a dinner, or something like that, have four \ndrinks in an hour--a man my size would have five--on an empty stomach, \nto have your child get in the back seat of a car with that driver, I \nwould say never, never. That is what we want to say across this \ncountry. Because every family is entitled to that kind of safety and \nsecurity.\n  In 1984, President Reagan signed a bill that I wrote over here to \nmake the national drinking age 21 and eliminate blood borders. Those \nare the borders between States with different drinking ages. Since \nthen, more than 10,000 lives have been saved, enough to fill a small \ntown. That is 10,000 families that did not have to mourn or grieve the \nloss of a child or a parent or a brother or a sister--10,000 people. \nThat is a lot of people.\n  Now we have a different kind of blood border--the blood alcohol \nborder. Right now a driver legally drunk in one of 16 .08 States merely \nhas to drive over the border and--poof--he is legally sober again. We \nknow that is wrong. And we know once you are over .08 you are too drunk \nto drive in any State.\n  Consider this: Someone, again, of my height having had four glasses \nof wine in an hour--five glasses of wine; again, I am a little heavier \nthan the average; five glasses of wine in an hour --on an empty \nstomach. That is too much. We are not saying, again, that people cannot \ndrink. We are saying they cannot drink and drive.\n  Think about the 6,000 families who will be spared the devastating \nloss of a loved one to a drunk driver over the course of a decade if we \npass .08. Think of what it means. Thousands of parents now destined to \nlose a child will be able to read their little ones to sleep instead of \nlooking at an empty bed; children now destined to lose a parent will \nwake up in a full and loving home.\n  One year ago, Randy Frazier called the Congress to action. Randy's \ndaughter, Ashley--people from Maryland--was killed by a .08 drunk \ndriver. Randy said, ``It is time for the leadership and action here in \nCongress to draw a safer, saner, and more sensible line against \nimpaired driving at .08. If we truly believe in family values, then .08 \nought to become the law of the land. Four beers in an hour''--four \nglasses of wine in an hour, on an empty stomach--``and getting behind \nthe wheel of a car, in our estimation, is one definition of family \nviolence.''\n\n  Mr. President, it is decision time. The question is whether we are \ngoing to vote with our conscience. Are we going to vote under ``VUI,'' \nvoting under the influence of the alcohol lobby? They poured people \ninto this town. The Restaurant Association had 130 as reported by a \nnewspaper, 130 lobbyists come in. They swarmed all over the House, and \nthey got people to change their minds. Then they got people, as I said \nearlier, to be able to hold that bill from getting consideration. That \nis not the way law ought to be decided when it comes to American \nfamilies. And we hope we are going to stand up to our responsibility as \nwe pause to honor the victims of drunk driving.\n  Let us be moved to action. We must enact tough drunk driving laws \nthis year. It has to be ``.08 in '98.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise on an issue of great importance \nto me, personally, and I believe many other Members of the Senate.\n  Winston Churchill once noted that nations whose sons fight and die \ntogether forever change their relationship. Seven years ago, the United \nStates and Kuwait tragically shared this experience. The liberation of \nKuwait forever changed the relationships between our two peoples. \nThough our cultures and the faiths of many are different, we share a \nsense of national independence and, I believe, a growing awareness of a \nburgeoning potential for democracy in Kuwait.\n  It was, therefore, extremely disturbing on November 19, 1997, when \nseveral members of the Islamic faction in Parliament in Kuwait sought \nthe ouster of the Minister of Information, Sheikh Saud Al-Nasir Al-\nSabah. It did so because of an allegation that he permitted books to be \ndisplayed at a book fair which fundamentalists deemed to be offensive. \nMembers of this Senate--indeed, many people in the administration--not \nonly know Sheikh Saud Al-Nasir Al-Sabah well, they consider him a \nfriend. During the darkest days of the invasion and occupation of \nKuwait, he was the voice of that Nation in the United States. We \ntrusted him. More, perhaps, than anyone we know in Kuwaiti society, he \nrallied support to the liberation of his country.\n  These allegations against him we now recognize were little more than \nan effort by Islamic fundamentalists to extend their control over the \nMinistry of Information, which would have changed the nature of the \npolitical system in Kuwait. Judgments about Kuwait's future are for the \nKuwaiti people, obviously, and entirely. But I believe as friends of \nthat Nation who have fought and died with them, we all have a stake in \nthe growing movement of that society for free expression.\n  I know my colleagues join me with some relief and considerable pride \nin that in a reformed Government following this incident, Sheikh Saud \nAl-Nasir Al-Sabah was kept as Oil Minister. Indeed, not only did he \nremain in the Government, therefore, but he received a promotion.\n  I know the people of Kuwait have been traumatized by this effort, \nthrough this emergence of Islamic factions within their political \nsystem, to extend their control and threaten rising elements of \ndemocracy in their society. I trust that Kuwaiti democracy will be the \nstronger for this experience, that the people of Kuwait will not only \nunderstand but appreciate the interests of the U.S. Senate in the \npolitical system of that country, since the concept of the government \nand free expression in Kuwait is so much a part of our mutual \nunderstanding for the defense of that society.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4850-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nS-2057, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I \nwant to thank all members of the Committee who have worked so hard this \nyear to bring this bill to the floor. I particularly want to thank \nSenator Levin, the Ranking Member, for his cooperative support.\n  I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Coats, \nSenator Kempthorne, and Senator Glenn. This will be their last defense \nauthorization bill. On behalf of the committee and the Senate, I want \nto thank them for their dedication to the national security of our \ncountry and their support for the young men and women who serve in our \narmed forces. We will miss these three outstanding Senators who have \nserved our country and the committee so well.\n  Mr. President, I also want to express my appreciation to the members \nof the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We on the \nCommittee are very proud of our staff. I believe that we have the most \ncompetent and professional staff on Capitol Hill. They work well \ntogether in a very bi-partisan way and all of us on the Committee are \nindebted to them for their selfless dedication. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a list of the members of the staff be included following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. This is the 40th defense authorization bill on which I \nhave worked since I joined the Armed Services Committee in 1959. It is \nmy fourth as Chairman of the committee and as I indicated earlier this \nyear, while I intend to remain on the Committee, this will be my last \nyear as Chairman. I look forward to the floor debate on this bill as \nwell as the conference with the House. I am hopeful that we are able to \ncomplete the bill and send it to the President before the July 4th \nrecess. It is essential that we complete floor action before the \nMemorial Day recess in order to meet this ambitious schedule.\n  We have accelerated significantly our process this year. I cannot \nrecall ever bringing the defense authorization bill to the floor this \nearly in the year. If we are successful in completing conference in \nlate June, we may be setting a modern day record.\n  Mr. President, the Defense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 1999 \nwhich I bring before the Senate today is only 3.1 percent of Gross \nDomestic Product--the lowest since 1940. Defense outlays peaked in 1986 \nat 6.5 percent. President Reagan's defense buildup was one of the great \ninvestments in our history. As a result of President Reagan's strong \nleadership and our strengthened military, we won the Cold War. \nTherefore, we have been able to reduce our defense force structure. \nThese reductions enabled the Nation to reduce the\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\ndeficit and achieve a balanced budget. The victory in the Cold War and \nthe resulting peace dividend, which began, by the way, under President \nReagan, is now saving us over $250 billion per year--the major factor \nin achieving a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, we haven't debated the levels for defense spending on \nthe floor of the Senate for some time. Maybe its because defense \ndoesn't rank very high these days in the polls which reflect the \nconcerns of the American people. Or maybe it's because everyone assumes \nthat the defense budget is adequate and there is no reason to debate \nit. I am concerned first of all because I believe there is a clear \nshortfall between the ambitious foreign policy of this Administration \nand the resources we are willing to provide for national defense.\n  The operational tempo of our military forces is at an all time high. \nAmerican forces are deployed literally around the globe. The foreign \npolicy of this Administration has raised the number of separate \ndeployments to the highest in our history. Our servicemen and women \nspend more and more time away from their homes and families on more \nfrequent and extended deployments. As a result, recruiting grows more \ndifficult and retention is becoming an extremely serious problem--\nespecially for pilots.\n  We are also beginning to see increasing indicators of readiness \nproblems. Spare parts shortages, increased cannibalization, declining \noperational readiness rates, cross-decking of critical weapons, \nequipment and personnel foretell a potential emergence of readiness \ndifficulties that could seriously cripple our military forces in the \nvery near future. The Chiefs of the military services indicate that \nthey are on the margin in readiness and modernization. The Chief of one \nof our military services has recently stated orally as well as in \nwriting that his budget for fiscal year 1999 is, for the third year in \na row, inadequate.\n  While, at the present time, the American people may not be expressing \nconcern about threats to our national security or the readiness of our \narmed forces, we in the Senate are not relieved of our responsibilities \nto ensure that we have capable, effective military forces ready to \ndefend our nation's vital interests. It is our job in the Congress to \nexamine the readiness and capability of our armed forces and ensure \nthat we have provided adequate resources and guidance to the Secretary \nof Defense so that he can carry out his mission to protect our national \nsecurity. I believe, as I have stated so many times on this floor, that \nnothing that we do here in the Congress is as important as providing \nfor our national security. I intend to continue to make this point \nwhenever I believe that we in the Senate may not be paying enough \nattention to this most critical issue.\n\n  Mr. President, the Congress has endeavored over the past several \nyears to shore up our defense budgets with annual add-ons. However, \nreductions in the defense budgets over the last 3 years to pay for \nBosnia have denigrated the effect of those Congressional plus-ups. \nAlmost half of the $21 billion we added to the defense budgets over the \nlast 3 years, which was intended to enhance readiness and \nmodernization, was spent instead for operations in Bosnia. The \nmaintenance of our forces in Bosnia and in the Persian Gulf, places \ngreat strain on our military forces and budgets.\n  As many of you are aware, we have been forced to cope with a $3.6 \nbillion outlay shortfall in the defense budget resulting from scoring \ndifferences between the Office of Management and Budget and the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici has been very helpful in working out a solution to \nhelp alleviate this problem. I am sure the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee joins me in thanking Senator Domenici and his \nstaff for their assistance.\n  Under the budget agreement, we have not added funds to the defense \nbudget this year. I do not believe that a majority of Senators would \nsupport adding funds to the defense budget in violation of the budget \nagreement. Therefore, we have conducted our markup consistent with the \nbudget agreement. However, I have stated in the past and I say again, I \nbelieve that we are not providing adequate funds for defense. The \nChairmen and Ranking Members of the House National Security Committee \nhave also called for increases in the defense budget. It remains my \nfirm belief that we should provide additional funds for our national \nsecurity.\n  In this bill, the Committee has achieved a balance among near-term \nreadiness; long-term readiness, through investments in modernization \ninfrastructure and research and development; force levels; quality of \nlife and ensuring an adequate, safe and reliable nuclear weapons \ncapability. The Committee modified the budget request to improve \noperations and achieve greater efficiencies and savings and to \neliminate spending that does not contribute directly to the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  The Committee recommended provisions to provide a 3.1 percent pay \nraise for the uniformed services; to enhance the ability of the \nservices to recruit and retain quality personnel; and to restore \nappropriate funding levels for the construction and maintenance of both \nbachelor and family housing. The bill recommends increased investment \nin research and development activities to ensure that the Department of \nDefense can leverage advances in technology.\n  The Committee remains concerned about the level of resources \navailable for the reserve components and the continued lack of a spirit \nof cooperation between the active and reserve forces. The Committee \nrecommended a number of policy initiatives and spending increases \nintended to continue the improvement of the readiness of the reserve \nforces and to permit greater use of the expertise and capabilities of \nthe reserve components. One such measure is the authority for the \nreserve components to prepare to respond to domestic emergencies \ninvolving the use or intended use of a weapon of mass destruction. I am \nproud to be able to recommend this important legislation which will \nenable the Nation to be prepared for the most unimaginable terrorist \nincident.\n  I do want to tell my colleagues that this defense bill does not \ninclude a long list of new major projects or new initiatives. Quite \nsimply, there is no money to support new major projects or new \ninitiatives. However, I should note that over the past three or four \nyears, the Committee on Armed Services has produced defense bills with \nmajor new program starts, reforms of the acquisition process, \ninitiatives related to missile defense and counter proliferation, and \nprograms to achieve efficiencies and enhance readiness. The Secretary \nof Defense must now implement these major programs. As the Department \nof Defense executes the programs we enacted over the past several \nyears, I anticipate that they will come back to the Congress to suggest \nmodifications addressing areas in which they believe they need \nadditional flexibility.\n  Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues that any \namendments to the defense authorization bill that would increase \nspending should be accompanied by offsetting reductions.\n  Mr. President, this is a sound bill.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of our \ncommittee in bringing the defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n1999 to the floor. As we all know, as Senator Thurmond has so \neloquently reminded us, this is the last year that he will be chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee, through his choice. Therefore, \nit is the last year that he will be bringing an authorization bill to \nthe floor. I just want to thank him and commend him for the commitment \nthat he has made to our Nation's defense. It has been longstanding, it \nhas been a matter of keen devotion. It is really a significant moment \nfor me to be here with him as this defense authorization bill comes to \nthe floor. I know I am thanking him on behalf of all of the members of \nour committee and the Senate for the energy he has placed into this \nissue of defense, security, and this bill itself.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is also the final defense \nauthorization bill for three other members of our committee--Senators \nGlenn, Coats and Kempthorne. They will be leaving us this year, also \nthrough their choice. We will miss them keenly. They have all made \ntremendous contributions to the work of the Armed Services Committee \nand to the national security of our country. Sometimes their ways were \nsimilar and sometimes they were different, but we are grateful for \ntheir contributions. I wanted to note that as we get to work on the \ndefense authorization bill.\n  The bill that we bring to the floor this morning is the product of \nseveral months of hard work by the Armed Services Committee. It is a \nlarge and complicated bill that could not have been produced without \nthe dedicated effort of our chairman, the other members of our \ncommittee and our staffs. I join Senator Thurmond in thanking our \nstaffs for their work.\n  While I don't agree with everything in this bill--none of us do or \never can in a bill this big and complicated--I think it will improve \nthe quality of life for the men and women in uniform and for their \nfamilies. It will continue the process of modernization of our Armed \nForces to meet the threats of the future.\n  Senator Thurmond has already summarized the provisions of the bill. I \nwill just highlight a few provisions that will make a significant \ncontribution to the national defense and to our men and women in \nuniform.\n  The bill contains a 3.1 percent pay raise for military personnel and \nauthorizes a number of bonuses to enhance our ability to recruit and \nretain quality men and women for our armed services.\n  The bill would authorize three health care demonstration projects \nthat would address concerns about gaps in the military health care \nsystem by requiring the Department of Defense to provide health care to \nretired military personnel and their families who are over 65 and \nMedicare-eligible.\n  The bill contains a bipartisan Defense Commercial Pricing Management \nImprovement Act, which would require the Department to address \nmanagement problems in sole-source buying practices.\n  The bill would provide funding for the U.S.-Canada environmental \nclean-up agreement, and for a new $24 million initiative for the \ndevelopment of pollution prevention technology.\n  Finally, the bill includes a series of other provisions that are \ndesigned to assist the Secretary of Defense in his effort to streamline \nour defense infrastructure and improve the Department's so-called \n``tooth-to-tail'' ratio. These provisions would require reductions in \nDOD headquarters staff; extend current personnel authorities available \nto the Department to assist in downsizing; encourage public-private \ncompetition in the provision of support services; require improvements \nin the Department's inventory management and financial management \nsystems; enable the Department to undertake needed reforms in travel \nmanagement and the movement of household goods; and require the \nDepartment to streamline its test and evaluation infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, the committee was presented with a dilemma on the Air \nForce's F-22 fighter program. Although there is broad support for \nachieving the revolutionary capability the F-22 program promises, a \nnumber of us remain concerned about the degree of overlap between \ndevelopment, testing, and production in the program. Four years ago, we \nexpected that 27 percent of the flight testing hours would have been \ncompleted before the Air Force signed a contract for the first \nproduction aircraft. Last year, that number had fallen to 14 percent. \nThis year, the committee was faced with the Air Force's plan of signing \na production contract with only four percent of the flight testing \ncompleted.\n  The bill would address this problem by making the long-lead funding \nfor the six F-22 aircraft in FY 2000 contingent upon certifications by \nthe Secretary of the Air Force that: (1) adequate flight testing has \nbeen conducted to address technical risk in the program; and (2) the \nfinancial benefits of going forward with the program exceed the \nfinancial risks.\n  I am also pleased that the bill contains a provision to encourage and \nfacilitate organ donation by service men and women. Organ donation \nrepresents, in my view, one of the most remarkable success stories in \nthe history of medicine. Over the past several years, the Department of \nDefense has made some strides in increasing the awareness among service \nmembers of the importance of organ donation. With our encouragement, \nDOD has included organ donation decisions in their automated medical \ndatabases, and established policies that give service members regular \nopportunities to state a desire to become organ donors upon their \ndeaths.\n  In an effort to enhance the value of these initiatives, the bill \nprovides the framework in which DOD will provide each new recruit and \nofficer candidate information about organ donation during their initial \nweeks of training, and will include organ donation procedures in the \ntraining of medical personnel and in the development of medical \nequipment and logistical systems. This initiative is likely to have a \nvital impact on the survival of countless individuals who will, one \nday, benefit from organs donated by service men and women.\n  From the beginning of the year, Secretary Cohen and the Joints Chiefs \nof Staff have stressed three things that they would like to achieve in \nthis bill:\n  First, they have requested authority to close excess military bases \nin order to fund their modernization priorities in the next decade;\n  Second, they have urged us not to undermine military training and \nreadiness by reducing operations and maintenance budgets; and\n  Third, they have urged us to provide the necessary funding to support \nU.S. military operations in Bosnia during FY 1999 in a manner that does \nnot cut into current levels of DOD funding.\n  I would say that the committee has achieved roughly one and a half of \nthese three goals.\n  First, the bill before us would authorize $1.9 billion for continued \nU.S. military operations in Bosnia, in the manner requested by the \nDepartment. I am sure that many Members will want to be heard on this \nsubject as we debate this bill. At the appropriate time I intend to \noffer my own amendment, which would ensure that the President reports \nto the Congress on progress toward achieving benchmarks toward \nimplementation of the Dayton Accord with an exit strategy and that the \nCongress has an opportunity to vote on the continued presence of U.S. \nground combat forces in Bosnia beyond June 30, 1999.\n  Second, the Armed Services Committee did a reasonable job of funding \ntraining and readiness, given the budgetary constraints under which we \nwere\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\noperating. Overall, the bill would reduce operations and maintenance \nfunding by roughly $300 million, but these cuts would be achieved \nthrough reductions for fuel savings, foreign currency fluctuations, and \ncivilian underexecution--which, if DOD's and CBO's predictions prove \nright, should not have a significant negative impact on military \ntraining and readiness.\n  On the other hand, the Secretary has asked us not to cut operations \nand maintenance accounts at all, because any cuts to these accounts \npose some risk of a negative impact on training and readiness. We have \nbeen hearing complaints for several years now that the Administration \nhas not provided adequate funding for military training and readiness. \nIf we are not able to increase the level of O funding in conference, \nthe cuts in this bill mean that Congress must share responsibility with \nthe Department of Defense for any training and readiness problems \nresulting from O funding shortfalls that DOD may experience in the \nnext year.\n  On the third point, I am deeply disappointed that the Armed Services \nCommittee has again filed to authorize a new base closure round, as \nrequested by the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nQuadrennial Defense Review, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The \nSecretary's Report on Base Closures from Secretary Cohen contains \nalmost 1,800 pages of backup material. It is responsive to those who \nsaid last year that we need a thorough analysis before we can reach a \ndecision on the need for more base closures.\n  The Report reaffirms that DOD still has more bases than it needs. \nFrom 1989 to 1997, DOD reduced total active duty military endstrength \nby 32 percent, a figure that will grow to 36 percent by 2003. Even \nafter 4 base closure rounds, the reduction in DOD's base structure in \nthe United States has been reduced only 21 percent.\n  DOD's analysis concluded that DOD has about 23 percent excess \ncapacity in its current base structure. For example, by 2003:\n  The Army will have reduced the personnel at its classroom training \ncommands by 43 percent, while classroom space will have been reduced by \nonly 7 percent.\n  The Air Force will have reduced the number of fighters and other \nsmall aircraft by 53 percent since 1989, while the base structure for \nthose aircraft will be only 35 percent smaller.\n  The Navy will have 33 percent more hangars for its aircraft than it \nrequires.\n  Secretary Cohen's report also documents the substantial savings that \nhave been achieved from past base closure rounds. Between 1990 and \n2001, DOD estimates that BRAC actions will produce a total of $13.5 \nbillion in net savings. After 2001, when all of the BRAC actions must \nbe completed, steady state savings will be $5.6 billion per year.\n  Based on the savings from the first four BRAC rounds, every year we \ndelay another base closure round, we deny the Defense Department, and \nthe taxpayers, about $1.5 billion in annual savings that we can never \nrecoup by studying to death the question of savings from previous \nrounds. In his report on base closures last month, Secretary Cohen \nstated: ``More than any other initiative we can take today, BRAC will \nshape the quality and strength of the forces protecting America in the \n21st century.'' General Shelton told our committee: ``I strongly \nsupport additional base closures. Without them we will not leave our \nsuccessors the warfighting dominance of today's force.''\n  Admiral Jay Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, stated:\n\n       This is more than about budgeting. It's about protecting \n     American interests, American citizens, American soldiers, \n     sailors, airmen, and Marines. We owe them the best force we \n     can achieve. Reducing excess infrastructure will help take us \n     there and is clearly a military necessity.\n\n  Mr. President, closing bases is a painful process. I know that as \nwell as anyone. All three Air Force bases in my state have been closed, \nand we are still working to overcome the economic blow to those \ncommunities. We have heard a lot of complaints in the last year about \ninadequate funds for modernization or for readiness. I am sure that we \nwill hear more such complaints in the next year. But we don't have much \nstanding to be critical of DOD for underfunding important defense needs \nif we don't allow them to do what Secretary Cohen and the Chiefs have \nrepeatedly said they need to do--close unneeded bases.\n  There are several other issues in the bill that concern me. I am \ndisappointed by the committee's cuts in the Department of Energy's \nstockpile stewardship program, which Secretary Pena says will have a \nreal and dramatic impact on our ability to maintain the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile and undermine confidence \nin our nuclear deterrent. I am disappointed by the cuts we have made in \nthe chemical demilitarization program, which may make it impossible for \nthe United States to comply with our obligations under the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. And I am disappointed that we have funded several \nweapons systems for which the Department of Defense says that it has no \ncurrent need. I look forward to amendments that will improve the bill \nin these and other areas in the course of our debate.\n  Mr. President, I know that there will be some vigorous debate on this \nbill, and I hope Senators will come to the floor and offer their \namendments so that we can complete Senate action on the bill in a \ntimely manner then go to conference with the House.\n  I must leave here for perhaps a half hour to an hour. I note that \nSenator Cleland will be floor managing the bill for this side of the \naisle. This is an important day for us. I know it is meaningful for \nhim, but it is an important day for us and for this institution, and \nfor this country to note that Senator Cleland, who is truly a hero for \nall of us, is now managing this bill. I can't think of anyone I would \nrather have do that, anyone in whom I have greater confidence to \nprotect this Nation's interest, as he always has, than Senator Cleland.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2399\n\n      (Purpose: To increase the amount for classified programs by \n$275,000,000, and to offset the increase by reducing the amount for Air \n  Force procurement for the Advance Medium Air-to-Air Missile System \n  program by $21,058,000, and by reducing the amount for Defense-wide \n    research, development, test, and evaluation for engineering and \n manufacturing development under the Theater High Area Defense program \n                            by $253,942,000)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for himself \n     and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 2399.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 103(2), strike out ``$2,375,803,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$2,354,745,000''.\n       In section 201(3), strike out ``$13,398,993,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$13,673,993,000''.\n       In section 201(4), strike out ``$9,837,764,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$9,583,822,000''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf \nof the Armed Services Committee.\n  This amendment implements an agreement between the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Intelligence Committee. Pursuant to this agreement, \nthe Armed Services Committee has agreed to reduce by $275 million funds \nin the pending bill for nonintelligence programs and to increase by \n$275 million funds for the next Foreign Intelligence Program, which is \nalso part of this bill.\n  The Armed Services Committee has considered the range and options for \nimplementing this agreement, all of which involve making difficult \nchoices to cut defense programs. After considerable deliberation, the \ncommittee has decided to reduce funding for the Theater High Altitude \nArea Defense Program by $250 million and the Advanced Medium Range Air-\nTo-Air Missile System by $21 million. These funds are now assigned to \nthese two programs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the DoD authorization bill, as reported, \nincludes a cut of some $550 million in classified intelligence \nprograms. I serve on both the Armed Services and the Intelligence \nCommittees. I am very aware of the tough choices that members of both \ncommittees have to make in discharging our respective responsibilities. \nHowever, I must say that the\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nmagnitude of this cut to intelligence programs disturbed me, as it did \nother members of the Committee.\n  Based on these concerns, the Committee agreed during the markup of \nthe Defense Authorization Bill to try to come to some compromise with \nthe Intelligence Committee that would reduce the magnitude of this \nreduction. This amendment restores $275 million of the original \nreduction made by the Committee. I am glad that we have worked together \nto achieve this outcome.\n  The bulk of the funds to increase the level of intelligence programs \nin this amendment comes from one particular program, the Theater High \nAltitude Area Defense, or THAAD program. The THAAD program is designed \nto meet a theater missile defense requirement. I have supported theater \nmissile defense programs like THAAD because we have a clear requirement \nfor theater missile defense systems.\n  The THAAD program has had a number of testing failures, and two days \nago, there was another unfortunate test failure in the program. Mr. \nPresident, this failure led the Committee to the conclusion that it \nwould be appropriate to adjust the fiscal year 1999 funding for the \nTHAAD system. While we do not know the full implications of this test \nfailure, it is clear that it would now be premature for the THAAD \nprogram to move from the demonstration/validation phase of the program \nto engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) next year as \nproposed in the fiscal year 1999 budget. The Committee amendment to the \nbill implementing the agreement with the Intelligence Committee \neliminates EMD funding for THAAD in fiscal year 1999, since it is \nunrealistic to expect THAAD to enter EMD during that period.\n  I must point out that the Committee is proposing that the Senate make \nthis adjustment without prejudice to the THAAD program. I believe that \nthe Committee will need to follow this program as we proceed to \nconference with the House on this bill. If it turns out that we need to \nadjust this position to one that is better for the underlying THAAD \nprogram, I will work with Chairman Thurmond to do just that.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to address the \ncommittee amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina and the \nSenator from Michigan. This amendment implements agreements made \nbetween the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee. \nPursuant to this agreement, the Armed Services Committee has agreed to \nreduce by $275 million funds in the pending bill for non-intelligence \nprograms, and to increase by $275 million funds for the National \nForeign Intelligence Program, which is also part of this bill.\n  The Armed Services Committee has considered a range of options for \nimplementing this agreement, all of which involve making difficult \nchoices to cut defense programs. After consideration deliberation, the \ncommittee has decided to reduce funding for the Theater High Altitude \nArea Defense (THAAD) program by $254 million and the Advanced Medium \nRange Air-to-Air Missile system by $21 million. The $21 million in \nAMRAAM is now excess to program requirements as a result of contract \nnegotiations between the Air Force and the contractor. The funding \nissue related to THAAD is more complex.\n  We have all heard the news of Tuesday's THAAD test failure. This was \nthe fifth time in a row that THAAD has filed to intercept a target. \nAlthough we don't have the details, we know that there was an \nelectrical failure in the booster which caused the missile to self-\ndestruct early in flight. Whatever impact this may have on the long-\nterm prospects for THAAD, judging by what we now know it appears that \nthe THAAD program will not be able to enter engineering and \nmanufacturing development (EMD) during fiscal year 1999.\n  In its markup of the Defense Authorization Bill, the committee \nexpressed concern that THAAD might not be able to spend all of its EMD \nbudget during fiscal year 1999 even if the recent flight test was a \nsuccess. Therefore, the markup included a reduction of $70 million in \nTHAAD EMD. This left $254 million in the THAAD EMD budget, $498 million \nin the THAAD Demonstration and Validation (Dem/Val) budget, for a total \nof $752 in fiscal year 1999 for THAAD.\n  With the recent test failure, however, it will be virtually \nimpossible for THAAD to enter EMD during fiscal year 1999, which means \nthat the remaining $254 million of THAAD EMD money cannot be spent.\n  I am very disappointed by the results of the THAAD test, but I \ncontinue to believe that this program is important and must be \npermitted to proceed. Therefore I believe that the Senate should \nsupport the full budget request of $497 million for THAAD demonstration \nand validation. Nonetheless, due to the circumstances that the THAAD \nprogram is now in, I believe the best course of action to take now is \nto disapprove funding for THAAD to enter EMD during FY99. I would \nremind the Senate that this would leave almost $500 million in the \nTHAAD program overall.\n  I would like to emphasize that I fully support the THAAD program and \nI would not have supported this reduction if I felt it would in any way \nhinder current progress on the program. The THAAD program is a critical \nupper-tier theater missile defense program that has encountered a \nsetback, but I have full confidence these programs can be corrected and \nthe program can move forward to its next test.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to on \nboth sides of the aisle. I now ask for a vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enz1). Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, our side supports the amendment. We think \nit is a good compromise. We think the staff and the committee did an \nexcellent job of putting this together. It was a difficult choice. But \nwe support the amendment.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The amendment (No. 2399) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now turn to Senator Coats for \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his recognition.\n  I want to also thank Senator Levin for the kind remarks he made about \nmy service on the committee. It has truly been an honor for me and a \nprivilege to serve for 10 years on the Armed Services Committee. I say \nwithout reservation that my service on that committee is the most \nenjoyable aspect of anything I have done in the U.S. Senate. It is a \ntruly bipartisan committee working for one purpose: To strengthen our \nArmed Forces, and to strengthen our national security, and to provide \nour men and women in uniform with the very best that we can under \nobviously difficult budget conditions.\n  It is the first responsibility of government to provide for the \ncommon defense. We are proud of the work that our men and women in \nuniform have done--their dedication, their commitment, their sacrifice, \ntheir loyalty, their duty, their honor--all virtues which are in short \nsupply in this country today. There are few institutions left that \nhonor those virtues. The military is one of them.\n  It has been a great pleasure for me over the past 10 years to be a \npart of that, to help shape those forces to address the needs and \nconcerns, to look to the future to see what is needed, and to hopefully \nput in place those programs and policies that will address those needs \nin the future. It has not been easy.\n  The decade of the 1980s was clearly a great time to be serving on \nthat committee. We had a challenging and important time. We had a \ndemonstrated need. We had a demonstrated bipartisan commitment to \naddress that need, and we had the resources to accomplish that. It all \nculminated in the most extraordinary and outstanding victory in the \nhistory of warfare. The United\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nStates' and the allies' performance in Desert Shield and Desert Storm \nwas revolutionary in terms of the way warfare is dictated.\n  I will never forget the debate that we had both in committee and on \nthe floor regarding what our participation should be in that situation, \nand the authorization for use of force, if necessary. Those were \ndifficult times. We feared significant loss of life. And yet, the \nmagnificent synergy of quality personnel, quality leadership, quality \nweapons, quality training, doctrine and command resulted in something \nthat was truly extraordinary: A decisive victory in a very short period \nof time with minimal loss of life and injury--creating a dominant \nmilitary the world has seldom witnessed in its history.\n  However, that was the culmination of the decade of the 1980s. Those \nwere decisions that were made during the 1980s in terms of how we \nstructure our forces, what kind of training and equipment we provide \nthem, how we develop our leadership, and how we bring all of that \ntogether. The 1990s have been a different story. It has been a time of \nbudget constraints. It has been a time of very significant cutbacks, a \ntime of rejoicing over the fall of the Berlin Wall, over the fall of \nthe Iron Curtain, the demise of a nuclear superpower that was \nchallenging us for world superiority, not that we were looking for \nthat, but that it was a triumph of an idea, a triumph of an idea of \nfreedom, the concept of freedom, and an economic concept of free \nenterprise over totalitarianism and Marxism. That, obviously, led to \nmajor changes in the way we structured our defense.\n  The decade of the 1990s has been a transition period, a period in \nwhich budget limitations have driven very significant changes, a period \nin which the Department of Defense has contributed more to the \nelimination of deficit spending than perhaps all of the other aspects \nof Government combined. The little-told story about why we now have a \nsurplus with our budget, why we have been able to control Government \nspending, is the contribution of the Department of Defense to that \nachievement. That contribution has overwhelmed all other contributions \nput together. The roughly 30-percent to 40-percent declines in spending \nin real dollars, the substantial downsizing of the military, the \nsubstantial downsizing in procurement, the substantial savings that \nhave been achieved over what we would have had to spend had we \nmaintained our military defense spending at the level of the 1980s, has \nmade the most significant contribution to deficit reduction. And we \nshouldn't forget that fact. That has happened with a truly bipartisan \neffort.\n  So it has been a joy for me to work with my colleagues, Republican \nand Democrat, on these issues. Have we had differences of opinion? Yes. \nHave we had difficult debates? Closed-door debates? Yes. But in the end \nwe have always forged a consensus, and we have done so because foremost \nin our minds was providing for the common defense in an effective way \nand looking out for the needs and the interests of our service \npersonnel.\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly comment on the fiscal year 1999 \ndefense authorization bill that has just come out of committee and that \nwe are addressing here on the floor. First of all, I want to start with \nquality of life and briefly touch on that.\n  I served for 4 years as ranking member and 2 years as chairman of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee.\n  While I still serve on that committee, I no longer am chairman. I \nwill leave much of the details of what that committee has done to \nSenator Kempthorne and the ranking member. However, I view this as the \nNo. 1 priority of the committee in establishing our budget because no \nweapon, no doctrine, no training manual, nothing can take the place of \nquality personnel. And so our goal has been to attract the very best we \ncan, to retain those personnel, and to provide them with the essentials \nof what they need, and to provide for them a standard of living that is \ncommensurate with their sacrifice.\n  Let me say that no standard of living that we can provide is \ncommensurate with the kind of hours and the kind of sacrifice and the \nkind of commitments that are made by our military personnel, but we try \nto do the best we can. Over the years they have been shortchanged in \nterms of housing. They have been shortchanged in terms of pay. And they \nhave been shortchanged in terms of benefits. We have tried to make up \nfor some of that. It is certainly better than it was but nowhere equal \nto the kind of commitment and the demands that we ask of our military \npersonnel. Yet, day after day, year after year, they continue to \nprovide the kind of effort and the kind of service that is unheard of \nin the private sector, and we owe them a great debt of gratitude as a \nNation. It means that we need to keep their pay consistent with pay on \nthe outside.\n  Today, we are attempting to attract people who are skilled in \ntechnical areas, who have the capacity and the capability and the \ntraining and the experience to employ today's modern military equipment \nusing today's advanced operational concepts. It is not just simply foot \nsoldiers carrying heavy loads, walking through the mud, although that \nwill always be an essential part of our military as it needs to be. But \nit is that foot soldiers and everyone else involved in our military are \ntoday operating very sophisticated, modern equipment. They need to \nthink on their feet. They need to have capabilities in terms of \ninformation processing, in terms of utilizing the latest in \ntechnologies, in weapons and computers and information sources that are \ncommensurate with what is needed in the private sector.\n  And so we have to have the incentives in place, and pay in place to \nallow us to compete, and to attract and to retain these personnel.\n  In that regard, we have provided in this bill a 3.1-percent pay raise \nfor military personnel. We also provide an increase of $500 million in \nmilitary construction projects, $164 million of which will fund \nbarracks, dining facilities, and military housing. If there is a \nshortfall in terms of what we have done for our troops over the years, \nit is military housing. Much of it, nearly two-thirds of military \nhousing is substandard, substandard by military code, military, not \ncommercial standards --and the military standards in many cases are not \nup to the same level as private standards--and yet year after year we \nask our military families to live in this housing. It is inadequate \nhousing, it is substandard housing, and they do so without complaint. \nWe owe it to them, to the single soldiers and airmen and marines, men \nand women, and to their families. We owe it to them to give them \naffordable, decent housing.\n  We are underway with an initiative that was started by Secretary \nPerry to, in many cases, privatize or leverage the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to utilize private contractors to provide \nmilitary housing in arrangements which allow us to make maximum use of \nthe funds we have, to leverage those funds in the way that the private \nsector leverages their money to address this housing shortfall, and so \nwe are underway with that.\n  Health care is another major issue. I won't go into that. I will let \nSenator Kempthorne address that. This is a major concern of our \nmilitary personnel, something that needs to be addressed. We are in the \ntransition period with that also, and there are many questions that \nneed to be answered. We attempt to do some of that in this bill \nincluding the direction of three health care demonstrations for our \nmilitary retirees who are Medicare eligible: one related to FEHBP; one \nrelated to TRICARE; and one related to mail order pharmacy benefits. I \nsupport these initiatives, but more needs to be done.\n\n  Let me now talk about readiness. The bill also adds over $400 million \nto the readiness account levels requested in the President s budget for \nour Active and Reserve Forces. We are all aware of the demand on \nreadiness with our commitments overseas--Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, \nto name just two, and there are many, many more. These are stretching \nour capacity. These are costly. They affect our readiness and our \nability to sustain the preparedness of the force. And we need to \nunderstand that this is a major concern which should be continually \nmonitored and addressed by the Congress.\n  I want to focus most of my comments, though, Mr. President, on the \nmodernization question. For years we have deferred modernization of our\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\nweapons systems and of our equipment--trucks, radios, and basic \nequipment. We have deferred that modernization because we have not had \nthe resources available to fund quality of life, readiness, all other \naspects of our national defense such as research and development, as \nwell as the modernization of weapon platforms and systems.\n  Now, this underfunding of modernization was done with the \nunderstanding that by fiscal year 1998, which we are now in, and we are \ndealing with the 1999 fiscal year with this budget, we will have ended \nthis pause where we have downsized our modernization spending by as \nmuch as 70 percent over previous levels. And the understanding, the \npromise, was that this administration would bring procurement back to \nat least a $60 billion a year procurement level in fiscal year 1998 in \norder to replace aging tanks, aging planes, and aging equipment. This \nis what was originally programmed and projected. Not all of us thought \nthat was attainable. We thought that we were doing less than we should. \nWe were able to secure some funds to plus-up some of that modernization \nin the past but at levels far below what was recommended to us by \nexperts outside the military and by military personnel who were looking \nat this question.\n  Well, here we are with an increased modernization budget but still at \na $50 billion level, not the $60 billion level we were supposed to have \nachieved last year. So, again, modernization accounts remain on the \nmargin. We are unable to modernize in a way that we believe is most \neffective from a cost standpoint and from a requirements standpoint. We \nhave increased procurement in some areas. And I think we appreciate the \nability to gain some extra funds for that, but I just want our \ncolleagues to know there is no basis on which to come to this floor and \ncriticize the Armed Services Committee for spending too much on new \nsystems. We are still spending too little on the modernization of our \nmilitary forces. We are below what the Department of Defense has told \nus, well below what they have told us is required to replace the aging \nweapons systems that we currently use, and recapitalize our joint \nwarfighting capabilities.\n  Several of these modernization issues come through my committee. I am \nprivileged to chair the Airland Committee. Let me just talk about some \nof these major procurement items.\n  First, the land portion of this--land power. The committee has held \nhearings on land power, and we are pleased to note that the Marine \nCorps advances in urban warfare experiments and revolutionary \nexpeditionary capabilities with the MV22 and the AAAV seem to be on \nschedule. They are important in the future.\n  We are also pleased that the Army is moving forward to consolidate \ngains it has learned from its Force XXI process. And that the Army says \nit is investigating the transformation to the faster, smaller, more \nlethal and more deployable force structure it will need in the 21st \nCentury. But the Army's modernization strategy to pursue this \nmodernization is short particularly in some of the less glamorous areas \nof aviation, armored vehicles, and trucks. The committee has added \nprovisions which address these issues. Again, there is not as much \nprocurement for landpower as we would like, but at least we are moving \nin the right direction.\n  I want to say, Mr. President, that we have also made some very \nsignificant progress in this whole question of addressing Reserve \ncomponent modernization. Thanks to the fine work of Senator Glenn in \nparticular, and committee and staff, we have for the very first time \nstructured what I believe is a coherent process in determining Guard \nand Reserve procurement. For the first time, the budget request by the \nDepartment has included a substantial amount of funds for National \nGuard and Reserve procurement--a $1.4 billion level, which is a 50-\npercent increase over last year. Our mark adds to this another $700 \nmillion.\n  But the important point to note here is that all of the additions \nthat we have added for the Army Guard were requested by the Army Chief \nof Staff, including Blackhawk helicopters to enhance tactical airlift, \nnew and remanufactured trucks that improve our transportation \ncapabilities and reduce operating costs, and radios that enable the \nGuard to integrate with the Active Army's tactical internet. Clearly, \nthe Senate's bipartisan efforts in this regard have had a very positive \neffect on the whole concept of total force integration.\n  As we look at limited defense budgets on and over the horizon, and as \nwe look at ways in which we assess the threats of the future, and at \nour ability to deploy, and at the cost of those overseas deployments, \nand at our ability to preposition equipment, and at, perhaps, the \ndenial of access to facilities overseas--to landing strips, sea ports, \nand bases--we need total force integration across our Active Army, and \nour Army Reserves, and our Army National Guard. And in order to \naccomplish that, we need to dispense with the former practice of making \nthe Guard and Reserve budget requests a secondary priority to that of \nthe Active Army, but to make them an integral part of the budget \nrequest sent over from the Department of Defense. The Department needs \nto assess what the Reserve components need, and they need to tell us \nthat in the budget request, and then we need to look at that as an \nintegrated requirement, rather than as two separate entities.\n  We have begun, under the prodding of the SASC, that process of total \nforce integration and taken a significant step forward this year. I \ncommend the Department for doing that and we need to do more for total \nforce integration in the future.\n  Let me talk about TACAIR, tactical aircraft. We have held a number of \nhearings on TACAIR to assess the status of the F/A18-E/F, Super Hornet \nand the F-22 Raptor. The Navy and the Director for Operational Test and \nEvaluation provided their assessment that the Super Hornet's, the F/\nA18-E/F, the wing-drop and buffeting issues have been fixed, and that \nthe program should proceed with production as planned. This \nauthorization supports those funds requested for the F/A18-E/F.\n  These issues with the Super Hornet were not as serious as many had \nthought. They were, really, reported as being more serious than they \nwere. However, they were issues that needed to be addressed. The \nDepartment of the Navy and the contractors have successfully addressed \nthese issues, and I am pleased that the F/A18-E/F program will proceed \nas planned.\n  Now, let me speak about the F-22. Last year I spoke on the floor at \nlength about my concerns with F-22 cost overruns and demonstrated \nperformance. And I want to state for the record here, up front, I \naddress these issues as a supporter of F-22 development, not as a \ncritic of the F-22. And I spoke last year because was concerned that if \nwe don't keep our arms around this issue and keep a good, clear \noversight of the issue, the F-22 may run into very serious problems in \nterms of funding and in terms of support for that funding. And I don't \nwant to jeopardize that. Based on the testimony of the Air Force and \nthe assessment of the General Accounting Office and other entities, \nthere are many who share a deep concern over whether or not we can \nmaintain support for the F-22 if costs continue to escalate toward $200 \nmillion per aircraft. So we need, and we ask for, adequate \ndemonstration of performance and cost control.\n  The bill that is before us authorizes the requested F-22 funding \nlevels. I want to repeat that. The bill before us, for those who are \nsupporters of F-22--and there are many here, because it is a marvelous \nnew leap-ahead technology that is important for our national security \nand our national defense in the future--many support this marvelous new \ndevelopment in technology that is going to provide the basis for Air \nForce air dominance capabilities in TACAIR for many, many years in the \nfuture. We have authorized every penny that has been requested for next \nyear's budget in order to continue developing the F-22. But we have put \nsome key oversight provisions in place that will help the Congress and \nhelp the administration keep the program on track. And the reason we \nhave done this is because there is a great deal in jeopardy if we don't \ndo that.\n\n  Several things could happen if we cannot control F-22 costs, none of \nwhich are good. One, we could end up treating F-22 as we ended up \ntreating B-2, another leap-ahead technology that provided us with one \nof the most\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\namazing developments in long-range strategic aircraft that any nation \nhas ever enjoyed. But we ended up producing far fewer than what we had \nplanned because the cost per copy had escalated so high we just simply \ncouldn't afford to produce more. While the threat today doesn't \nnecessarily justify additional B-2s, the threat of tomorrow could and \nwe won't have those planes. We don't want that to happen to the F-22.\n  Second, we could lose support for other key systems that are \nnecessary to provide for our future defense needs, such as carriers, \nComanche, V-22. We could jeopardize those systems if the cost overruns \nfor F-22 escalate to the point where we are spending more money on that \nprogram, and we have to take it from somewhere else. And I am afraid we \nwould have to take it from these key and necessary weapons platforms \nthat we require in the future.\n  Or third, we could lose the ability to produce what we need of the \nJoint Strike Fighter. The Joint Strike Fighter is the complement to the \nF-22 that is coming on at a later date. It is currently in its early \nstages of its engineering and manufacturing development, and we could \njeopardize this program if F-22 costs grow. The reason why we cannot \nallow that to happen is that the Navy and the Marines are absolutely \ndepending on the Joint Strike Fighter to provide stealth and to address \ntheir other TACAIR needs for the future, just as the Air Force is \ndepending on F-22 to address their needs.\n  In fact, the Marine Corps has staked their entire TACAIR future on \nJoint Strike Fighter. So we have to be careful that we preserve our \nability to go forward with the conventional variant, the carrier \nvariant, and the short take-off / vertical land (STO/VL) variant of the \nJSF. And that is why we have placed some prudent oversight provisions \non F-22.\n  Here is what we have done and here is why we did it. When we reviewed \nthe F-22 program, the Air Force planned F-22 flight tests beginning in \nMay of 1997 with a contract award for the Lot I production scheduled in \nJune 1999. Lot 1 is the first two production planes, which are followed \nby a Lot 2 of six aircraft. And this gets a little esoteric here--they \nplanned for that contract award for June of 1999 when there would be \n601 hours of flight testing complete, which is 14 percent of the total \nflight-test program.\n  The 14 percent is an important threshold because the Defense Science \nBoard Report of 1995 on the F-22 production noted that most of the \n``program killer''--how they describe it, ``program killer'' problems \nare usually discovered in the first 10 to 20 percent of developmental \nflight tests.\n  Our experience in the past has demonstrated that somewhere in that \n10- to 20-percent range we find the kind of problems that can \npotentially terminate or cause major modifications to the technical \nspecifications of the program that are so significant they don't \njustify the expense to go forward and fix the problem. You almost have \nto go back to page 1 of the program, and obviously that puts it in \ngreat jeopardy. So we were concerned that before we execute a contract \nfor production, we reach a threshold level of testing, flight testing \nthat would give us some assurance that executing that contract would be \nwise--a wise business decision, and a decision in the best interests of \nour taxpayers, but also in line with our defense needs before we \nexecuted that contract.\n  Unfortunately, this F-22 flight testing program has had to slip. The \nfirst flight was nearly 4 months late. Instead of May of 1997, it was \nin September 1997. Another test flight had to be canceled. To date, \nonly 3 hours of flight time have been accumulated. In addition, the \nprogram is experiencing manufacturing delays of up to five months. And \nwe have already had the previous assessment of a Joint Evaluation Team \nof Air Force and industry experts that concluded the F-22 program would \nsignificantly exceed its cost estimates and that it should be \nrestructured to reduce risk. This caused us to reallocate a very \nsignificant amount of funds, $2.2 billion, to get the program back on \nsound footing.\n  Yet, despite all these problems, the Air Force wants to move the \ncontract award not back, not to keep it at the same level, but to move \nit forward 6 months when the program hopes to have only 4 percent of \nits flight testing\n  We have had a lot of debate about this. We have had hearings. We have \nheard from the contractors. We have heard from the Air Force. We have \nheard from outside witnesses. We have heard from experts. We have \ndebated among ourselves. And I believe we have reached an acceptable \nconsensus as to how we ought to address this particular problem.\n  We need to address it because the obvious answer, the first answer \nthat comes to mind, is, ``Well, let's just delay; let's just delay \nuntil they get to 14 percent.'' I wish it were that easy. Delay means \nthat the prime contractors have to cease a schedule of lining up \nsubcontractors, of establishing production lines, of hiring workers--a \nmyriad of tasks that have to be accomplished, people who have to be \nhired, procedures that have to be put in place--and that delay costs a \ngreat deal of money and can break the production base of the program.\n  We have had this very complicated schedule to put together. We are \ntalking about one of the most complex and difficult development \nprocesses and production processes that anybody can imagine. This \ninvolves a great deal of effort, time, and cost. To delay that incurs \nconsiderable risk and considerable cost.\n  By the same token, going forward without adequate testing produces a \ngreat deal of risk--risk that the F-22 will not turn out as we hope it \nturns out, risk that the flight testing between the current level, the \n4-percent level, or the 14-percent level will turn up something that is \na showstopper, that is a ``program killer.'' So we are trying to \nbalance this risk against the cost of delay.\n  In addition to this, there has been a very complex set of \nnegotiations that have taken place with the Air Force and the \ncontractor, in particular, that imposes a fixed-price contract for \nthese initial production aircraft. The Air Force states: ``This is all \nthe money you are going to get. No matter what problems come up, we're \nnot going to give you more, so you have to operate under the fixed-\nprice contract.''\n  The contractor comes back and says: ``Well, if we have to operate \nunder the fixed-price contract, you can't delay the contract, because \nthere is no way we can meet the goal of producing what you want us to \nproduce at the time you want us to produce it under the cost cap that \nyou have imposed on us if you delay the contract and production \nprocess.''\n  So all of this has to be put into the mix and a decision must be made \nin terms of how we proceed.\n  This is what we decided to do: No. 1, we are going to approve the \nbudget request for the full funding of continued development for the F-\n22. However, we are going to put what we call a fence--that is, we are \ngoing to put some of the what we call long lead money, money that is \ngoing to be spent in the future on items that allow us to prepare for \nproduction--we are going to put that money in a category which says it \nwill not be released for expenditure until a couple of things happen.\n  First of all, I need to point out, we are going to go ahead and \nproduce and buy the Lot I series of F-22 which consists of two \naircraft. We are going to keep that on schedule. There are no \nrestraints on that, no holds, no fences, no conditions. This is \nunderway. We need to proceed. We are going to buy those first two \nplanes.\n  Lot II consists of the next six planes. What we are going to do is \nsay that advance procurement of lot II F-22s, the next six aircraft, \ncannot commence until we reach a threshold level of 10 percent of \ntesting, which is the minimum that was specified by the Defense Science \nBoard back in 1995--not the 14 percent, but the 10 percent. Remember, \nthey gave us the range of 10 to 20 percent. We thought 14 percent was \nan adequate number. We are going to drop that down to 10 percent. That \nis the minimum. So there is still risk, and we are trying to minimize \nrisk and balance risk against cost.\n\n  We are going to fence that money until 10 percent of testing is \ncomplete or until the Secretary of Defense certifies to us that a \nlesser amount of flight testing is sufficient and provides his \nrationale and analysis for that certification. And we are also \nrequiring the Secretary to certify that it is financially advantageous \nto proceed to\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nLot II production, aircraft three through eight, rather than wait for \ncompletion of the 10 percent of the currently planned test schedule.\n  That last portion is something Senator Levin suggested. The first \nportion is what I suggested. The two together, I believe, form a good \nbasis for us to impose upon the Secretary of Defense a certification \nand verification process that provides us the necessary assurance that \nthey have kept their eyes on the program, have determined through \ntesting that if that level is 8, 8\\1/2\\, 9 or 9\\1/2\\, that is \nsufficient. There is no magic to the 10-percent number. Again, it was \nselected because the Defense Science Board set it as its minimum. \nHowever, we have new production techniques, we have new manufacturing \nprocesses in place for this plane, which have never been done before. \nAnd if we can, through simulation, if we can, through other procedures, \ndetermine that we have adequate information relative to the performance \nand capabilities of this plane to go into production at a lower level \nof demonstrated performance, then the Secretary can certify that for \nus.\n  He can't do that if the flight testing is less than 4 percent. We \nhave to get to at least that level. Of course, that is the level \nsuggested to us by the Air Force as necessary, and that is the level \nthey currently plan to achieve before contract award. Those are the \nnecessary flight test hours that are required to move up the contract \naward 6 months.\n  Those are the committee's efforts to try to balance risk with excess \ncost for delay and put in place a process that will give us the \nopportunity to have the oversight and to force the Secretary of Defense \nto keep his focus on the F-22 program and on any kind of cost \nescalation that might jeopardize the program.\n  We have reached this accord with the significant help of members on \nboth sides of the committee. The committee was unanimous, Republicans \nand Democrats--unanimous--that this is the procedure that we ought to \nput in place. So there is complete bipartisan support for this effort.\n  I am urging my colleagues, and I have already had discussions with \nsome of our House colleagues about why this is important. This should \nnot be an item for compromise. We have made some very, very tough \ndecisions here.\n  Mr. President, in moving away from TACAIR, let me talk for a moment \nabout defense transformation, something Senator Lieberman and I have \nworked on diligently in the past several years. I am pleased he has \njoined me on the floor, and I know we will hear from him about this \nwhen I am finished.\n  Defense transformation is, I think, a necessary process to address \nthe threats of the future and to have the capability to deal with those \nthreats. What happens under defense transformation will bear fruit 10 \nor 15 or 20 or more years from now. Just as the astounding success of \nDesert Storm was the result of decisions made in the late seventies and \nthroughout the eighties, the successes that we can achieve in \naddressing threats of the future in the year 2014 or the year 2020 or \nbeyond will be determined by the decisions that are made today, and in \n2001, and 2003, and 2007.\n  Those decisions--in terms of the kind of platforms and equipment that \nwe purchase, in terms of the kind of doctrine that we develop to \naddress those new threats, in terms of the kind of forces that we \nstructure, in terms of the kind of assessments that we make of those \nthreats and the response to those threats --those decisions will be \nmade now and in the next several years. And we will understand the \nsignificance of that well beyond the time that most of us will still be \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  But we owe it to the future--just as those who made the decisions in \nthe late 1970s and in the 1980s provided for the future success of our \nnational defense strategy in the late 1980s and 1990s--we owe it to the \nfuture and future generations to make the right decisions now.\n  We know that the threats of the future will be different than the \nthreats of the past. Few, if any, tyrants or dictators or world leaders \nwill ever again amass forces in a desert situation and line them up in \ntraditional warfare and take on the capabilities that the United States \ndemonstrated during the Gulf War.\n  No dictator is going to pour tens and hundreds of billions of dollars \ninto building the kind of defense structure that the United States \nannihilated in Desert Storm. They are going to be looking at different \ntypes of threats, threats that we call asymmetric, not what is typical, \nnot what we expect, not the war of the past, but the war of the future.\n  Historians will tell you that those who fight wars based on the last \nwar lose the next war--because their adversaries are always adjusting, \nalways evaluating and transforming. We saw that with Blitzkrieg; we saw \nthat in naval aviation and a number of ways throughout history. The \nlast thing we want to do is maintain the status quo, because the status \nquo will not be adequate to address threats of the future. So defense \ntransformation is necessary. It is necessary to prepare us for the \nfuture. But how do we transform our military capabilities?\n  The Armed Services Committee has focused on this issue. A couple of \nyears ago we authorized what we call the Quadrennial Defense Review \n(QDR). It simply means once every 4 years there is a review of the \nthreats, and the processes and capabilities we have put in place as the \nmeans by which we address those threats. This QDR was an internal \nprocess. It was a process that takes place within the Department of \nDefense.\n  We believe there needs to be an ongoing, continuing process, a \ncontinual update and assessment of the threat, and how we address that \nthreat, and what changes need to be made, and what structures need to \nbe imposed in order to successfully address those threats in the \nfuture.\n  With that, we combined the QDR with a process which we labeled the \nNational Defense Panel (NDP). It was a selection of outside experts who \ntook a look at the same situation, a second opinion, if you will. Faced \nwith a serious disease, people should--and I think in most cases do--\nget a second opinion. We don't just go to the very first doctor and \nsay, ``Well, that sounds good. Let's go ahead.'' And we should treat \nour national security the same way. ``This is so serious, potentially \nlife threatening, I want a second opinion before I make a decision.'' \nThe NDP was our second opinion, but it was an outside opinion.\n  We worked closely with Secretary Perry, Deputy Secretary White, and \nothers to fashion how we select these individuals for the NDP, and how \nwe put this process together. It was led by Phil Odeen, chairman of the \nNational Defense Panel, and with distinguished and recognized outside \nthinkers, experts, and experienced people with military background and \ntraining.\n  That panel produced an extraordinary report which ought to be one of \nthe blueprints for the future. We have combined this external NDP \nprocess with the internal QDR process to try to lay out an assessments \nof where we are, where we are going, and how we will get there. Our \ndefense authorization bill this year includes a sense of the Congress \non a key process at the foundation of fulfilling some of these \nrequirements--the designation of a combatant commander who has the \nmission of developing, preparing, conducting, and assessing a process \nof joint warfare experimentation.\n\n  This joint warfighting experimentation is at the foundation of this \nwhole defense transformation. Basically, what this process says is that \nbefore we rush into what Senator Coats or Senator Lieberman or the \nArmed Services Committee, or even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs or \nthe Secretary of Defense, thinks is the direction we ought to go, let \nus test it, let us test some ideas, let us experiment, let us look at \nhow we develop all of this, let us take the good ideas and throw out \nthe bad, let us not just commit to something that turns out 4 or 5 \nyears from now to be the wrong item or the wrong direction.\n  Secretary Cohen is reviewing currently, for his signature, a charter \nwhich would assign the mission of joint warfighting experimentation to \na combatant commander, the Commander in Chief of US Atlantic Command \n(USACOM) in Norfolk. We have met with Secretary Cohen. And we met with \nGeneral Shelton and Admiral Gehman, the CINC of USACOM. They\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nhave worked with us to craft this language. We have their full support.\n  We are not going forward here thinking that we know all the answers \nto these issues. We are not the experts. We have some ideas and we \nwould like to move them forward. And we have bounced them off the \nDepartment. And we have worked together. And we have structured \nsomething which we agree on. I visited USACOM. I visited their joint \ntraining and simulation center, and their joint battle lab. And I can \nreport, Mr. President, that progress is being made to develop the \nfoundation for this joint experimentation process.\n  The Senate, I believe, has been keenly aware of the need to transform \nour military capabilities to address the potentially very different \nchallenges we are going to face in the future. The National Defense \nPanel report argues that these challenges--which include things such as \nchallenges in power projection, information operations, and weapons of \nmass destruction--can place our security at far greater risk than what \nwe face today.\n  Correspondingly, the NDP recommended establishing this combatant \ncommand which will drive the transformation of our military \ncapabilities through this process of joint experimentation. The NDP \ntestified that the need for this joint experimentation process is \n``absolutely critical'' and ``urgent.'' I am pleased that the \nDepartment of Defense has been so cooperative in working with us in \nhelping to establish this new mission for a command and this new \nprocess. The resounding consensus from several hearings on defense \ntransformation that we have held in the committee support the \ncombination of joint and service experimentation as the foundation for \nthe transformation of military capabilities to address the operational \nchallenges of the future.\n  So we are taking joint and service experimentation, and combining our \nefforts, those best efforts and forces of our services and of our \nunified commanders, along with individual service experimentation \ninitiatives--Force XXI, Sea Dragon--and a whole number of other joint \nand individual service processes, and looking at ways in which we take \nthe very best insights as the basis for developing our capabilities for \nthe future.\n  This process of experimentation is designed to investigate the co-\nevolution of advances in technology, with changes in the organizational \nstructure of our forces, and with the development of new operational \nconcepts. The purpose of joint experimentation is to determine those \ntechnologies, those organizations, and those concepts which will \nprovide a leap-ahead in joint warfighting capability. Just as we are \nlooking to leap-ahead technologies in platforms, aircraft carriers, \njoint strike fighters, et cetera, we are looking for leap-ahead \ndevelopment in concepts, and in doctrine, and in force structure.\n  As I said earlier, it is just as important to select winners as it is \nto determine losers. Under joint experimentation, failure can be a \nvirtue. We know everything will not be a success. We do not want to \nreward failure, but we want to recognize failure as important to \ndetermining what works and what does not. The worst thing we could do \nis make a commitment to a major change in doctrine, operational \nconcepts, weapon systems, or force structure only to find out that it \ndoes not address the relevant threats of the future. It is through \nexperimentation that we can distinguish the true leap-aheads in \ncapability, from those that fall short.\n  Identifying these failures will be just as important to our achieving \nsuccess in transformation, as identifying the leap-aheads themselves \nbecause it will allow us, in a time of limited budget, to deploy and to \nutilize our resources in the most effective way.\n  We cannot afford to do what we did in the 1980s. The threat was so \ngreat, the work that we had to do was so needed, the status of our \ndefense forces and our national security was so at risk, that we had to \nrisk failure to determine success. But we had the budget to accommodate \nthis failure if we had to. We had the budget to experiment and still \ndevelop all the potential systems. We don't have that luxury anymore. \nWe don't have the kind of funds that were available in the 1980s. \nTherefore, we must be selective. And therefore we must have a process \nwhich allows us to determine what is the wisest course of action to \ntake.\n  Mr. President, previously in our history this country has found \nitself unprepared for the threats we have faced at the outset of war. \nWith God's grace and with the magnificent commitment and response of \nthe American people, we have always rallied to eventually overcome \nthese threats to our freedom.\n  That was always done at a cost, not only the fiscal cost to the \ntaxpayer, but the cost in terms of the lives of young people who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our country. We are currently contemplating \nthe construction of a World War II memorial down on The Mall. It will \njoin the Vietnam memorial. It will join a tribute to the Korean war. It \nwill join other monuments to wars that this country has fought which \nought to sober all of us and remind us of the tremendous cost we had to \npay in order to secure and maintain our freedom, and to provide freedom \nfor millions of people around the world.\n  Previously in this nation's history, we have found ourselves \nunprepared for the threats we faced at the outset of war. Because we \nwere unprepared, we were vulnerable. Because we were vulnerable, we \nwere exploited. And we had no choice but to respond. We did so, but we \ndid so often at a terrible cost. It was worth the cost because we have \nmaintained our freedom and we enjoy that freedom today. But we \ndesperately want to learn from our history how to avoid those \ncircumstances. And the tragedy that we should have learned is that \nbeing unprepared for the threats we face at the outset of conflict \nresults in the need to build significant memorials to those who \nsacrifice their lives, and to those whose lives were correspondingly \nchanged forever--those families, those relatives, those friends. All \nthis because we failed to prepare for the relevant threats that \nconfront us.\n  We desperately want to avoid this situation. We know we will be \nfacing different threats in the future. We know that the way we are \ncurrently constituted doesn't necessarily prepare us to address those \nthreats successfully. Obviously, the most successful thing we can do is \nensure we are never vulnerable to be exploited in the first place--to \nbe so prepared and to be so strong that no adversary desires to take us \non. For us to achieve this preparedness, it is going to take a \ntransformation in thinking. And it is going to take a transformation in \nstructuring our military forces and in our operational concepts for us \nto be prepared to address the threats of the future. The joint \nexperimentation program is one piece of the puzzle in terms of how we \ntransform our capabilities to do that, and this bill supports that \neffort. In short, joint experimentation is essential to ensuring that \nour Armed Forces are prepared to address the security challenges of the \n21st century.\n  In conclusion--I have taken a long time--the bill makes great strides \nin improving quality of life, readiness, and modernization of the \nforce. And this bill also lays the framework for the transformation of \ndefense capabilities to address the operational challenges envisioned \nin the 21st century.\n  I want to acknowledge and thank the distinguished service of our \nchairman, Senator Thurmond, who has provided such diligence and \ntremendous effort as chairman of this committee. He has been a member \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee for nearly 40 years. This will \nmark his last defense authorization bill as chairman of the committee. \nHe will always be chairman in our hearts, and chairman emeritus of that \ncommittee, and will continue to make significant contributions. What a \nprivilege it has been for this Senator to serve under this \ndistinguished leadership of this distinguished member who has given so \nmuch to this committee!\n\n  I also thank Senator Glenn for his support and stewardship of defense \nissues in this, our last defense authorization bill. People have said, \n``What has happened to our heroes in this country?'' John Glenn is a \ngenuine American hero--first to orbit the Earth, and now, at the age of \n77, at the termination of a distinguished Senate career, he will climb \nback in the shuttle and orbit the Earth once again. I think that is one \nof the most remarkable achievements of this century. And we recognize \nhim for that.\n  Senator Levin, as ranking member, has made an outstanding \ncontribution\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nto our efforts. Many others, up and down the committee, have also \nplayed very significant roles in this. Again, I say this is a truly \nbipartisan effort.\n  Finally, without the support of our staff, this could not have been \naccomplished: Les Brownlee, staff director; and his counterpart David \nLyles as minority staff director; our committee staff, Steve Madey and \nJohn Barnes who have been so helpful to me on the Airland Subcommittee; \nCharlie Abell, who I think is on the floor here, was so helpful to me \nduring my time as Personnel Subcommittee chairman.\n  My personal staff--Frank Finelli, Pam Sellars, Bruce Landis, Sharon \nSoderstrom, and others--has been so helpful. I couldn't do it without \ntheir help.\n  And in closing, I wish to state that this defense bill has my full \nsupport, and I strongly encourage all members to support it.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in that regard, I ask unanimous consent \nBruce Landis, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges \nthroughout the consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nIndiana. First, he has delivered a magnificent address on the \nimportance of the Armed Services Committee work and defense in general.\n  Next, I want to commend him for the long, faithful service he has \nrendered to this committee. I don't know of any member of the committee \nthat has worked harder and has stood stronger for defense and has been \nmore knowledgeable in accomplishing what we have been able to do than \nthe able Senator from Indiana. He is truly an expert on armed services \nmatters. I wish him well in all that he does in the future.\n  I regret that he has seen fit not to run again. We will miss him \nhere. A vacuum will be created. It will be hard to fill. He is such a \nfine man, such a knowledgeable man, and such a dedicated man. I want \nhim to know that our country appreciates what he has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent floor privileges \nbe granted to John Jennings, a fellow in my office, during the pendency \nof this defense bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal \nyear 1999 defense authorization bill.\n  I do want to add my own voice to those who have offered thanks and \npraise to the leadership of our committee, the distinguished chairman, \nthe Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Michigan, who have \nworked together as chairman and ranking member to do exactly what \nSenator Coats said earlier, which is to build a strong, bipartisan--in \nmany ways, nonpartisan--effort to meet the defense national security \nneeds of our country.\n  We used to say, and sometimes we are still able to, that partisanship \nstops at the Nation's borders, at the water's edge, when we enter \nforeign policy, defense policy. It could also be said in good measure \nthat partisanship stops when we enter the rooms of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I thank the leadership of this committee for making \nthat possible.\n  I want to pay particular tribute to Senator Thurmond, who is an \nAmerican institution, a figure that looms large in our history, who, as \nwe all know from personal service with him, manages to do what they \nused to say only about wine, which is that he gets better as he adds \nyears. He is not only informed and experienced and committed; the truth \nis, he is a great patriot. In so many ways that will never be visible, \nhis leadership has strengthened the security of the United States of \nAmerica in the world. It has been a great honor to get to know him at \nthis stage of his career, to work with him, particularly on the Armed \nServices Committee, to thank him on this historic occasion as he \nmanages the last of these armed services bills through the Senate. The \nnation is in his debt, deep debt. I think all of us who have served \nwith him are very proud that we have.\n\n  This is a person who, in the hurly-burly and sometimes mean-spirited \nworld of politics, never seems to have anything but a positive word to \nsay--certainly, toward his colleagues. In addition to all of the \nsubstance that I have talked about, that notion of spirit is one that I \ndeeply appreciate.\n  Mr. President, while we are talking about members of the committee, I \ndo want to thank Senator Coats, the Senator from Indiana, for the \nremarkable statement he has just made--eloquent, thoughtful, informed. \nHe has made a tremendous contribution on this committee. It has been a \nreal pleasure to work with him on a host of issues. In our case, it \nalmost seems that I don't have to say ``across party lines,'' because \nwe never thought about that; we were focused on common interests.\n  We got interested in this business of the military transformation \nwhen we were both invited, on the same day, to a day-long seminar that \na think tank in town was holding on national security. We spoke at \ndifferent times during the day. We had not talked to each other about \nthe fact that we were on the same program, and we both essentially gave \nthe same speech about the challenges facing our military--that in a \nworld where we have faced a remarkable range of challenges, post-cold \nwar revolution, technology, and fiscal resources constraint we had to \nbegin to think about how to stay with it and produce the most cost-\neffective defense we could. From that coincidence, we began to work \ntogether on some of the elements of this authorization bill that \nSenator Coats has spoken of and which I will get back to in a moment. I \nwanted to thank him, while he was on the floor, for his tremendous \ncontributions, and in a personal way, thank him for the partnership \nthat we have had, which has also become a friendship. I hate to see him \nleave; I am going to miss him, and the Senate will miss him. I know \nthat wherever he is, by his nature, he will be involved in public \nservice. I wish him Godspeed in that work.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the bill before us because I believe \nit is a very responsible bill. It is a bill that adequately provides \nfor our Armed Forces, which is our constitutional responsibility, fully \nin accord with our duty of raising Armed Forces to protect our Nation. \nAfter all, it is one of the primary responsibilities that motivates \npeople to form governments, and I think this bill continues to carry \nout that responsibility, uphold that duty in a way that is measured and \nas best we could do under the circumstances. It has never been easy to \nmake the choices that are necessary to make when one deals with \nnational security. I would say, having been honored to be part of this \nprocess on the committee, that it has been even harder than normal this \ntime, because we have been working with very severe fiscal constraints.\n  Senator Coats made the important point--one that I think is little \nappreciated here in Congress and, more broadly, around the country--\nthat as we have worked very hard to bring our Federal Government books \ninto balance, the real contributor to that balance in reduced spending \nhas been the defense side of the budget. That is the fact. Sometimes \npeople look at the amount of money we are authorizing and appropriating \nfor national security and say, ``You folks don't understand that the \ncold war is over.'' Believe me, we understand, and the programs have \nbeen constricted, have been in some ways squeezed, and even strangled \noccasionally to live within the constraints, to give what we have been \nasked to give to help in this great effort that is now successfully \nachieved--to balance our budget.\n\n  Lets talk specifically. By my reckoning, this is the 14th straight \nyear in which our defense authorization and the spending to follow has \ndeclined in real dollars. We are spending a smaller percentage of our \ngross domestic product on defense today than at any time since prior to \nthe beginning of the Second World War. I know the cold war is over, but \nthe reality is that the world not only remains an unsettled and \ndangerous place--as we have seen in the last few days with the nuclear \nexplosions in India--but that our military, in many ways, is operating \nat a more\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nintense and faster up-tempo than it did during the cold war. And the \nlimitation on funding that we have imposed on ourselves has made it \ndifficult to do all that we need to do, has made it difficult to \nprovide for our personnel as we want to provide for them, and has put \nus in a position to push them at a very intense level, leading some to \nleave.\n  As is well known, Mr. President, the Air Force particularly is seeing \na significant departure of pilots. They have invested a lot of money in \ntraining, pushing them at a very hard pace, and more and more of them \nare just reaching the conclusion that, well, I love my country, I love \nto serve, I have been trained to do this, I love being a pilot for the \nU.S. military, but my family can only take so much; it is time to leave \nand get a much higher-paying job in commercial airlines and have more \ntime with my family.\n  So this steady constriction of our spending on the military has had \nan affect on us. This budget is 1.1 percent below the rate of \ninflation. The budget that we put before you, the authorization bill, \nS. 2057, is 1.1 percent below the rate of inflation. That means more \npressure to get more out of what is being provided. It is having an \naffect.\n  Let me describe one area I am particularly interested in, because I \nhave had the privilege of serving as the ranking Democrat on the \nSubcommittee of Armed Services on Acquisition and Technology. It is a \npleasure to serve with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, who \nhas done a superb job as chairman of the subcommittee. There are no \npartisan differences here. We both agree that there is a dangerous \ntrend in our investment in science and technology. It has often been \nsaid, but it bears repeating, that we are some distance from the great \nvictory we achieved in Desert Storm and the Gulf war. The remarkable \ntechnologically and sophisticated weapons system that so dominated the \nenemy in that war didn't just spring out of nowhere a year or two \nbefore the war; they are the result of investments in science and \ntechnology that occurred in the 1970s, which came to maturation in the \n1980s, which produced the systems and the equipment that we used so \nsuccessfully in the early 1990s in Operation Desert Storm.\n  The Department of Defense's science and technology budget has three \nbasic elements: basic research, applied research, and advanced \ntechnology development. The total science and technology budget, \ncomprised of these components just mentioned, has declined from $9.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 1993 to $7.7 billion last year, and to somewhat \nover $7.1 billion this year. These are the investments we are making in \nthe brilliant ideas that lead to the remarkable weapons systems that we \nare going to need in the future to defend ourselves.\n  No business would do this. Today, in fact, private business, \nunderstanding how important innovation and knowledge are, are investing \nmore and more. The best businesses constantly reinvest in basic \nresearch technology and creative development. This is an alarming \ntrend, and I point it out on the floor here this morning with the hope \nthat we will see it, come to understand, and turn it around. I am \nencouraged to believe that my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, will, at some point, be offering an amendment to this \nbill, if not a freestanding bill, which would set some higher standards \nand goals for increasing our support of the science and technology \naspect of the defense budget.\n\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, there is a bright story to be told here. \nThe investments we make in defense technologies have produced enormous \nbenefits for civilian and commercial technology, and for our world, our \neconomy. Most people, if you ask them what the most exciting \ntechnological development of recent years is, would say personal \ncomputers, the Internet--the unprecedented ability we have to \ncommunicate with each other and the people around the world to gain \nknowledge rapidly.\n  The Internet is the result of investments that the Defense \nDepartment--DARPA, the research agency--made years ago for its own \noriginal military uses. Then it spun off and become the Internet. You \ncould mention one after another of the remarkable developments that \nmake our lives more exciting and make it easier to be educated but in \neffect make us safer but healthier. They came from science and \ntechnology budgets of the DOD. We cut that. We are again down from $9.5 \nbillion in 1993 to almost $7.2 billion in 1999, the next fiscal year. \nThat is a problem. We are all going to pay for it.\n  Mr. President, overall when we look at the various factors that \ncreate the environment for security and international security, when we \nlook at the effect that these technological changes are having in \ncreating what the experts call a revolution in military affairs, we can \ndo things we could never do before. Commanders are able to see the \nentire battlefield before them in real time, not only on the \nbattlefield. We have the ability now to send a picture of real time \nback to somebody at a base, or even at the Pentagon thousands of miles \naway from the battlefield, to see what is happening and sight the \nenemy. We have the ability to strike an enemy from standoff positions, \nexposing our own personnel to no danger, with remarkable accuracy. And \nit is changing constantly.\n  So we have the revolution in military affairs. We have the global \nchanges that are occurring: The end of the cold war; breakouts in some \nplaces of nationalistic and ethnic rivalries; and the spread of \ntechnology so that nations that are less wealthy than we are can focus \ntheir energy into, unfortunately, lower priced means of not only \ndefense but offense--weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological, \nand nuclear; the means to deliver those weapons with the unprecedented \nability from standoff positions and with great accuracy.\n  Ballistic missiles: I voted yesterday for cloture on the measure \nintroduced by the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, and the \nSenator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, on the policy of creating a \nnational missile defense and stating that clearly here in the Senate. I \ndidn't agree with every provision of the bill. To me, it is an urgent \nnational problem that deserved our debate. When we got to it, I was \ngoing to prepare some amendments. I hope eventually we do get to it and \nwe can have an agreement across not only the aisles here but between \nthe Congress and the administration to state clearly that the \ndevelopment of a national missile defense is a national priority and \nhere is the way we ought to go at it.\n  Incidentally, when we go at it, we ought to begin to negotiate it \nwith our friends in Russia about how it affects the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty, not to do it by way of surprise or antagonism. But the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was negotiated and signed more than a \nquarter of a century ago. The world is a very different place. In many \nways, the strategic interests of Russia and the United States are \ncomparable certainly on this ground: Common concerns about being \naffected by the spread of technology and ballistic missiles delivering \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\n  So put that together--revolution of military affairs, global \nchanges--and add to that the fiscal restraints that I have described, \nand you have a tough situation, one that falls on us here in Congress \nand on those who serve our Nation in uniform and as civilian leaders in \nthe Pentagon, to not accept the status quo, to stick with it. \nEverything is changing. You can't succeed and stay static, stay the way \nyou have been doing. You have to keep moving. You have to keep looking \nfor better ways for doing what you are doing. You have to keep looking \nfor efficiencies and finding ways to save money so you can use that \nmoney to invest in other areas that help you with your future defense.\n  There is a great company headquartered in the State of Connecticut. \nAwhile back, I was reading in one of our newspapers that they were \nabout to achieve record profits in a quarter, that they were going to \ngo well over a couple of billion dollars on an annual basis, I believe, \nin profits. What is the story? The CEO of the company is calling in all \nof the division heads and pushing them for how they are going to find \nnew efficiencies in the company--What are the market opportunities of \nthe future? What are their competitors going to be doing?--knowing \nthat, as great as things are now, unless they keep asking those \nquestions, they are not going to stay on top 5 years from now or 10 \nyears from now.\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\n  That is exactly the way I think we have to approach our national \nsecurity. We are the strongest nation in the world; unrivaled. Yet the \nworld is changing. We have to keep focusing on those changes.\n  General Shalikashvili a while ago, when he was Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, informed us and warned us about what we call--as \nSenator Coats mentioned today--``asymmetric warfare.'' Yes, we are the \nsuperpower, but a much lesser power, much less wealthy, less \ntechnically developed, smaller military can focus its investment of \nfunds into an area where they see some vulnerability in us, asymmetric, \nand strike at that vulnerability--perhaps our capacity to forward \ndeploy our troops, perhaps using weapons of mass destruction, chemical \nwarfare; or, noting how dependent we are now on space-based assets for \nnavigation, for surveillance, targeting, for communications, perhaps to \ntry to develop systems that would focus on that dependence and try to \nincapacitate some of those systems, hurting us in a conflict.\n  So we have to look at that wide range of threats and protecting our \nassets in space, developing our ability to defend against weapons of \nmass destruction delivered by ballistic missiles.\n  That is why we have to continue to find within a budget that is going \nto be constrained--I don't see in the near future, certainly barring \nthe kind of international crisis that none of us wants, hope and pray \nnever occurs, a great public support, a support here in Congress, for \nthe kinds of increases in our military spending that we truly need.\n  So we are going to have to squeeze more out of the rock. That means \ntough questions. It means, in my opinion, that we are going to have to \ngo back and do another look at our infrastructure. It is controversial; \nI understand. But all of the statistics tell us that we have more \ninfrastructure than we need, that we have reduced our personnel and \nother expenditures much more than we have reduced the spending we are \ndoing on our bases. We have to come back to that and acknowledge that \nmaybe we have to find a better way to do it, but somehow we have to do \nit because we need that money. As I say, we have to continue the work \nwe have done on acquisition reform as a way to find more funds for \nthese programs that we need to support.\n  It is in this context that I come to two amendments that are in this \nbill, in which I think we have, as a committee and hopefully now as a \nfull Senate, stepped up to our responsibility to oversee the \ntransformation of our military to the future course that will not only \nprotect our security better in the 21st century but will do it in a \nmore cost-effective fashion.\n  There are two provisions in this bill that I think are very important \nfor our execution of this oversight responsibility. I want to speak \nabout them. The first supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, our current chairman, General Shelton--doing a superb job--in \nhis decision to establish a joint experimentation process. The second \nrequires on a regular basis a Quadrennial Defense Review and a National \nDefense Panel assessment be done every 4 years--the experience we have \nbeen through in the last couple of years not to be a one-time \nexperience but it continue on.\n  Let me talk about the first. And, again, I see this not only as a \nmove to jointness, not only as a way to better take advantage of the \nrevolution of military affairs, but to be more efficient. We have \ndeveloped a force service. They are remarkable centers of excellence \nand purpose, patriotism, but no one would want to diminish the unique \ncontributions each one of them makes; and yet there are redundancies \nand we have to find ways while preserving the uniqueness of each \nservice--and the special edge that some of that competition among them \nbrings--to also bring them together more in joint requirements, joint \nexperimentation because our premise is--and the experts tell us this, \nthe National Defense Panel told us this--that more and more war \nfighting of the future will be joint war fighting.\n  During the 1980s it became clear that we needed to change the way our \nmilitary was organized, with more joint planning, more joint conduct of \nmilitary operations. The Congress of the United States in that period \nof time stepped up to the responsibility when, frankly, the Pentagon \nwould not and responded with the Goldwater-Nichols act, which I would \nsay that most everybody today in Congress and outside says was right \nand necessary.\n  The collapse of the Soviet Union and the unprecedented explosion of \ntechnological advances that could fundamentally redefine military \nthreats and military capabilities in the future, once again, have \ngenerated the need this bill responds to to examine the suitability of \nour defense policies, our strategy, and our force structure to meet \nfuture American defense requirements. Several assessments have been \ndone but the rapid pace of change, I think, outstripped the ability of \nthese assessments to give us durable and continuing relevant answers.\n  General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, reacted to this changing environment and published Joint Vision \n2010 in May of 1996 as a basis for the transformation of our military \ncapabilities. I think this was a brilliant and far-sighted document \nwhich embraced the improved intelligence and command and control \navailable in the information age, and also developed the operational \nconcepts of dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional \nprotection, and focused logistics to achieve the objective of the \nwidest spectrum, full spectrum dominance in war fighting--a very \nimportant step forward.\n  We in Congress have also been concerned about the shortcomings in \ndefense policies and programs derived from some of the earlier \nassessments. In 1996, we passed the Military Force Structure Review \nAct. That act required the Secretary of Defense to complete in 1997 a \nQuadrennial Defense Review of our programs to include a comprehensive \nexamination of our defense strategy, force structure, force \nmodernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of the defense \nprogram and policies with a view toward determining and expressing the \ndefense strategy of the United States and establishing a revised \ndefense program through the year 2005.\n\n  That Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996 also established a \nNational Defense Panel, a team B, a group of outside experts, many of \nthem with active military experience, to assess the Quadrennial Defense \nReview and to conduct their own independent, nonpartisan review of the \nstrategy force structure and funding required to meet anticipated \nthreats to our security through the year 2010 and beyond--an attempt to \nforce the process to do what our colleagues in the private sector do, \ntry to look out beyond the horizon, make some reasoned and informed \njudgments as best we could about what threats we face, what competition \nwe face, and then come back and decide where should we be investing, \nhow should we be restructuring and reorganizing to be in the best \npossible position to meet those threats of the future.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan, unanimous support that was given to that \nMilitary Force Structure Review Act of 1996, and I believe it resulted \nin two reports that have had a very important effect on our military \nand how we view our future needs.\n  The QDR, as it is called, the Quadrenniel Defense Review, completed \nby the Secretary in May 1997, defined the defense strategy in terms of \nshape, respond and prepare now--three cardinal principles. The QDR \nplaced greater emphasis on the need to prepare now for an uncertain \nfuture by exploiting the revolution in technology and transforming our \nforces toward Joint Vision 2010. It concluded that our future force \nwill be different in character than our current force.\n  Then came the National Defense Panel. Its report, published in \nDecember of 1997, concluded that ``the Department of Defense should \naccord the highest priority to executing a transformation strategy for \nthe U.S. military starting now.''\n  Let me just repeat those words. A transformation strategy, broad, \nbold transformation strategy to the next era of threat and opportunity, \noffense and defense, and the final words ``starting now.'' It is \ntimely. It is important. It recommended the establishment of a joint \nforces command with responsibility as the joint force integrator and\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nprovider, a center of activity to meld the services together in some \njoint experimentation, investments, requirements, training.\n  Also, the NDP recommended that this joint forces command have the \nresponsibility and budget for driving the transformation process of \nU.S. forces, including the conduct of joint experimentation. If we are \nnot experimenting together, how are we going to really be prepared for \nthe joint war fighting that the experts tell us will dominate the \nfuture?\n  Admiral Owens, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nsaid to us on many occasions to look around and note that we don't have \njoint bases, and that is something to think about. That may be one.\n  Both of these assessments, the QDR and the NDP, provide Congress with \na compelling argument that the future security environment and the \nmilitary challenges we will face will be fundamentally different from \ntoday's. They also reinforce the fundamental principle, the \nunderpinning of the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, \nthe so-called Goldwater-Nichols act, and that fundamental principle was \nthat warfare in all its varieties will be joint warfare requiring the \nexecution of joint operational concepts.\n  As a result of these two assessments, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Shelton, and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee certainly have concluded that a process of joint \nexperimentation is required to integrate advances in technology with \nchanges in the organizational structure of the Armed Forces and the \ndevelopment of joint operational concepts which will be effective \nagainst the wide range of anticipated threats, and will not just be \neffective, but will be cost effective because they will achieve \nefficiencies of scale; they will eliminate redundancies; they will pool \nresources for maximum results.\n  It is necessary to identify and assess independent areas of joint \nwarfare which will be key to transforming the conduct of future U.S. \nmilitary operations. To do this, U.S. Armed Forces must innovatively \ninvestigate and test technologies, forces and joint operational \nconcepts in simulation, war game and virtual settings, as well as in \nfield environments under realistic conditions against the full range of \nfuture challenges. The Department of Defense, I am pleased to note, is \ncommitted to conducting aggressive experimentation as a key component \nof its transformation strategy. Service experimentation and the \nresultant competition of ideas is vital in this pursuit. To complement \nthe ongoing service experimentation, it is essential that an energetic \nand innovative organization be established within the military and \nempowered to design and conduct this process of joint experimentation \nto develop and validate new joint warfighting concepts aimed at \ntransforming the Armed Forces of the United States to meet the \nanticipated threats of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, in this regard I refer my colleagues to title XII of \nthis defense authorization bill, S. 2057, which sets this out in the \nform of a sense of the Senate, in a quite detailed form and, in my \nopinion, quite progressively, as a result of very constructive \ndiscussion among the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary of \nDefense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I think we have \na blueprint here which expresses the transformation that our military \nis now undergoing, led by the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and sets down a mark that is an expression of the \npolicy desires of the Congress in this regard, that we not only \nappreciate that the military move in this direction; dispatching our \nconstitutional responsibility, we urge them to do just that. And we \nrequire, here, a series of reports to tell us how they are doing. The \njoint experimentation provision in the bill, title XII, is our \nstatement of support to General Shelton, as he designs and executes his \nplans for joint experimentation, to select a command, the Atlantic \nCommand, presumably, to carry out this important responsibility.\n  Title XII does not dictate either the method that the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs should choose nor the outcomes that he should arrive at. \nIt is a sense of the Congress. It helps establish a framework for us to \nexplore the options for our future security in the hard light of tests \non the ground, the only place where these arguments can begin to be \nsettled objectively and where these theories can be tested \nrealistically. And this provision in title XII offers a mechanism for \nus to get a report about the process, about the results, that is \ndetailed enough for us to provide the kind of oversight we should and \nmust provide if we are going to make the right decisions about our \nnational security in the coming years.\n  Finally, the provision that requires a quadrennial defense review and \nnational defense plan to be conducted every 4 years is equally \nimportant. The assessments that were conducted and the debate they have \nengendered within the Congress, within the inner community of active \ndefense thinkers, and hopefully increasingly within the country, has \nbeen very useful. But the valid criticism by some, of both of these \nstudies, and the conflicting ideas that they have raised make it \nobvious that a one-time assessment is not going to provide us all the \nanswers we need.\n  We also know that the world is not going to stop changing, and just \nas that CEO of that large private company headquartered in Connecticut \nthat I described who, at the moment of greatest historic success, was \npressing his managers to review where they were, look forward, decide \nwhat they had to do so they would stay on top, 5, 10, 15, 20 years from \nnow--the repetition of these two reports, the QDR and the Inside the \nPentagon Review, and the NDP, a nonpartisan, independent review, offer \nthat same hope of constant reevaluation, sometimes provocation, and \nhopefully, some good, solid ideas. That kind of formal review of our \nnational security posture every 4 years will permit the needed look at \nwhere we have been and what course corrections we need to make without \nthe disruption of too frequent interference, with the certainty that we \nwill not slide into destructive or unproductive or irrelevant paths \nbecause we simply haven't stopped to look at what we are doing and \nwhere it is taking us.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I thank my colleagues. Bottom line, \nthis is a balanced bill, the best I think this committee could offer \nthe Senate, Congress, and the Nation, to protect our national security \nin a time of restraint on resources that is greater than I think is \nreally in our national interest. But we have done the best we could. \nAgain, I thank the leadership of the committee for the purposive, \ncooperative and informed way they have led us through the exercise that \nhas produced this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  If there is no one else on the floor seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from \nConnecticut for the kind remarks he made about me. I also wish to thank \nhim for the great service he renders as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He is one of the most valuable members of our committee.\n  I also thank him for the great service he renders this Nation. He has \ntaken sound positions and he has followed a course of action that our \nNation would be well to follow. I appreciate all he does for his \ncountry and want him to know his colleagues hold him in high esteem.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2387\n\n(Purpose: Relating to commercial activities in the United States of the \n     People's Liberation Army and other Communist Chinese military \n                               companies)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The People's Liberation Army is the principal \n     instrument of repression within the People's Republic of \n     China, responsible for occupying Tibet since 1950, massacring \n     hundreds of students and demonstrators for democracy in \n     Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and running the Laogai \n     (``reform through labor'') slave labor camps.\n       (2) The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive \n     military buildup, which has involved a doubling since 1992 of \n     announced official figures for military spending by the \n     People's Republic of China.\n       (3) The People's Liberation Army is engaging in a major \n     ballistic missile modernization program which could undermine \n     peace and stability in East Asia, including 2 new \n     intercontinental missile programs, 1 submarine-launched \n     missile program, a new class of compact but long-range cruise \n     missiles, and an upgrading of medium- and short-range \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (4) The People's Liberation Army is working to coproduce \n     the SU-27 fighter with Russia, and is in the process of \n     purchasing several substantial weapons systems from Russia, \n     including the 633 model of the Kilo-class submarine and the \n     SS-N-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed to \n     incapacitate United States aircraft carriers and Aegis \n     cruisers.\n       (5) The People's Liberation Army has carried out acts of \n     aggression in the South China Sea, including the February \n     1995 seizure of the Mischief Reef in the Spratley Islands, \n     which is claimed by the Philippines.\n       (6) In July 1995 and in March 1996, the People's Liberation \n     Army conducted missile tests to intimidate Taiwan when Taiwan \n     held historic free elections, and those tests effectively \n     blockaded Taiwan's 2 principal ports of Keelung and \n     Kaohsiung.\n       (7) The People's Liberation Army has contributed to the \n     proliferation of technologies relevant to the refinement of \n     weapons-grade nuclear material, including transferring ring \n     magnets to Pakistan.\n       (8) The People's Liberation Army and associated defense \n     companies have provided ballistic missile components, cruise \n     missiles, and chemical weapons ingredients to Iran, a country \n     that the executive branch has repeatedly reported to Congress \n     is the greatest sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n       (9) In May 1996, United States authorities caught the \n     People's Liberation Army enterprise Poly Technologies and the \n     civilian defense industrial company Norinco attempting to \n     smuggle 2,000 AK-47s into Oakland, California, and offering \n     to sell urban gangs shoulder-held missile launchers capable \n     of ``taking out a 747'' (which the affidavit of the United \n     States Customs Service of May 21, 1996, indicated that the \n     representative of Poly Technologies and Norinco claimed), and \n     Communist Chinese authorities punished only 4 low-level arms \n     merchants by sentencing them on May 17, 1997, to brief prison \n     terms.\n       (10) The People's Liberation Army contributes to the \n     People's Republic of China's failure to meet the standards of \n     the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding with the United States \n     on intellectual property rights by running factories which \n     pirate videos, compact discs, and computer software that are \n     products of the United States.\n       (11) The People's Liberation Army contributes to the \n     People's Republic of China's failing to meet the standards of \n     the February 1997 Memorandum of Understanding with the United \n     States on textiles by operating enterprises engaged in the \n     transshipment of textile products to the United States \n     through third countries.\n       (12) The estimated $2,000,0000,000 to $3,000,000,000 in \n     annual earnings of People's Liberation Army enterprises \n     subsidize the expansion and activities of the People's \n     Liberation Army described in this subsection.\n       (13) The commercial activities of the People's Liberation \n     Army are frequently conducted on noncommercial terms, or for \n     noncommercial purposes such as military or foreign policy \n     considerations.\n\n     SEC. ____. APPLICATION OF AUTHORITIES UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL \n                   EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT TO CHINESE \n                   MILITARY COMPANIES.\n\n       (a) Determination of Communist Chinese Military \n     Companies.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), not \n     later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Attorney General, the Director of Central Intelligence, and \n     the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall \n     compile a list of persons who are Communist Chinese military \n     companies and who are operating directly or indirectly in the \n     United States or any of its territories and possessions, and \n     shall publish the list of such persons in the Federal \n     Register. On an ongoing basis, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of \n     Central Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation, shall make additions or deletions to the \n     list based on the latest information available.\n       (2) Communist chinese military company.--For purposes of \n     making the determination required by paragraph (1), the term \n     ``Communist Chinese military company''--\n       (A) means a person that is--\n       (i) engaged in providing commercial services, \n     manufacturing, producing, or exporting, and\n       (ii) owned or controlled by the People's Liberation Army, \n     and\n       (B) includes, but is not limited to, any person identified \n     in the United States Defense Intelligence Agency publication \n     numbered VP-1920-271-90, dated September 1990, or PC-1921-57-\n     95, dated October 1995, and any update of such reports for \n     the purposes of this title.\n       (b) Presidential Authority.--\n       (1) Authority.--The President may exercise the authorities \n     set forth in section 203(a) of the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1702(a)) with respect to any \n     commercial activity in the United States by a Communist \n     Chinese military company (except with respect to authorities \n     relating to importation), without regard to section 202 of \n     that Act.\n       (2) Penalties.--The penalties set forth in section 206 of \n     the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n     1705) shall apply to violations of any license, order, or \n     regulation issued under paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. ____. DEFINITION.\n\n       For purposes of this title, the term ``People's Liberation \n     Army'' means the land, naval, and air military services, the \n     police, and the intelligence services of the Communist \n     Government of the People's Republic of China, and any member \n     of any such service or of such police.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Abraham of Michigan, be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today's debate is about the security \nof the United States. The underlying question in the debate today on \nthe Defense Department authorization bill concerns the safety and \nsecurity of the citizens of the United States, and that is why I am \noffering an amendment that will give the President increased powers to \nconfront America's greatest threat, or certainly America's greatest \nexternal threat, and that is the People's Liberation Army of the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  My amendment mirrors exactly the language that passed overwhelmingly \non the floor of the House of Representatives last November. This \nlanguage, in bill form, in the House passed by a vote of 405 to 10.\n  The amendment would do two things: First, it would require the \nSecretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General, the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI, to \nmaintain a current list of Chinese military firms operating directly or \nindirectly in the United States. This list, consisting strictly of PLA-\nowned companies, would be updated regularly in the Federal Register.\n  Secondly, the amendment would give the President enhanced authority \nunder the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to take action \nagainst Chinese military-owned firms if circumstances warrant, \nincluding the President would have the authority to freeze assets or \notherwise regulate these firms' activities. Thus, if a PLA-owned firm \nis found to be shipping missile-guidance components to a rogue state \nlike Iran, the President would have the authority to take immediate \naction against a United States subsidiary of that firm which might, for \nexample, be selling sporting goods in the United States.\n  I should note that this amendment would not require the President to \ntake any action whatsoever. It would simply enhance his ability to do \nso should he believe that the circumstances warrant that action.\n  Let me explain the reasoning behind this amendment and why it is so \ncritical, I believe, that the Senate adopt this amendment.\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n  Mr. President, last week I came to this floor to discuss the growing \nthreat that the People's Republic of China poses to the citizens of the \nUnited States. I discussed the recent CIA report covered in the \nWashington Times on May 4, 1998, under the headline, ``China Targets \nNukes At U.S.'' This article and this CIA report noted that 13 of \nChina's 18 long-range strategic missiles, with ranges exceeding 8,000 \nmiles, have single nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of \nAmerica.\n  These missiles, which are under the control of the PLA, with PLA \nofficers manning their nuclear buttons, are in addition to China's 25 \nCSS-3 missiles, with ranges of more than 3,400 miles; its 18 CSS-4 \nmissiles, with ranges exceeding 8,000 miles; and its planned DF-31, \nwith a range exceeding 7,000 miles.\n  Until last year, China lacked the military intelligence necessary to \nmanufacturer boosters that could reliably strike at such long \ndistances.\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon has reported that two U.S. companies--\nLoral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronics--illegally gave \nChina space expertise during cooperation on a commercial satellite \nlaunch which could be used to develop an accurate launch and guidance \nsystem for ICBMs. This issue is still under investigation. But while it \nwas still under investigation, in February, Loral launched another \nsatellite on a Chinese rocket and provided the Chinese with the same \nexpertise that is at issue in the criminal case.\n  The chairman of the House Science Subcommittee on Space and \nTechnology has received word from an unnamed official at Motorola that \nthey, too, have been involved in ``upgrading'' China's missile \ncapability. Interestingly, this executive claims that the work is being \ndone under a waiver from this administration, thus circumventing all \nbans and restrictions on such technology transfers.\n  The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive military buildup \nwhich has involved a doubling since 1992 of announced official figures \nfor military spending by the PRC. We do not know how much may be spent, \nhow much investment there may be in their military establishment that \nis not released for official consumption, but the official public \nfigures indicate a doubling of that expenditure since 1992.\n  The PLA is working to coproduce the SU-27 fighter with Russia and is \nin the process of purchasing several substantial weapons systems from \nRussia, including the 633 model of the Kilo-class submarine and the SS-\nN-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed to incapacitate U.S. \naircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers.\n  So the question arises, Mr. President, how does the People's \nLiberation Army fund the ongoing arms race? By selling its technology \nto rogue states is one means by which they do it, selling arms, or at \nleast attempting to sell arms, to U.S. gangs in our inner cities and \nselling CDs, socks, consumer electronics, and scores of other \ncommercial items to U.S. consumers.\n  For example, the People's Liberation Army has contributed to the \nproliferation of technologies relevant to the refinement of weapons-\ngrade nuclear material, including transferring ring magnets to \nPakistan. Additionally, the PLA and its associated defense companies \nhave provided ballistic missile components, cruise missiles, chemical \nweapons ingredients, to Iran, a country that the executive branch has \nrepeatedly reported to this Congress is the greatest sponsor of \nterrorism in the world today.\n  I point to this chart. The source is the Office of Naval \nIntelligence, March of 1997. They reported:\n\n       Discoveries after the Gulf War clearly indicate that Iraq \n     maintained an aggressive (W)eapons of (M)ass (D)estruction \n     procurement program.\n\n  And then they point out:\n\n       A similar situation exists today in Iran with a steady flow \n     of materials and technologies from China to Iran. This \n     exchange is one of the most active weapons of mass \n     destruction programs in the Third World, and is taking place \n     in a region of great strategic interest to the United States.\n\n  So we have, I think, very clear, overwhelming evidence that China \ncontinues to export technology, nuclear technology as well, and in so \ndoing places at risk the national security of the United States.\n  They also are funding the arms buildup in China, not only by selling \nweapons to rogue states like Iraq and Iran, but also there is evidence \nthat they are trying to actually sell weapons produced in the People's \nRepublic of China to gangs in the United States.\n  In May 1996, the U.S. authorities caught the People's Liberation Army \nenterprise entitled Poly Technologies--a PLA-owned and operated \nenterprise--they were caught by U.S. authorities, and the civilian \ndefense industrial company, Norinco, that is also involved, the U.S. \nauthorities caught these two companies attempting to smuggle 2,000 AK-\n47s into Oakland, CA, and offering to sell urban gangs shoulder-held \nmissile launchers capable of taking out a 747.\n  Communist authorities, upon capture of these individuals, punished \nonly four of them--four low-level arms merchants--and they did so, \nsentencing them May 17, 1997, to brief prison terms.\n  I would suggest and I suspect that the prison terms given to these \nmerchants of arms to the young people of this country were far less \nthan the prison terms that have been exacted upon those prisoners of \nconscience, those who dared to speak up against the oppressive regime \nthat controls the largest nation in the world. Eight years was given to \nWang Dan for his support of the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square \nalmost 9 years ago in addition to the 12 years that he was recently \nserving for supporting democracy in China.\n  It is estimated that the PLA earns $2 billion to $4 billion a year in \nearnings through the many enterprises that it operates that deal in \nnonmilitary commodities and that these enterprises profit handsomely \nfrom their activities in the United States. A report released earlier \nthis year indicated that vast quantities of goods, as varied as toys, \nskis, garlic, iron weight sets, men's pants, car radiators, glassware, \nswimming suits, and many more such commercial domestic items are being \nsold to U.S. consumers by PLA-owned firms.\n  This chart indicates--and I will quote from this chart regarding the \nPLA-affiliated companies and their operation in the United States. This \ncomes from the Institutional Investor, July of 1996: ``And we find that \nmilitary-affiliated companies can be found in virtually every part of \nthe Chinese economy with the most rapid expansion occurring in the \nlucrative service industries. Though the PLA enterprises are scattered \nthroughout the economy, they have carved out niches in the eight areas \nto the right''--including transportation, vehicle production, \npharmaceuticals, hotels, real estate development, garment production, \nmining and communications.\n  Some of these products are being exported--which becomes a rich \nsource of revenue for the People's Liberation Army. Even those products \nand those services that are sold domestically to the Chinese people \nbecome an unaccounted for subsidy, if you will, for the arms race, in \nthe development of the PLA military strength and might. So I believe \nthis should be of great concern to us as we continue to see the PLA \nfund the arms race.\n  I point out that the Chinese defense industrial trade organizations \nhave a broad, broad interrelationship with the industries in China. \nThis chart shows the web of PLA-owned enterprises that operate in the \nUnited States and around the world.\n  All of the companies on the left, in the peach color, are companies \nthat have been documented by our Defense Intelligence Agency as being \ndirectly owned by the People's Liberation Army. The ones to the other \nside, in the yellow, are their defense industrial base. Some of them \nhave indirect connections also, but they are not directly owned by the \nPeople's Liberation Army.\n  This next chart I believe shows the chain of command for companies \nlike China Poly Group, China Carrie Corp., and other well-known Chinese \ncompanies and their interrelationship with the government and the PLA \nand the Communist Party. In fact, the Communist Party Central Military \nCommission is right at the top of the chain of command--going down to \nthese various companies, including the China Poly Group, and the 999 \nEnterprise Group, and so forth. I think the American people would be \nshocked to see the companies listed on this chart. This, I\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nmight add, is a very incomplete list, which is why I emphasize again \nthe need for this amendment which would require a listing to be \npublished of all PLA-owned enterprises that are buying and selling and \ndoing business in the United States.\n\n  It is well documented that the PLA violates international \nintellectual property rights by running factories which pirate videos, \ncompact discs, and computer software that are products of the United \nStates. This is the main reason the People's Republic of China failed \nto meet the standards of the 1995 memorandum of understanding with the \nUnited States on the protection of intellectual property rights. During \nmy trip to China in January, I saw firsthand the evidence of the \npirating of videos and CDs and the selling of those pirated products on \nthe market, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing.\n  In violation of a February 1997 agreement with the United States, the \nPeople's Liberation Army continued to operate enterprises which engaged \nin the transshipment of textile products through third countries, thus \nthwarting tariffs and restrictions on illegally produced items from \nChina.\n  With all but five of China's long-range nuclear missiles pointed at \nthe citizens of the United States, it is obvious that the increasingly \naggressive People's Liberation Army views the United States as its most \nserious adversary. My colleagues have said they would like China as an \nally. We would all like to have China as an ally. But let us not fool \nourselves. When our Central Intelligence Agency tells us their \nmissiles--13 of 18 of their long-range nuclear missiles--are pointed at \nthe citizens of the United States, it is clear they view us as an \nadversary. It is a sad paradox that U.S. consumers, American consumers, \npurchasers of products in retail stores across this country, are the \nunwitting supporters of and funders of the military that has their hand \non the nuclear button that threatens cities in the United States.\n  Now, as we talk about the response of this amendment, of letting the \nAmerican people know what companies are owned directly and indirectly \nby the military of the Chinese communist government, it seems to me to \nbe a very basic freedom-of-information kind of issue, the right-to-know \nkind of issue.\n  We talk about the response of the President, having the enhanced \nauthority to deal with those PLA-owned companies that might be \nsubsidizing the military buildup in China. It is important for us to \nremember the ongoing human rights violations that are occurring in \nChina. Not only are they increasing their threat internationally, but \nwithin their own borders they continue to oppress their own people. \nThis is not some human rights watchdog group that I am going to cite. \nIt is our own State Department which each year issues a report from \nvarious countries around the world on human rights conditions. The \nlatest State Department report on human rights in China shows that \nChina is still one of the major offenders of internationally recognized \nhuman rights standards. This report notes that China is continuing to \nengage in ``torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent \nCatholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of \nethnic minorities and religions in Tibet and Xinjiang, and absolute \nintolerance of free political speech or free press.''\n  To visit Shanghai, to visit Beijing, some of the largest cities in \nthe world, the most populous cities in the world, and to realize there \nis not one free newspaper in those cities--in northwest Arkansas, in a \ntwo-county area, population of 200,000, we have half a dozen competing \nnewspapers. These are free voices--free to criticize me, free to \ncriticize this U.S. Senate, free to criticize our President--and in the \nlargest cities in the world in China, not one voice of freedom, not one \nvoice to reflect the values of democracy.\n  So let us in this China debate, and as we look at amendments to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill, remember the ongoing human \nrights abuses that are taking place. Furthermore, that the current \npolicy that we have pursued has so dismally failed.\n\n  According to a recent report in the Washington Post entitled ``U.S.-\nChina Talks Make Little Progress on Summit Agenda,'' the United States \nis getting very few concessions from China relating to the inspection \nof the technology we share with them, concessions on limiting \nproliferation of technology to third parties like Iran, or concessions \non human rights conditions, particularly in Tibet.\n  So our President is preparing to go to China next month, negotiations \ngoing on. We would hope they would be positive in light of our so-\ncalled policy of constructive engagement, yet we find our policy is one \nof give and give and give. We are not seeing corresponding concessions \non the part of the Chinese Government. In fact, we are continuing to \nsee these horrible human rights abuses taking place.\n  We have provided key technology that puts our own country at risk. We \nhave set up a hotline that reaches from the White House to China. We \nhave begun assisting China on its efforts to gain membership in the \nWorld Trade Organization. We dropped, to the consternation of many \nMembers of this body, we dropped our annual push for a resolution \ncondemning China's human rights record at the United Nations, something \nthis country has done year after year as part of our foreign policy. We \ndropped that resolution so as not to offend the Chinese Government. We \ncontinue to allow PLA-owned companies to operate unregulated in the \nUnited States, and we continue to provide China most-favored-nation \nstatus. In return, we have witnessed the release of four, in return for \nall of these concessions that we have granted, we have seen the Chinese \nCommunist government release four prominent prisoners out of the \nthousands upon thousands of political and religious dissidents being \nheld today in Chinese prisons.\n  So I say to my colleagues, the American people have a right to know \nthey are funding the People's Liberation Army. I believe the American \nconsumers ought to know whether the products they are buying--including \nthings like toys, sweaters and porcelain that they might purchase for \nthe upcoming holidays--are supporting the People's Liberation Army and \nthe kind of activities that I have identified today. The American \npeople have a right to know. It may not be possible for American \nconsumers to go into a Wal-Mart or Kmart or Target store and to \nidentify all of the Chinese-produced products and to decide voluntarily \nthey are not going to support that. But at least they ought to know \nwhich of those companies are controlled, directly or indirectly, by a \nmilitary establishment in China that has targeted American cities with \nits missiles.\n  This amendment will help to do just that. It is needed both to shed \nlight on the PLA's activities in the United States and to ensure that \nthe President has the latitude and has the authority he needs to take \nappropriate actions when the evidence of wrongdoing arises. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this amendment.\n  Again, this amendment merely requires the Secretary of Defense to \ndocument and list PLA-owned companies operating in the United States \nand provides the President with the power, authority, and discretion to \ntake action against these companies, should circumstances so warrant. \nIt does not require the President to do anything. I believe it is a \ncommonsense amendment that, once again, passed by an overwhelming \nmargin in the U.S. House of Representatives. I ask for my colleagues' \nsupport.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator brings to the attention of \nthe Senate through this amendment a very important subject, one which \nis currently before the Senate in a number of committees--Foreign \nRelations Committee, Banking Committee, and in all probability the \nCommerce Committee has an interest in it. I say to my colleague that \nthe Armed Services Committee, indeed, would have an interest, of \ncourse, because it goes to the fundamental proposition of national \nsecurity.\n  But I have to say in total candor that this amendment would require \nconsideration by at least the three enumerated committees as well as \nours. What I am asking of my colleague, and I\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\nwant to ask a few questions about it, is that I hope the Senator would \nbe agreeable to laying this amendment aside so that the Senate would \nproceed with other amendments, and within that period of time it would \nbe the pending amendment, within that period of time, we will get the \nexpression and the views of colleagues serving on those other \ncommittees.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the chairman for his consideration, and I \nwould not object to laying it aside so long as I will be assured there \nwill be a rollcall vote if I so request it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, he has requested and gotten his rollcall \nvote.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I only point out that I think it \nwould be very appropriate to consult with and visit with the \nappropriate chairman. I remind my distinguished colleague that this is \nthe exact language that passed by a 405-10 vote in the House, and I \nwould regard that as pretty bipartisan and noncontroversial. That \nlanguage passed out of the House last November and has been referred to \nthe appropriate committees, where it has--if I might use the word--\n``languished'' for several months without any action. So it is for that \nreason I think it is imperative that the Senate have an opportunity to \nexpress its will on something the House expressed its opinion on months \nago.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  At this time, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be laid aside but that it remain as the pending business on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I see other colleagues here who may wish \nto continue with opening statements on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if my friend from Virginia would yield to me so I \ncould ask the Senator from Arkansas a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, on the matter that was set aside, I \nwonder if the Senator could tell us whether or not there have been any \ndiscussions between you and those committees that we have now asked \ntheir reaction from relative to holding hearings on that amendment. \nCould he give us a little background on that?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think there were 10 bills that passed out of the \nHouse regarding China policy as a block, separate bills, but that was \nlast November. Two of those have passed, in various forms, in the \nSenate. Six of those bills were referred to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. The other two--the two I am now offering--one was referred \nto Banking and the other to Finance. I have had ongoing discussions \nwith Senator Helms of the Foreign Relations Committee. It is my \nunderstanding that they will address these bills this coming week. \nTherefore, I defer taking any action upon those because of the \ncommittee's anticipation of looking at these next week.\n  The ones in Banking and Finance I thought were important to move \nahead on. This was the most appropriate vehicle before us. I am not \naware that there were any plans for hearings. Since so much time had \nelapsed since they were referred to the Senate, it would seem to be the \nappropriate time to move them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could ask the Senator an additional question. I am \nnot familiar with his amendment. Is this particular amendment--has this \nbeen introduced as a bill in the Senate separately, or was it a House \nbill that came over and was referred? And, if so, was it referred to \nBanking or Foreign Relations?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. This particular bill was referred to Banking.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Has the Banking Committee indicated that they are likely \nto hold a hearing and have a markup on this bill?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. They have not indicated to me their intent to hold \nhearings or move on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Have there been discussions between you and the chairman?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have not talked to Senator D'Amato about the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise to talk not so much about this \nbill but the bills that have been talked about here that passed in the \nHouse last year. Many of them were referred to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, of which I happen to be chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia \nand the Pacific Rim. These were not heard because the committee did not \nchoose to hear them. Now we find ourselves having a hearing this \nmorning on China. We find the President preparing to go to China.\n  So this bill, of course, as the Senator pointed out, was referred to \nBanking. I am not familiar with that one. I am here to tell you that I \ndon't think this is the appropriate procedural place to deal with these \nbills. There are committees that have jurisdiction over them. They have \nbeen referred to those committees. They can be referred to those \ncommittees, and, in my view, they should be referred to those \ncommittees. So if we are going to extend the length of this debate by \nhaving each of 10 bills discussed here and voted on, then I think we \nneed to prepare ourselves for a rather long time.\n  Furthermore, I think we talked at great length this morning about \nChina and about these kinds of issues. The point of the matter is that \nnobody disagrees with some of the issues that are to be done here; the \ndisagreement is how they should be handled. To send the President off \nto China with language of this kind doesn't seem to be a proper thing \nto do. They were talking about it when Jiang Zemin came here last time.\n  So I am prepared to talk about these bills if that is what we are \ngoing to do. But, procedurally, it doesn't seem to me that this is the \nappropriate place to deal with the bills. We can go on for a very long \ntime if that is what is going to take place on this authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization bill offered by the Senator from \nArkansas to address what is clearly a national defense issue--the \nconduct of Chinese companies, owned and operated by the People's \nLiberation Army, in the United States. It is based on a provision in a \ncomprehensive bill I introduced last year, the China Policy Act.\n  I believe that this bill is not only an appropriate place to consider \nthis issue, it is the most appropriate, and is indeed an issue of \nsupreme national security interest. Furthermore, Mr. President, if I \nthought the original bill that was passed by the House by a vote of \n405-10 would actually be considered by the Banking Committee, it may be \nappropriate to wait. But it has been over six months, Mr. President, \nand no action has been taken. Given this is a national security issue, \nwe need to discuss this here and now.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I wish to outline some of my specific \nnational security concerns regarding these People's Liberation Army \ncompanies. First, we are all familiar with the well publicized examples \nof Polytech and Norinco, two companies caught trying to smuggle fully \nautomatic AK-47 assault rifles, along with 4,000 clips of ammunition, \nvalued at over $4 million, to supply street gangs and drug runners in \nthe United States. During the course of this undercover sting \noperation, U.S. agents were offered a slew of other heavy ordinance, \nincluding shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.\n  Now Mr. President, these two companies are effectively controlled by \nthe People's Liberation Army. In fact, the head of the Polytech parent \ncompany, Poly Group, is Major General He Ping, the son-in-law of Deng \nXiao-ping. He heads Poly Group, a company that reports directly to the \nCentral Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army. At the \nsame time, Norinco is the parent company of 150 businesses, including \nthe largest motorcycle maker in China and one of the country's most \nsuccessful automakers.\n  As state-owned enterprises, PLA companies frequently operate on non-\ncommercial terms, conducting their affairs for such non-market reasons \nas military espionage and prestige considerations. Critics have also \ncontended that the China Ocean Shipping Company, otherwise known as \nCOSCO, have offered transoceanic shipping at well below market rates \nbecause of state subsidization and extremely low crew costs, in order \nto penetrate markets and further develop a strategic lift capability.\n  Last, Mr. President, the profits from these companies will end up \nfinancing\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\nthe Chinese military. Karl Schoenberger, writing in Fortune Magazine, \nestimated that the profits from these PLA activities is conservatively \nestimated at $2 to $3 billion. Based in part on this purchasing power \nand the Chinese military establishment's considerable use of off-budget \nfinancing, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimated that \nChinese military spending is nine times what it announced.\n  The question therefore becomes, Mr. President, do we want to know \nwhich companies in the United States are financing Chinese military \nexpansion? Do we want to know which companies are financing the arm of \nrepression in the PRC that has been extensively detailed on this floor \nover the past year? Do we want to give the American consumer the \nopportunity to know whether the product they are buying will help \nfinance the oppression in Tibet? I believe that is our responsibility, \nMr. President, and that this amendment will provide that vital \ninformation for our national security, by mandating that the Director \nof Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI compile a list of \nthese PLA companies operating in the United States.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the President of the United States needs the \nadditional authority to take decisive action against those companies \nthat do threaten our national security. This amendment provides that \neconomic authority to stop the operation of these front companies, and \nprovides the only effective tools in this economic warfare--the \nprohibition of economic activity.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment as necessary, germane to the Defense Authorization bill, and \nvital to our national security.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise as chairman of \nthe Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee to focus on \nsome areas that are very critical to our Nation's defense. Certainly, \n``strategic'' takes on a new meaning as we hear news in the last few \ndays of what is happening in India.\n  We tried, in our subcommittee, to continue initiatives that have been \nstarted in previous years. At the same time, because of overall funding \nreductions, we were forced to make some substantial cuts, cuts that I \ndid not want to make. But as part of the overall budget, we felt we had \nto do it. So we do have a budget cap, and that issue, in and of itself, \nis somewhat controversial.\n  I think it is time, as we look at the reduction in defense spending, \nto begin to look at that cap and, in my opinion, remove the cap. We \nmust recognize that the defense budget has been cut deeply, and these \ncuts are beginning now to affect the effectiveness of our military \nforce.\n  The budgets of both DOD and DOE, which are in my Strategic \nSubcommittee, had to be reduced. I tried to do that as fairly as I \npossibly could. Let me just outline some of the tough choices that we \nhad to make. Missile defense, of course, is an area that I care deeply \nabout. But there is some redundancy in some of the programs that we \nhave. We have to begin to set some priorities.\n  The budget, as it was presented to us by the President, had some \nareas in it that were funded in this budget but not in future years. So \nthe question is, If a program such as MEADS--Medium Extended Air \nDefense System--is not funded beyond 1999, what is the purpose of \nproviding funding for it in fiscal 1999? So I tried to look at this. If \nI could not get a commitment from the administration to fund beyond \nfiscal year 1999, then I, for the most part, reduced or eliminated the \nfunds for next year. In the case of MEADS, our intent is to encourage \nDOD to find alternative approaches to meeting the requirement. But we \ncannot support the program if DOD has no budget for it in the future.\n  Another very controversial reduction, which I was not happy about, \nwas our cut of $97 million from the Airborne Laser Program. Because \nthis was a tough decision, I want to explain what happened.\n  There were a lot of news reports that said we ``slashed'' the \nAirborne Laser Program, that we ``ruined'' the program, that we \n``killed'' the program, that we have made it impossible for the program \nto recover, and so on. This is unfair and inaccurate. I simply felt \nthat we had an obligation to review the technical and operational \nviability of the program.\n  Two years ago, our Committee included report language which basically \ncalled on the Air Force and Airborne Laser Program advocates to come \nforward and justify the program. I do not believe that they have done \nso.\n  So we withheld funds for placing this very complex technology on an \nactual aircraft, a 747, until the capability is more fully tested and \nthe operational concepts are better defined by the Air Force. I do not \nwant to go into great detail; to some degree I cannot because it is \nclassified. But let me be clear--we only cut the dollars intended for \nintegrating this technology on an aircraft. This does not destroy the \nAirborne Laser Program, nor does it make any comment, subtle or \notherwise, by anyone on the committee that somehow this program is not \nworthy. It does require the Secretary of Defense, with the help of \noutside experts, to review the program's technology and concept of \noperations, and show us how this technology will work when it is placed \nupon an aircraft. I don't think it destroys the program to delay the \npurchase of an airplane for a year or two while we find out whether the \ntechnology and the operational concept is valid. This is what \ncongressional oversight is all about.\n  We have increased funding for Navy Upper Tier, another missile \ndefense program, and the space-based laser readiness demonstrator, \nwhich is the ultimate step, I think, in missile defense--the space-\nbased laser.\n  We tried to reduce as much of the risk as possible in the NMD Program \nby encouraging the Department to modify the program. Currently the so-\ncalled 3+3 program is extremely high risk. To deploy a complex system \nin 3 years is very, very difficult. It is an artificially compressed \ndate and an artificially compressed program. It requires us to do \neverything at once instead of running a low-risk program to ensure \neverything fits together first. There is no margin for failure or \nproblems. If one thing goes wrong, the whole program could collapse. It \nneeds to be run like any other defense acquisition program, with the \nobjective of reducing the program risk.\n  With the Administration's 3+3 program, we must first decide that \nthere is a missile threat to the United States. Then we assume that in \n3 years we can deploy a system to intercept that missile. I think that \nassumption just does not make sense.\n  Can we depend on our intelligence to give us that information? I draw \nmy colleagues' attention to what happened in the last few days with \nIndia's nuclear tests. We didn't, frankly, know what was happening \nuntil it happened. We either did not have that information, or we did \nnot heed it.\n  I am not trying to fault the intelligence community, other than to \nsay that intelligence is not always objective. It is not always \nthorough. It is not always timely. It is not always heeded. The \nquestion we have to ask is, Are we willing to take the risk once we \nknow that somebody has the capability and the intent to use a missile \nagainst us, and are we then prepared to say that in 3 years we will \nhave the technology deployed to intercept that missile? I am not \nprepared to take that kind of chance, which is why I was very \ndisappointed in the vote in the Senate yesterday on Senator Cochran's \nlegislation, which would have established a policy to deploy a national \nmissile defense system when it becomes technically feasible. That wise \nlegislation was rejected; it did not get enough votes to bring it to \ncloture. So the current administration plan for NMD 3+3 means an NMD \nsystem will be developed in 3 years, and when a threat is acknowledged \nthis system will be deployed in 3 years.\n\n  This just does not make a lot of sense. It naively assumes that we \nwill see all emerging threats, and that if and when we see one, we can \nconfidently deploy a complex system in just 3 years.\n  So I hope my colleagues in the Senate sometime sooner rather than \nlater\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\nwill come to the realization of how dangerous this 3+3 approach really \nis. Perhaps a few more unforseen nuclear tests will convince them. If \nnot, this extremely naive and extremely dangerous complacency could \ncost us dearly in years to come. We are seeing proliferation of \nmissiles, and of the technology to develop missiles, all over the \nworld--China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Iran. And, yet, we were \ndenied the opportunity yesterday on the Cochran proposal to get going \non a national missile defense system.\n  It is extremely disturbing. As one who deals with these issues every \nday on the Armed Services Committee, and specifically as the chairman \nof the Strategic Subcommittee, I know full well that this is a naive \npolicy. It is well intended--there is no question there--but naive.\n  Colin Powell, former National Security Adviser to President Reagan \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Bush and \nClinton, used to say we have to be concerned first and foremost about \nthe capability of an enemy because we never know what his intent will \nbe. The intent tomorrow might be good. It might be bad. But what is the \ncapability? We all know that the Chinese, and the Russians, have the \ncapability to fire a missile at the United States of America. Do they \nhave the intent? Maybe not today. But what about tomorrow?\n  So we have to deal with capability. If we deny that, if we look the \nother way, we are really putting our heads in the sand.\n  In space programs, the committee increase funding for a range of \nactivities: space control technology development; the enhanced global \npositioning system; the microsatellite program and the space maneuver \nvehicle. The budget for those programs were increased. These efforts \nare critical for the future exploitation and use of space by the United \nStates.\n  Another area of the strategic forces subcommittee budget concerns \nweapons and other activities of the Department of Energy. We tried \nthere to stabilize the core mission funding for weapons activities and \nenvironmental cleanup. As you know, we have a lot of environmental \ncleanup to do as a result of DOD and DOE activities over the past \nseveral decades, especially during the cold war.\n  So we tried in our budget to maintain the capability to remanufacture \nand certify enduring U.S. nuclear warheads. We tried to maintain the \npace of cleanup at DOE facilities with our funding, and though the \noverall DOE budget was reduced, a number of funding increases were \nauthorized for programs critical to achieving these goals.\n  Increases include additional funding for the four weapons production \nplants, tritium production, and environmental management technology \ndevelopment. Some will criticize these DOD cuts. But it is a matter of \nbalance. If you look at the budget in real terms, since 1996, DOD \nfunding has decreased by 5.2 percent, and DOE has increased by 7.7 \npercent.\n  We did the best we could. I hope that my colleagues will be \nsupportive of the recommendations that we have made, not only in the \nStrategic Subcommittee but in other subcommittees as well. It is a \ntough job. I don't think there is a member of the committee who doesn't \nfeel that we have gone probably too far, that we need to, perhaps, \nremove that budget firewall and begin to put more dollars into defense. \nBut given the constraints of the budget agreement, we had to do with \nwhat we had.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senators Thurmond, Levin, and Bingaman for the \ncooperation that we have had together, especially Senator Bingaman on \nthe subcommittee who has always been courteous to me.\n  I want to thank Eric Thoemmes, Paul Longsworth, and Monica Chavez of \nthe Armed Services Committee staff, and John Luddy, Brad Lovelace, and \nSteve Hellyar of my own staff as well.\n  I would be happy to yield the floor, Madam President. I see others \nwho wish to speak.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges \nof the floor be granted to Adam Pawluk, Chrissie Timpe, and Meg \nDimeling for today's session of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to reflect on the \nbusiness at hand today; that is, our Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Three hours ago, I had the privilege of joining a couple of my \ncolleagues at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during a very somber, \nserious ceremony to exhume the remains of the unknown Vietnam veteran \nfrom the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. If you have followed this, as all \nof our colleagues in this body and most of America have, you are aware \nthat through sophisticated, primarily DNA testing--and you, Mr. \nPresident, of all people understand this very well--we now are going to \nbe able to identify almost all remains from the Vietnam war.\n  I begin my remarks this afternoon with that reflection because what \nwe are about here today is serious business. It is about the business \nof national defense--defending America's interests in the world. It is \ncostly, it is serious, and at some times it is devastating. It is \ndevastating for the families who lose loved ones in crisis, in war, in \nconflict.\n  But when I say it is costly, Mr. President, I mean costly. As one who \nhas spent some time in the Armed Forces, who is somewhat familiar with \nthe sacrifices that we ask of our men and women and their families, I \nam as concerned today about the defense capabilities of our armed \nservices as I have been since the late 1970s. Not that our men and \nwomen, our warriors, are not up to the task, but I fear what we are \ndoing to our men and women who have committed their lives to the \ndefense of freedom and the defense of this Nation is that we are not \nproviding them, we are not making to them, the kind of commitment in \nthe resources they need to do their job.\n  We are asking--and this has been the case over the last 10 years--our \nArmed Forces to do more with less--more deployments, longer \ndeployments. And as you look at our Defense Department budgets, this \nfiscal year 1999 budget represents the 14th consecutive year of decline \nin defense spending. In real dollars, I think the American public \nshould know that this budget represents $3 billion less than current \nlevels and about a 40-percent drop from the spending levels of the mid \nto late 1980s.\n  I compliment my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for \ndealing with a difficult issue. I especially compliment Chairman \nThurmond, who, I understand, will lead this authorization bill fight \nfor the last time. His commitment to his country is not only exemplary \nbut it is truly unmatched in this Chamber. There is no one who \nunderstands this business better than Chairman Thurmond and who \nunderstands what I am talking about today.\n  I will jump to the conclusion of my remarks by saying this. It is \ntime the Congress of the United States be direct and honest with the \nAmerican public and say what needs to be said, and that is, we need to \nincrease spending for our Defense Department. We need to increase \nspending. Any measurement you take of where we are in inflation-\nadjusted dollars, this year's defense budget represents the smallest, \nin real dollars, the smallest Defense Department budget since the \nbeginning of the Korean war. We have the smallest military in nearly 50 \nyears.\n  I am astounded that the President of the United States comes before \nthe Congress and the American public and says we have the smallest \nGovernment ever. First of all, we don't have the smallest Government \never; a $1.7 trillion Government is rather significant. But he is half \nright; we have a military that we have continued to hollow out over the \nlast 10 years. We will pay a severe price for what we are doing to our \nArmed Forces capability.\n  About 3 percent of our gross domestic product today, less than half \nof what we had in the 1980's, goes to defense\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nspending. By any measurement you take of this issue of research, \nacquisition, and deployment of new weapons systems, we are relying on \naging and older equipment.\n  I had an interesting conversation over the weekend at the airport in \nOmaha, NE. It was with two DOD auditors who have been with the DOD, \nauditing systems equipment, for almost 30 years. Each of them told me \nindependently that they have never seen such a situation since the late \n1970s. When they are auditing military orders to cannibalize equipment \nin order to get spare parts off of our jets, off of our ships, off of \nour military vehicles, something is drastically wrong when that \nhappens, drastically wrong.\n  I hear very interesting commentary from the Secretary of Defense, \nwhom I admire greatly, about, if you would just close more bases, that \nwould give us more money and free up the resources. Well, that may do \nsome of that, but what is interesting is that it does not give you any \nmore manpower, and in fact in the President's budget this year he calls \nfor cutting 36,000 uniformed men and women from military service, \n12,000 Reserve men and women. How can we, in fact, focus the resources \nand make the commitment we need to make to our men and women who defend \nthis Nation?\n  Let's remember something. National defense is the guarantor of our \nforeign policy. Without a national defense, we have no foreign policy. \nYet we continue to ask our men and women in uniform to do more. Since \n1990, our Armed Forces have been used in 36 foreign missions compared \nto 22 from 1980 to 1989. The Army decreased its manpower by 36 percent \nwhile increasing the workload by over 300 percent. Since 1989, the Air \nForce personnel have been cut by one-third yet the number of missions \nhas quadrupled. From October to January of last year, we lost over 600 \nAir Force jet pilots. The Army estimated in 1997 that its deployable \nunits spent 180 to 190 days away from home each year. This was before--\nbefore--the recent escalation of our forces in the Persian Gulf.\n  The Army Chief of Staff, General Dennis Reimer recently said, ``Our \nrequirements exceed our people to man those requirements.''\n  Let's look at the quality of life. Let's ask what we are doing for \nthe men and women we are asking to commit, in some cases, their lives; \nwhat we are asking them to do and what we are giving in return--not \nonly the increasing rate of deployment, longer deployment, cutting \ntheir time with families, impacting their quality of life, but what \nabout housing? It is disgraceful. Last year, the outgoing Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, said that, ``* * \n* we have family housing that we ought not be asking our folks to live \nin.''\n  In the Air Force alone there are over 41,000 families on waiting \nlists for decent housing. In my State of Nebraska, at Offutt Air Force \nBase alone, there is a terrible need for decent housing. When I say \ndecent housing, I don't mean villas, I mean running water, hot water, \nplaster not falling from the ceiling, windows not broken out. These \npeople in our Armed Forces are not asking for palaces. How do we expect \nthe men and women in our Armed Forces, as we send them, deploy them all \nover the world, to concentrate on the serious business before them if \nthey are worried about their families at home because we in the \nCongress and the President are not paying attention to focusing on the \nresources that our men and women need?\n  Military pay lags 13 percent behind that of the private sector. By \nthe Department of Defense's own estimates, more than 23,000 men and \nwomen in uniform, and their families, are eligible for food stamps. \nWhat does this do to retention, recruitment and readiness? That is the \nessence of a capable military. The Army has fallen short of its \nrecruitment goal for the first time since 1979--the first time. And the \npercentage of recruits in the United States Army with high school \ndiplomas is declining. Since Desert Storm, the percentage of Navy petty \nofficers who say they intend to make the Navy a career has dropped by \n10 percent.\n  Look at the world today. Is it getting safer? Need we really look \nbeyond what happened earlier this week with the atomic testing done by \nIndia? We have major troop deployments around the world today: 37,000 \ntroops in South Korea, major deployments of forces in the Middle East, \nJapan, Europe, Bosnia. And what about the flash points that are there \ntoday, the real possibilities of conflict south of Bosnia, Kosovo? What \nis yet to happen on the subcontinent of Asia with Pakistan and India? I \nwill be in the Caspian Sea region in 2 weeks--a tinderbox. Are we \nprepared?\n  The end of the cold war has reduced some threat. But now is no time \nto not only withdraw American leadership but to withdraw the commitment \nto our Armed Forces. Our armed services are the capability that we are \nrelying on to protect our national interests, our role in the world, to \nguarantee our foreign policy. That will not be done by hollowing out \nour military. Today we see a world that is shifting globally in its \ngeopolitical, economic, and military power structures. We cannot allow \nAmerica to become weaker, or withdraw from that world. Now is not the \ntime. Now is the time for America to project its leadership and help \nform and help craft and help incentivize and lead the world to more \nfreedom. You cannot accomplish that with an unprepared military.\n  I looked at the President's budget again this week, his fiscal year \n1999 budget. The President proposes $123 billion in new domestic \nprograms, but again proposes to cut our military budget. Surely now--\nsurely America's national interests and our national security has some \npriority in this budget.\n\n  As we step back for a moment and survey the world as it is--not as we \nhope or wish it will be, but as it is--if we in fact are, and I believe \nwe are, capable of taking advantage of the tremendous opportunities and \nhopes and the series of historical consequences and events that have \ncome together in a rather magnificent way to make the world better, it \nis going to require American leadership. Not that we need to shoulder \nall the burden--of course not. But part of that American leadership is \na national security worthy of who we are and a commitment to the people \nthat we ask daily to defend our Nation--a commitment to give them the \nresources they need.\n  I would say finally, Mr. President, to me a part of that commitment \nis not to underfund our military but, in fact, it is to start \nrebuilding our military. I hope as this issue develops and debate \ndevelops, that the issue we are about today will extend far beyond the \nnarrowness of the focus that we debate today, but interconnects with \nthe future and our leadership, and much of that future resides at the \ncore of our national defense capabilities.\n  I thank my colleagues who serve on the Armed Services Committee for \ntheir efforts, their leadership, and their lives that many have devoted \nto making this a more secure world and helping our military.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank my able colleague from Nebraska \nfor his kind words about me. I also wish to thank him for the great \nservice he has rendered this country here in the Senate. He is an \nexpert on defense matters and his opinions are certainly worth the \nconsideration of every Senator here.\n  Again, it is a pleasure to serve with him. I wish him continued \nsuccess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield just for \none moment?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I simply want to add my thanks to the Senator from \nNebraska. Every year when this bill comes up, he is here. It is a very \nimportant contribution which he is making to the national defense. We \non the Armed Services Committee do the best we can, but we have \ncolleagues such as the Senator from Nebraska who add their immense \nexpertise and passion and feeling about these issues, and it is \nsignificantly important to us and I thank the Senator for doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Hutchinson \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n                Amendment No. 2401 to Amendment No. 2387\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2388 and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), for himself and \n     Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 2388.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end the following new sections:\n\n     SEC. ____. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Customs Service has identified goods, \n     wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or \n     manufactured under conditions of convict labor, forced labor, \n     and indentured labor in several countries.\n       (2) The United States Customs Service has actively pursued \n     attempts to import products made with forced labor, resulting \n     in seizures, detention orders, fines, and criminal \n     prosecutions.\n       (3) The United States Customs Service has taken 21 formal \n     administrative actions in the form of detention orders \n     against different products destined for the United States \n     market, found to have been made with forced labor, including \n     products from the People's Republic of China.\n       (4) The United States Customs Service does not currently \n     have the tools to obtain the timely and in-depth verification \n     necessary to identify and interdict products made with forced \n     labor that are destined for the United States market.\n\n     SEC. ____. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS PERSONNEL TO \n                   MONITOR THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH \n                   FORCED LABOR.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated for monitoring by \n     the United States Customs Service of the importation into the \n     United States of products made with forced labor, the \n     importation of which violates section 307 of the Tariff Act \n     of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code, \n     $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1999.\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON FORCED LABOR PRODUCTS \n                   DESTINED FOR THE UNITED STATES MARKET.\n\n       (a) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of \n     Customs shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report on \n     products made with forced labor that are destined for the \n     United States market.\n       (b) Contents of Report.--The report under subsection (a) \n     shall include information concerning the following:\n       (1) The extent of the use of forced labor in manufacturing \n     products destined for the United States market.\n       (2) The volume of products made with forced labor, destined \n     for the United States market, that is in violation of section \n     307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or section 1761 of the title \n     18, United States Code, and is seized by the United States \n     Customs Service.\n       (3) The progress of the United States Customs Service in \n     identifying and interdicting products made with forced labor \n     that are destined for the United States market.\n\n     SEC. ____. RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED \n                   LABOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     determine whether any country with which the United States \n     has a memorandum of understanding with respect to reciprocal \n     trade which involves goods made with forced labor is \n     frustrating implementation of the memorandum. Should an \n     affirmative determination be made, the President should \n     immediately commence negotiations to replace the current \n     memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective \n     procedures for the monitoring of forced labor, including \n     improved procedures to request investigations of suspected \n     prison labor facilities by international monitors.\n\n     SEC. ____. DEFINITION OF FORCED LABOR.\n\n       As used in sections ____ through ____ of this Act, the term \n     ``forced labor'' means convict labor, forced labor, or \n     indentured labor, as such terms are used in section 307 of \n     the Tariff Act of 1930.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Abraham of Michigan, as an original \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and, again, \nit was noncontroversial when it was voted on in the House of \nRepresentatives. In fact, the language in this amendment passed the \nHouse with almost unanimous support. Having served in the House 4 \nyears, I know this happens rarely. It was a 419-to-2 vote. So, it had \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  This amendment will simply do two things: First, it will express the \nsense of the Congress that the President should replace any memorandums \nof understanding on prison labor that lack effective monitoring \nprocedures like the one negotiated with the People's Republic of China \nand replace the agreement with a stricter monitoring system.\n  Second, the bill authorizes $2 million in additional funds for the \nU.S. Customs Service to monitor the importation of slave-labor-produced \ngoods. As everyone in this body knows, the importation of goods made by \nconvicts has been banned for more than a half a century. This law \nunderscores Americans' firm conviction that such products produced by \ncoerced and forced labor should not be sold in this country. I believe \nAmericans are repulsed by the very thought of benefiting from cheap \nprices on products produced by the sweat and blood of foreign \nprisoners.\n  Despite this ban, products made in Communist China's vast archipelago \nof slave labor camps, known as the laogai, continue to flow into this \ncountry unabated. This system of laogai, a word meaning reform through \nlabor, was designed for the dual purposes of political control and \nforced economic development. Interestingly, this system is modeled on \nStalin's Soviet Gulag, which we all remember was exposed most \ngraphically by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.\n  This system of forced labor, slave labor, has been an integral part \nof Chinese totalitarianism since the inception of the People's Republic \nof China in 1949. Harry Wu, a survivor of the laogai, and a friend of \nmine, has estimated that some 50 million Chinese men and women have \npassed through these camps, of whom 15 million have perished. Today, \nanywhere from 6 to 8 million people are captive in the 1,100 camps of \nlaogai, held and forced to work under grossly inhumane conditions.\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\n  According to official statistics, the laogai operate 140 export \nenterprises selling products to over 70 nations abroad, including the \nUnited States. These enterprises are responsible for producing key \ncommodities, including uranium, graphite, rubber, cotton, asbestos, and \none-third of Chinese tea is produced in these slave labor camps, as \nwell as a huge array of consumer goods, including toys, artificial \nflowers and, ironically, Christmas lights and rosaries.\n  When I went to China in January, I asked to visit a laogai prison. In \nfact, I asked every day. I asked repeatedly, and repeatedly, but my \nrequests to visit a laogai prison were denied. Fortunately, one of my \ncolleagues in the House on an earlier trip, Representative Frank Wolf, \nwas able to visit Beijing Prison No. 1. This is the exterior of that \nprison camp that Congressman Wolf visited, a prison camp that includes \na slave labor industry.\n  This second photo shows us the picture of the Beijing hosiery \nfactory. This is located inside of that prison camp.\n  The third photo actually shows the assembly line where these products \nare made.\n  In this prison, Mr. Wolf found slave laborers producing socks on this \nassembly line. I have some of the very socks produced on that assembly \nline which Mr. Wolf brought back. You can see the socks. This \nparticular pair was determined to be for export. This is not just a \nmatter of laogai slave labor prisons, which would be horrific enough, \nthat would be bad enough, but these particular products were made for \nexport to other countries.\n  When I was in China, I saw many things. One thing I did not see was \nany golf courses, but the logo on these socks is a person swinging a \ngolf club, obviously not intended for sale within China but for sale on \nthe foreign market.\n\n  Although the United States entered into binding agreements with China \nin 1992 and 1994 to bar trade in prison labor products and to allow \ninspection of its forced-labor camps, the Chinese Government has \nfrustrated their implementation, both by using dual names to disguise \ncamp products and by denying access to those slave labor camps.\n  In 1996, the Chinese Government granted access to just one prison \nlabor camp. Out of the whole laogai system, access in 1996 was granted \nto only one that had been requested by the U.S. Customs Service.\n  Mr. President, the following two charts show examples of laogai \nprison camps that have never been inspected, though the request has \nbeen made to visit. These photos were taken, obviously, outside the \ncamp. This is laogai slave labor camp No. 5 and Zhejiang laogai slave \nlabor camp. Both of these labor camps--we have a second picture as \nwell--show individuals going into the camp. These pictures were \nobtained by the Laogai Research Foundation.\n  Mr. President, the two most recent State Department human rights \nreports on China state that ``Repeated delays in arranging prison labor \nsite visits called into question the government's intention regarding \nthe implementation of the two agreements.''\n  So we have two agreements with China which were to provide for \ninspections of these camps in which these kinds of products are made to \ncompete with American workers. According to our State Department, we \nhave found, instead of cooperation, obstructionism and delays in \narranging for visits to those labor camps.\n  Obviously, I think this indicates that the Chinese Government is not \nintent on cooperating with us on trying to ensure that the products \nproduced are not being sold domestically or to the foreign market and \nthat humane conditions prevail in these camps.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has already banned 27 different products of \nlaogai camps. Unfortunately, in testimony before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, on May 22, 1997, the Customs Commissioner George \nWeise noted that the Customs Service is too weak and understaffed to \nmonitor China's slave labor enterprises.\n  Specifically, he said:\n\n       We simply do not have the tools within our present arsenal \n     at Customs to gain the timely and in depth verification that \n     we need.\n\n  I want to say I do not know whether he is accurate in that contention \nor not. I would not presume to say whether or not the Customs Service \nactually has the resources to do the job or not. But I want them to \nhave no excuse; I do not want them to be able to come to the House or \nto the Senate, to our committees, our oversight committees, and say, we \nsimply cannot do the job that we are mandated to do in ensuring that \nthese products are not being sold in the United States of America that \nare being produced in these slave labor camps.\n  These expansive forced-labor camps operate at very low costs even in \nrelation to China's lower wage scale, thus providing them a competitive \nadvantage over other firms and giving them sizable profit margins that \nhelp to fund the Chinese Government. The laogai are in a win-win \nsituation. It is a win-win for China. They help maintain their \npolitical control and indoctrination of the citizenry, and they funnel \nmoney into their treasury through these slave labor enterprises. \nAmerican businesses that use wage-earning employees are being placed at \na competitive disadvantaged by less scrupulous competitors who use this \nillegal source of artificially cheap labor.\n  These socks are the kind of thing they are producing. And they are \nproducing them with slave labor, prisoners who are being paid little, \nif anything. And those laborers are competing with American workers, \nplacing our workers at an incredible disadvantage. As more businesses \nrely on Chinese slave labor and slave-labor-produced goods, U.S. \nemployment in these industries fall. Thus, despite the productivity \nadvantage of U.S. labor--and I do not believe there is a better worker \nin the world; I do not believe there are harder workers in the world \nthan the American worker--but in spite of that high productivity, how \ncan we ask them to compete? And, in fact, they cannot compete against \nlow- or no-cost employment in the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, I doubt American consumers would knowingly fund a \nStalinist system of forced labor and repression. That is why they \nsupport laws banning this practice and expect the U.S. Government to do \neverything possible to ensure that such products are not sold in the \nUnited States. Yet because of the lax enforcement and the open Chinese \ndisregard for United States law, Americans are being duped into buying \nproducts made by slave laborers. I think that is unfortunate. I think \nthey are doing so unwittingly. But I think we have to do a better job \nto ensure, in monitoring those products that are coming into this \ncountry, that they are not made in inhumane, slave labor conditions \nthat exist in hundreds of prisons in China today.\n  That is why this is a modest--what I would call a baby step, this is \na minimalist approach. This is the least we can do, to simply give $2 \nmillion to the Customs Service and say we have to have better \nmonitoring of these products. We have a moral obligation to do \neverything in our power to stop slave labor and to end the flow of \nslave-labor-produced goods in this country which will stop the flow of \nprofits or at least slow the flow of profits into the PRC. I think it \nis a rational first step, a small step but a rational step.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join 419 Members of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives by passing this amendment to increase the Customs \nService enforcement funding and to reach agreements that give the \nCustoms Service the powers they need to end this bloody trail.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would like to inquire of the Senator, here he \nprovides $2 million to be used to handle this situation. Will that come \nout of the defense bill?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the chairman, I would presume that the $2 \nmillion--this is an amendment to the Department of Defense bill, so I \nwould assume the $2 million would come out of the defense bill. And $2 \nmillion, I might add--if I might inquire of the chairman, the total \nbudget, the total amount authorized in the defense bill, is how much?\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. If that comes out of defense, then I will have to \noppose the amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I simply say that the national security of the United \nStates--part of that is ensuring that the People's Liberation Army and \nthe Chinese Government not receive resources and revenues through \nproducts produced by slave labor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am glad to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. To answer the chairman's point, it does not come out of \ndefense. It just authorizes the Department of Treasury to allocate $2 \nmillion.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Two million dollars.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For this purpose.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank my colleague for that clarification.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It does not come out of this.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the chairman, may I clarify my previous \nresponse that in fact it would not come from the Department of Defense, \nnot come from the defense budget, but authorizes $2 million from the \nDepartment of Treasury. So it would not in any way intrude upon that \nwhich your committee has sought to ensure adequate defenses for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you for the clarification.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2402 to Amendment No. 2388\n\n(Purpose: To increase monitoring of imported products made with forced \n          or indentured labor and forced or indentured child)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the Hutchinson \namendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 2402 to amendment \n     No. 2388.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Customs Service has identified goods, \n     wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or \n     manufactured under conditions of convict labor, forced labor, \n     or indentured labor, in several countries.\n       (2) The United States Customs Service has made limited \n     attempts to prohibit the import of products made with forced \n     labor, resulting in only a few seizures, detention orders, \n     fines, and criminal prosecutions.\n       (3) The United States Customs Service has taken 21 formal \n     administrative actions in the form of detention orders \n     against different products destined for the United States \n     market, found to have been made with forced labor, including \n     products from the People's Republic of China.\n       (4) However, the United States Customs Service has never \n     formally investigated or pursued enforcement with respect to \n     attempts to import products made with forced or indentured \n     child labor.\n       (5) The United States Customs Service can use additional \n     resources and tools to obtain the timely and in-depth \n     verification necessary to identify and interdict products \n     made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced \n     or indentured child labor, that are destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (6) The International Labor Organization estimates that \n     approximately 250,000,000 children between the ages of 5 and \n     14 are working in developing countries, including millions of \n     children in bondage or otherwise forced to work for little or \n     no pay.\n       (7) Congress has clearly indicated in Public Law 105-61, \n     Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations, 1998, that forced or \n     indentured child labor constitutes forced labor under section \n     307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307).\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS PERSONNEL TO \n                   MONITOR THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH \n                   FORCED OR INDENTURED LABOR.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 to the United States Customs Service to \n     monitor the importation of products made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor, \n     the importation of which violates section 307 of the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON FORCED LABOR OR INDENTURED \n                   LABOR PRODUCTS DESTINED FOR THE UNITED STATES \n                   MARKET.\n\n       (a) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Customs \n     shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report on products \n     made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced \n     or indentured child labor that are destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (b) Contents of Report.--The report under subsection (a) \n     shall include information concerning the following:\n       (1) The extent of the use of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor in \n     manufacturing or mining products destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (2) The volume of products made or mined with forced labor \n     or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child \n     labor that is--\n       (A) destined for the United States market,\n       (B) in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \n     or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code, and\n       (C) seized by the United States Customs Service.\n       (3) The progress of the United States Customs Service in \n     identifying and interdicting products made with forced labor \n     or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child \n     labor that are destined for the United States market.\n\n     SEC. 4. RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED \n                   LABOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     determine whether any country with which the United States \n     has a memorandum of understanding with respect to reciprocal \n     trade that involves goods made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor \n     is frustrating implementation of the memorandum. If an \n     affirmative determination be made, the President should \n     immediately commence negotiations to replace the current \n     memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective \n     procedures for the monitoring of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor. The \n     memorandum of understanding should include improved \n     procedures for requesting investigations of suspected work \n     sites by international monitors.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITION OF FORCED LABOR.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``forced labor'' means convict labor, \n     forced labor, or indentured labor, as such terms are used in \n     section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The term includes \n     forced or indentured child labor--\n       (1) that is exacted from any person under 15 years of age, \n     either in payment for the debts of a parent, relative, or \n     guardian, or drawn under false pretexts; and\n       (2) with respect to which such person is confined against \n     the person's will.\n         Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n         ``For purposes of this section, forced or indentured \n     labor includes forced or indentured child labor.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a second degree to the Hutchinson \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add my name to the Hutchinson amendment as \na cosponsor; and Senator Wellstone also wanted to be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have spoken with the author of the pending amendment, \nand I am very supportive of Senator Hutchinson's amendment. This is a \nfriendly amendment, which he accepts. My amendment does not in any way \nchange the intent of the Hutchinson amendment nor does it add any more \nmoney.\n  Basically, this amendment reflects the intent of Congress to include \nforced and indentured child labor in the interpretation of section 307 \nof the Tariff Act of 1930.\n  The Congress spoke with one voice when it instructed the U.S. Customs \nService to block from entry into the United States any imports made by \nforced or indentured child labor, as they are inherently for imports \nmade with forced and indentured labor.\n  This clarification of congressional intent was part of the fiscal \nyear 1998 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill which the President has \nsigned into law. So, again, this amendment does not change anything \nreally of the Hutchinson amendment. It simply adds forced and \nindentured child labor as part of the amendment.\n  As I said, it preserves the congressional intent passed last year. \nThe U.S. Customs Service will still be able to aggressively pursue \nitems made with convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor, and \nprevent them from reaching our shores. They should rightly do so. That \nis why I am supportive of the Hutchinson amendment.\n  Again, the reason this is necessary is a little over a year ago--\nactually about 2 years ago now--I contacted the Treasury Department to \nask if section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 covered forced and \nindentured child labor.\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\n  I got a letter back saying, well, they did not know. They needed \nclarification. Last year, under the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill, we provided that clarification that it indeed covered forced and \nindentured child labor. And that is what my amendment does here; it \njust adds those words back in there.\n  And, again, it should be added because in many cases these children \nare like slaves. They are sold, maybe sometimes for an outstanding debt \nthat is owed to a family. They are traded like cattle. Typically what \nhappens is, a child is sold into a factory or plant as a payment for an \noutstanding debt. The middle man, a loan shark, transfers the child to \na work setting far away from his home. And these kids literally work as \nvirtual slaves doing anything from making rugs to soccer balls to \nserving as prostitutes, to breaking bricks or mining granite or making \nglassware. Many times these kids are never released from their bondage \nuntil they get too old to do the work. They are punished severely; a \nlot of times they work 12 to 15 hours a day.\n\n  Mr. President, last year I visited a place out of New Delhi called \nthe Muki Ashram, or ``liberation retreat'' established in 1991 by \nKailash Satiyarti, president of the South Asian Coalition on Child \nServitude, located right outside of New Delhi, a place where bonded \nchild laborers are freed from the shackles of slavery. They are brought \nthere, they are rehabilitated, they are able to go to school, learn a \ntrade and regain their sense of self-worth. I was deeply moved by this \nestablishment.\n  I saw somewhere between 50 and 100 kids who were there, many as young \nas 8 years of age, many of whom had been beaten. I saw kids that had \nmarks still on their face and their arms where they had been burned \nwith red-hot pokers and things like that. These kids were now being \ntaught in a school, provided nutrition. As I said, they get their sense \nof self-worth back.\n  I have two stories here of two of the kids who I saw when I was \nthere. I ask unanimous consent that these two stories be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Story of Exploited Child\n\n       Mohan, a seven year old boy exploited by a carpet loom \n     owner. He was taken away by a dalal from his native village \n     of Bihar to a carpet loom in Allahabad, U.P. Labour recruiter \n     (Dalal) came to his parents and lured them by giving false \n     promises of a good life and bright future of Mohan Kumar.\n       After reaching Allahabad, his cruel employer treated him \n     just like an animal, Mohan was forced to work for 16-18 hours \n     a day. While working he was beaten very frequently by his \n     master or his attendant. Some times he passed sleepless night \n     due to pain, but nobody was taking care of him. In the name \n     of food, he was given only two chapaties, and forced to eat \n     at the same place where he worked. He was guarded by the \n     attendant of his master in the night and even not allowed to \n     go for routine work alone.\n       One day Mohan was weeping to go to meet his parents at the \n     very moment, his cruel employer hitted him by a pointed \n     weapon. His left eye had injured. His parents came to know of \n     his pathetic condition, they reported the matter to the \n     activists of BBA-SACCS. A raid and rescue operation was \n     organized by activists of BBA-SACCS for releasing of Mohan \n     Kumar.\n       After releasing, Mohan Kumar joined Mukti Ashram, he was \n     suffering from the traumatic effects. Still he has the mark \n     of that brutal act of his master under his left eye. Slowly \n     and gradually, he accustomed with the environment of Mukti \n     Ashram and recovered from the traumatic effect. He began to \n     taking interest in his studies. Now his ambition to become a \n     Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM) so that, he can help to those \n     miserable children, who are in bondage.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Smile Even When You Are in Trouble\n\n       One fine morning Nageshwar sang while walking in Mukti \n     Ashram's garden--``Smile and sing even when you are in \n     trouble.'' For every winter follows spring as the dawn \n     follows dusk.\n       And the Mukti Ashram celebrated it, Everyone, children and \n     teachers were singing and dancing, `Thank God! Nageshwar's \n     voice came back, which he lost for more than three weeks.\n       Nageshwar comes from a remote district of Bihar. When he \n     was seven and playing with his two younger brothers, a Dalal \n     (Labour recruiter) came along with four children of the same \n     age of Nageshwar lured him by giving some sweets and false \n     promise of a good life and bright future. Due to allurement, \n     Nageshwar and his brothers were ready to go with Dalal. Dalal \n     taken away them to a carpet loom situated in the remote area \n     of Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh.\n       Carpet loom owner treated him just like a slave. Nageshwar \n     was forced to work for 18 to 20 hours a day even some times \n     for whole night also. While weaving the carpet his cruel \n     employer often beat him brutally with a panja ( a tool used \n     in carpet weaving). In the name of food, Nageshwar's employer \n     given him two chapaties with salt twice a day and forced to \n     eat. Nageshwar has no separate place to sleep and forced to \n     sleep only for two hours in the same place where he worked.\n       It was November 1st, 1995 the acts of barbarism against \n     Nageshwar reached their peak. Around mid night after \n     Nageshwar had helped his two younger brothers to escape from \n     the continuous harassment, physical torture and tyranny they \n     had been suffering for years, his employer punished him with \n     red hot iron rod, causing irreparable damage to his body. \n     Nageshwar cried and cried--`Oh God, Oh father' but no body \n     was their to help him.\n       When the villagers noticed the sign of this torture they \n     reported to BBA-SACCS. November 4th 1995 was the independence \n     day for Nageshwar. On that day Nageshwar and his younger \n     brothers and other four children were released with the great \n     efforts of the activists of BBA-SACCS.\n       When Nageshwar came to the Mukti Ashram, he was ``shell \n     shocked'', and lost his speech. After a month of \n     comprehensive medical treatment and special care and \n     attention from other children and the Ashram staff, he became \n     able to speak and express his feelings Slowly and gradually \n     he had begun to enjoy the life of Mukti Ashram.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I want to make it clear I am very supportive of \nthe Hutchinson amendment. I believe it is a good amendment. This is a \nfriendly amendment--just to add the word ``child.'' In other words, \nunder ``forced and indentured labor'' to include ``forced and \nindentured child labor'' to clarify section 307 of the Tariff Act of \n1930.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Hutchinson amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I may have missed this. Would you clarify it, was \nthis the language that was adopted last year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, this exact language was adopted by both the House \nand the Senate last year on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. But because it was appropriations, it was only good \nfor 1 year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is the problem.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I express my support for the friendly amendment and \nappreciate your support for the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Chair will advise as to the pending \namendment so everybody listening has it clearly in mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment numbered \n2402 offered by the Senator from Iowa as a second-degree amendment to \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. For further clarification, the yeas and nays have not \nbeen ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And therefore the debate and the colloquy on this \namendment should continue. I am advised that we would not be successful \nin a unanimous consent requirement to lay it aside and am perfectly \nwilling at this time to continue debate on the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to modify my amendment to \naccept the Harkin second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2388), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Customs Service has identified goods, \n     wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or \n     manufactured under conditions of convict labor, forced labor, \n     or indentured labor, in several countries.\n       (2) The United States Customs Service has made limited \n     attempts to prohibit the import of products made with forced \n     labor, resulting in only a few seizures, detention orders, \n     fines, and criminal prosecutions.\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\n       (3) The United States Customs Service has taken 21 formal \n     administrative actions in the form of detention orders \n     against different products destined for the United States \n     market, found to have been made with forced labor, including \n     products from the People's Republic of China.\n       (4) However, the United States Customs Service has never \n     formally investigated or pursued enforcement with respect to \n     attempts to import products made with forced or indentured \n     child labor.\n       (5) The United States Customs Service can use additional \n     resources and tools to obtain the timely and in-depth \n     verification necessary to identify and interdict products \n     made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced \n     or indentured child labor, that are destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (6) The International Labor Organization estimates that \n     approximately 250,000,000 children between the ages of 5 and \n     14 are working in developing countries, including millions of \n     children in bondage or otherwise forced to work for little or \n     no pay.\n       (7) Congress has clearly indicated in Public Law 105-61, \n     Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations, 1998, that forced or \n     indentured child labor constitutes forced labor under section \n     307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307).\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS PERSONNEL TO \n                   MONITOR THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH \n                   FORCED OR INDENTURED LABOR.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 to the United States Customs Service to \n     monitor the importation of products made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor, \n     the importation of which violates section 307 of the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON FORCED LABOR OR INDENTURED \n                   LABOR PRODUCTS DESTINED FOR THE UNITED STATES \n                   MARKET.\n\n       (a) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Customs \n     shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report on products \n     made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced \n     or indentured child labor that are destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (b) Contents of Report.--The report under subsection (a) \n     shall include information concerning the following:\n       (1) The extent of the use of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor in \n     manufacturing or mining products destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (2) The volume of products made or mined with forced labor \n     or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child \n     labor that is--\n       (A) destined for the United States market,\n       (B) in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \n     or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code, and\n       (C) seized by the United States Customs Service.\n       (3) The progress of the United States Customs Service in \n     identifying and interdicting products made with forced labor \n     or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child \n     labor that are destined for the United States market.\n\n     SEC. 4. RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED \n                   LABOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     determine whether any country with which the United States \n     has a memorandum of understanding with respect to reciprocal \n     trade that involves goods made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor \n     is frustrating implementation of the memorandum. If an \n     affirmative determination be made, the President should \n     immediately commence negotiations to replace the current \n     memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective \n     procedures for the monitoring of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor. The \n     memorandum of understanding should include improved \n     procedures for requesting investigations of suspected work \n     sites by international monitors.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITION OF FORCED LABOR.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``forced labor'' means convict labor, \n     forced labor, or indentured labor, as such terms are used in \n     section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The term includes \n     forced or indentured child labor--\n       (1) that is exacted from any person under 15 years of age, \n     either in payment for the debts of a parent, relative, or \n     guardian, or drawn under false pretexts; and\n       (2) with respect to which such person is confined against \n     the person's will.\n       Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``For purposes of this section, forced or indentured labor \n     includes forced or indentured child labor.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Mr. Thurmond, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see the Senator from California on the \nfloor and I would like to give her whatever part of my time that might \nbe left because this is in regard to legislation that I think is so \nimportant. It is important for the psychology of the women of America \nwho, unfortunately, will be diagnosed with breast cancer. It is \nimportant in their medical treatment. It is important to their \nfamilies. It is important to the community. It is important to let \npeople know we are serious in our battle to win the fight against \nbreast cancer and to see that those who are diagnosed get the proper \ntreatment and don't have some medical plan or medical director who says \nthat--as a result of the ERISA laws passed more than 20 years ago--we \ndon't have to provide you basic coverage; we don't have to say that \nreconstructive surgery is covered. And, indeed, we have had plans today \nin America where millions of women face being denied basic coverage as \nit relates to cancer and its treatment and the reconstructive surgery \nthat is necessary.\n  On January 30, 1997, Senator Feinstein and myself, along with a dozen \nor more colleagues--now 21--introduced the Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act. We have amended that and, indeed, put some provisions \naside, and we have reduced it to two main parts. No. 1, no bean \ncounter, no statistician can set an arbitrary limit on the length of \ntime that a woman takes after a medical procedure for breast cancer. \nSome plans limit her stay to 24 hours. Imagine that. If there are \ncomplications, it is too bad. She and her family then have to pay for \nany longer stay. That is unconscionable. The decision in terms of the \nlength of stay should be predicated upon the needs of that patient. \nThat determination should be made according to the medical necessity \nand by her physician, not some bean counter who arbitrarily looks at a \npolicy and says, ``We won't pay for more than 24 hours.'' We say that \ndecision should be made as the medical necessity requires.\n\n  The second major provision of that bill is that reconstructive \nsurgery will not be treated as something optional or cosmetic. Let me \nrefer to the case of a young woman. This past February, not that long \nago, her doctor called me. Dr. Wider of Long Island said to me, ``Janet \nFranquet, a 31-year-old woman, needs a radical mastectomy. When I \ncontacted her medical plan, the medical director said that they would \nnot\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nauthorize payment for reconstructive surgery.'' Here is a young woman, \n31 years of age. I called the director of that plan, Dr. Hodos, and I \nsaid to him, ``How could you be saying that this is not necessary?'' He \nsaid, ``Replacement of a breast is not medically necessary and not \ncovered under the plan.'' Then he said, ``This is not a bodily function \nand therefore cannot and should not be replaced.''\n  That is not an isolated case, Mr. President. The women of America--\nour mothers, daughters, sisters, neighbors, friends--should know that \nthey are covered.\n  Let me tell you something. The sorry history of this legislation is \nthat, in spite of Senator Feinstein, myself, Senator Snowe, and I think \nevery woman Senator who signed on to support this bill--I have \ncolleagues who say we should not legislate by body part. Imagine that. \nWe should not mandate that. You are right, we should not have to \nmandate it. But the situation requires that. Then we get others who \nsay, oh, no, we are not going to let you have a vote on this bill until \nor unless you let us have a vote on some other legislation. What \nnonsense--to hold the women of America captive.\n  Senator Feinstein and I, and a number of colleagues, have decided \nthat we will bring this legislation up and offer it as an amendment on \nevery piece of legislation that goes through here that is vital, where \nthere is a bipartisan interest in seeing this pass. We are going to put \nit on. Indeed, at some point in time, we may hold this assembly \nhostage.\n  When the wheels slow down--understand, it is almost a year and a half \nnow we have been trying to get this vote. I don't want people saying we \nare attempting to work our will against the majority. We backed down on \nthe education bill; we took it off the IRS reform bill. We introduced \nthis bill on January 30, 1997, 14 months ago. We brought it up during \nthe consideration of IRS reform. We lost in committee. We got six \nvotes. We brought it up again. In terms of the package that has just \ngone by, we brought it up and it was rejected 6 to 6 during the A+ \neducation bill. We brought it up on the IRS bill during committee and \nwe lost 8 to 10. We brought it up again today and we won 11 to 9. It is \non the tobacco bill and it will be coming to this floor.\n  When people say ``what relevance,'' we are talking about the health \nof American women. Indeed, I am prepared to offer it as an amendment to \nthe defense bill, because we spend defense funds, as Senator Feinstein \nsays, for cancer research and the defense of the families, and the \nwomen of America should not be shelved by partisan considerations or \nsome ideological philosophy that says we can't have mandates. We have \nmandates every day. And some of the same people who voted against this \nbill vote for mandates every day. That is nonsense. It is too bad we \nneed this.\n\n  So this has been reported out 11 to 9 and will be on the tobacco \nbill. I thank the 11 members on the Finance Committee who voted for it. \nBut understand, this Senator is serious. We are going to continue until \nthis ``win'' turns into a real win and America's women do not have to \nbe held hostage any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4875-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I send an amendment to the \ndesk, if I may, I would like to make one comment on the remarks posed \nto the body by the Senator from New York with respect to the \nlegislation that we cosponsored.\n  I want to congratulate him for getting this legislation on the \ntobacco bill.\n  I also want to express my dismay that this route has been taken and \nthat an amendment which is very direct cannot get by this body any \nother way.\n  Mr. President, every day women of this country are being subjected to \na mastectomy being performed in the morning and being pushed out on the \nstreets that afternoon. It is called a ``same-day mastectomy,'' a \n``drive-through mastectomy.'' I never thought in my lifetime that I \nwould see the medical profession in a position where the length of \nhospital stay could not be determined by the physician.\n  All we would do in this amendment is say that the length of a woman's \nhospital stay, having had a mastectomy, would be based on the advice \nand knowledge of her physician. Whether she has a radical mastectomy, \nwhat her reaction to anesthesia is, what her preconditions are, all \nshould be party to that decision, and not some HMO that says henceforth \nall major surgical procedures called mastectomies will be conducted on \na same-day basis. This, to me, is bad medicine.\n  We also, as the Senator said, simply provide that the insurance \ncompany must provide for reconstructive surgery or prosthetic surgery, \nand that the doctor cannot be penalized for recommending additional \ntreatment for the woman.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that we owe this simple gesture to the \nwomen of America, because to say to any woman that she has to go into a \nhospital for major, major surgery and is going to get pushed out on the \nstreet--I would hazard a guess that there isn't a man in this room who \nwants to have major surgery, leave with two to four drains in their \nbody, having had a general anesthetic, and losing a significant portion \nof their torso, and hear, ``You cannot stay overnight in the hospital \nno matter how you feel.''\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\n  So I hope that the leadership of this body, hearing the capacity, the \nenergy, the stubbornness of the Senator from New York, would really \nrealize that the better part of valor is to allow us to have an up-or-\ndown vote on this amendment. It seems to me, humbly stating, that this \nis the way this body should, in fact, function.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I simply would like to say that I have \nnever encountered such graciousness, such tenacity, such great \ndedication to a cause than the Senator from California has given to \nthis effort for the past almost year and a half; and what a great \nfighter she is for all of the families of this country.\n  I thank her. And it is a great privilege and pleasure for me to have \nthe opportunity to work with her in this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4876-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4877-S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2405\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the Indian \n                             Nuclear Tests)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert: Findings:\n       The Government of India conducted an underground nuclear \n     explosion on May 18, 1974;\n       Since the 1974 nuclear test by the Government of India, the \n     United States and its allies have worked extensively to \n     prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons in South \n     Asia;\n       On May 11, 1998, the Government of India conducted \n     underground tests of three separate nuclear explosive \n     devices, including a fission device, a low-yield device, and \n     a thermo-nuclear device;\n       On May 13, 1998 the Government of India conducted two \n     additional underground tests of nuclear explosive devices;\n       This decision by the Government of India has needlessly \n     raised tension in the South Asia region and threatens to \n     exacerbate the nuclear arms race in that region;\n       The five declared nuclear weapons states and 144 other \n     nations have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in \n     hopes of putting a permanent end to nuclear testing;\n       The Government of India has refused to sign the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty;\n       The Government of India has refused to sign the Nuclear \n     Non-Proliferation Treaty;\n       India has refused to enter into a safeguards agreement with \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency covering any of its \n     nuclear research facilities;\n       The Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 requires \n     the President to impose a variety of aid and trade sanctions \n     against any non-nuclear weapons state that detonates a \n     nuclear explosive device;\n       It is the sense of Senate that the Senate\n       (1) Condemns in the strongest possible terms the decision \n     of the Government of India to conduct three nuclear tests on \n     May 11, 1998 and two nuclear tests on May 13, 1998;\n       (2) Supports the President's decision to carry out the \n     provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of \n     1994 with respect to India and invoke all sanctions therein;\n       (3) Calls upon the Government of India to take immediate \n     steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and unnecessary \n     step has caused;\n       (4) Expresses its regret that this decision by the \n     Government of India will, of necessity set back relations \n     between the United States and India;\n       (5) Urges the Government of Pakistan, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China, and all governments to exercise \n     restraint in response to the Indian nuclear tests, in order \n     to avoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in South \n     Asia;\n       (6) Calls upon all governments in the region to take steps \n     to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missiles;\n       (7) Urges the Government of India to enter into a \n     safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency which would cover all Indian nuclear research \n     facilities at the earliest possible time.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill to express the concern of \nthis body and condemnation of the recent Indian nuclear tests.\n  Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate. Before I go into the \nprovisions of it, let me state what I understand the facts to be.\n  In the last 2 days, there have been five underground nuclear tests in \nIndia about 70 miles from the border of Pakistan. According to Prime \nMinister Vajpayee of India, there was a fission device, a low-yield \ndevice, and a thermonuclear device.\n  According to the Carnegie Foundation, India is estimated to have \napproximately 400 kilograms of weapons-usable plutonium. Given that it \ntakes about 6 kilograms of plutonium to construct a basic plutonium \nbomb, this amount would be sufficient for 65 bombs. With a more \nsophisticated design, it is possible that this estimate could go as \nhigh as 90 bombs.\n  India also possesses several different aircraft capable of nuclear \ndelivery, including the Jaguar, the Mirage 2,000, the MiG-27, and the \nMiG-29. India has 2 missile systems potentially capable of delivering a \nnuclear weapon: The Prithvi, which can carry a 1,000-kilogram payload \nto approximately 150 kilometers or a 500-kilometer payload to 250 \nkilometers; and the Agni, a two-stage, medium-range missile which can \nconceivably carry a 1,000-kilogram payload as far as 1,500 to 2,000 \nkilometers.\n  India, according to a report, has possibly deployed, or at the very \nleast is storing, conventionally armed Prithvi missiles in Punjab very \nnear the Pakistani border.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that there are intense feelings \nbetween these two nations. Pakistan and India, up to late, have been \nvery difficult adversaries. More recently--this makes these detonations \neven more concerning--I think there has been a kind of \nrapprochement. And we hopefully were seeing some improvement in the \nrelations between these two countries.\n\n  Mr. President, I can hardly think of a more important issue to the \ninterests of the United States than preventing the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. As the Secretary of State said the other \nday, this Nation has no other agenda than peace and stability \nthroughout the world. And that, indeed, is an agenda to which I believe \nthis body can wholeheartedly subscribe. So each State that acquires \nnuclear weapons creates additional complications in maintaining \ninternational security.\n  In south Asia today it appears to be too late to talk about \npreventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Both countries, India \nand Pakistan, now clearly have nuclear capability. And ultimately India \nmust determine for itself whether its interests are best served by \nridding South Asia of weapons of mass destruction or by turning the \nregion into a potential nuclear battleground. That, I think, is no less \nthe decision that has to be made.\n  We all hope that India will choose the course of deescalation, of \nstanding down, of beginning to reduce its nuclear arsenal and at the \nvery least showing a willingness, now that these underground tests have \nbeen carried out, to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  And, all of us saying to the Pakistani Government, please, we urge \nyou not to respond in kind but to show that, indeed, Pakistan \nunderstands that greatness is not indigenous to nuclear production, I \nbelieve, in the long run, will bring inordinate credibility to the \nGovernment and the people of Pakistan, and the favorable response of \nthis body as well.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I submit today on behalf of Senators \nBrownback, Glenn, Bryan and myself essentially reports what has \nhappened in the last 2 days. It then goes on to say that it is the \nsense of the Senate that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the \ndecision of the Government of India to conduct three nuclear tests on \nMay 11 and two on May 13 and that we support the President's decision \nto carry out the provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act \nof 1994 with respect to India and to invoke all sanctions therein.\n  I might add that the author of that act is a distinguished Member of \nthis body, none other than Senator John Glenn of the great State of \nOhio. And that is a rather comprehensive statement of sanctions that in \nfact can be placed on India. It will effectively terminate assistance \nto that country under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 except for \nhumanitarian assistance or food or other agricultural commodities.\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\n  It will terminate sales to that country of any defense articles, \ndefense services or design and construction services, and licenses for \nthe export to that country of any item on the U.S. munitions list.\n  It will terminate all foreign military financing for that country, \nand it will deny to that country credit, credit guarantees or other \nfinancial assistance by any department, agency or instrumentality of \nthe U.S. Government, except that it will not apply to any transaction \nsubject to the reporting requirement of title V or to humanitarian \nassistance.\n  And it will oppose, in accordance with the International Financial \nInstitutions Act, the extension of any loan or financial or technical \nassistance to that country by any international financial institution \nand prohibit any U.S. bank from making any loan or providing any credit \nto the Government of that country except for loans or credits for the \npurpose of purchasing food or other agricultural commodities.\n  Finally, it will prohibit exports to that country of specific goods \nand technology.\n  My point in reading this, Mr. President, is that these, indeed, are \nstrong sanctions. I believe all Members of this body are in support of \nthe President's decision and this amendment gives us an opportunity to \nsay so.\n  The sense of the Senate also calls upon the Government of India to \ntake immediate steps to reduce tensions that this unilateral and \nunnecessary step has caused. We express our regret that this decision \nby the Government of India will by necessity set back relations between \nthe United States and India, and we urge the Government of Pakistan, \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China and all governments to \nexercise restraint in response to Indian nuclear tests in order to \navoid further exacerbating the nuclear arms race in south Asia.\n  We call upon all governments in the region to take steps to prevent \nfurther proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and we \nurge the Government of India to enter into a safeguards agreement with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency which would cover all Indian \nnuclear research facilities at the earliest possible time.\n  Mr. President, this is the text and sum of this sense-of-the Senate \namendment before this body. I might say, for someone who has taken an \ninterest in India, who has spent time with prior Ambassadors, both of \nIndia and Pakistan, attempting to reconcile differences between the two \ncountries, that these tests come to me personally as a very low blow.\n  I did not think we would see the day when the detonation of these \nnuclear devices would take place. However, that is now past. We have \nseen that day. We hope we learn from that, and we hope, most \nimportantly, that the governments concerned--India, Pakistan, and \nChina--also will recognize the fact that we in this body wish to do \neverything we possibly can to find consensus rather than animus, to put \nan end to the adversarial relationships, and to have sanity and \nsoundness prevail when it comes to nuclear weapons.\n  I thank the Chair. Perhaps I might ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I now see my distinguished colleague. I did not see \nSenator Brownback. Perhaps he would like to comment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I wish to address this body on this very important \nissue. Before I get started, I ask unanimous consent that Terry \nWilliams of my staff be allowed in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Feinstein \namendment. Senator Feinstein and I spoke yesterday about this issue and \nthe need to speak and to act quickly by the United States in a \nstatement of condemnation towards India, of support towards Pakistan, \nto encourage the Pakistanis to stand strong as a nation and not to \nignite and set forth a nuclear weapon and escalate this chain reaction. \nWe put forward this resolution of which I am a cosponsor. I believe it \nis the right and appropriate step for us. She has offered it, and she \nhas been a peacemaker and a peacekeeper for these countries, had their \nrepresentatives in her home to try to get the Ambassadors of these two \nnations to speak together and to not further proliferate but, rather, \nto seek peace. And all of that to no avail as far as the action that \nthe Indian Government has taken this week.\n  We had, yesterday, a hearing in my subcommittee that Senator \nFeinstein attended where we heard of the great problems we are facing \non this entire subcontinent. Indeed, this is probably the most \ndifficult area of the world today and the most problematic, and the \nmost probable flash point that the world is facing today with the use \nof nuclear weapons.\n\n  With the Indians taking this action, five being set off, and then the \nresponse in India, not being one of ``My goodness, what have we \nunleashed, these first devices being set off since 1974 by a \nnonnuclear-weapons state; my gosh, what have we released?'' the \nreaction in the street has been jubilation, which is greater cause for \nconcern, for concern of what is going to happen in Pakistan, which is \nmost likely the next place for there to be a response, whether they \nwould step forward and set off a nuclear weapon themselves, and where \ndo we escalate from there? These two nations have gone to war three \ntimes in the last half century. This, to me, is a grave situation we \nare facing today.\n  The world was duly horrified this week when the Government of India \ndetonated these three nuclear devices. I think India has behaved \nirresponsibly and has relegated itself to the category of an outcast. \nIt is a terrible shame for a great nation. Rather than a celebration in \nthe streets, the people of India should be demonstrating against their \ngovernment for plunging their nation into this international crisis. \nThat is why I support this resolution.\n  South Asia is facing a moment of truth. India has already acted. We \nknow Pakistan is poised to retaliate. I believe we have to have a \nchance--and I want to note this, just a chance--to stop Pakistan, or \nencourage Pakistan from taking a foolish and dangerous step. We must, \nas President Clinton has recognized, do all we can to persuade the \nGovernment of Pakistan to show restraint, moderation, and intelligence. \nDeputy Secretary of State Talbott, Assistant Secretary Inderfurth and \nGeneral Zinni are in Pakistan right now. I support their efforts and \nwish them every success in their discussions with Prime Minister \nSharif.\n  But I think we, too, must act in the U.S. Senate. With this \nresolution, I think we must demonstrate, also, our support for Prime \nMinister Sharif in the face of incredible pressure that he is going to \nhave from his country to respond to India's nuclear tests. That is why \nI believe the Senate should do this, and I also think the Senate should \ngo further. I think we need to take further and even more aggressive \nand bold action to try to encourage the Pakistanis: Don't respond in \nkind.\n  With that, I think we need to act today to repeal the Pressler \namendment as an action we can take, as an overt carrot to hold out to \nthe Pakistanis, saying, ``We believe in your cause. Please, show \nrestraint. Don't go on forward. Don't ignite a nuclear weapon. Don't \ncontinue this chain reaction. And if you don't, we are prepared to move \nforward with removing something that has been a thorn in your side for \nsome time, the Pressler amendment itself.''\n  This is not about rewarding Pakistan or punishing India. This is a \nsignal to Pakistan at a crucial moment. Repealing the Pressler \namendment will have little impact on the ground. Pakistan is already \nsubject to Glenn-Symington sanctions dating back more than a decade. \nThose sanctions already preclude providing Pakistan any assistance \nunder the Foreign Assistance Act.\n  So, in this regard I would like to send an amendment to the desk \nregarding the Pressler amendment and ask for its\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nimmediate consideration. This will be in the form of an amendment to \nthe amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2407 to Amendment No. 2405\n\n     (Purpose: To repeal a restriction on the provision of certain \n              assistance and other transfers to Pakistan)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2407 to amendment No. 2405.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. REPEAL OF RESTRICTION ON CERTAIN ASSISTANCE AND \n                   OTHER TRANSFERS TO PAKISTAN.\n\n       Section 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2375(e)) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I pointed out, I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Feinstein's efforts in this regard, the resolution being put \nforward. I think that is positive and it is a right step to do. I think \nwe need to do that. But I think at this critical juncture we have to \nact even more decisively than what we are doing with this resolution, \nand that is why I am proposing this amendment to the resolution that I \ncosponsor. I think the amendment that Senator Feinstein has put forward \nis the right thing to do.\n  I think, as well, at this very moment in Islamabad and throughout \nPakistan they are considering: How do we respond? What do we do? Should \nwe set off a nuclear weapon ourselves, in this escalating set of \nevents?\n  If you are in Islambad and you are the Prime Minister of this \ncountry, or a parliamentarian, or somebody that's an official in this \nnation, you have to be sitting there saying, What do we do? Is this the \ntime we should show strength in the form of retaliation, in the form of \nsetting off another nuclear weapon, and we get the escalation going on? \nAnd there is pressure building in the streets, and the people in the \nstreets say, ``We need to respond, we need to show strength in the form \nof detonating a nuclear weapon.''\n  We have to do everything we can today to try to encourage the \nPakistanis not to respond in kind. We need to hold out some carrots to \nthem, saying if you will show restraint, if you will show wisdom, if \nyou will show moderation, we can help and we can work with you and here \nis a way. The Pressler amendment has been in place. It has been \npartially repealed over time. We can say to them, If you will show \nrestraint, we are going to move towards lifting this; we are going to \nlift this Pressler amendment.\n  Then they have a different choice to make. They can say, You know, if \nwe don't respond in kind we can get the onus of this off our back that \nwe have tried to have removed for some time. If we do respond in kind, \nthe Glenn amendment automatically hits the Pakistanis as well, and you \nare going to have a wider range of issues and of sanctions that will be \nhitting Pakistan. So now there is a carrot and a big stick sitting out \nthere of, How do we respond? And the pressure is building in the \nstreets in Islamabad and throughout Pakistan of, How do we respond? We \nhave to do everything we can, near term, to stop that and provide them \nsome option and some means and some reason not to set off a nuclear \nweapon.\n  What repealing this outdated, I think, unilateral sanction will do is \nbring Pakistan on the same playing field as the rest of the world and \nwill offer them a carrot. If Pakistan detonates a nuclear weapon, as \nIndia has, it will be subject to the same sanctions as India. And \nbelieve me, I will be the first one to urge that the United States move \nswiftly and decisively to impose the sanctions.\n  It is important that we factor in several considerations as we \nconsider this amendment. The first is that there are multiple laws in \nplace to deal with nuclear proliferators: the Glenn-Symington \namendment, the Glenn amendment, and various others. Pakistan will not, \nand should not, be allowed to get away with nuclear proliferation. \nThere can be no excuse for transgressing international norms or U.S. \nlaws.\n  However, we must also face an important reality. Pakistan, a long-\nterm friend and ally of the United States, is next door to a nation of \n960 million people who just tested five nuclear weapons this week. \nIndia could not have been more clear that it was sending a message to \nChina and as well to Pakistan and the rest of the world. It is not \nunnatural, though it is clearly unwise, for Pakistan to consider its \noptions.\n  Pakistan's conventional military abilities have been seriously eroded \nbecause of the Pressler sanctions. I believe that were Pakistan able to \nbe more reliant on a conventional deterrent the nuclear option might \nseem less attractive. In addition, were Pakistan aware of the immense \ninternational support behind a policy of restraint, so, too, might they \nfeel less threatened and feel like there is something in this for them \nif they show a bit of moderation and a bit of restraint.\n\n  We are at a crucial moment. Failure to take decisive action at this \njuncture could mean disaster in south Asia. I think time is absolutely \nof the essence or I would not have brought it out on this today. \nDecisions are being made now in Islamabad of what reaction they will \ntake to the Indian's action, what they have done this week in \ndetonating five nuclear weapons. Those decisions are being made now. I \nwish we could put this debate off for a month or 2 or 5 months, or a \nyear, but it is now that it counts. It is now that decisions are being \nmade. I hate to rush people towards these sorts of actions, but if we \nfail to act now, with all the potential we have to urge restraint in \nPakistan, I am fearful we will have acted too late and the graphite \nrods will have been pulled out and the chain reaction continues and we \nhave not done everything we possibly can.\n  This is something we can possibly do. I wish it were in another place \non another vehicle. There is no other place or time to be able to do \nthis. I think the base amendment is a good one to pass. I think this \none sends the absolute positive signal to Pakistan, please, please show \nrestraint. That is why I ask consideration of my amendment to the \namendment.\n  At the appropriate time, if necessary, I will be asking for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, regretfully I rise to oppose this \namendment which, in the current heated environment surrounding the \nIndian nuclear tests, seeks to repeal the Pressler amendment.\n  I believe that to put a repeal of the Pressler amendment on this bill \nand to allow the United States to resume military aid to Pakistan would \nbe counterproductive and would contribute to a further destabilization \nof an already unstable South Asian security environment.\n  What would India do in response? I urge the Members of this body, \nwhen considering whether to vote for an imminent repeal of the Pressler \namendment, to think that we are doing this before our people have even \nhad a chance to ascertain what the particulars of this situation are. \nWe are doing it before we have any assessment of what might be the \nresponse to this action. I think that is precipitous, and I think it is \nunfortunate.\n  Most immediately, what would be the effect? A repeal of Pressler \nwould release 28 F-16s which Pakistan purchased in 1989, but due to the \ninability of the President to certify in 1990 that Pakistan does not \npossess a nuclear device----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \ncompletion of this vote, the floor be restored to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2387\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to lay on the table the motion \nreconsider is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2401\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I, as the sponsor of the amendment, \naccept the second-degree amendment by Senator Thomas, ask unanimous \nconsent to vitiate the yeas and nays, and urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays are \nvitiated. Without objection, the second-degree amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 2401) was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the reason for my concern about this \namendment is reflected in the statement that was sent to us by the \nadministration. I very much support the purpose of this amendment. I \nthink it is right on target, and I commend the Senator from Arkansas \nfor focusing on this problem.\n  But the statement of the administration policy raises a concern that \nthe requirement to disclose publicly the list of Chinese military \ncompanies operating directly or indirectly in the United States could \nimplicate classified information that needs to be protected in the \ninterests of national security, i.e., intelligence sources and methods. \nThat is the basis for my concern, and therefore I will vote ``no'' on a \nvoice vote, and I ask unanimous consent that this statement of \nadministration policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1997.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    h.r. 2647--monitoring commercial activities of chinese military \n                companies (fowler (r) fl and 16 others)\n\n       The Administration opposes H.R. 2647 because it is \n     unnecessary and counterproductive. In particular, the \n     Administration opposes the requirement to disclose publicly \n     the list of Chinese military companies operating directly or \n     indirectly in the United States. The requirement for such \n     disclosure could implicate classified information that needs \n     to be protected in the interests of national security, i.e., \n     intelligence sources and methods.\n       The Administration is also seriously concerned about the \n     precedent of authorizing the exercise of authorities under \n     the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \n     without regard to the Act's strict standards of an \n     international threat. H.R. 2647 establishes no clear \n     standards for invoking the IEEPA authorities against Chinese \n     military companies and bears no relation to the effect on the \n     United States of the commercial activities of the designated \n     Chinese companies. If the People's Liberation Army companies, \n     or any other foreign companies, undertake specific illegal \n     activities, there are U.S. laws authorizing a broad range of \n     sanctions. In cases when U.S. law is violated, the \n     Administration can, and will, act to enforce the law.\n\n\n                 Vote On Amendment No. 2387, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2387), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 2388, As Amended, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from \nArkansas has a second amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, amendment No. 2388 is the second \namendment. Has the amendment been modified by the Harkin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been modified.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Once again, this is a good amendment. It was broadly \nsupported in the House on a bipartisan basis. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I again commend my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, on \nthis amendment. I think it is a good amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nI be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2388), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to advise Senators, we will not have \nfurther votes prior to the hour of 5 o'clock. My understanding is the \nSenator from Oklahoma has an amendment which he wishes to bring to the \nSenate. I am hopeful we could accommodate a few more minutes of debate, \nwhich the Senator from California had asked for, on her amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Virginia yield on that point?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe we did enter a unanimous consent agreement that \nthe Senator from California be recognized after the disposition of the \nHutchinson amendments, since she was in the middle of her remarks at \nthe time that the regular order required us to begin the last votes.\n  I am wondering if we could just spend 30 seconds seeing if the \nSenator from California would like the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join in that request, and then the \nSenate can proceed to the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I ask \nunanimous consent that following the remarks of the Senator from \nCalifornia, the Senate proceed to the amendment that will be submitted \nby the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nCalifornia is on her way and will be here in a few moments. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I had been asked previously by the \nSenator from Iowa that he be listed as a cosponsor of the amendment I \nput forward. I ask unanimous consent that while we are waiting that he \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold? Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Oklahoma be recognized for 5 minutes at \nthis time and then the Senator from California regain recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I want to make a couple of \ncomments concerning the defense authorization bill of 1999 and how it \naffects readiness.\n  Over the past several years, a number of military officers have \nexpressed deep concerns regarding the trends in the operational \nreadiness of the Armed Forces. Last year, these trends led one military \nofficer to state, ``The storm clouds are on the horizon.''\n  This was a year in which most of the Armed Forces were ready to meet \ntheir wartime mission, but in order to do so\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nin a resource-constrained environment, they were forced to resort to \ncost-saving practices which could impact negatively on our wartime \nreadiness.\n  For example, the Marine Corps began using retreaded tires. This had \nnot been done before. We have no way of knowing how these will perform \nin the case of some type of a Persian Gulf or Middle East desert-type \nof operation.\n  While the overall readiness of forward deployed units remains \nadequate, this is increasingly accomplished at the expense of \nnondeployed units. According to Vice Admiral Browne, Commander of the \nNavy's Third Fleet: ``More today than in the past, forward deployed \nreadiness is being maintained with the slimmest of margins and at the \nexpense of CONUS based training and increased individual PERS- TEMPO.''\n  He went on to say: ``To get the U.S.S. Denver underway early as part \nof the Tarawa ARG amphibious readiness group, two other ships were \ncannibalized for parts.''\n  Furthermore, Colonel Bozarth of the Air Force's 388th Operations \nGroup stated: ``The people that pay the price, though, are the folks \nthat are back home. Because if you take a wing like ours, 5 years ago, \nin 1993, we were looking at full mission capable rates in the nineties. \nIn the 1995-1997 timeframe, we are looking at mission capable rates in \nthe eighties. Now we are down into the lower seventies.''\n\n  Unfortunately, there are reports that even the readiness of the \nforward deployed units is beginning to suffer. According to naval \nofficers in the Pacific, 20 percent of the deployed planes on the \ncarriers are grounded awaiting spare parts and other maintenance, all \nthe time cannibalization of the aircraft is taking place. It has gone \nup 15 percent over the past year. In fact, Admiral Browne recently \nacknowledged that, ``Full mission capable rates from fiscal year 1996 \nto 1997 for our deployed aircraft have declined from 62 to 55 \npercent.''\n  I am very much concerned about this. Mr. President, I think this is \ndue to two problems that we have. One is the deprived budget, insofar \nas our modernization program, which is leading us to have to use older \nequipment, and the other is the high deployment rate.\n  It is interesting that since 1992, we have had twice the number of \ndeployments that we had in the entire 10 years before that. This is not \nfor missions that are affecting our Nation's security.\n  I have had occasion to go to many, many, many installations \nthroughout America and around the world. I can tell you right now, we \nhave very serious problems. In Camp Lejeune, in talking to these guys \ndown there--they are tough marines, but their OPTEMPO and PERSTEMPO \nrate, to the extent the divorce rate is up, the retention rates are \ndown. It is a very serious problem.\n  I think most people realize it costs $6 million to put a guy into the \ncockpit of an F-16, and yet our retention rate right now has gone down \n28 percent. In the Mojave Desert, the National Training Center in \nTwentynine Palms tells us the troops they get in for advance training \nare far below the level of proficiency that they were 10 years ago. \nNellis Air Force Base where they have a red-flag operation, which is a \nvery good operation for training combat pilots, they now have dropped \nthese operations from every 12 months to 18 months. This means they go \ndown from six to four operations each year.\n  What this means is, these pilots who would otherwise be going through \nthe red-flag exercises getting this simulated training that is actually \nfor combat are off providing missions, supporting areas like Bosnia.\n  I draw attention to the 21st TACON, because in this area, we have \nboth of these problems occurring. The 21st TACON is using old \nequipment. Some of the 915 trucks that they use have over a million \nmiles on them. I personally saw that they are using for loading docks \nold flatbeds that are wired together.\n  As far as the deployment is concerned, we know there are serious \nproblems around the world. We know that Iraq is about to boil. We know \nwe may have to send in ground troops, and yet they would have to be \nlogistically supported by the 21st TACON. Right now they are at 100 \npercent capacity just supporting the Bosnia operation.\n  What we are dealing with in the defense authorization bill for 1999 \nis a budget that is not adequate and it does not put us in the state of \nreadiness we should be in, but it is the very best we can do under the \nconstraints that we are operating.\n  While it is inadequate, I do ask that our colleagues support the \ndefense authorization bill for 1999.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is critically important that the \nUnited States be able to protect its troops in the field from ballistic \nmissile attack, and this includes modern ballistic missiles of \nincreasing range and sophistication. To do that, we need both lower \ntier systems like the Patriot and more capable, upper tier systems like \nthe Theater High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, and Navy Theater Wide.\n  It is disappointing that the THAAD system has not yet achieved a \nsuccessful intercept in its test program. Given the program's history \nof lengthy delays between flight tests, it is unlikely that a \nsufficient number of tests can be conducted in fiscal year 1999 to \nenable the program to enter into the Engineering and Manufacturing \nDevelopment, or EMD, phase. Accordingly, I understand the rationale for \nthe amendment offered today which would remove an additional $250 \nmillion from the THAAD Program. While I am disappointed that the \nprogram's lack of progress has brought about this decision, I believe \nthe action proposed by the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee to be reasonable. And, along with everyone else, I \ncall on the Government and the contractors supporting the program to do \neverything they can to ensure future success.\n  Let's not forget, however, that we have test programs to find and \nsolve problems. We would move our weapons systems right from the \ndrawing board to the field if we never expected to uncover problems \nduring testing. While we would prefer there to be as few problems as \npossible, test programs are conducted to wring these problems out of \nour weapons systems. We should not be too quick to overemphasize the \nresults of any one test.\n  The level of scrutiny being applied to the Demonstration and \nValidation phase of the THAAD Program is higher than that applied to \nany other program in its Dem-Val phase that I am aware of. In fact, the \nscrutiny it is undergoing is more like that normally found in the EMD \nphase of a program. This intense scrutiny will ultimately be beneficial \nin helping us get this system fielded as soon as the technology is \nready. Given the EMD-like scrutiny in the THAAD Dem-Val program, \nCongress should examine the Department of Defense plans for the \nstructure and length of its EMD program. It is important for this \nprogram to be long enough to ensure the THAAD system ultimately \nproduced is the right one, but not so long as to leave U.S. forces \nvulnerable for a minute longer than technologically necessary.\n  The need for missile defense doesn't disappear because of a single \nflight test. Given the results of the most recent intercept attempt, it \nis reasonable to delay provision of THAAD EMD funding beyond fiscal \nyear 1999. Additional reductions, however, are not warranted.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from \nMississippi. He has shown such leadership in bringing to our attention \nthe importance of a missile defense system for this country. We have \nall been shocked this week to hear what is happening across the globe \nwith India actually testing a nuclear weapon and starting an arms race, \ntension that we haven't seen in a long time.\n  I can't think of another country in the world that would be testing \nits own missile defense system out in the open as we are, the THAAD \nmissile that my colleague just talked about, but we did. Yes, it didn't \nwork. And, yes, we are all disappointed and we are hoping that we can \nlearn from what didn't work on that test and perfect it. But that is \nwhy we have tests of defensive systems.\n  But I think what Senator Cochran has done is, he is putting in \ncontext how important it is that we put our full force behind the \npriority of defending our shores and our troops, wherever they may be, \nanywhere in the world, against any incoming ballistic missile,\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\na Scud missile or an intercontinental missile. Senator Cochran is \nright. The Senate had a very important vote yesterday, and by only one \nvote--by only one vote in the Senate, we were not able to move and \nclearly say that this country's first priority is going to be a \ndefensive system for the ballistic missiles that we know 30 countries \nare now in the process of perfecting.\n  So I commend him for the statement he just made, for the efforts he \nhas been making over the last year, and for the future efforts that we \nare all going to make to continue to press this very important issue. \nAs we are debating the defense authorization bill for our country, I \ncan think of no higher priority than to make sure that the shores of \nour country are protected against an incoming ballistic missile, \nwhether it be from a rogue nation or terrorist act. That our people \nwould know that we would be protected is the very highest priority. We \nare debating right now how to fund and make sure that our troops have \neverything they need to do the job to protect us. They should have that \nsame protection anywhere that they would be representing the United \nStates of America. In any theater anywhere in the world, we should be \nable to have a defense against an incoming ballistic missile.\n  So I commend the Senator from Mississippi, and I want to say we will \nnot rest until we have won this issue, that we would be able to deploy \nright now our first priority, a defensive system for incoming ballistic \nmissiles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas for her kind and generous remarks. I agree with her that we \nneed to do everything we can to study the test results, translate that \ninto solving the problems we have in these systems for theater weapons \nthat we have to protect our troops that are already being programmed--\nthere are already deployment decisions that have been made, even though \nwe haven't completed the development and the testing phase.\n  I hope we can see some successful tests soon and we urge the \ncontractors and the Department to work as hard as they can to see that \nis done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2410\n\n(Purpose: To provide eligibility for hardship duty pay on the basis of \n the nature of the duty performed instead of the location of the duty, \n                      and to repeal an exception)\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for the Senate to consider amendment No. 2410; that the amendment \nbe agreed to; and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2410) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 620. HARDSHIP DUTY PAY.\n\n       (a) Duty for Which Pay Authorized.--Subsection (a) of \n     section 305 of title 37, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking out ``on duty at a location'' and all that follows \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``performing duty in the United \n     States or outside the United States that is designated by the \n     Secretary of Defense as hardship duty.''.\n       (b) Repeal of Exception for Members Receiving Career Sea \n     Pay.--Subsection (c) of such section is repealed.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--(1) Subsections (b) and (d) of \n     such section are amended by striking out ``hardship duty \n     location pay'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``hardship duty \n     pay''.\n       (2) Subsection (d) of such section is redesignated as \n     subsection (c).\n       (3) The heading for such section is amended by striking out \n     ``location''.\n       (4) Section 907(d) of title 37, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``duty at a hardship duty location'' \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``hardship duty''.\n       (d) Clerical Amendment.--The item relating to section 305 \n     in the table of sections at the beginning of chapter 5 of \n     such title is amended to read as follows:\n\n``305. Special pay: hardship duty pay.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment will give the Secretary of \nDefense authority to compensate our men and women in uniform that are \nserving in remote areas, in very difficult situations. Specifically, \nthis amendment amends hardship duty location pay and allows the \nSecretary of Defense to designate certain ``duties'' as a hardship \nrather than limiting the pay to hardship duty ``locations'' only. This \nwill allow for designation of certain missions like Joint Task Force \nFull Accounting (JTF-FA), the POW/MIA search teams, and the Central \nIdentification Lab (CILHI) to be designated for receipt of the hardship \nduty pay. These teams are exposed to the most arduous conditions while \ndeployed to remote, isolated areas of Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, North \nKorea and China to conduct excavations of crash sites and \nidentification of remains of U.S. servicemembers.\n  This amendment also allows the Secretary to recognize members serving \nin high operation tempo missions and eliminates the restriction on \nmembers receiving sea pay and hardship duty pay simultaneously. This \nwould allow naval members who are serving in high operations tempo \nunits to receive the added benefit. The hardship duty pay limit of $300 \nper month would not be changed.\n  I commend my friends of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) for \nbringing this to my attention. Their concern for the state of the \nmilitary and those that serve is unsurpassed. During a recent trip to \nSoutheast Asia, the VFW learned that personnel deployed under the \ncommand of JTF-FA are not authorized and do not receive imminent danger \npay when deployed on Joint Field Activity operations in Laos and \nVietnam. They reported their concerns to me because many of the crash \nsites were in extremely difficult terrain, littered by unexploded \nmunitions.\n  At one Joint Field Activity excavation site that they visited in \nwestern Laos, the area in which the team was conducting excavations was \nlittered with unexploded BLU-26 cluster bomb units. Another crash site \nexcavation was located next to sidewinder missiles. In addition, the \nteams are exposed to resistant strains of malaria, dengue fever, and \nother diseases while they are deployed in these isolated and remote \nareas. Furthermore, most of these sites are far removed from any modern \nmedical facility.\n  Mr. President, I feel it not only the right thing to do, but that it \nwill help the services to adequately compensate our men and women in \nuniform so as to entice these young Americans to stay in the service \nand to consider a career in the military. For the difficult and \ndangerous duties that they do, they deserve no less.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is informed there is an order to \nrecognize the Senator from California. Is there objection to the \nrequest?\n  Mr. THURMOND. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4877-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4882-S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to compliment \nthe House of Representatives on passage of legislation this afternoon \nto take a stand against religious persecution worldwide.\n  And, I compliment Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia for his \nleadership on this very important legislation.\n  Legislation is pending in the U.S. Senate identical with or very \nsimilar to the legislation passed in the House--I am not sure what \namendments may have been crafted on the House floor this afternoon and \nwhat last-minute changes may have been made--but similar legislation \nhas been introduced by this Senator in the U.S. Senate. And the purpose \nof this legislation is for the United States to take a stand against \nreligious persecution worldwide.\n  We have a very unfortunate situation today where Catholic priests are \nbeing incarcerated in China, Buddhists are being persecuted in Tibet, \nand Evangelical Christians are being imprisoned in Saudi Arabia and in \nEgypt. The essence of freedom of religion is a very fundamental value \nin the United States and a very fundamental moral value. And, the \nlegislation which passed the House today and which is pending in the \nSenate will enable the U.S. Government to take a stand against this \nreligious persecution worldwide.\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\n  Freedom of religion is the first part of the first amendment. The \nUnited States was founded for religious freedom. The Pilgrims came here \nin 1607 for that purpose, as did my father Harry Specter, who literally \nwalked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket in 1911 seeking \na new life for himself and a family which he hoped to have, and \nreligious freedom, because the Cossacks rode up and down the streets of \nBatchkurina, a small village in Ukraine, in Russia, where my father's \nbrother, Mordechai Spectorski, had fought with the Cossacks, and they \nwere looking for Mordechai Spectorski, who had fled the city. And, the \nCossacks continued to look for members of the Specter family. My father \nimmigrated to the United States, as did my mother Lillie Shanin, \nleaving a small town on the Russian-Polish border at the age of 5, \ncoming to the United States in 1905.\n  The legislation which has passed the House of Representatives has \nsome sanctions in it. It provides that there be no weapons of torture \nsold, and provides limitations as to what U.S. taxpayer money can be \ngiven for, other than humanitarian purposes. And, it seems to me that \nif the legislation is to have any effect, there have to be sanctions, \nthere have to be weapons in the bill--teeth--in order to promote \ncompliance.\n  I visited this past January in Saudi Arabia and talked to Saudi \nofficials about concerns which I have and which others have had where \nChristians cannot display a Christmas tree in a window if it is visible \nfrom the outside, where Jewish soldiers are reluctant to wear their dog \ntags identifying themselves as being Jewish, a situation which is \nintolerable, where we have some 5,000 young men and women who are in \nSaudi Arabia to protect the Saudis.\n  The situation in Egypt is very serious where there are Evangelical \nChristians who are being persecuted, where they land in jail if there \nis a conversion from Islam to Christianity. I was unable to visit the \nSudan because of difficulties there, but visiting in nearby Eritrea, I \nheard stories about the persecution of Christians in Sudan.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will be considered by the Senate \nin short order so that a firm stand will be taken to deal with the very \nserious issue of religious persecution worldwide.\n  Again, I compliment the House and chief sponsor, Frank Wolf, and look \nforward to enactment of this legislation in the Senate. The bill passed \nby a vote of 375-41, which is well beyond the number necessary to be \nveto proof. The administration has been opposed to having sanctions in \nlegislation, sanctions such as some of the ones proposed in the bill \nwhich I have offered and is pending in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4882-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate turn to Calendar No. 358, \nS. 2037, regarding the WIPO treaty, which is the treaty dealing with \ndigital copyright.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2037) to amend title 17, United States Code, to \n     implement the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances \n     and Phonograms Treaty, to provide limitations on copyright \n     liability relating to material online, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the WIPO \nCopyright Treaty which has up to 1 hour under the consent agreement \nthat was reached on May 12. Therefore, the next vote will occur \nshortly--hopefully in less than an hour--on passage of the WIPO \ncopyright bill, and that will be the last vote of the day.\n  I know there are some Senators here who have worked on this issue who \ndo want to be heard briefly--the Senator from Missouri, and, of course, \nthe Senator from Utah has been working on this assiduously. We had a \nlittle problem we ran into yesterday, but we are going forward with \nthis and we will try to work it out with the House, and I will \ncertainly try to be helpful with that.\n  This is important legislation. A lot of effort has been put into it. \nSome of the problems have been resolved, thanks to the courtesy and \nleadership of Senator Hatch, working with Senator Ashcroft. So I think \nwe need to go ahead and do it today and we will have had, really, an \nincredible week on these high-tech bills.\n\n  Again, the next vote will occur on Monday--there will be no further \nvotes after the WIPO vote tonight--and I will notify all Members as to \nthe time of that vote.\n  With regard to the DOD authorization matter, I will be talking with \nthe managers of this legislation to see what their wishes are, and we \nwill have some further announcements of when that legislation will be \nbrought up again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time allocated \nfor this debate is 60 minutes, equally divided and controlled between \nthe Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, with 15 minutes of the time of Mr. Hatch controlled by the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

I would like to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for an amendment that he has to take care of.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I ask this time not be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are submitted and will be \nnumbered. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask that time not be charged to the present act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act of 1998, S. 2037. The DMCA is the most \ncomprehensive bill that has come before the Senate regarding the \nInternet and the digital world in general.\n  The DMCA in Title I implements the World Intellectual Property (WIPO) \ntreaties on copyright and on performers and phonograms, and in Title II \nlimits the copyright infringement liability of on-line and Internet \nservice providers (OSPs and ISPs) under certain circumstances. The DMCA \nalso provides in Title III a minor but important clarification of \ncopyright law that the lawful owner or lessee of a computer may \nauthorize someone to turn on their computer for the purposes of \nmaintenance or repair. Title IV addresses the issues of ephemeral \nrecordings, distance education, and digital preservation for libraries \nand archives.\n  Due to the ease with which digital works can be copied and \ndistributed worldwide virtually instantaneously, copyright owners will \nhesitate to make their works readily available on the Internet without \nreasonable assurance that they will be protected against massive \npiracy. Legislation implementing the treaties provides this protection \nand creates the legal platform for launching the global digital on-line \nmarketplace for copyrighted works. It will facilitate making available \nquickly and conveniently via the Internet the movies, music, software, \nand literary works that are the fruit of American creative genius. It \nwill also encourage the continued growth of the existing off-line \nglobal marketplace for copyrighted works in digital format by setting \nstrong international copyright standards.\n  The copyright industries are one of America's largest and fastest \ngrowing economic assets. According to International Intellectual \nProperty Alliance statistics, in 1996 (when the last full set of \nfigures was available), the U.S. creative industries accounted for \n3.65% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)--$278.4 billion. In the \nlast 20 years in which comprehensive statistics are available--1977-\n1996--the U.S. copyright industries' share of GDP grew more than twice \nas fast as the remainder of the economy--5.5 percent versus 2.6 \npercent.\n  Between 1997 and 1996, employment in the U.S. copyright industries \nmore than doubled to 3.5 million workers--2.8 percent of total U.S. \nemployment. Between 1977 and 1996 U.S. copyright industry employment \ngrew nearly three times as fast as the annual rate of the economy as a \nwhole--4.6 percent versus 1.6 percent. In fact, the copyright \nindustries contribute more to the U.S. economy and employ more workers \nthan any single manufacturing sector, including chemicals, industrial \nequipment, electronics, food processing, textiles and apparel, and \naircraft.\n  More significantly for the WIPO treaties, in 1996 U.S. copyright \nindustries achieved foreign sales and exports of $60.18 billion, for \nthe first time leading all major industry sectors, including \nagriculture, automobiles and auto parts, and the aircraft industry. \nThere can be no doubt that copyright is of supreme importance to the \nAmerican economy. Yet, American companies are losing $18 to $20 billion \nannually due to the international piracy of copyrighted works.\n  But the potential of the Internet, both as information highway and \nmarketplace, depends on its speed and capacity. Without clarification \nof their liability, service providers may hesitate to make the \nnecessary investment to fulfill that potential. In the ordinary course \nof their operations service providers must engage in all kinds of acts \nthat expose them to potential copyright infringement liability.\n  For example, service providers must make innumerable electronic \ncopies in order simply to transmit information over the Internet. \nCertain electronic copies are made to speed up the delivery of \ninformation to users. Other electronic copies are made in order to host \nWorld Wide Web sites. Many service providers engage in directing users \nto sites in response to inquiries by users or they volunteer sites that \nusers may find attractive. Some of these sites might contain infringing \nmaterial. In\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nshort, by limiting the liability of service providers, the DMCA ensures \nthat the efficiency of the Internet will continue to improve and that \nthe variety and quality of services on the Internet will continue to \nexpand.\n  Besides the major copyright owners and the major OPSs and ISPs (e.g., \nthe local telephone companies, the long distance carriers, America \nOnLine, etc.), the Committee heard from representatives of individual \ncopyright owners and small ISPs, from representatives of libraries, \narchives and educational institutions, from representatives of \nbroadcasters, computer hardware manufacturers, and consumers--and this \nis not an exhaustive list.\n  Title II, for example, reflects 3 months of negotiations between the \nmajor copyright owners and the major OSPs, and ISPs, which I encouraged \nand in which I participated, and which took place with the assistance \nof Senator Ashcroft. Intense discussions took place on distance \neducation too, with the participation of representatives of libraries, \nteachers, and educational institutions, and with the assistance of \nSenator Leahy, Senator Ashcroft, and the Copyright Office.\n  As a result, the Committee took substantial steps to refine the \ndiscussion draft that I laid down before the Committee through a series \nof amendments, each of which was adopted unanimously. For example, the \ncurrent legislation contains:\n  (1) a provision to ensure that parents will be able to protect their \nchildren from pornography and other inappropriate material on the \nInternet;\n  (2) provisions to provide for the updating of the copyright laws so \nthat educators, libraries, and achieves will be able to take full \nadvantage of the promise of digital technology;\n  (3) important procedural protections for individual Internet users to \nensure that they will not be mistakenly denied access to the World Wide \nWeb;\n  (4) provisions to ensure that the current practice of legitimate \nreverse engineering for software interoperability may continue; and\n  (5) provisions to accommodate the needs of broadcasters for ephemeral \nrecordings and regarding copyright management information.\n  These provisions are in addition to provisions I had already \nincorporated into my discussion draft, such as provisions on library \nbrowsing, provisions addressing the special needs of individual \ncreators regarding copyright management information, and provisions \nexempting nonprofit archives, nonprofit educational institutions, and \nnonprofit libraries from criminal penalties and, in the case of civil \npenalties, remitting damages entirely when such an institution was not \naware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a \nviolation.\n  Consequently, the DMCA enjoys widespread support from the motion \npicture, recording, software, and publishing industries, as well as the \ntelephone companies, long distance carriers, and other OSPs and ISPs. \nIt is also supported by the Information Technology Industry Council, \nwhich includes the leading computer hardware manufacturers, and by \nrepresentatives of individual creators, such as the Writers Guild, the \nDirectors Guild, the Screen Actors Guild, and the American Federation \nof Television and Radio Artists. The breadth of support for S. 2037 is \nreflected in the unanimous roll call vote (18-0) by which the DMCA was \nreported out of Committee.\n  Mr. President, the United States started the Internet, and remains \nits most significant hub. No country comes close to the United States \nin creative output. In these areas, we are the undisputed leaders. This \nbill will help us maintain this edge in an increasingly competitive \nglobal market.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote favorably \nfor S. 2037. This bill has such important ramifications for the \ncontinued prosperity of the U.S. as we enter the next millennium and \nhas such powerful support that it should be enacted immediately.\n  Finally, I would like to particularly pay tribute to the ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. I don't know \nof anyone who has more interest in the Internet, more interest in \ncomputers, more interest in copyright matters than Senator Leahy, \nunless it is myself, and I don't think I have more. He has done a great \njob on this committee. It is a pleasure to work with him.\n  It has been a wonderful experience throughout the 22 years I have \nbeen on the committee to work with him on technical and difficult \nissues. I personally thank him before everybody today for his good \nwork. Without his help, we wouldn't be this far, and we all know it. I \nthank him. I would also like to thank Manus Cooney, Edward Damich, Troy \nDow, and Virginia Isaacson of my staff for their long hours of hard \nwork on this issue. And I want to commend the hard work and cooperation \nI received from Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, and Marla Grossman of \nSenator Leahy's staff, and Paul Clement, and Bartlett Cleland of \nSenator Ashcroft's staff.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2411\n\n                (Purpose: To make technical corrections)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2411.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, line 15 strike subsection (c) and redesignate \n     the succeeding subsections and references thereto \n     accordingly.\n       On page 17, line 4, insert ``and with the intent to induce, \n     enable, facilitate or conceal infringement'' after \n     ``knowingly''\n       On page 17, beginning on line 8, strike ``, with the intent \n     to induce, enable, facilitate or conceal infringement''\n       On page 17, beginning on line 21, strike paragraph (3) and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(3) distribute, import for distribution, or publicly \n     perform works, copies of works, or phonorecords, knowing that \n     copyright management information has been removed or altered \n     without authority of the copyright owner or the law,\n\n     knowing, or, with respect to civil remedies under section \n     1203, having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, \n     enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of any right \n     under this title.''.\n       On page 19, line 4, insert the following new paragraph and \n     redesignate the succeeding paragraphs accordingly:\n       ``(6) terms and conditions for use of the work;''.\n       On page 19, line 4, strike ``of'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``or''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a technical amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2411) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for his \ngracious comments, and I do appreciate working with him on this matter. \nHe and I have discussed this so many times in walking back and forth to \nvotes and in the committee room, and so on. I think the Senator from \nUtah and I long ago determined that if we were going to have this WIPO \nimplementing bill passed, its best chance would be one where the \nSenator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont were basically holding \nhands on it.\n  The Senator from Utah may recall a time once when the then-Senator \nfrom Nevada, Senator Laxalt, and I were here and we had two pieces of \nlegislation, a Laxalt-Leahy bill and a Leahy-Laxalt bill. One of our \ncolleagues said, ``This is either a very good bill or one of you didn't \nread.''\n  In this case, the Hatch-Leahy-et al. piece of legislation is a very \ngood bill, and one which the two of us have read every word. We have \ntried to make very clear to the Senate that the issues we are raising \nin this bill are not partisan issues. These are issues that create jobs \nin the United States. These are issues that allow the United States to \ngo into the next century with our innovative genius in place. These are \nissues that allow the United States, in creating that innovative \ngenius, to continue to lead the world. Senators, in voting for this \nlegislation, will be voting to maintain the intellectual leadership of \nthe United States.\n  The successful adoption by the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization, what we call WIPO, in December 1996, of two new copyright \ntreaties--one on written material and one on sound recordings--was \npraised in the United States. The bill that we have before us today, \nthe DMCA, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, will effectuate the\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\npurposes of those treaties in the United States and, I believe, will \nserve as a model for the rest of the world.\n  The WIPO treaties will fortify intellectual property rights around \nthe world. They will help unleash the full potential of America's most \ncreative industries, including the movie, recording, computer software, \nand other copyrighted industries that are subject to online and other \nforms of piracy, especially in the digital age where it is easier to \npirate and steal exact copies of works.\n  If they don't have the protection, the owners of intellectual \nproperty are going to be unwilling to put their material online. If \nthere is no content worth reading online, then the growth and \nusefulness of the Internet will be stifled and public accessibility \nwill be retarded.\n  Secretary Daley of the Department of Commerce said, for the most \npart, ``The treaties largely incorporate intellectual property norms \nthat are already part of U.S. law.'' What the treaties will do is give \nAmerican owners of copyrighted material an important tool to protect \ntheir intellectual property in those countries that become a party to \nthe treaties.\n  With ever-expanding electronic commerce, trafficking the global \nsuperhighway, international copyright standards are critical to \nprotecting American firms and American jobs. The future growth of the \nInternet and of digital media requires rigorous international \nintellectual property protections.\n  I have in my hand the 1998 Report on Copyright Industries in the \nUnited States Economy. This was released last week by the International \nIntellectual Property Alliance.\n  This report shows conclusively just how important the U.S. copyright \nindustries are to American jobs and how important it is to protect that \nU.S. copyright industry from global piracy.\n  If you look at the chart over here, Mr. President, it shows that from \nthe years 1977 to 1996, the U.S. copyright industries' share of the \ngross national product grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the \neconomy.\n  These are the core copyright industries. Look how fast they grew as \ncompared to the rest of the U.S. economy.\n  One of the things that has expanded and fueled our expanding economy \nis the copyright industry.\n  Now, during those same 20 years, job growth in the core copyright \nindustries was nearly three times as fast as the rest of the economy. \nWhat this shows us, Mr. President, is that we are undergoing \nunprecedented expansion of our economy, but this is the area expanding \nthe fastest.\n  These statistics underscore why, when the President transmitted the \ntwo WIPO treaties and draft legislation to implement the treaties to \nthe U.S. Senate, I was proud to introduce the implementing legislation, \nS. 1121, with Senators Hatch, Thompson, and Kohl. We did it the same \nday. The legislation we have before us today is the result of years of \nwork domestically and internationally to ensure that the appropriate \ncopyright protections are in place around the world to foster the \ngrowth of the Internet and other digital media and networks.\n  The Clinton administration showed great foresight when it formed, in \n1993, the Information Infrastructure Task Force, IITF, which \nestablished a Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights to examine \nand recommend changes to keep copyright law current with new \ntechnology. Then they released a report in 1995 explaining the \nimportance of this effort, stating:\n\n       The full potential of the NII will not be realized if the \n     education, information and entertainment products protected \n     by intellectual property laws are not protected. . .\n\n  The report said further:\n\n       All the computers, telephones, fax machines, scanners, \n     cameras, keyboards, televisions, monitors, printers, \n     switches, routers, wires, cables, networks, and satellites in \n     the world will not create a successful NII, if there is no \n     content. What will drive the NII is the content moving \n     through it.\n\n  The same year that report was issued, Senator Hatch and I joined \ntogether to introduce the NII Copyright Protection Act of 1995, S. \n1284, which incorporated the recommendations of the Administration. \nThat legislative proposal confronted fundamental questions about the \nrole of copyright in the next century--many of which are echoed by the \nDMCA, which we consider today.\n  Title I of the DMCA is based on the Administration's recommendations \nfor legislation to implement the two WIPO treaties. It makes certain \ntechnical changes to conform our copyright laws to the treaties and \nsubstantive amendments to comply with two new treaty obligations.\n  Specifically, the treaties oblige the signatories to provide legal \nprotections against circumvention of technological measures used by \ncopyright owners to protect their works, and against violations of the \nintegrity of copyright management information (CMI). Such information \nis used to identify a work, its author, the copyright owner and any \ninformation about the terms and conditions of use of the work. The bill \nadds a new chapter to U.S. copyright law to implement the anticircum-\nvention and CMI provisions, along with corresponding civil and criminal \npenalties.\n  Title II of the DMCA limits the liability for copyright infringement, \nunder certain conditions, for Internet and online service providers. \nTitle III gives a Copyright Act exemption to lawful computer owners or \nlessees so that independent technicians may service the machines \nwithout infringement liability.\n  Title IV begins a process of updating our Nation's copyright laws \nwith respect to library archives, and educational uses of copyrighted \nworks in the digital age.\n  Title I is based on the administration's recommendations, as I said.\n  Following intensive discussions with a number of interested parties, \nincluding libraries, universities, small businesses, ISPs and OSPs, \ntelephone companies, computer users, broadcasters, content providers, \nand device manufacturers, we in the Senate Judiciary Committee were \nable to reach unanimous agreement.\n  For example, significant provisions were added to the bill in Title \nII to clarify the liability for copyright infringement of online and \nInternet service providers. The bill provides ``safe harbors'' from \nliability under clearly defined circumstances, which both encourage \nresponsible behavior and protect important intellectual property \nrights. In addition, during the committee's consideration of this bill, \nan Ashcroft-Leahy-Hatch amendment was adopted to ensure that computer \nusers are given reasonable notice when their Web sites are the subject \nof infringement complaints, and to provide procedures for computer \nusers to have material that is mistakenly taken down put back online.\n  We have a number of provisions designed to help libraries and \narchives. First, libraries expressed concerns about the possibility of \ncriminal sanctions or potentially ruinous monetary liability for \nactions taken in good faith. This bill makes sure that libraries acting \nin good faith can never be subject to fines or civil damages. \nSpecifically, a library is exempt from monetary liability in a civil \nsuit if it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts \nconstituted a violation. In addition, libraries are completely exempt \nfrom the criminal provisions.\n  We have a ``browsing'' exception for libraries so they can look at \nencrypted work and decide whether or not they want to purchase it for \ntheir library.\n  Senator Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and I crafted an amendment to \nprovide for the preservation of digital works by qualified libraries \nand archives. The ability of libraries to preserve legible copies of \nworks in digital form is one I consider critical. Under present law, \nlibraries are permitted to make a single facsimile copy for their \ncollections for preservation purposes, or to replace copies in case of \nfire and so on. That worked back in the nondigital age. It does not \nwork today. This gives us a chance to be up to date. We would allow \nlibraries to transfer a work from one digital format to another if the \nequipment needed to read the earlier format becomes unavailable \ncommercially.\n  The bill ensures that libraries' collections will continue to be \navailable to future generations by permitting libraries to make up to \nthree copies in any format--including in digital form. This was one of \nthe proposals in The National Information Infrastructure (NII) \nCopyright Protection Act of 1995, which I sponsored with Senator Hatch \nin the last Congress. The Register of Copyrights, among others, has \nsupported that proposal.\n  These provisions go a long way toward meeting the concerns that \nlibraries have expressed about the original\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\nimplementing legislation we introduced.\n  We address distance learning. When Congress enacted the present \ncopyright law it recognized the potential of broadcast and cable \ntechnology to supplement classroom teaching, and to bring the classroom \nto those who, because of their disabilities or other special \ncircumstances, are unable to attend classes. At the same time, Congress \nalso recognized the potential for unauthorized transmissions of works \nto harm the markets for educational uses of copyrighted materials. The \npresent Copyright Act strikes a careful balance and includes a narrowly \ncrafted exemption.\n  As with so many areas of copyright law, the advent of digital \ntechnology requires us to take another look at the issue.\n  I recognize that the issue of distance learning has been under \nconsideration for the past several years by the Conference on Fair Use \n(CONFU) that was established by the Administration to consider how to \nprotect fair use in the digital environment. In spite of the hard work \nof the participants, CONFU has so far been unable to forge a \ncomprehensive agreement on guidelines for the application of fair use \nto digital distance learning.\n  We made tremendous strides in the Committee to chart the appropriate \ncourse for updating the Copyright Act to permit the use of copyrighted \nworks in valid distance learning activities.\n  Senator Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and I joined together to ask the \nCopyright Office to facilitate discussions among interested library and \neducational groups and content providers with a view toward making \nrecommendations for us to consider with this legislation. We \nincorporated into the DMCA a new section 122 requiring the Copyright \nOffice to make broader recommendations to Congress on digital distance \neducation within six months. Upon receiving the Copyright Office's \nrecommendations, it is my hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will \npromptly commence hearings on the issue and move expeditiously to enact \nfurther legislation on the matter. I know that all members on this \nCommittee are as anxious as I am to complete the process that we \nstarted in Committee of updating the Copyright Act to permit the \nappropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning \nactivities. This step should be viewed as a beginning--and we are \ncommitted to making more progress as quickly as possible.\n  We have also asked the Copyright Office to examine, in a \ncomprehensive fashion, when the actions of a university's employees \nmight jeopardize the university's eligibility for the safe harbors set \nout in the bill for online service providers. This is an important and \ncomplex issue with implications for other online service providers, \nincluding libraries and archives, and I look forward to reviewing the \nCopyright Office's analysis of this issue.\n  Amendments sponsored by Senator Ashcroft, Senator Hatch, and I were \ncrafted to address the question of reverse engineering, ephemeral \nrecordings, and to clarify the use of copyright management.\n  Finally, to assuage the concerns of the consumer, electronics \nmanufacturers, and others, that the bill might require them to design \ntheir products to respond to a particular technological protection \nmeasure, Senator Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and I crafted an amendment to \nclarify the bill on this issue.\n  I mention all of these things, Mr. President, because it shows why \nthe administration has sent a Statement of Administration policy saying \nthe Administration supports passage of this bill. This is a well-\nbalanced package of proposals. As we go into the next century--the \ncreators, the consumers, those in commerce in this country need the \nbest laws possible. The United States is the leader today. The United \nStates will not be the leader tomorrow without adequate laws.\n  These laws allow the United States to continue to be the electronic \nand intellectual property leader of the world. We should pass this \nbill. We can pass it with pride.\n  I would like to close by praising the dedicated staff members from \nthe Judiciary Committee who have assisted us in crafting this \nlegislation. They appreciate the significance of this legislation for \nour country and its economy. In particular, I want to thank Edward \nDamich and Troy Dow from the Chairman's staff, and Paul Clement and \nBartlett Cleland from Senator Ashcroft's staff, for demonstrating what \ncan be done when we put political party allegiances aside and strive to \nwork together in a bipartisan fashion to craft the best bill possible. \nMy hope is that the bipartisan manner in which they worked on behalf of \nthe Chairman and Senator Ashcroft to bridge differences rather than \nexacerbate them can be replicated on a number of other important \nissues pending in our Committee.\n\n  I would also like to thank those people on my Judiciary Committee \nstaff--Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Marla Grossman, Bill Bright and Mike \nCarrasco--for their work on this bill. They each put in long hours to \nhelp me find solutions to the concerns of a number of stakeholders in \nthis bill. I could always trust their counsel to be fair and \nconscientious.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just praise my colleague from \nMissouri. Senator Ashcroft has been committed and has worked very, very \nhard to make this bill one that all of us can support. He has done a \nterrific job. He has worked on this OSP liability thing with us ad \ninfinitum and added matters to this bill that made this a much better \nbill and strengthened the bill. I just could not feel better about \nsomebody on my committee working on this bill than I do toward Senator \nAshcroft. I just wanted to say he played a significant role in this \nlegislation. I personally thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is recognized to speak for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am grateful for the kind remarks of the Senator from Utah and am \npleased to have the opportunity to work with him and the Senator from \nVermont.\n  I rise today to speak in favor of one of the most important pieces of \ntechnology legislation in the 105th Congress. At its heart, this \nlegislation is about updating the copyright laws for the digital age \nand preparing a sizable portion of our economy for the next century.\n  The affected parties include the online service providers, computer \nhardware and software manufacturers; every educator in America is \naffected by this legislation; every student; all the libraries; all the \nconsumer electronics manufacturers and consumers of electronics; the \nmotion picture companies, and everyone who uses the Internet. This \nmeasure will have as broad an impact on the American public as \nvirtually any measure we will address.\n  The full Senate's consideration of this bill culminates an effort of \nupdating our copyright law that I began last September when I \nintroduced S. 1146, the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology \nEducation Act. S. 1146 was a comprehensive bill designed to jump-start \na process that had ground to a halt and appeared to be going nowhere.\n  The bill addresses three basic problems. First, the liability of \nonline service providers for copyright violations; second, the need to \nupdate the provisions of the copyright law that affect educators and \nlibraries for the digital age; and third--and not least, of course--the \nneed to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization, or \nWIPO, treaties.\n  The United States of America, as the generator of so much content and \nmaterial--the innovator, the creator of so much of what is \ncopywritten--stands to gain most by making sure that our copyrights are \nrespected worldwide.\n  I am gratified that today the full Senate will vote on this bill that \naddresses all three of these concerns, especially the concerns \nregarding the need to implement the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization treaties which will provide that the United States effort \nto protect copyrights--the intellectual property of those who are the \ncreators in this country and develop things in this country--those \ntreaties will protect those copyrights.\n  The original administration language that was introduced by Senators \nHatch and Leahy focused exclusively on the\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\nWIPO treaties. However, through hard work, numerous amendments and the \nassistance of Senators Hatch and Leahy and their staffs--and this was \nreally a cooperative effort--we were able to fashion a comprehensive \napproach to updating the copyright laws for the digital age.\n  Many important changes were made to the bill, including amendments \nreinforcing on-line privacy rights, ensuring that the bill would not be \nread to mandate design decisions and addressing the need to update the \ncopyright laws to permit distance education using digital technology.\n  When I was a professor--I won't want to admit how long ago--I used to \nteach a television course. The very same procedures I used in analog \ntechnology for television transmission might well have been illegal if \nthe TV signal had been transmitted digitally. It is important that we \ngive the capacity for distance education in the digital age the same \npotential that we had for distance education in the analog age.\n  I will focus on three important changes, one reflecting each of the \nthree basic problems addressed by the original bill.\n  First, there is the issue of the liability of on-line service \nproviders. The notion that service providers should not bear the \nresponsibility for copyright infringements when they are solely \ntransmitting the material is one key to the future growth of the \nInternet. Now, what we are really talking about is if someone illegally \ntransmits material on the Internet, the Internet companies that provide \nthe opportunity for people to transmit the material shouldn't be held \nresponsible any more than the phone company should be held responsible \nif you were to say something illegal over the phone, or that Xerox \nshould be held responsible if you violate a copyright by illegally \ncopying material on the Xerox machine.\n  This is very important because of the way the Internet operates in \nterms of assembling and reassembling digital messages that they not be \nconsidered to be an illegal publisher; they, therefore, needed the \nprotections that are provided in this bill so that we can have and \ncontinue to use the infrastructure of the Internet and allow it to \noperate effectively.\n  Proper resolution of this issue is critical to unlock the potential \nfor the Internet. For that reason, I included a title addressing on-\nline service provider liability in my legislation. Make no mistake \nabout it, clarification of on-line service provider liability was one \nof my fundamental concerns in the debate, and after months of \nnegotiations the affected parties were able to agree to legislative \nlanguage that protects on-line service providers, or what we call the \nOSPs, from liability when they simply transmit--they are not involved, \nthey don't have any interest in the message, but they are just \ntransmitters. If there is a violation, it is not their fault that \nsomething was transmitted in contravention of the copyright law.\n  Although I applauded the efforts of the affected industries to \nresolve the OSP liability issue, there was one issue which the industry \nagreement did not address--the protections that need to be given to \nusers of the Internet. The agreement that the OSPs entered into would \nhave protected the interests of the copyright owners, but it provided \nlittle or no protection for an Internet user who was wrongfully accused \nof violating copyright laws.\n  I think of a little girl, perhaps, who puts on her Internet site the \npicture of a duck she draws. We shouldn't allow Disney to say, ``We own \nDonald Duck. That looks too much like Donald,'' and be able to bully a \nlittle girl from having a duck on her web site. We needed protection \nfor the small user, not just for the big content promoters.\n  Even though several Judiciary Committee members claimed no amendments \nwere needed, I made sure that the industry compromise respected the \nrights of typical Internet users, ordinary people, by offering an \namendment that provided a protection included in the original bill I \nhad offered. It is an idea which is referred to as the ``notice and \nput-back'' provision. If material is wrongfully taken down from the \nInternet user's home page, my amendment ensures that the end user will \nbe given notice of the action taken and gives them a right to initiate \na process that allows them to put their material back on line without \nthe need to hire a lawyer or go to court. This was a critical \nimprovement over the industry's prior compromise agreement.\n\n  A second concern of mine throughout this process has been the need to \nupdate protections for educators and libraries already included in the \ncopyright law to reflect the digital technology. I have already \nmentioned that. Having been an individual who had the privilege of \nteaching a college course on television I knew just how important it \nwould be for libraries and educational institutions to be able to use \ndigital transmissions of documents and signals in the same way that \nthey were authorized to do so with analog signals under our copyright \nlaw as it has existed.\n  I did offer an amendment in committee, and it was unanimously \nincorporated into the bill, which will allow libraries to use digital \ntechnology for archiving and for interlibrary loans, for example. This \nwill help libraries serve the American public.\n  A final issue of profound importance, ensuring that the bill did not \ninadvertently make it a violation of the Federal law to be a good \nparent. The original bill or draft of this bill took such a broad \napproach to outlawing any devices that could be used to gain access to \na copyrighted work that it may have made it illegal to manufacture and \nuse devices that were designed to protect children from obscenities and \npornography. An amendment I offered in committee makes it clear that a \nparent may protect his children from pornography without running afoul \nof this law. I think moms and dads will want to be able to protect \ntheir children and shouldn't have to risk running afoul of the law to \ndo so. My own belief is that when moms and dads do their jobs, \ngoverning America will be easy. If moms and dads don't do their jobs, \ngoverning this country could be impossible. We need to make it possible \nfor parents in every instance to do their job.\n  The amendment recognizes that devices designed to allow such parental \nmonitoring must be allowed. We should never allow any legislation to \nmove forward that intentionally or unintentionally makes good parenting \nillegal. When the choice is between protecting our children from \nobscene material and perhaps allowing one machine to be diverted for \nunlawful use, Congress and the court should choose the protection of \nthe children every time and then prosecute anyone who makes unlawful \nuse of such machine.\n  There are a number of individuals who deserve our specific thanks \nhere, and I want to take the time to make sure that deserving \nindividuals and organizations are thanked. I want to take a moment to \nthank a few particular staff members who labored into the night over \nand over again and through weekends to put together this legislation. I \ncommend my colleagues Senators Hatch and Leahy. I want to say that a \nnumber of my concerns were accommodated because these members of the \nLeahy and Hatch staff were so hard-working. Ed Damich and Troy Dow with \nSenator Hatch were critical to moving forward on all issues, \nparticularly by coordinating the OSP discussions.\n  Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman of Senator Leahy's staff were \nsimilarly important to the process, particularly in regard to the \neducation provisions and on drafting language for several key areas. I \nthank the staff. They worked very closely with two of the best staff \nmembers that I think work in any arena on Capitol Hill, and that is \nBartlett Cleland of my staff and Paul Clement. They worked extremely \nhard with industry and with other Members of the Senate to craft a \npiece of legislation which I believe is going to be a tremendous asset \nin allowing the potential of the Internet to be realized.\n  Finally, I want to thank all of the individuals representing various \nindustry and education interests who were critical not only in \neducating me on the myriad of technical issues addressed in this \nlegislation, but were helping in every way to reach agreement when the \ntime came. In the end, this is perhaps not a perfect bill. I would have \nfavored a different approach to some issues. But this is a bill that \nhas become a comprehensive effort to bring the copyright law into the \ndigital age. It is an important piece of legislation which we can work \ntogether to make work for America.\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\n  Accordingly, I am happy to support this bill. I look forward to its \nfinal passage, with appreciation to the outstanding leadership of \nSenator Hatch and Senator Leahy in the committee. Working with them has \nbeen one of the most gratifying experiences of a process of reaching a \nconclusion on legislation which I think will advance our opportunity \nsignificantly to access the advantages of electronic and digital \ncommunication for the entirety of America.\n  Mr. President, I want to go over some of these notions again and \nexpand the ideas a bit further.\n  I rise today to speak in favor of one of the most important pieces of \ntechnology legislation in the 105th congress. At its heart, this \nlegislation is about updating the copyright laws for the digital age \nand preparing a sizable portion of our economy for the next century. \nThe affected parties include the on-line service providers, computer \nhardware and software manufacturers, educators students, libraries, \nconsumer electronics manufacturers and consumers, motion picture \ncompanies, and everyone who uses the Internet. The full Senate's \nconsideration of this bill culminates an effort at updating our \ncopyright law that I began last September when I introduced S. 1146, \nthe Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act. S. \n1146 was a comprehensive bill designed to jump start a process that had \nground to a halt and appeared to be going nowhere. The bill addressed \nthree basic problems: (1) the liability of on-line service providers \nfor copyright violations, (2) the need to update the provisions of the \ncopyright law that affect educators and libraries for the digital age, \nand (3) the need to implement the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization, or WIPO, treaties. I am gratified that today the full \nSenate will vote on a bill that addresses all three of these concerns.\n  The original Administration language that was introduced by Senators \nHatch and Leahy focused exclusively on the WIPO Treaties. However, \nthrough hard work, numerous amendments, and the assistance of Senators \nHatch and Leahy and their staffs, we were able to fashion a \ncomprehensive approach to updating the copyright laws for the digital \nage.\n  The bill before the Senate today now addresses all three of the basic \nproblems identified in my bill. First, the notion that service \nproviders should not bear the responsibility for copyright \ninfringements when they are providing a means of communication is a key \nnotion for the future growth and development of digital communications \nand most importantly the Internet. Resolution of this issue is critical \nfor the future development of the Internet. For that reason, I included \na title regarding on-line service provider liability in my legislation. \nAfter months of negotiations, the affected parties were able to agree \nto legislative language that protects on-line service providers, or \nOSPs, from liability when they simply transmit information along the \nInternet.\n  The principles expressed in this legislation will provide a clear \npath for OSPs to operate without concern for legal ramifications or \ncopyright infringement that may occur in the regular course of the \noperation of the Internet, or that occur without the OSPs knowledge. \nWithout these issues being clearly delineated we would have faced a \nfuture of uncertainty regarding the growth of Internet and potentially \nwhether it could have operated at all. Make no mistake that the \nclarification of on-line service provider liability was one of my \nfundamental concerns in this debate. While this was not the only \ncrucial change in the legislation it is a change that I found essential \nfor this legislation to even be considered, which is why Title I of my \noriginal legislation was devoted to clearly defining liability.\n  Although I was supportive of the affected industries' efforts to \nresolve the OSP liability issues, there was one issue which the \nindustry agreement did not address--what protections would be given the \ntypical users of the Internet. The agreement protected the interests of \nOSPs, and it protected the interests of copyright owners, but it \nprovided little or no protection for an Internet user wrongfully \naccused of violating the copyright laws.\n  The original draft would have left these wrongly injured, innocent \nusers with limited recourse. They would have to hire an attorney and go \nto court to have the court require the OSP and copyright holder to \nallow the web page to go back up--in other words the end user would \nhave to go to court to prove their innocence. I found this situation to \nbe totally unacceptable. Even though several Judiciary Committee \nmembers claimed that no amendments were needed I made sure that the \nindustry compromise protected the rights of the typical Internet user \nby offering an amendment that provided protection included my original \nbill--an idea referred to as notice and put back. If material is \nwrongly taken down from an Internet user's home page because the \noriginal notice mistakenly did not take into account that the Internet \nuser was only making a fair use of the copyrighted work, my amendment \nensures that the end-user will be given notice of the action taken, and \ngives them a right to initiate a process that allows them to put their \nmaterial back on-line, without the need to hire a lawyer and go to \ncourt. This was a critical improvement over the industry's compromise \nagreement.\n  Another modification to the OSP liability material was to guarantee \nthat companies, such as Yahoo!, could continue to operate as they have \nprevious to the passage of this legislation. I admire companies that \ncan succeed in the highly competitive technology sector, and Yahoo! has \ndone just that. In no way should Congress discourage true \nentrepreneurship, particularly when the better ``mouse trap'' in this \ncase has propelled a company to the top of its market. The safe harbor \nshould not dissipate merely because a service provider viewed a \nparticular online location during the course of categorization for a \ndirectory. If the rule were otherwise, true consumer oriented products \nwould be eliminated or discouraged in the marketplace.\n  Finally, I also insisted on language in the Committee role that \nrecognized that the OSP liability provisions must be applied to \neducators and libraries with sensitivity to the special nature of those \ninstitutions and the unique relationships that exist in those settings. \nThe report also makes it clear that the notice and put-back provision I \nmentioned above provides all the process that is due, so that state \ninstitutions need not worry about having to choose between qualifying \nfor the safe harbors provided in the bill and the requirements imposed \nby the Due Process Clause.\n  The second title of my original legislation was dedicated to similar \nconcerns of universities, libraries, schools, educators and students, \nand ensured that these groups would not be left out when the content \nproviders rushed to secure their position in the digital age. This \nlegislation now includes some of the same provisions. I worked closely \nwith Senator Leahy, educators, libraries and publishers to guarantee \nthat libraries will be able to update their archives and provide \nmaterials to the public in a way that keeps pace with technology.\n\n  Additionally, this legislation begins the process to allow distance \neducation in the digital world. We should not tolerate laws that \ndiscriminate against technology, instead we should seek to guarantee \nthat what people can do in the analog that they can continue those \nactions in the digital world. A study will be undertaken to help \nCongress to sort out the many technological and legal challenges of \nupdating the copyright law regarding distance education. At the \nbeginning of the next Congress I fully expect to introduce legislation \nspecifically on distance education and I understand that both Senators \nHatch and Leahy have agreed to support legislation based on the study \nconducted by the Copyright Office. In addition, I look forward to \nworking with both the education community and the content community to \npass, not block, this important legislation. Distance education is of \nfundamental importance to Missouri, as it is to most rural states, and \nof great importance to the many parents who home school their children.\n  A third portion of the bill addresses the means by which the WIPO \ntreaties will be implemented in the United States, also referred to as \nsection 1201. This issue is of fundamental importance for a vital part \nof our nations\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\neconomy. Piracy is a large and growing problem for many content \nproviders, but particularly to our software industry. Billions of \ndollars in pirated material is lost every year and in impact is felt \ndirectly to our national bottom line.\n  While the overall structure of the legislation in this part is not \nthe way I would have approached the issue I believe that I have been \ngiven enough assurance both in legislative language and in legislative \nhistory that I can support the bill. I still find troubling any \napproach that makes technology the focus of illegality rather than the \nbad conduct of a bad actor, but with the accommodations that have been \ngiven I think that the bill is workable.\n  One issue of profound importance to me was ensuring that parents \ncontinue to have the legal ability to be good parents. The original \ndraft of this bill took such a broad approach to outlawing devices, \nthat it may have inadvertently made it illegal to manufacture and use \ndevices designed to protect children from on-line pornography. The \nbill, as amended recognizes that certain devices--such as devices that \nallow parents to protect their children from on-line pornography--must \nbe allowed. An amendment I offered in Committee makes clear that a \nparent may protect their children from pornography without running \nafoul of this law. We should never be in the position with any \nlegislation that intentionally or unintentionally makes good parenting \nillegal. When the choice is between protecting our children from \nobscene material and perhaps allowing one machine to be diverted for \nunlawful use, Congress and the courts should choose the protection of \nchildren every time.\n  Additionally, the protection of privacy remains a concern. While the \nlegislation makes some effort to make clear that a person acting to \nprotect their individual privacy should not be liable for or guilty of \ncircumvention some further clarification is needed. One of my primary \nconcerns has been the use of ``cookies'' and their detrimental impact \nfor on-line privacy. I am not convinced that cookies could not be \ncopyrighted and protected in such a way that getting rid of them or \nturning them off would not violate the new law. Recently my concern has \nbeen proven further by a piece of software developed by Blizzard \nEntertainment called StarCraft. This software rifles through the \nplayer's hard drives and sends the information found back to the \ncompany. Again, I was told by some that I should not be concerned, but \nI will tell you that I am concerned and everyone in this body and in \nthe country should have similar concerns about this or any legislation \nthat without careful thought could create a situation where an \nindividual's privacy is jeopardized. I believe the savings clause I \nadded to the bill will address this problem. However, if that does not \nprove sufficient, I will introduce legislation to deal with this \nproblem directly and will look forward to working with all the parties \nthat support this bill to ensure passage of such legislation.\n  One industry that has concerns about this legislation is the \nencryption industry. I sought to have included in the legislative \nlanguage a provision to guarantee that the highly successful means for \nencryption research that are used in this country may continue to be \nused in the future, despite some of the prohibitions included in this \nbill. Unfortunately, we were not able to work out any acceptable \nlegislative language. We were able to craft language for the report \nthat made clear that most forms of current encryption research were \nleft undisturbed by the bill. While I believe that this is better than \nnothing, I understand that there are lingering concerns, and I would \ncertainly support efforts to try to address this issue before the House \ncompletes work on this important piece of legislation.\n  In discussing the anti-circumvention portion of the legislation, I \nthink it is worth emphasizing that I could agree to support the bill's \napproach of outlawing certain devices because I was repeatedly assured \nthat the device prohibitions in 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) are aimed at so-\ncalled ``black boxes'' and not at legitimate consumer electronics and \ncomputer products that have substantial non-infringing uses. I \nspecifically worked for and achieved changes to the bill to make sure \nthat no court would misinterpret this bill as outlawing legitimate \nconsumer electronics devices or computer hardware. As a result, neither \nsection 1201(a)(2) nor section 1201(b) should be read as outlawing any \ndevice with substantial non-infringing uses, as per the tests provided \nin those sections.\n  If history is a guide, however, someone may yet try to use this bill \nas a basis for initiating litigation to stop legitimate new products \nfrom coming to market. By proposing the addition of section 1201(d)(2) \nand (3), I have sought to make clear that any such effort to use the \ncourts to block the introduction of new technology should be bound to \nfail.\n  As my colleagues may recall, this wouldn't be the first time someone \nhas tried to stop the advance of new technology. In the mid 1970s, for \nexample, a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block the introduction of \nthe Betamax video recorder. I think it useful to recall what the \nSupreme Court had to say in ruling for consumers and against two movie \nstudies in that case:\n\n       One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that \n     the elected representatives of the millions of people who \n     watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a \n     program for later viewing at home, or have enacted a flat \n     prohibition against the sale of machines that make such \n     copying possible.\n\n  As Missouri's Attorney General, I had the privilege to file a brief \nin the Supreme Court in support of the right of consumers to buy that \nfirst generation of VCRs. I want to make it clear that I did not come \nto Washington to vote for a bill that could be used to ban the next \ngeneration of recording equipment. I want to reassure consumers that \nnothing in the bill should be read to make it unlawful to produce and \nuse the next generation of computers or VCRs or whatever future device \nwill render one or the other of these familiar devices obsolete.\n  Another important amendment was added that makes clear that this law \ndoes not mandate any particular selection of components for the design \nof any technology. I was concerned that this legislation could be \ninterpreted as a mandate on product manufacturers to design products so \nas to respond affirmatively to effective technical protection measures \navailable in the marketplace. In response to this concern I was pleased \nto offer an amendment, with the support of both the Chairman and the \nRanking Member of the Committee, to avoid the unintended effect of \nhaving design requirements imposed on product and component \nmanufacturers, which would have a dampening effect on innovation, and \non the research and development of new products. Accordingly, my \namendment clarified that product designers need not design consumer \nelectronics, telecommunications, or computing products, nor design and \nselect parts or components for such products, in order to respond to \nparticular technological protection measures.\n  This amendment reflects my belief that product manufacturers should \nremain free to design and produce consumer electronics, \ntelecommunications and computing products without the threat of \nincurring liability for their design decisions under this legislation. \nNothing could cause greater disaster and a swifter downfall of our \nvibrant technology sector than to have the federal government dictating \nthe design of computer chips or mother boards. By way of example, \nduring the course of our deliberations, we were made aware of certain \nvideo boards used in personal computers in order to allow consumers to \nreceive television signals on their computer monitors which, in order \nto transform the television signal from a TV signal to one capable of \ndisplay on a computer monitor, remove attributes of the original signal \nthat may be associated with certain copy control technologies. I am \nacutely aware of this particular example because I have one of these \nvideo boards on my own computer back in my office. It is quite useful \nas it allows me to monitor the Senate floor, and occasionally ESPN on \nthose rare occasions when the Senate is not in session. My amendment \nmakes it clear that this legislation does not require that such \ntransformations, which are part of the normal conversion process rather \nthan affirmative attempts to remove or circumvent copy control \ntechnologies, fall within the proscriptions of chapter\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\n12 of the copyright law as added by this bill.\n  Further, concerns were voiced during the Committee's deliberations \nthat because 1201 applies not only to devices but to parts and \ncomponents of devices, it could be interpreted broadly to sweep in \nlegitimate products such as personal computers and accessories and \nvideo and audio recording devices. While the manufacturers of these \nproducts were understandably concerned, it was quite apparent to me \nthat it was not the Committee's intention that such useful multipurpose \narticles of commerce be prohibited by 1201 on the basis that they may \nhave particular parts or components that might, if evaluated separately \nfrom such products, fall within the proscriptions of 1201(a)(2) or (b). \nMy amendment adding sections 1201(d)(2) and (3) was intended to address \nthese concerns.\n  Another issue of concern is that unless product designers are \nadequately consulted on the design and implementation of technological \nprotection measures and means of preserving copyright management \ninformation, such measures may have noticeable and recurring adverse \neffects on the authorized display or performance of works. Under such \ncircumstances, certain adjustments to specific products may become \nnecessary after sale to a consumer to maintain the normal, authorized \nfunctioning of such products. Such adjustments, when made solely to \nmitigate the adverse effects of the measure on the normal, authorized \noperation of a manufacturer's product, device, component, or part \nthereof, would not, in my view, constitute conduct that would fall \nwithin the proscriptions of this legislation.\n  The problems described may occur at a more fundamental level--with \nnoticeable and recurring adverse effects on the normal operation of \nproducts that are being manufactured and sold to consumers. The best \nway to avoid this problem is for companies and industries to work \ntogether to seek to avoid such problems to the maximum extent possible. \nI am pleased to note that multi-industry efforts to develop copy \ncontrol technologies that are both effective and avoid such noticeable \nand recurring adverse effects have been underway over the past two \nyears in relation to certain copy protection measures. I join my \ncolleagues in strongly encouraging the continuation of these efforts, \nsince, in my view, they offer substantial benefits to copyright owners \nwho add so much to the economy and who obviously want devices that do \nnot interfere with the other normal operations of affected products.\n  The truth of the matter is that Congress ought to operate \ncontemporaneously with industry to solve problems. Anytime the affected \nindustries beat government to the solution they ought to be praised. In \nmany respects I invite the private sector to be there first and get it \ndone well. If they are there first, they will often solve the problem. \nEven when they cannot solve the problem, the private sector problem \nsolving process will at least narrow the issues for the government to \naddress. Getting a law passed is very difficult, getting it changed is \nsometimes even more difficult, and so relying on government really \nelevates the need to have no garbage in, to result in the right output.\n  I would encourage the content community and the device and hardware \nmanufacturers to work together to avoid situations in which effective \ntechnological measures and copyright management information affect \ndisplay quality. There is no reason why the interested parties cannot \nresolve these issues to ensure both optimal protection of content and \noptimal picture quality. To the extent that a particular technological \nprotection measure or means of applying or embedding copyright \nmanagement information to or in a work is designed and deployed into \nthe marketplace without adequate consultation with potentially affected \nmanufacturers, the proprietor of such a measure or means and those \ncopyright owners using it must be aware that product adjustments by a \nmanufacturer to avoid noticeable and recurring adverse effects on the \nnormal, authorized operation of affected products are foreseeable, \nlegitimate and commercially necessary. Such actions by manufacturers \nmay not, therefore, be proscribed by this chapter.\n  Again, several individuals and organizations deserve thanks from \neveryone involved in this debate. I want to take a moment to thank \nthose few particular staff who labored into the night and over weekends \nto put together this legislation and to accommodate some of my \nconcerns. Ed Damich and Troy Dow with Senator Hatch's office were \ncritical to moving forward on all issues particularly by coordinating \nthe OSP discussions. Beryl Howell and Marla Grossman were similarly \nimportant to the process particularly in regards to the education \nprovisions and on drafting language for several key areas. I would like \nto thank all of the individuals representing various industry and \neducational interests who were critical not only in educating me on the \nmyriad issues but also on copyright law in general. Finally, I would \nagain like to thank the members of my own staff, Bartlett Cleland and \nPaul Clement who worked so well to produce a piece of legislation that \ncould guide this country to a digital future.\n  In the end, this is not a perfect bill. I would have favored a \ndifferent approach to some issues. However, this bill is an important \nstep forward in bringing the copyright law into the digital age. I am \nhappy to support this bill and look forward to its final passage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act of 1998. In my view, we need this measure to \nstop an epidemic of illegal copying of protected works--such as movies, \nbooks, musical recordings, and software. The copyright industry is one \nof our most thriving businesses. But we still lose more than $15 \nbillion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according to some \nestimates.\n  This foreign piracy is out of control. For example, one of my \nstaffers investigating video piracy on a trip to China walked into a \nHong Kong arcade and bought three bootlegged computer games--including \n``Toy Story'' and ``NBA `97''--for just $10. These games normally sell \nfor about $100. Indeed, the manager was so brazen about it, he even \nagreed to give a receipt.\n  Illegal copying has been a longstanding concern to me. I introduced \none of the precursors to this bill, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, \nwhich in principle has been incorporated into this measure. And I was \none of the original cosponsors of the original proposed WIPO \nimplementing legislation, the preliminary version of this measure.\n  In my opinion, this bill achieves a fair balance by taking steps to \neffectively deter piracy, while still allowing fair use of protected \nmaterials. It is the product of intensive negotiations between all of \nthe interested parties--including the copyright industry, telephone \ncompanies, libraries, universities and device manufacturers. And every \nmajor concern raised during that process was addressed. For these \nreasons, it earned the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am confident that this bill has the best approach for stopping \npiracy and strengthening one of our biggest export industries. It \ndeserves our support. Thank you.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few brief remarks on \nS. 2037, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which would \nimplement the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties. The \namendments adopted in Committee make some significant improvements to \nthe original bill. For example, the bill now includes provisions \nclarifying educational institution and library liability and use \nexemptions, as well as provisions dealing with distance learning. The \nCommittee also adopted provisions addressing concerns regarding \npornography and privacy. Further, I worked with Senator Kyl to make \nsure that our law enforcement and intelligence people are able to carry \nout their duties in the best, and most effective, manner possible.\n  It was important to me that the bill be clarified to ensure that \nparents are not prohibited from monitoring, or limiting access to, \ntheir children in regard to pornography and other indecent material on \nthe Internet. I don't believe anyone wants to restrict parents' rights \nto take care of their children, or to take away tools that might be \nhelpful for parents to ensure that their kids aren't accessing sites \ncontaining pornography. The interests of the copyright owners had to be \nbalanced with the needs of consumers and\n\n[[Page S4892]]\n\nfamilies. I think that the Committee made a significant improvement to \nthe bill in defense of this important protection for our families.\n  Also, the Committee worked on changes which protect individuals' \nright to privacy on the Internet. I've heard concerns about software \nprograms, probes, contaminants and ``cookies,'' and how they obtain \npersonal and confidential information on Internet users and then convey \nit to companies for commercial purposes, sometimes without the users \neven knowing that this is happening. Even if users are aware a \n``cookie'' or one of these other techniques has been sent to them, I \nthink we'd all agree that Internet users should have a choice on \nwhether to give up their personal information or not. While some argue \nthat this is a non-issue because ``cookies'' and ``cookie-cutting'' do \nnot violate the provisions of the bill, I've heard otherwise. In fact, \nI've heard about a case where a computer game company admitted that it \nsurreptitiously collected personal information from users' computers \nwhen they were playing the game via the Internet. So I was not \nconvinced that there did not need to be a clarification in the bill on \nthis subject. The intent behind the bill is now clear that an Internet \nuser can protect his or her privacy by disabling programs that transmit \ninformation on that user to other parties, or by utilizing software \nprograms like ``cookie-cutters'' to do this.\n  I'd also like to make a few remarks on the clarification Senator Kyl \nand I worked on dealing with the law enforcement exceptions in the \nbill. The changes Senator Kyl and I made substantially improve the \nbill's language by making it clear that the exceptions will protect \nofficers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting \nat the direction of, a law enforcement or intelligence agency of the \nUnited States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, who are \nperforming lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or \nintelligence activities. Further, the bill's language was clarified to \nindicate that the exceptions also apply to officers, agents, employees, \nor contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, any \nelement or division of an agency or department of the United States, a \nState, or a political subdivision of a State, which does not have law \nenforcement or intelligence as its primary function, when those \nindividuals are performing lawfully authorized investigative, \nprotective, or intelligence activities. I'd like to note that the \nCommittee report makes clear that these exceptions only apply when the \nindividuals are performing these activities within the scope of their \nduties and in furtherance of lawfully authorized activities. Our law \nenforcement and intelligence people must have the opportunity and the \ntools to carry out their duties effectively. This language was crafted \nwith the input and support of representatives from the law enforcement \ncommunity, the Administration, as well as the content providers and \nother parties. I'd like to especially thank Senator Kyl and his fine \nstaff for their hard work on this important clarification to the bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Ashcroft and his staff for all the hard work \nand long hours they put into this difficult negotiations process to \nimprove this bill. Their efforts in working for a balance of interests \nin the bill are to be commended. I'd also like to thank Chairman Hatch \nand Senator Leahy, and their staffs, for their hard work on the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President I am proud to support the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 which I believe is an important \nstep in the evolution of international digital commerce. The DMCA \naccomplishes two important goals--it implements the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization Copyright Treaty and the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty. Both treaties \ninclude provisions that respond to the challenges of digital \ntechnology.\n  Although the treaties contain little that is not already covered by \nU.S. law, the treaties will provide U.S. copyright holders the \nworldwide protections they need and deserve. In addition, the treaties \nwill go along way towards standardizing international copyright \npractice.\n  Intellectual property, including copyright, is an integral part of \nthe U.S. economy. The core copyright industries accounted for $238.6 \nbillion in value added to the U.S. economy, accounting for \napproximately 3.74 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. In addition, \nbetween 1977 and 1993, employment in the core copyright industries \ndoubled to 3 million workers, about 2.5 percent of total U.S. \nemployment. The copyright industries contribute more to the U.S. \neconomy and employ more workers than any single manufacturing sector \nincluding aircraft, textiles and apparels or chemicals.\n  Intellectual property is a particularly integral part of the economy \nof my home state of California. California is the leading producer of \nmovies, computer software, recordings, video games, and other creative \nworks. California's movie and television industries employed \napproximately 165,000 Californians in 1995 and the combined payroll of \nthose industries was $7.4 billion. Similarly, the California pre-\npackaged computer software industry employs more than 25,000 \nCalifornians.\n  Finally Mr. President, I want to note the importance of this bill to \nOnline Service Providers (OSPs) and to Internet Service Providers \n(ISPs). I believe it is important to update our copyright laws to \ncomport with the digital electronic age in which we now operate. This \nbill appropriately balances the interests of copyright holders and \nOSPs/ISPs. It ensures that creative works receive the protection they \ndeserve while also assuring that OSPs/ISPs are not held liable for \nunknowingly posting infringing material or for merely providing the \nphysical facilities used to upload infringing material.\n  I think this is a good bill, a balanced and fair bill, and I am proud \nto support it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. 2037, the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act. This legislation implementing the \nWorld Intellectual Property Organization Treaty is of vital importance \nto the American economy.\n  No nation benefits more from the protection of intellectual property \nthan the United States. We lead the world in the production and export \nof intellectual property, including the many forms of artistic \nintellectual property and computer software. These industries are among \nthe fastest growing employers in our country. When the owners of \nintellectual property are not fairly compensated, that hurts Americans \nand it decreases incentives for creating additional intellectual \nproperty that educates, entertains, and does business for us.\n  New technology creates exciting opportunities for intellectual \nproperty, but the digital environment also poses threats to this form \nof property. Unscrupulous copyright violators can use the Internet to \nmore widely distribute copyrighted material without permission. To \nmaintain fair compensation to the owners of intellectual property, a \nregime for copyright protection in the digital age must be created. \nTechnology to protect access to copyrighted work must be safeguarded. \nCopyright management information that identifies the copyright owner \nand the terms and conditions of use of the copyrighted material must be \nsecured.\n  There are new issues with respect to copyright in the digital age \nthat never were issues before. The bill addresses such issues as on-\nline service provider liability in a way that is fair to all parties. \nAnd it governs a number of other issues that have been accommodated in \nthe new era.\n  Passage of this bill is important if American intellectual property \nis to be protected in other countries. I was pleased to be an original \nco-sponsor of the initial bill, and to have supported the bill in the \nJudiciary Committee and now on the floor. I strongly support its \nenactment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to speak on passage of S. 2037, the Digital Millennium Copyright \nAct. This Act implements two treaties adopted by the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization, or WIPO, in December, 1996--the WIPO Copyright \nTreaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.\n  Passage of this important legislation will clear the way for \nratification of these treaties, which are in the paramount interest of \nthe United States--\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\nand of the State of California, in particular. These treaties are \nintended to ensure that foreign countries give intellectual property to \nthe same high level of protection that we afford it here in the U.S.\n  The United States is the world's leader in intellectual property, the \nhome of the most creative and dynamic individuals and enterprises in \nthe world--the majority of whom are located in California. This \nindustry constitutes a very important sector of the U.S. economy, and \ncontributes greatly to our global economic position: American creative \nindustries grew twice as fast as the rest of the U.S. economy from \n1987-94; more than 3 million Americans worked in the core copyright \nindustries as of 1994; exports of U.S. intellectual property were more \nthan $53 billion in 1995; and the Business Software Alliance reports \nthat 50-60 percent of its revenues come from overseas.\n  It is vital that we do everything we can to protect and defend this \nimportant sector of the economy from foreign piracy, especially in this \nnew digital age, when the potential exists for thousands of absolutely \nperfect, priated copies of American intellectual property to be made \nalmost instantly, at the tough of a button: American copyright owners \nlose $15 billion in overseas sales to piracy every year; the digital \ngaming industry loses $3.2 billion per year to priacy--almost one third \nof its $10.1 billion annual sales; and the recording industry's \ndomestic business is flat and they need a strong export market for \nsales growth.\n  Indeed, some countries, such as Argentina, have said that computer \nprograms aren't even protected by copyright; ratifying WIPO will ensure \nthat they are. Foreign countries have been waiting for the U.S., as the \nworld's largest producer of intellectual property, to take the lead in \nWIPO ratification before the ratify the WIPO treaty, so this is an \nimportant step we are taking today.\n  The bill which we crafted in the Judiciary Committee is a truly \nimpressive achievement. We worked together with a plethora of diverse \nindustries, academic interests, and law enforcement to forge a bill \nwhich advances everybody's interest.\n  Title I of the bill implements the WIPO treaties, and outlaws so-\ncalled ``black boxes'': devices designed to accomplish the perfect \ndigital piracy which I have mentioned. By protecting against this \npiracy and paving the way for ratification of the WIPO treaties, this \ntitle provides immense help to America's creative industries, including \nauthors, composers, publishers, performers, movie-makers, the recording \nindustry, and the software industry.\n\n  Title II of the bill provides for protection from copyright \ninfringement liability for on-line service providers who act \nresponsibly. This title provides much-desired protection for on-line \nservice providers, such as Yahoo! from my State of California, \ntelecommunications companies, and educational institutions.\n  Title II includes a provision which I authored, section 204 of the \nbill, which requires the Copyright Office to take a comprehensive look \nat the issue of the liability of schools and universities for the acts \nof their students and faculty who may use their network to post \ninfringing materials, and to make recommendations for legislation.\n  Among the factors which the Copyright Office is to consider are: What \nis the direct, vicarious, and contributory liability of universities \nfor infringement by: faculty, administrative employees, students, \ngraduate students, and students who are employed by the university.\n  What other users of university computers universities may be \nresponsible for; the unique nature of the relationship between \nuniversities and faculty; what policies should universities adopt \nregarding copyright infringement by university computer users; what \ntechnological measures are available to monitor infringing uses; what \nmonitoring of the computer system by universities is appropriate; what \ndue process should the universities afford in disabling access by \nallegedly infringing computer users; should distinctions be drawn \nbetween open computer systems, closed computer systems, and open \nsystems with password-protected parts; and taking into account the \ntradition of academic freedom.\n  I want to thank the Chairman, Senator Hatch, and the Ranking Member, \nSenator Leahy, for working with me on this provision.\n  It is my hope and expectation that copyright content providers and \nthe educational community will get together and work cooperatively to \naddress these issues during the course of the Copyright Office study.\n  Title III of the bill ensures that computer maintenance and repair \nproviders will not be found liable for copyright infringement for \nperforming their ordinary services.\n  Title IV of the bill provides additional copyright exemptions for \nlibraries, archives and broadcasters, and another study, of distance \nlearning, which could benefit educational institutions.\n  So this bill helps an incredibly broad spectrum of American \ninterests: authors, telecommunications, universities, computer makers, \nmovies, software, broadcasters, and on and on. No small number of these \nindustries are centered or have very substantial presence in, and \nimmense importance to the economy of, my state of California.\n  Thus, it is with great pleasure that I applaud the passage of this \nlegislation, and urge the House to protect America's economy and \nrapidly pass it as well.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President: I rise today to speak about a section in the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act that I am particularly proud of, and \nthat is the law enforcement exception in the bill. At the Judiciary \nCommittee mark-up, Senator Grassley and I, along with the assistance of \nChairman Hatch and Senator Ashcroft worked to strengthen the law \nenforcement exception in the bill. We received input on the language \nfrom the copyright community and the administration: the National \nSecurity Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, and the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB).\n  The law enforcement exception ensures that the government continues \nto have access to current and future technologies to assist in their \ninvestigative, protective, or intelligence activities. I am concerned \nthat the tools and resources of our intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunities are preserved--and more importantly, not limited, by \npassage of S. 2037. Under this bill, a company who contracts with the \ngovernment can continue to develop encryption/decryption devices under \nthat contract, without having to worry about criminal penalties.\n  Because much of our leading technologies come from the private \nsector, the government needs to have access to this vital resource for \nintelligence and law enforcement purposes.\n  The law enforcement exception recognizes that oftentimes governmental \nagencies work with non-governmental entities--companies, in order to \nhave access to and develop cutting edge technologies and devices. Such \nconduct should not be prohibited or impeded by this copyright \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their hard work \non this legislation--which implements the two world intellectual \nproperty organization copyright treaties adopted by the 1996 Geneva \ndiplomatic conference.\n  As is the practice on such intellectual property matters, we are \nfirst seeking to pass the implementing legislation. This, I believe, \nwill pave the way for the Foreign Relations Committee--and the full \nsenate--to ratify the treaties, which the administration submitted last \nJuly.\n  The WIPO treaties and the implementing legislation will update \nintellectual property law to deal with the explosion of the Internet \nand other forms of electronic communications. Delegates from the United \nStates and 160 other member nations agreed to give authors of \n``literary and artistic works,'' including books, computer programs, \nfilms, and sound recordings, the exclusive right to sell or otherwise \nmake their work available to the public.\n  The treaties give tougher international protection to software makers \nand the recording industry--the U.S. Government's biggest goal. The \nU.S. wanted--and got--tough international protection for sound \nrecordings in order to stop pirating of music compact discs overseas. \nThe treaties protect literary and artistic works from\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\ndigital copying, but do not make it illegal to use the Internet in the \nnormal way.\n  To give a concrete example of what passage and implementation of the \nWIPO treaties will mean--before the treaty it was illegal to photocopy \nthe contents of an entire book or copy a videotape without permission, \nbut it was not clear whether it was illegal to e-mail copies of a \ndigital book or movie to 500 friends all over the world. Passage of \nthis bill and the WIPO treaties will ensure that both will be illegal--\nboth domestically and overseas.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains provisions to clarify the \nactions Internet service providers--as well as libraries and \neducational institutions--will be legally required to take when \nconfronted with evidence of copyright violations by users of their \nservices.\n  I am also pleased that this bill contains language intended to \npreserve the ability of consumer electronics manufacturers--and \ncomputer manufacturers and software developers--to continue research \nand development of innovative devices and hardware products.\n  These provisions in my view strike an appropriate balance between the \nrights of copyright holders and the need to encourage continuing \nexpansion of access to digital information to greater numbers of users \nthroughout the world.\n  Therefore, I commend my Judiciary Committee colleagues for their hard \nwork on this bill and I look forward to its passage by the Congress.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back the remainder \nof our time. First, I understand that the Senator from Illinois would \nlike up to 2 minutes. We will yield that time to him, and then we will \nyield the remainder of the time and go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, many good reasons have been stated on the \nfloor for the passage of this important legislation. I hold in my hand \nconvincing evidence. It is an unsolicited e-mail sent to my Senate \ncomputer a few weeks ago. It boasts that they will offer for me to \npurchase 500 different bootleg video games from a person who says in \nthis solicitation, ``All the games I sell are pirated. I do not sell \noriginals.'' This business is operating across the United States, \nCanada, England, Australia, and claims to trade copies made in Hong \nKong.\n  When you think of the importance of intellectual property to \nAmerica's exports and the importance of this business in terms of the \nUnited States and the world, it is clear that we need this legislation \nto stop this type of flagrant abuse, which I received and I am sure \nmany others could receive if they surf the Internet.\n  I commend Senators Hatch, Leahy, Ashcroft, and so many others. I urge \nits unanimous passage and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Leahy and myself, I \nyield the remainder of our time. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to recognize and honor Rear Admiral \nKendell Pease, United States Navy, as he prepares to retire upon \ncompletion of more than 34 years of faithful service to our great \nnation.\n  A Boston native, Rear Admiral Pease grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, \nenlisted in the United States Navy in 1963 and was selected to attend \nthe United States Naval Academy. Upon graduation in 1968, he was \ncommissioned an Ensign and began a distinguished career as a Public \nAffairs Officer. He initially served in the Republic of Vietnam and had \nfollow-on public affairs assignments in Charleston, South Carolina; \nNaples, Italy; and Norfolk, Virginia. He served as the Public Affairs \nOfficer for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet, the Naval Academy, and was \nassigned to multiple tours in Washington including the Department of \nDefense, the On-Site Inspection Agency and the Department of the Navy.\n  Since 1992, Rear Admiral Pease served as the Navy's Chief of \nInformation. In this capacity, he has been instrumental in educating \nthe American public about the Navy's role in protecting American \ninterests around the world. During his watch, he led hundreds of \nsuccessful efforts to communicate Navy operations in areas from A to Z, \nAlbania to Zaire, including Bosnia, the Persian Gulf and Somalia. He \nalso deserves tremendous credit for his efforts to communicate the need \nfor very important Navy programs such as the SEAWOLF and NSSN submarine \nprograms; CVN 77 and CVX; DDG 51 and DD 21; and Super Hornet. He \naccomplished all of this while navigating the Navy through a number of \ncontentious issues, earning deep respect for his style of aggressively \nand honestly communicating all of the facts.\n  Most significantly, Rear Admiral Pease served as a passionate \nadvocate for the Sailors in the Fleet--the men and women who serve far \nfrom home\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\nanywhere, anytime, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Their welfare was \nalways his number one priority, for he truly understood that Sailors \nare the backbone of our nation's strategy of forward presence, and \nproviding them with better internal communication would make for a more \nsuccessful Sailor. He focused on improving the Navy's internal \ncommunication tools and methods--including improvements to the fleet-\nwide internal magazine (All Hands), the television program ``Navy and \nMarine Corps News'' shown each week aboard ships at sea, and a new \nprogram to take satellite television direct to Sailors at sea. Rear \nAdmiral Pease made it his mission to ensure that opinion leaders and \ndecision makers understood the special needs of Sailors and their \nfamilies.\n  An individual of exceptional character and uncommon vision, this \ngreat Nation and our military are indebted to Rear Admiral Pease for \nhis many years of outstanding service. I am proud, Mr. President, to \nthank him for his honorable service in the United States Navy and to \nwish him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he closes his \ndistinguished military career.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4900-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I stand today as the sponsor of Senate \nResolution 201 designating May 15, 1998, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day.\n  This is the fifth year in a row that I have sponsored this resolution \nand I am proud to be joined this year by 62 of my Senate colleagues in \nhonoring the brave men and women who serve this country as peace \nofficers.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow we will be adding the names of 159 officers \nto the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Since the inception \nof this memorial, 14,662 peace officers names have been inscribed on \nthe wall. I am also pleased to share with my Colleagues that tomorrow, \nat the State Police complex in Meridian, Idaho, the State will dedicate \nits own Law Enforcement Memorial to those Idahoans who have paid the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  These memorials, and others around the nation, serve as proof that \nthe individuals who serve this nation as our guardians of peace do so \nat great personal risk. There are few communities in America that have \nnot been touched by the senseless death of a peace officer by violent \nmeans. Last year, two communities in Idaho experienced the tragic \ndeaths of two very talented and brave officers. I would like to share \nwith you the sacrifices these men gave to protect the sanctity of their \ncommunities. It is my hope that while I relay their stories each of us \nwould realize the important role that peace officers play in our \neveryday lives.\n  While searching for the body of an 18 month old infant who had been \nlost in the Salmon River, William Inman, a Lemhi County deputy Sheriff, \nwas killed when his hyper-light aircraft struck an unmarked power line \nand he tragically plunged into the river.\n  Deputy Inman devoted his entire life to being an excellent police \nofficer. He was a Sergeant in the police force in Peoria, Illinois, \nwhere he retired in order to become the Chief of Police in Farmington. \nAfter retiring from the Farmington force he moved to Salmon, Idaho, \nwhere he went to work as Sheriff's Deputy for Lemhi County. After his \ndeath deputy Inman was inducted posthumously into the American Police \nHall of Fame.\n  William Inman was a father of four children: Maria, Tracy, Jeff and \nJennifer and was a loving husband to his wife Donna. Along with \nspending as much time with his family as he could, Bill was an avid \noutdoorsman.\n  Bill Inman will be greatly missed by many, many people.\n  The second tragedy struck Idaho's capital city of Boise in the early \nmorning hours of September 20, 1997. Boise Police Officer Mark Stall \npulled over a car bearing Pennsylvania plates that had committed a \ntraffic violation. The driver and passenger of the vehicle refused to \ncooperate with Officer Stall's requests, when the driver suddenly \nremoved a gun from under his coat and shot Officer Stall. Officer \nStall, inflicted with a mortal gunshot wound, fell back to his patrol \nvehicle for cover and continued firing at the men in order to protect \nother Bosie officers in the ensuing gunfight. Both Officer Mark Stall \nand the two assailants were killed. Mark Stall's sacrifice protected \nnot only the officers at the scene but the entire community, when a \nsearch of the suspect's residence revealed an arsenal of guns and \nexplosive materials. You know it was not for peaceful purposes.\n  Officer Stall was an exemplary police officer and set the standard \nfor other officers both in Boise and around the nation. He was a loving \nfather to his daughters Jonelle and Julia, and a devoted husband and \nbest friend to his wife, Cheryl. Officer Stall was committed to his \nfamily, his community, his job and above all his God. I would like to \nshare with you an excerpt from an Idaho Statesman article that outlines \nthe lives of Idaho Peace Officers. In the article Officer Heath Compton \ncharacterized his hero, Mark Stall. ``One night quite a while back, I \nwas driving down State Street in my patrol car, when a Boise police \nofficer shined his spotlight in my face. I stopped to talk with him. I \nhad never met the officer before, but realized quickly that he was very \nlikable. He introduced himself as Mark Stall. Over the next several \nmonths, I got to know Mark quite well. What I learned was that Mark \nloved God, his family, the people he worked for and with. He always had \na smile on his face and a good word.''\n  The bravery and commitment to community that these men possessed will \nbe carried on by their families. I am pleased to say that I have had \nthe opportunity to spend time with the families of both officers.\n  I met with the Inman family this morning, and yesterday I met with \nthe Stall family, with his wife and his daughters and also with his \nmother and father, with his mother-in-law and father-in-law, brothers \nand sisters and all of their children. What a beautiful family. The \nonly thing that was missing was Mark. But you can see the blessing that \nMark had given to that family because of the wonderful memories of a \ngreat man. He will be missed greatly by his community and by his \nfamily, but every life that Mark touched will be blessed because of his \nbeing here.\n  The strength and perseverance that is exemplified by each of them is \nan inspiration to me. My thoughts and prayers go out to these families \nand others that have been devastated by this type of senseless loss.\n  This resolution is not the answer to the meaningless violence that \noccurs in our communities but it is a small attempt to celebrate and \nmemorialize the lives of the officers who serve and protect us. I would \nlike to thank my colleagues for their cosponsorship and would like to \nagain thank the officers and the families that have come from all fifty \nstates to our Nation's capital on this special day to eulogize these \nofficers that have given the greatest sacrifice of all--their lives--in \nthe performance of their duties.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for all Senators and for Americans when \nI salute the peace officers of America in all the communities, large \nand small. When they perform their duties, they are not sure what the \noutcome will be. They are never sure if it is going to be a peaceful \nstop or one that ends in violence and the loss of life.\n  I know many of the police officers throughout my State of Idaho. I am \nproud to know each and every one of them, and I pray for their safety \nand that the officers will return safely to their families.\n  It is an honor to serve here, with all of the police officers on \nCapitol Hill who we come to know personally. Again, they are an \noutstanding group of peace officers, as they are throughout this \nNation.\n  Today, Mr. President, I thank the Senate for properly acknowledging \nthe role of peace officers and saying to the Inman family and to the \nStall family, thank you for your sacrifice. God bless you and may you \nhave peace in the days that follow.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4901-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4901-S4902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute's report \nfor the week ending May 8, disclosed that the U.S. imported 8,772,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, an increase of 1,206,000 barrels over the \n7,566,000 imported every day during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.9 percent of their needs last \nweek. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent \nof its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo \nin the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's \noil supply.\n  Politicians had better give consideration to the the economic \ncalamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut \noff our supply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil \nflowing into the U.S.--now 8,772,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4902-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:34 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 10.

As \n     many as 125,000 lower income families buy their first home \n     each year through programs in the states financed with \n     mortgage revenue bonds; and\n       Whereas, the cap on the amount of money the states can use \n     for home ownership programs based on mortgage revenue bonds \n     was last adjusted a decade ago. As a result, annual demand \n     exceeds supply for mortgage revenue bond money by \n     approximately $2 billion; and\n       Whereas, mortgage revenue bonds help finance mortgages for \n     buyers with nearly 80 percent of the national median income, \n     with the average price of the homes also approximately 80 \n     percent of average conventionally financed, first-time homes. \n     The programs' requirements for income levels and the \n     safeguards against abuse make this one of the most successful \n     initiatives for home ownership in our country; and\n       Whereas, there are two bills currently before Congress that \n     seek to raise the cap for mortgage revenue bonds. These \n     bills, H.R. 979 and S. 1251, would amend the Internal Revenue \n     Code to raise the cap. An important feature of the proposal \n     is that this amount would be indexed to inflation, beginning \n     in 1999.

That we hereby urge the Congress of the United States to \n     prepare and submit to the several states an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States to add a new article \n     providing as follows:\n       ``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of the \n     United States shall have the power to instruct or order a \n     state or a political subdivision thereof, or an official of \n     such a state or political subdivision, to levy or increase \n     taxes.''\n       2. That this resolution constitutes a continuing \n     application in accordance with Article V of the Constitution \n     of the United States.\n       3.

Sec. 3796, et \n     seq.) which gave states funding to create programs to help \n     improve the responses of victim service providers and law \n     enforcement authorities to violence against women and \n     provided for vigorous apprehension and prosecution of persons \n     committing crimes against women; and\n       Whereas, Congress will be considering reauthorization of \n     this Act under the Violence Against Women Act of 1998 which \n     seek funding to continue the important programs originally \n     enacted in the first Violence Against Women Act of 1994; \n     additional funding for new programs to address other issues \n     including child custody, insurance discrimination, legal \n     services eligibility, medical training, workplace safety, and \n     campus crime; and funding for training programs for social \n     service providers and law enforcement officials to target \n     violence against older women, disabled women, and provisions \n     to address the special needs of battered immigrant women; \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the \n     Congress of the United States to support reauthorization of \n     and funding for the Violence Against Women Act of 1998; be it \n     further\n       Resolved That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-418.

Mr. President, colleagues, and ladies and \ngentlemen, I rise today to introduce legislation to change the Tax Code \nto put stay-at-home moms and dads on an equal footing with two-income \nfamilies. My legislation is cosponsored by Senators Hatch, Grams, \nWyden, and Abraham. This legislation that we introduce will\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\nincrease the current $500-per-child credit to $1,500 per child for \nchildren up to 6 years of age. This credit would replace the current \ndependent care tax credit with real money that directly benefits \nfamilies and restores equality and fairness in child care.\n  Mr. President, there are many proposals to reduce tax burdens, many \nof which I wholeheartedly support, such as the elimination of the \nmarriage penalty. But I must confess some frustration that I felt on \nthe night our President gave his State of the Union Address when he \nspoke at great length about child care. He made a proposal, about $20 \nbillion worth, that contained many laudable provisions and parts of \nwhich I could support. But it contained a very glaring omission, in my \nview. The Clinton administration policy is both a direct and indirect \nsubsidy to the marketplace day care industry. The administration seeks \nto help only a small portion of working parents, ruling out those who \nwish to stay at home to take care of their child and those who do not \nwant to use marketplace day care. Government policy ought not to \ndiscriminate in this manner against the best form of child care where \nthe child is taken care of by his or her own parents or family member.\n  A few months ago Renee Anderson of Medford, OR, sent me an e-mail \ncommenting that government spending will not give tax relief to parents \nof preschoolers who take care of their own children.\n  Here is her letter, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Medford, OR,\n\n                                                    March 7, 1998.\n     Re the President's National Day Care Plan.\n\n       Dear Senator Gordon Smith: Please do all you can to squelch \n     Bill and Hillary Clinton's $21.7 billion National Day Care \n     Plan.\n       It is loaded with a number of government-controlled \n     programs.\n       New spending will not give tax relief to parents of \n     preschoolers who take care of their own children.\n       Not one penny of relief will help increase the amount of \n     time parents will have available to spend with their \n     children.\n       This is ``day care,'' not ``child care.'' Child care is \n     something that every family does. Day care is the activity, \n     undertaken out of preference or necessity, that some families \n     choose.\n       There is a rampant prejudice against stay-at-home parents.\n       Here's what's at stake: the continued importance of \n     parental care of children and through that care, passing on \n     the values that families hold dear.\n       Commercial day care is often avoided if at all possible \n     because there is a lack of personalized attention and \n     affection. Plus there is a greater exposure to childhood \n     diseases and many other sicknesses.\n       Surely this new public policy is very characteristic of \n     today's government arrogance.\n       I strongly oppose this $21.7 billion national day care \n     plan. It is an alarming example of government encroachment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Renee Anderson.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Renee, like many mothers and fathers, sees most \ngovernment spending as ``day care'' and not ``child care.'' Child care, \nshe says, is something that every family does. Day care is the activity \nundertaken out of either preference or necessity that some families are \nable to choose or forced to choose.\n  A recent Wirthlin poll shows that care by a child's own parent or \nimmediate family member is rated as the most desirable form of child \ncare, with child care by a family's mother ranking the highest.\n  Census Bureau statistics show that many families--nearly half of \nthose with children under 6 years of age--pass up a second income and \ncare for their children themselves, and yet where is the tax relief to \nhelp ease the burden of child care expenses for families that choose to \ntake care of their children in their homes? It simply is not there. \nThis legislation will eliminate the current discriminatory tax policy \nand replace it with one that is fair to all families regardless of the \nchild care choices they make.\n  I hope many of my colleagues can join in supporting this legislation. \nI know it competes with many other proposals, but I, frankly, can think \nof no greater priority that we ought to have than helping mothers and \nfathers take care of their children, for truly the hand that rocks the \ncradle is the hand that controls the future. There is no more important \nresponsibility that any of us as mortals undertake than to rear a \nchild. So the Federal Government ought to not get in the way of that \nbut ought to reduce its take and leave more resources to mothers and \nfathers to leave them at home where they can serve real human and child \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT FOR CHILDREN \n                   UNDER AGE 6 WITH INCREASE IN CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Increase in Child Tax Credit.--Subsection (a) of \n     section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     child tax credit) is amended by striking ``an amount equal to \n     $500'' and all that follows through the period and inserting \n     the following: ``an amount equal to--\n       ``(1) $1,500 in the case of a qualifying child who is 5 \n     years of age or less, and\n       ``(2) $500 in the case of all other qualifying children.''.\n       (b) Coordination of Dependent Care Credit.--Section 21 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to expenses for \n     household and dependent care services necessary for gainful \n     employment) is amended by inserting ``over the age of 5 and'' \n     before ``under the age of 13'' each place it appears in \n     subsections (b)(1)(A) and (e)(5)(B).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Mack, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Roth, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Hollings, Mr. DeWine, \n        and Mr. Thompson):\n  S. 2080. A bill to provide for the President to increase support to \nthe democratic opposition in Cuba, to authorize support under the Cuban \nLiberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 for the \nprovision and transport of increased humanitarian assistance directly \nto the oppressed people of Cuba to help them regain their freedom, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             THE CUBAN SOLIDARITY ACT OF 1998 (SOLIDARIDAD)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, immediately upon his return from Cuba, Pope \nJohn Paul II gave an audience at the Vatican where he discussed his \nhistoric Cuban pilgrimage. While Fidel Castro and others were working \nhard to distort the purpose of his visit, the Pope was unambiguous \nabout the aims and purposes of his visit in Cuba.\n  His Holiness said: ``I wish for our brothers and sisters on that \nbeautiful island that the fruits of this pilgrimage will be similar to \nthe fruits of that pilgrimage in Poland,'' referring to his June 1979 \nvisit to his native Poland--a visit which is widely credited with \ninspiring the Polish people to throw off the shackles of their \noppression, and embrace their God-given spiritual and political \nfreedom.\n  That visit marked the beginning of the end for Poland's communist \ndictatorship--just as, I believe, the Pope's historic visit to Cuba has \nmarked the beginning of the end of Fidel Castro's despotic rule.\n  With his Cuban pilgrimage, John Paul II has sown the seeds of \nspiritual and political liberation in the Cuban mind. The United States \nmust now help the Cuban people to cultivate those seeds of liberation \nwhich His Holiness had planted in Cuba--just as the United States \nworked with him in helping the Polish people in their struggle against \ncommunist oppression nearly two decades ago.\n  That is why today--along with more than 20 of my Senate colleagues--I \nam introducing legislation that will bring new energy and focus to the \nU.S. Cuba policy--``The Cuban Solidarity Act of 1998'' or \n``SOLIDARIDAD'' Act.\n  The buttons we are all wearing may look familiar to many watching \ntoday. Our buttons bear the logo of the Polish Solidarity movement--but \nwith a Cuban twist. You see, we are calling this legislation the \n``Cuban Solidarity Act'' for a reason. Our goal is to do today for the \npeople of Cuba, what the United States did for the Solidarity\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\nmovement in Poland during the 1980s: Give the Cuban people the \nresources they need to build a free, functioning civil society within \nthe empty shell of Castro's bankrupt communist ``revolution.''\n  The Cuban Solidarity Act proposes to authorize $100 million over four \nyears in U.S. government humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people--\ndonations of food and medicine, to be delivered through the Catholic \nChurch and truly independent relief organizations in Cuba like Caritas.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will authorize direct \nhumanitarian flights to deliver both private and U.S. government \ndonations to Cuba. And it will mandate a proactive U.S. policy to \nsupport the internal opposition in Cuba, just as the U.S. supported the \nSolidarity movement in Poland during the 1980s.\n  This legislation is not about the Cuban embargo. It does not tighten \nthe embargo; it does not loosen the embargo. What it does is add a new \ndimension to the U.S. policy regarding Cuba: With the enactment of this \nlegislation, U.S. policy will no longer be simply to isolate the Castro \nregime, but to actively support those working to bring about change \ninside Cuba.\n  As Secretary of State Madeline Albright recently put it, there are \ntwo embargoes in Cuba today: The U.S. embargo on the Castro regime, and \nCastro's embargo on his own people. We must, Secretary Albright said, \nmaintain the first, while breaking the second.\n  This legislation is designed to break Fidel Castro's brutal embargo \non the Cuban people. The Cuban Solidarity Act has four central \nobjectives:\n  First, this bill will provide free food and medicine to Cubans most \nin need--those who cannot possibly afford to buy the necessities of \nlife because they have no access to U.S. dollars.\n  Second, it will strengthen those institutions delivering this aid by \ngiving them the resources they need to expand their space in Cuba and \nnurture a nascent civil society on the island.\n  Third, this bill will undermine the Castro regime's ability to stifle \ndissent through the denial of work and basic necessities. In Cuba \ntoday, anyone who dares to speak out against Castro's despotic rule can \nlose his or her job (or be thrown in jail) and thus lose their ability \nto feed their families. This bill will help undermine Castro's ability \nto maintain social control through deprivation, by helping build \nalternative sources of food and medicine in Cuba.\n  And finally, this bill will take away Fidel Castro's excuses, by \nneutralizing Castro's propaganda which falsely blames the U.S. embargo \nfor the hardships suffered by the Cuban people.\n  This legislation puts Castro in a no-win situation. There is no way \nfor him to be on the right side of denying the Cuban people access to \nfree food and medicine from the United States.\n  If Castro allows this food and medicine into Cuba, it will bring \nrelief to millions of Cubans who cannot afford to buy basic \nnecessities; it will remove his ability to use deprivation as a tool of \noppression; and it will help independent institutions create space for \nthemselves in Cuba society.\n  But if he does not allow the food and medicine in, them 11 million \nCubans will know exactly who is responsible for their daily suffering. \nThey will know that the American people wanted to send them $100 \nmillion in food and medicine, but that Castro said ``No''.\n  In addition to this humanitarian relief, the Cuban Solidarity Act \nalso instructs the President to take a series of steps intended to \nhasten the liberation of the Cuban people. Among other provisions:\n  The bill instructs the President to increase all forms of U.S. \ngovernment support for ``democratic opposition groups in Cuba,'' who \nrisk life and limb each day to challenge the regime.\n  The bill also urges the President to seek a U.N. Security Council \nresolution calling on Fidel Castro to ``immediately respect all human \nrights, free all political prisoners, legalize independent political \nparties, allow independent trade unions, and conduct freely contested \nelections.''\n  The Cuban Solidarity Act also calls for creative measures to overcome \nCastro's blockade on information coming into Cuba instructing the \nPresident to commence ``freedom broadcasting'' through Radio and TV \nMarti from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo, and other suitable sites \naround Cuba.\n  The bill also requires the Administration to produce a series of \nreports on the plight of average Cubans, including conditions of human \nrights, workers' rights, and the apparent policy of coercing abortions \namong poor, less-educated Cuban women.\n  And the bill will authorize increased personnel in the Treasury and \nCommerce Departments to facilitate licenses for American medical sales \nto Cuba--which have been fully legal since 1992--taking away Castro's \nexcuses for his failure to provide American medicine and medical \nequipment for his people.\n  The Cuban Solidarity Act is a bill that could and should be supported \nby all U.S. Senators, those for the Cuban embargo, and those opposed.\n  All of us should unite behind a policy of providing free food and \nmedicine to those trapped in Castro's Orwellian economy. I cannot \nimagine that anyone would disagree with the notion that the United \nStates should bring the same intense commitment to its Cuba policy that \nmade the difference in Poland's struggle with communist tyranny.\n  Now some have suggested that we should not give the Cuban people free \nfood and medicine--rather, we should sell it to them. My question is \nthis: What exactly will they use to buy this American food and \nmedicine? Soviet rubles?\n  The Cuban people can't afford to buy American food and medicine! \nToday, in Cuba, food and medicine is available everywhere. In Havana, \nthere are bakeries overflowing with fresh bread, pharmacies stocked \nwith Western medicines, grocery stores brimming with foods. But these \nproducts are completely out of reach to most Cubans.\n  Why? Castro allows them to be sold only for dollars, which the vast \nmajority of Cubans don't have. Castro pays them in worthless Cuban \npesos. The only Cubans who can afford to shop in these exclusive stores \nare cronies of the Castro regime, and those few lucky Cubans who get \ndollars from abroad--or those poor Cuban women and girls who are forced \nto prostitute themselves to foreign tourists from Canada and Europe in \norder to survive.\n  Instead of trading with the Castro regime (and thus subsidizing the \nbrutal state security apparatus which keeps him in power), our call \ntoday is: Let us unite to circumvent this monstrous system Castro has \nbuilt; Let's give food and medicine directly to the Cuban people.\n  The Cuban Solidarity Act will also encourage and facilitate increased \nprivate donations to Cuba. There are many in the private sector who \nhave been enormously generous in their humanitarian efforts for the \nCuban people, and we will be encouraging them to redouble their \nefforts.\n  But we will also be issuing a challenge to all of our big-hearted \nfriends in the corporate community who have been lobbying to lift the \nCuban embargo. Since they claim to have so much concern for the Cuban \npeople, we will be asking them: What are you willing to donate to help \nsuffering Cubans who cannot afford to buy food and medicine for \nthemselves? We'll see if the floodgates of generosity open up, showing \ncorporate America's concern for Cuba's suffering people.\n  Fidel Castro will never change his stripes. The Cuban Solidarity Act \nis based on the belief that we must do more than wait for Fidel Castro \nto die or ``get religion.'' We must do what was done for Lech Walesa \nand his courageous Polish brothers; that is, we must undertake a \nproactive policy under which the United States will lend decisive \nsupport to the cause of freedom in Cuba.\n  The Pope's visit planted the seeds of liberation in Cuba. The Cuban \nSolidarity Act is the American people's way of cultivating those seeds \nfor the benefit of Cubans and freedom-loving people everywhere.\n  Let's get about it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Helms, Lott, \nMack, and nearly twenty other Senators in introducing the Cuban \nSolidarity Act. This bill will capitalize on the historic opportunity \nprovided by Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba this past January. It \nprovides for $100 million in humanitarian assistance directly to the \nCuban people over four years, and does so in a way that will strengthen\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\nthe Catholic Church and other independent organizations in Cuba. We \nmust seize this opportunity to help our Cuban brothers and sisters who \nhave suffered under Castro's brutal rule for far too long.\n  Communism has collapsed around the world, and the only countries that \nmaintain this economic sytsem--Cuba and North Korea--are crumbling \nunder their own weight. This failed system has created shortages of \nfood and medicine, and Castro has denied the basic freedoms that we \ntake for granted to millions of ordinary Cubans.\n  In addition to providing humanitarian assistance to Cuba, this bill \nalso directs the administration to expedite the licensing of sales of \nmedicine and medical supplies to Cuba. Since 1992, the embargo has been \nlifted on the sale of medicines, medical equipment, and medical \nsupplies to Cuba. While Castro continues to claim that the United \nStates is responsible for Cubans' lack of access to much needed \nmedicines, the truth is that we are doing everything we can to ensure \nthat the Cuban people can get the medical supplies denied them by the \nCastro government.\n  Pope John Paul II called the world's attention to the suffering of \nthe Cuban people during his visit to Cuba in January. I feel the time \nis right to make assistance to oppressed Cubans more easily available \nthrough organizations such as the Catholic Church and other independent \ngroups. Targeting additional aid in this matter will have three \nimportant effects. First, it will provide humanitarian assistance \ndirectly to the Cuban people who have suffered under communism. Second, \nit will strengthen the position of the Catholic Church as a more \nindependent, viable institution in Cuba. Finally, it will help to \nundermine Castro's policy of denying food and medicine as a means of \npolitical control.\n  Pope John Paul II asked the world to open up to Cuba, and asked Cuba \nto open itself to the world. This bill will begin that process by \nproviding humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people. We hope that \nCastro will respond by opening Cuba to the world.\n  Just yesterday, Cuban Cardinal Ortega expressed concern that the \nCastro regime was not making an effort to open Cuba to the world--\nspecifically regarding the political prisoners that continue to fill \nCuban jails. Four of these political prisoners are in particularly \ndesperate condition--Marta Beatriz Roque, Vladimiro Roca, Felix Bonne, \nand Rene Gomez Manzano--and Castro has refused appeals by the Pope and \nCanadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to release them on humanitarian \ngrounds. In fact, Marta Beatriz Roque is very ill with breast cancer \nand is being denied medical attention in jail. I hope that these \npolitical prisoners, as well as thousands of others, live to see a time \nwhen expressing one's political ideas does not mean a death sentence.\n  This legislation will provide an upwelling of support for the \nadvocates of freedom and human rights in Cuba. A number of periodic \nreports on exploitative labor conditions and the plight of political \nprisoners in Cuba will help bring the world's attention to the reality \nof Castro's oppression. Democracy efforts in Cuba will be bolstered \nthrough pro-active U.S. support for the Cuban opposition. Direct mail \ndelivery from the U.S. to Cuba and additional Radio and TV Marti \nbroadcasts will allow the Cuban people to receive uncensored news from \nthe outside world, breaking Catro's monopoly on the dissemination of \ninformation.\n  Let us not forget that U.S. support for the democracy movements of \nEastern Europe helped millions of people there win the freedom to \nexpress their ideas, live without fear, and create better lives for \ntheir children. We should not turn our backs on the Cuban people now, \nwhen they need our help more than ever. The Castro government does not \nneed food and medicine: the Cuban people do. We must ensure that our \naid does not go to those who torture and kill. The Cuban Solidarity Act \nworks to give food and medicine to those who are forgotten by Castro's \nregime--the poor mothers who need prenatal care, the children who need \nbread and milk, the elderly who die of easily curable diseases.\n  Mr. President, the 11 million Cubans imprisoned by Castro's reign of \nterror are counting on us to enact this vital and historic piece of \nlegislation. I hope that all of my colleagues will join Senators Helms, \nLott, Mack, myself, and nearly twenty others in supporting this effort \nto provide a lifeline to the Cuban people.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the \nCuban Assistance and Solidarity (SOLIDARIDAD) Act that my distinguished \nfriend and Chairman of the foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, \nis introducing today. I commend the Chairman for his leadership on this \nissue and strongly support him in this endeavor.\n  The intent of this legislation is very simple * * * to actively \nassist the repressed Cuban people and those dedicated to ending the \nregime of Fidel Castro.\n  This Act will authorize $100 million in humanitarian assistance over \nfour years for food, medicine, and medical supplies, donated by the \nU.S. government. In addition, direct flights to deliver this \nhumanitarian aid will be authorized and monitored to ensure that all \naid is directly delivered to the Cubans who need it most, those who are \nunable to afford to make purchases in the Castro controlled dollar-only \nstores.\n  Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation. This bill \nwill eliminate Castro's claims that the U.S. embargo is the cause of \nthe hardships suffered by the Cuban people. It effectively creates a \nCatch-22 for him. If he allows the aid, he loses his control by \ndeprivation. If he prohibits the aid, he will no longer be able to \nprevent the people from receiving food and medicine without the \nknowledge that he is responsible for their pain and suffering, not the \nUnited States.\n  Further, this bill requires the President to take several timely and \nappropriate pro-democracy steps regarding Cuba, such as strengthening \nsupport for democratic opposition within Cuba; seeking a U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution on free elections; beginning ``freedom \nbroadcasting'' through Radio and TV Marti; producing a series of \nreports on the plight of average Cubans; authorizing increased \npersonnel to expedite American medical sales licenses; and obtaining \nthe International Court of Justice indictment in the downing of two \nunarmed planes and the murder of four people in 1996.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to take a proactive stand \nfor the people of Cuba and support the SOLIDARIDAD Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2081. A bill to guarantee the long-term national security of the \nUnited States by investing in a robust Defense Science and Technology \nProgram; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n        THE NATIONAL DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nNational Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998. In line \nwith the clear bipartisan support for Defense research I am very \npleased to be joined by Senator Santorum and Lieberman in introducing \nthis important bill.\n  The National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998 \nwill lay the fiscal framework for the Defense research needed to \nachieve, early in the next century, what the Department of Defense call \n``Full Spectrum Dominance''--the ability of our armed forces to \ndominate potential adversaries in any conceivable military operation, \nfrom humanitarian operations through the highest intensity conflict. \nThe bill creates a plan that would achieve the equivalent of at least a \n$9 billion Defense Science and Technology Program budget in today's \ndollars within the next 10 years--an increase of 16% over today. The \nbill also sets similar increases for the non-proliferation research of \nthe Department of Energy.\n  Much of the technology that gave the United States a quick victory \nwith so few casualties in Desert Storm came from DoD's research of the \n1960s and 1970s. More Defense research is needed today to prepare for \nthe next century for a number of reasons.\n  First, as the DoD has noted, the two key enablers of ``Full Spectrum \nDominance'' will be information superiority and technological \ninnovation. The DoD has been the preeminent federal agency funding the \ndisciplines undergirding these enablers, for example, supporting\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\nroughly 80% of the federally sponsored research in electrical \nengineering, and 50% of that in computer science and mathematics. No \nother organizations, public or private, can be expected to substitute \nfor the unique role of the DoD in these research areas. Second, the \nglobal spread of advanced technology and a nascent revolution in \nmilitary affairs are creating new threats to the United States which \nwill challenge our ability to achieve Full Spectrum Dominance. These \ninclude: information warfare; cheap precise cruise missiles; and the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. Finally, we are now in a \nrelatively secure interlude in our international relations, a time when \nwe can afford to work on transforming our military forces. While the \nworld is still a dangerous place, it will be even more dangerous in the \nfuture. So now is the time to undertake the Defense research needed to \nsecure our future.\n  Yet, the DoD's current Science and Technology budget plans do not \nreflect these realities. The outyear budgets are basically flat in real \nterms out to 2003, at a level $200 million lower than 1998's level. \nThis money pays for the research and concept experimentation needed to \ninvent and experiment with new military capabilities. Worse yet, the \nDepartment of Energy's budget for non-proliferation research will \ndecline by around 20% in real terms by 2003. Simply put, Mr. President, \nthese budget plans are just not consistent with the vision of Full \nSpectrum Dominance, the threats on the horizon, and the opportunity we \nhave today.\n  National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act creates budget \nplans that are consistent with the vision, threats, and opportunity. \nStarting with fiscal year 2000, the Act calls on the Secretary of \nDefense to increase the Defense Science and Technology budget request \nby at least 2% a year over inflation until fiscal year 2008. The end \nresult will be a Defense Science and Technology budget that reaches at \nleast $9 billion in today's dollars by 2008, an increase of $1.2 \nbillion or 16% over today's level. The Department of Energy's non-\nproliferation research would also increase the same 2% over inflation \nyearly.\n  These budget increases are significant for research, yet modest and \nachievable; they will be an excellent investment. While they may \nrequire some shifting of funds within DoD's budget, the total amount \nshifted will be around half a percent of that total budget over ten \nyears. I am extremely confident that the Secretary of Defense will be \nable to make this gradual shift in the budget without damaging other \npriorities. I am also quite sure its something we need to do.\n  Imagine, if you will, a large company in the most ferociously \ncompetitive high tech business in the world--a company that has done \nvery well over the years, but faces downstream a series of new, highly \naggressive, innovative and unpredictable competitors. Would we, as \nshareholders, say that shifting half a percent of its revenue into \nresearch over ten years would be something it couldn't afford to do? \nNo. It would be clear that is something it couldn't afford not to do. I \nsuggest the DoD is in a similar position.\n  Technological supremacy has been a keystone of America's security \nstrategy since World War II. Supporting that supremacy has been Defense \nresearch, one of the highest return investments this nation makes. This \ncoming decade is the time to start increasing this investment in our \nnational security. The National Defense Science and Technology \nInvestment Act of 1998 is a modest approach to making this investment, \nbut one, I am sure, which will yield immodest returns to our military.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Santorum, \nLieberman, and myself in support of this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Defense Science and \n     Technology Investment Act of 1998.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress of the United States finds the following:\n       (1) To provide for the national security of the United \n     States in the 21st century, the U.S. military must be able to \n     dominate the full range of military operations, from \n     humanitarian assistance to full-scale conflict. The keys to \n     achieving this ``Full Spectrum Dominance,'' as described in \n     the Department of Defense's ``Joint Vision 2010,'' are \n     technological innovation and information superiority.\n       (2) The global spread of advanced technology is \n     transforming the military threats faced by the United States \n     and will challenge our ability to achieve Full Spectrum \n     Dominance. Some of the major technological challenges our \n     military face include information warfare; proliferating \n     weapons of mass destruction; inexpensive, precise, cruise \n     missiles; and increasingly difficult operations in urban \n     environments.\n       (3) The United States is now in a relatively secure \n     interlude in its international relations, but the future \n     security environment is very uncertain. Thus, now is the time \n     to focus our Defense investments on the research and \n     experimentation needs to meet new and undefined threats and \n     achieve Full Spectrum Dominance.\n       (4) The Department of Defense has been the preeminent \n     federal agency supporting research in engineering, \n     mathematics, and computer science, and a key supporter of \n     research in the physical and environmental sciences. These \n     disciplines remain critical to achieving information \n     superiority and maintaining technological innovation in our \n     military. The Department of Energy has played a critical role \n     in supporting the research needed to limit the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction. No other organizations, public \n     or private, can be expected to substitute for the role of the \n     Department of Defense and Department of Energy in these \n     research areas.\n       (5) However, the current budget plan for the Defense \n     Science and Technology Program is essentially flat in real \n     terms through fiscal year 2003. The planned budget for \n     nonproliferation science and technology activities at the \n     Department of Energy will decline.\n       (6) These budget plans are not consistent with the vision \n     of Full Spectrum Dominance, the threats or uncertainties on \n     the horizon, or the opportunity presented by the current \n     state of international relations. The planned level of \n     investment could pose a serious threat to our national \n     security in the next 15 years, given the usual time it takes \n     from the start of Defense research to achieving new military \n     capabilities.\n       (7) Consequently, the Congress must act to establish a \n     long-term vision for the Defense Science and Technology \n     Program's funding if the United States is to encourage the \n     research and experimentation needed to seize the current \n     opportunity and begin transforming our military to meet the \n     new threats and achieve Full Spectrum Dominance early in the \n     next century.\n       (8) The Congress must also act to establish a robust long-\n     term vision and funding plan in support of nonproliferation \n     science and technology activities at the Department of \n     Energy.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a ten-\n     year budget plan to support the disciplines, research, and \n     concept of operations experimentation that will transform our \n     military and reduce the threat from weapons of mass \n     destruction early in the next century.\n       (b) Funding Requirements.--\n       (1) Defense science and technology program budget.--For \n     each year from fiscal year 2000 until fiscal year 2008, it \n     shall be an objective of the Secretary of Defense to increase \n     the Defense Science and Technology Program budget by no less \n     than 2.0 percent over inflation greater than the previous \n     fiscal year's budget requests.\n       (2) Nonproliferation science and technology activities \n     budget.--For each year from fiscal year 2000 until fiscal \n     year 2008, it shall be an objective of the Secretary of \n     Energy to increase the budget for nonproliferation science \n     and technology activities by no less than 2.0 percent a year \n     over inflation greater than the previous fiscal year's budget \n     request.\n\n     SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR THE DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Synergistic management of research and development.--\n     The Secretary of Defense may allocate a combination of funds \n     from Department of Defense 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3 accounts in \n     supporting any individual project or program of the Defense \n     Science and Technology Program.\n       (b) Relationship of the Defense Science and Technology \n     Program to Commercial Research and Technology.--\n       (1) In supporting projects within the Defense Science and \n     Technology Program, the Secretary of Defense shall attempt to \n     leverage commercial research, technology, products, and \n     processes for the benefit of the Department of Defense to the \n     maximum extent practicable.\n       (2) Funds made available to the Defense Science and \n     Technology Program must only be used to benefit the \n     Department of Defense, which includes--\n       (A) the development of defense unique technology;\n       (B) the development of military useful, commercially viable \n     technology; or\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\n       (C) the adaption of commercial technology, products, or \n     processes for military purposes.\n       (c) Relationship of Defense Science and Technology Program \n     to University Research.--The following shall be key \n     objectives of the Defense Science and Technology Program--\n       (1) the sustainment of research capabilities in scientific \n     and engineering disciplines critical to the Department of \n     Defense;\n       (2) the education and training of the next generation of \n     scientists and engineers in disciplines relevant to future \n     Defense systems, particularly through the conduct of basic \n     research; and\n       (3) the continued support of the Defense Experimental \n     Program to Stimulate Competitive Research and research \n     programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and \n     Minority Institutions.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenators Bingaman and Santorum, the National Defense Science and \nTechnology Investment Act of 1998. I have been concerned for some time \nnow that our investments in defense R are not commensurate with the \nopportunity that new technology developments afford. I recognize, Mr. \nPresident, that relative to the procurement budget, defense R has \nfared well in recent years. While the ratio of R funding relative to \nprocurement was an appropriate benchmark during the Cold War, I would \nargue that it is a misleading indicator in the current environment.\n  We find ourselves in a comparatively peaceful historical interlude in \nwhich we face no peer military competitors. How likely is it that this \nset of circumstances will last? We don't know the answer to that \nquestion. The future is uncertain and, if history is our guide, will be \nconsiderably more dangerous than today. At the same time, the ongoing \ntechnology revolution is creating revolutionary new capabilities that \nwill change the nature of warfare itself. These new capabilities would \nenable our forces to engage an enemy in a coordinated fashion across an \nentire theater of operations and thereby rapidly and totally dominate \nthe battlespace. By aggressively exploiting the new capabilities that \ntechnology has to offer, the U.S. can assure its decisive military \nsuperiority over any potential adversary, even with numerically smaller \nforces than are fielded today. Our ability to realize this vision of \nthe future, however, depends on the research and development we conduct \ntoday.\n  All of the assessments, both internal and external, of our nation's \ndefense posture concur that we must transform our force structure \nthrough greatly accelerated rates of technology insertion. The \ntransformed military force envisioned in, for example, General \nShalikashvili's Joint Vision 2010 requires a much higher level of \nresearch, development, prototyping, and testing than we are engaged in \ntoday. Our current defense R budgets simply don't support the \naccelerated rates of technology insertion and integration that these \nassessments imply.\n  Mr. President, I realize that our military has many needs today that \ncompete for scarce defense dollars. But we cannot mortgage our future \nsecurity to short-term demands. Increased funding for our nation's \ndefense R enterprise is essential if we are to realize the vision of \na transformed force structure that takes advantage of the new \nopportunities that the high-tech revolution has to offer. The National \nDefense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998 would put us on \nthe path of higher defense R budgets by outlining a plan for real \nincreases of 16% over ten years. This is a modest proposal, Mr. \nPresident, and one that holds the promise of very significant future \nreturns. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Bingaman, Santorum, and \nme and support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 2082. A bill to amend chapter 36 of title 39, United States Code, \nto provide authority to fix rates and fees for domestic and \ninternational postal services, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n             the International Postal Services Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the International \nPostal Services Act of 1998. This bill would amend section 3621 of \ntitle 39 of the U.S. Code, dealing with the authority of the Board of \nGovernors of the U.S. Postal Service to establish rates and classes of \npostal services, by subjecting international postal services to review \nby the Postal Rate Commission.\n  At present, the Board of Governors' and Postal Rate Commission's \nauthority to collect and review Postal Service data on costs, volumes, \nand revenues extends only to domestic mail. Therefore, the regulators \nand Congress, and the public, cannot require data to support statements \nby the Postal Service that international mail is covering its \nattributable costs.\n  Allegations have been made that the Postal Service uses its revenues \nfrom first class mail to subsidize its international postal services. \nThe Postal Service denies this, and reminds its competitors that the \nPostal Reorganization Act prohibits the Postal Service from using the \nrevenues from one service to reduce the price of another.\n  When Congress drafted, and later passed, the postal Reorganization \nAct of 1970, no specific language was included that would grant the \nPostal Rate Commission jurisdiction over international postal \nservices--as it was granted for all domestic postal services. I believe \nthis was an oversight by Congress, and I believe it would be best if, \nfor the purposes of establishing classes and rates for mail, \ninternational postal services were to be treated the same as domestic \npostal services are treated.\n  I invite Senators to consider this proposal and support this effort \nto bring harmony to the treatment of international and domestic postal \nservices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2083. A bill to provide for Federal class action reform, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     the class action fairness act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill help fight class action lawsuit abuses. This bill, which Senator \nKohl and I are introducing today, will go a long way toward ending \nclass action lawsuit abuses where the plaintiffs receive very little \nand their lawyers receive a whole lot. It will also preserve class \naction lawsuits as an important toll that bring representation to the \nunrepresented and result in important discrimination and consumer \ndecisions.\n  My Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing last Fall that exposed and \ndiscussed the problem of certain class action lawsuit settlements. Let \nme give you an example of a class action lawsuit settlement that I find \nparticularly disturbing. In an antitrust case settled in the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois in 1993, the plaintiff class alleged that multiple \ndomestic airlines participated in pricefixing beginning at least as \nearly as January 1, 1988. This pricefixing resulted in plaintiffs \npaying more for airline tickets that they otherwise would have had to \npay.\n  The settlement in this case gave a coupon book to all of the \nplaintiffs. These coupons varied in amount and\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\nnumber, according to how many plane tickets the plaintiffs had \npurchased. These coupons can be used toward the purchase of future \nairline tickets. The catch is that the plaintiff still has to pay for \nthe majority of any new airline ticket out of his or her own pocket. \nThis means that only $10 worth of coupons can be used towards the \npurchase of a $100 dollar ticket; up to $25 worth of coupons can be \nused towards the purchase of a $250 ticket; up to $50 worth of coupons \ncan be used towards the purchase of a $500 ticket, and so on. In \naddition, these coupons cannot be used on certain blackout dates, which \nseem to include all holidays and peak travel times.\n  The attorneys, interestingly enough, did not get paid in coupons. The \nplaintiffs' attorneys got paid in cash. They got paid $16 million \ndollars in cash. If the coupons were good enough for their clients, I \nwonder why coupons were not good enough for the lawyers.\n  Another egregious class action lawsuit settlement was discussed by \none of the witnesses in my subcommittee hearing. Ms. Martha Preston was \na member of the class in Hoffman versus BancBoston, where some of the \nplaintiffs received under $10 dollars each in compensation for their \ninjuries, yet were docked around $75 or $90 for attorneys' fees. This \nmeans that attorneys that they had never met, who were supposed to be \nrepresenting their best interests, agreed to a settlement that cost \nsome of the plaintiffs more money than they received in compensation \nfor being wronged.\n  These lawsuit abuses happen for a number of reasons. One reason is \nthat plaintiffs' lawyers negotiate their own fees as part of the \nsettlement. This can result in distracting lawyers from focussing on \ntheir clients' needs, and settling or refusing to settle based on the \namount of their own compensation.\n  During our hearing, evidence was presented that at least one group of \nplaintiffs' lawyers meets regularly to discuss initiating class action \nlawsuits. They scan the Federal Register and other publications to get \nideas for lawsuits, and only after they have identified the wrong, do \nthey find clients for their lawsuits. Rather than having clients \ncomplaining of harms, they find harms first, and then recruit clients \nwith the promise of compensation.\n\n  The defendants are not always innocent, though. Plaintiffs' lawyers \nsay that they are approached by lawyers from large corporations who \nurge them to find a class and sue the corporation. The corporations may \nuse this as a tool to limit their liability. Once this suit is \ninitiated and settled, no member of the class may sue based on that \nclaim. In other words, if a corporation settles a class action lawsuit \nby paying all class members $10 as compensation for a faulty car door \nlatch, the plaintiffs can no longer sue for any harm caused by the \nfaulty door latch. this is one way of buying immunity for liability.\n  The Preliminary Results of the Rand Study of Class Action Litigation \nstates that, ``It is generally agreed that fees drive plaintiffs' \nattorneys' filing behavior, that defendants' risk aversion in the face \nof large aggregate exposures drives their settlement behavior. . . . In \nother words, the problems with class actions flow from incentives that \nare embedded in the process itself.''\n  The Glassley/Kohl Class Action Fairness Act does the following:\n\n\n                             plain english\n\n  Notice of proposed settlements (as well as all class notices) in all \nclass actions must be in clear, easily understood English and must \ninclude all material settlement terms, including the amount and source \nof attorney's fees. One thing that I knew before our hearing, but that \nwitness testimony confirm, is that the notice most plaintiffs receive \nare written in small print and confusing legal jargon. Even one of the \nlawyers testifying before my subcommittee said that he couldn't \nunderstand the notice he received as a plaintiff in a class action \nlawsuit. Since plaintiffs are giving up their right to sue, it is \nimperative that they understand what they are doing and the \nramifications of their actions.\n\n\n                   notice to state attorneys general\n\n  The Class Action Fairness Act requires that State Attorneys General \nbe notified of any proposed class settlement that would affect \nresidents of their states. The notice give a state AG the opportunity \nto object if the settlement terms are unfair.\n\n\n                attorneys' fees based on actual damages\n\n  Our bill requires that attorney's fees in all class actions must be a \nreasonable percentage of actual damages and actual costs of complying \nwith the terms of a settlement agreement.\n\n\n          removal of multistate class actions to federal court\n\n  This bill provides that class acting lawsuits may be removed to a \nfederal court by a defendant or unnamed class member if the total \ndamages exceed $75,000 and parties include citizens from multiple \nstates. Currently, only defendants can seek removal, and only if each \nname plaintiff has at minimum a $75,000 claim and complete diversity \nexists between all named plaintiffs and defendants, even if only one \nclass members is from the same state as a defendant. The bill also \neliminates the ability of a lone class action defendant to veto \nremoval, and it forecloses class attorneys from avoiding removal by \nraising a class action claim for the first time only after the suit \nalready has been pending for a year. Removal still must be sought \nwithin 30 days from when there is notice of the class claim.\n\n\n                mandatory sanctions for frivolous suits.\n\n  This section of our bill will reduce frivolous lawsuits by requiring \nthat a violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nwhich penalizes frivolous filings, will require the imposition of \nsanctions. The nature and extent of sanctions will remain \ndiscretionary.\n  We need this bill. We need this reform. Both plaintiffs and \ndefendants are calling for reform in his area. This bill is not just \nprocedural reform; this is substantive reform of our courts system. \nThis bill will remove the conflict of interest that lawyers face in \nclass action lawsuits, and ensue the fair settlement of these cases.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I today introduce the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 1998. This legislation addresses a growing \nproblem in class action litigation--too many class lawyers put their \nself-interest above the best interests of their clients, often \nresulting in unfair and abusive settlements that shortchange class \nmembers while the class lawyers line their pockets with high fees.\n  Let me share with you just a few disturbing examples.\n  One of my constituents, Martha Preston of Baraboo, Wisconsin, was an \nunnamed member of a class action lawsuit against her mortgage company \nthat ended in a settlement. While at first she got four dollars and \nchange in compensation, a few months later her lawyers surreptitiously \ntook $80--twenty times her compensation--from her escrow account to pay \ntheir fees. In total, her lawyers managed to pocket over $8 million in \nfees, but never explained that the class--not the defendant--would pay \nthe attorneys' fees. Naturally outraged, she and others sued the class \nlawyers. Her lawyers turned around and sued her in alabama--a state she \nhad never visited--and demanded an unbelievable $25 million. So not \nonly did she lose $75, she was forced to defend herself from a $25 \nmillion lawsuit.\n  Class lawyers and defendants often engineer settlements that leave \nplaintiffs with small discounts or coupons unlikely ever to be used. \nMeanwhile class lawyers reap big fees based on unduly optimistic \nvaluations. For example, in a settlement of a class action against \nmajor airlines, most plaintiffs received less than $80 in coupons while \nclass attorneys received $14 million in fees based on a projection that \nthe discounts were worth hundreds of millions. In a suit over faulty \ncomputer monitors, class members got $13 coupons, while class lawyers \npocketed $6 million. And in a class action against Nintendo, plaintiffs \nreceived $5 coupons, while attorneys took almost $2 million in fees.\n  Competing federal and state class actions engage in a race to \nsettlement, where the best interests of the class lose out. For \nexample, in one state class action the class lawyers negotiated a small \nsettlement precluding all other suits, and even agreed to settle \nfederal claims that were not at issue in state court. Meanwhile, a \nfederal court found that the federal claims could be worth more than $1 \nbillion, while accusing the state class lawyers of ``hostile \nrepresentation'' that ``surpassed inadequacy and sank to the level of \nsubversion;'' ``vigorous disparagement'' of the value of the federal \nclaim in order to sell the settlement to\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\nthe state court; and pursuit of self-interest in ``getting a fee'' that \nwas ``more in line with the interests of [defendants] than those of \ntheir clients.''\n  Class actions are often filed in state courts that are more likely to \ncertify them without adequately considering whether a class action \nwould be fair to all class members. On several occasions, a state court \nhas certified a class action although federal courts rejected \ncertification of the same case. And in several Alabama state courts, 38 \nout of 43 classes certified in a three-year period were certified on an \nex parte basis, without notice and hearing. One Alabama judge acting ex \nparte certified 11 class actions last year alone. Comparably, only an \nestimated 38 class actions were certified in federal court last year \n(excluding suits against the U.S. and suits brought under federal law). \nThis lack of close scrutiny appears to create a big incentive to file \nin state court, especially given the recent findings of a Rand study \nthat class actions are increasingly concentrated in state courts.\n  Class lawyers often manipulate the pleadings in order to avoid \nremoval of state class actions to federal court, even by minimizing the \npotential claims of class members. For example, state class actions \noften seek just over $74,000 in damages per plaintiff and forsake \npunitive damage claims, in order to avoid the $75,000 floor that \nqualifies for federal diversity jurisdiction. Or they defeat the \nfederal requirement of complete diversity by making sure at least one \nnamed class member is from the same state as a defendant, even if every \nother class member is from a different state.\n  Out-of-state defendants are often hauled into state court to address \nnationwide class claims, although federal courts are a more appropriate \nand more efficient forum. For example, an Alabama court is now \nconsidering a class action--and could establish a national policy--in a \nsuit brought against the big three automakers on behalf of every \nAmerican who bought a dual-equipped air bags in the past eight years. \nThe defendants failed in their attempt to remove to federal court based \non an application of current diversity law. And, unlike federal courts, \nstates are unable of consolidate multiple class actions that involve \nthe same underlying facts.\n  These examples show that abuse of the class action system is not only \npossible, but real. And part of the problem are the incentives and \nrealities created by the current system.\n  A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents \nan individual plaintiff, but, in addition, seeks relief for all those \nindividuals who suffered a similar injury. For example, a suit brought \nagainst a pharmaceutical company by a person suffering from the side \neffects of a drug can be expanded to cover all individuals who used the \ndrug. A class action claim may proceed only if a court certifies the \nclass, and certification is permitted only if the class procedure will \nbe fair to all class members. Prospective class members are usually \nsent notice about the class action, and are presumed to join it, unless \nthey specifically ask to be left out.\n  Often, these suits are settled. The settlement agreements provide \nmoney and/or other forms of compensation. The attorneys who brought the \nclass action also get paid for their work. All class members are \nnotified of the terms of the settlement, and given the chance to object \nif they don't think the settlement is fair. A court must ultimately \napprove a settlement agreement.\n  The vast majority of these suits are brought and settled fairly and \nin good faith. Unfortunately, the class action system does not \nadequately protect class members from the few unscrupulous lawyers who \nare more interested in big attorneys' fees than compensation for \ntheir clients, the victims. The primary problem is that the client in a \nclass action is a diffuse group of thousands of individuals scattered \nacross the country, which is incapable of exercising meaningful control \nover the litigation. As a result, while in theory the class lawyers \nmust be responsive to their clients, the lawyers control all aspects of \nthe litigation.\n\n  Moreover, during a class action settlement, the amount of the \nattorney fee is negotiated between plaintiffs' lawyers and the \ndefendants, just like other terms of the settlement. But in most cases \nthe fees come at the expense of class members--the only party that does \nnot have a seat at the bargaining table.\n  In addition, defendants may use class action settlements to advance \ntheir own interests. A settlement will generally preclude all future \nclaims by class members. So defendants have ample motivation to give \nclass lawyers the fees they want as the price for settling all future \nliabilities.\n  In light of the incentives that are driving the parties, it is easy \nto see how class members are left out in the cold. Class attorneys and \ncorporate defendants sometimes reach agreements that satisfy their \nrespective interests--and even the interests of the named class \nplaintiffs--but that sell short the interests of any class members who \nare not vigilantly monitoring the litigation. And although the judge is \nsupposed to determine whether the settlement is fair before approving \nit, class lawyers and defendants ``may even put one over on the court, \na staged performance. The lawyers support the settlement to get fees; \nthe defendants support it to evade liability; the court can't vindicate \nthe class's rights because the friendly presentation means that it \nlacks essential information.'' Kamilewicz v. Bank of Boston Corp., 100 \nF.3d 1348, 1352 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting) (7th Cir. 1996).\n  Although class members get settlement notices and have the \nopportunity to object, they rarely do so, especially if they have \nlittle at stake. Not only is it expensive to get representation, but \nalso it can be extremely difficult to actually understand what the \nsettlement really does. Settlements are often written in long, finely \nprinted letters with incomprehensible legalese, which even well trained \nattorneys are hard pressed to understand. And settlements often omit \nbasic information like how much money will go towards attorney's fees, \nand where that money will come from. In Martha Preston's case, one \nprominent federal judge found that ``the notice not only didn't alert \nthe absent class members to the pending loss but also pulled the wool \nover the state judge's eyes.''\n  We all know that class actions can result in significant and \nimportant benefits for class members and society, and that most class \nlawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly. Class actions \nhave been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain \nredress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate \nindividuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursue claims that collectively would otherwise be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is \nweeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we \npropose attempts to do this. It does not limit anyone's ability to file \na class action or to settle a class action. It seeks to address the \nproblem in several ways. First, it requires that State attorneys \ngeneral be notified about proposed class action settlements that would \naffect residents of their states. With notice, the attorneys general \ncan intervene in cases where they think the settlements are unfair.\n  Second, the legislation requires that class members be notified of a \npotential settlement in clear, easily understood English--not legal \njargon.\n  Third, it limits class attorneys' fees to a reasonable percentage of \nthe actual damages received by plaintiffs and the actual costs of \ncomplying with settlement agreements. This will deter class lawyers \nfrom using inflated values of coupon settlements to reap big fees, even \nif the settlement doesn't offer much practical value to victims. Some \ncourts have already embraced this standard, which parallels the recent \nsecurities reform law.\n  Fourth, it permits removal to federal court of class actions \ninvolving citizens of multiple states, at the request of unnamed class \nmembers or defendants. This provision eliminates gaming by class \nlawyers to keep cases in state court. It reinforces the legitimate role \nfor diversity jurisdiction--to establish the federal courts as the \nproper forum for lawsuits directly affecting residents from diverse \nstates. Diversity jurisdiction makes little sense if a $76,000 claim by \none out-of-state plaintiff qualifies for federal jurisdiction but a\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\nmultimillion dollar class action bundling thousands of $74,000 claims \nby out-of-state citizens cannot be brought in federal court, and if \nremote state courts can make decisions affecting nationwide classes of \ncitizens.\n  Finally, it amends Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures \nto require the imposition of sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits, \nalthough the nature and extent of sanctions remains discretionary. This \nprovision will deter the filing of frivolous class actions.\n  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not \nclose the courthouse door to any class action. We do not require that \nState attorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do \nnot deny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that \nevery class action be brought in federal court. Instead, we simply \npromote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class \nsettlements.\n  We are aware that some are critical of provisions in this bill. For \nexample, there is concern that attorneys' fee provision does not \nadequately address settlements which offer primarily injunctive relief. \nFor this reason, this bill should be viewed as a point of departure, \nnot a final product.\n  But Mr. President, right now, people across the country can be \ndragged into lawsuits unaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal \nbattlefield. What our bill does is give regular people back their \nrights and representation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it \nmoves us forward. It will help ensure that good people like Martha \nPreston don't get ripped off.\n  Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I believe this is a moderate \napproach to correct the worst abuses, while preserving the benefits of \nclass actions. It is both pro-consumer and pro-defendant. We believe it \nwill make a difference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2084. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to cease mineral leasing activity \non submerged land of the Outer Continental Shelf that is adjacent to a \ncoastal State that has declared a moratorium on mineral exploration, \ndevelopment, or production activity in adjacent State waters; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the coastal states protection act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Coastal States \nProtection Act--legislation which I also introduced in the 104th \nCongress. This act will provide necessary protection for the nation's \nOuter Continental Shelf (OCS) from the adverse effects of offshore oil \nand gas development by making management of the federal OCS consistent \nwith state-mandated protection of state waters. I am pleased that \nRepresentatives Capps and Miller are introducing the House version of \nthis legislation.\n  After many years of hard work to prevent further oil drilling in the \nOuter Continental Shelf (OCS), I am very pleased to see the broad bi-\npartisan support that now exists for this issue. I began fighting for \nocean protection on the Marin County Board of Supervisors, continued \nduring my 10 years in the House of Representatives, and as a United \nStates Senator representing California.\n  Simply put, my bill says that when a state establishes a drilling \nmoratorium on part or all of its coastal water, that protection would \nbe extended to adjacent federal waters.\n  It does a state little good to protect its own waters which extend \nthree miles from the coast only to have drilling from four miles to 200 \nmiles in federal waters jeopardizing the entire state's coastline--\nincluding the state's protected waters.\n  An oil spill in federal waters will rapidly foul state beaches, \ncontaminate the nutrient rich ocean floor upon which local fisheries \ndepend, and endanger habitat on state tidelands.\n  My legislation simply directs the Secretary of Interior to cease \nleasing activities in federal waters where the state has declared a \nmoratorium on such activities thus coordinating federal protection with \nstate protection.\n  The bill has a very fundamental philosophy--do no harm to the \nmagnificent coastlines of America and respect state and local laws.\n  I also want to express my strong support for the current protection \nof our precious marine resources.\n  The major portions of fragile California coastline is currently \nprotected from the dangers of oil and gas drilling in offshore waters \nby several provisions of law. The State has a permanent moratorium on \noil and gas leasing, which covers state waters up to three miles out. \nU.S. waters, up to 200 miles out, have been protected by a succession \nof one-year leasing and drilling moratoria enacted by Congress each \nyear since 1982.\n  In addition, in 1990, President George Bush issued a statement \ndirecting his Secretary of the Interior to cancel several existing \nleases and withhold any further leases in California waters for 10 \nyears. With this directive, President Bush showed his commitment to \nprohibiting offshore drilling in areas where environmental risks \noutweigh the potential energy benefits to the Nation.\n  The strongest protection would be a permanent ban on further offshore \noil and gas leases in California waters, and I have asked the President \nto consider this.\n  California, and the rest of the nation, need a clear statement of \ncoastal policy to provide industries, small businesses, homeowners and \nfishermen more certainty than can be provided by yearly moratoria. \nAnnual battles over the moratoria make long-range business planning \ndifficult, divert resources and attention from the real need for \nnational energy security planning, and send confusing signals to both \nindustry and those concerned about the impacts of offshore development.\n  I understand that some feel that we are losing revenue because of \nthese moratoria. I have two things to say about that. First, the public \nstrongly supports the moratorium. And second, if the oil companies paid \nthe royalties that they currently owe the federal government we could \nmake up for the so-called ``lost revenue'' caused by the moratorium. \nOil companies currently owe the federal government millions upon \nmillions of dollars. It does not make sense to give oil companies \naccess to more federal oil when they are already cheating the American \ntaxpayer out of millions of dollars.\n  As we celebrate the United Nations Year of the Ocean, we have a prime \nopportunity to strengthen our commitment to environmental protection by \ngiving Americans a long lasting legacy of coastal protection.\n  We must recognize that the resources of the lands offshore \nCalifornia, and the rest of the country, are priceless. We must \nrecognize that renewable uses of the ocean and OCS lands are \nirreplaceable elements of a healthy, growing economy. These moratoria \nrecognize that the real costs of offshore fossil fuel development far \noutweigh any benefits that might accrue from those activities.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Murray, Sarbanes, Robb, Lautenberg, \nand Graham are original co-sponsors of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal States Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE MORATORIA ON OFFSHORE MINERAL LEASING.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) State Moratoria.--When there is in effect with \n     respect to lands beneath navigable waters of a coastal State \n     a moratorium on oil, gas, or other mineral exploration, \n     development, or production activities established by statute \n     or by order of the Governor, the Secretary shall not issue a \n     lease for the exploration, development, or production of \n     minerals on submerged lands of the outer Continental Shelf \n     that are seaward of or adjacent to those lands.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Boxer in introducing the ``Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.'' \nIt is a key step forward in Florida's long battle to preserve our \nbeautiful coastal and marine ecosystems.\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n  Floridians oppose offshore oil drilling because it poses a tremendous \nthreat to one of our state's greatest natural and economic resources--\nour coastal environment. Florida's beaches, fisheries, and wildlife \ndraw millions of tourists each year from around the globe. Tourism \ndirectly or indirectly supports millions of jobs all across Florida, \nand the travel industry generates billions of dollars in economic \nactivity every year.\n  The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in \nthe world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and \nseagrass beds, are an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many \nspecies, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing \nindustry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries \nfor the most commercially harvested fish. Perhaps the most \nenvironmentally delicate regions in the Gulf, estuaries could be \ndamaged beyond repair by even a relatively small oil spill.\n  Over the years, we have met with some success in our effort to \nprotect Florida's OCS. In 1995, the lawsuit surrounding the \ncancellation of the leases around the Florida Keys was settled, \nremoving the immediate threat of oil and gas drilling from what is an \nextremely sensitive area.\n  In June of 1997, Senator Mack and I introduced the Florida Coast \nProtection Act to cancel six leases in an area 17 miles off the coast \nof Pensacola. This bill would have provided leaseholders with the \nabsolute right to just compensation from the federal government in \norder to recover their investment in these leases, while simultaneously \nprotecting the Florida coastline that is so critical to our economy.\n  Luckily, it was never necessary. Less than a week after we introduced \nour legislation, Mobil Oil announced that it was ending its drilling \noperation off the Northwest Florida coast and cancelling its \nexploratory leases. While Mobil's action did not completely eliminate \nthe threats posed by oil and gas drilling, it did mean that the \nresidents of Florida's Gulf Coast faced one fewer environmental \ncatastrophe-in-the-making.\n  The Florida delegation has also been successful in blocking other \nattempts to search for energy resources off our state's precious \ncoastline. We've worked--and will continue to work--in a united, \nbipartisan fashion to maintain the federal moratorium on drilling in \nsensitive coastal areas.\n  Mr. President, the bill that Senator Boxer has introduced today will \nprovide further protection to all coastal states that have taken action \nto prevent offshore oil drilling by issuing a state moratorium on oil, \ngas, or mineral exploration, development, or production within state \nwaters. Florida will benefit greatly from this bill, and I urge its \nspeedy passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 2085. A bill to assist small businesses and labor organizations in \ndefending themselves against Government bureaucracy; to protect the \nright of employers to have a hearing to present their cases in certain \nrepresentation cases; and to prevent the use of the National Labor \nRelations Act for the purpose of disrupting or inflicting economic harm \non employers; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       the fairness for small business and employees act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today an \nimportant piece of legislation which would restore fairness to small \nbusinesses and their employees in the nation's labor laws, and ensure \nfreedom of choice in the marketplace. ``The Fairness for Small Business \nand Employees Act of 1998'' will achieve these goals, and improve \nfairness in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.\n  Small businesses are facing a serious and devastating problem. They \nare the targets of unethical attempts to manipulate the law in order to \ninjure or destroy the competition. We cannot allow any group with an \nulterior and destructive motive to use coercive governmental power just \nto harass small businesses and their workers.\n  Frivolus charges cost companies significant time, money, and \nresources to defend themselves against complaints that have no merit. \nSmall businesses, in particular, need these resources to secure more \nwork opportunities, invest in better equipment, and create more jobs.\n  The bill I am introducing today consists of three separate small \nbusiness bills, which I have previously introduced in the Senate: ``The \nTruth in Employment Act,'' ``The Fair Hearing Act,'' and ``The Fair \nAccess to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act (FAIR) Act.''\n  The first provision, ``The Truth in Employment Act,'' remedies the \nunscrupulous practice of ``salting'' by amending the National Labor \nRelations Act (NLRA) to make clear that an employer is not required to \nhire any person who seeks a job in order to promote interests unrelated \nto those of the employer. I would point out that the language in no way \ninfringes upon any rights or protections otherwise accorded employees \nunder the NLRA, including the right to organize. This provision would \nmerely alleviate the legal pressures imposed upon employers to hire \nindividuals whose overriding purpose for seeking the job is to disrupt \nthe employer's workplace, or otherwise inflict economic harm designed \nto put the employer out of business.\n  The second section, ``The Fair Hearing Act,'' would create a \nstatutory right to a hearing for the employer when there is a dispute \nregarding the proper bargaining unit of a company with multiple \nlocations. While the NLRB proposal has been ``tabled'' for now, there \nis still nothing in the law to assure fairness for employees.\n  The last provision, ``The Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement \nAct (FAIR) Act,'' would amend the NLRA to provide that a small business \nor labor organization which prevails in an action against the NLRB will \nautomatically be allowed to recoup the attorneys' fees and expenses it \nspends defending itself. Small employers often cannot afford the \nqualified legal representation necessary to defend themselves against \nNLRB charges.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop the devastating impact of unfair \nlabor law enforcement on small businesses and their employees. Small \nbusinesses are truly the backbone of our nation's economy. We must \ncurtail the anti-competitive attacks, and instead help these companies \ndevote time, money, and resources toward productivity, growth, and \nproviding new jobs.\n  I would urge my fellow Senators to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation, and work to pass ``The Fairness for Small Business and \nEmployees Act of 1998.'' The survival of America's small businesses \ndemand that we act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2085\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Small Business \n     and Employees Act of 1998''.\n                      TITLE I--TRUTH IN EMPLOYMENT\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) An atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management \n     relationships is essential to a productive workplace and a \n     healthy economy.\n       (2) The tactic of using professional union organizers and \n     agents to infiltrate a targeted employer's workplace, a \n     practice commonly referred to as ``salting'' has evolved into \n     an aggressive form of harassment not contemplated when the \n     National Labor Relations Act was enacted and threatens the \n     balance of rights which is fundamental to our system of \n     collective bargaining.\n       (3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking employment \n     with nonunion employers not because of a desire to work for \n     such employers but primarily to organize the employees of \n     such employers or to inflict economic harm specifically \n     designed to put nonunion competitors out of business, or to \n     do both.\n       (4) While no employer may discriminate against employees \n     based upon the views of employees concerning collective \n     bargaining, an employer should have the right to expect job \n     applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing the skills \n     of the applicants to further the goals of the business of the \n     employer.\n\n     SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to preserve the balance of rights between employers, \n     employees, and labor organizations which is fundamental to \n     our system of collective bargaining;\n       (2) to preserve the rights of workers to organize, or \n     otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under the \n     National Labor Relations Act; and\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\n       (3) to alleviate pressure on employers to hire individuals \n     who seek or gain employment in order to disrupt the workplace \n     of the employer or otherwise inflict economic harm designed \n     to put the employer out of business.\n\n     SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158(a)) is amended by adding after paragraph (5) the \n     following flush sentence:\n\n     ``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring \n     an employer to employ any person who is not a bona fide \n     employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought \n     employment with the employer with the primary purpose of \n     furthering another employment or agency status: Provided, \n     That this sentence shall not affect the rights and \n     responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was \n     a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-\n     organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, \n     to bargain collectively through representatives of their own \n     choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the \n     purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or \n     protection.''.\n                         TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Bargaining unit determinations by their nature require \n     the type of fact-specific analysis that only case-by-case \n     adjudication allows.\n       (2) The National Labor Relations Board has for decades held \n     hearings to determine the appropriateness of certifying a \n     single location bargaining unit.\n       (3) The imprecision of a blanket rule limiting the factors \n     considered material to determining the appropriateness of a \n     single location bargaining unit detracts from the National \n     Labor Relations Act's goal of promoting stability in labor \n     relations.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National \n     Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific \n     analysis of whether or not a single location bargaining unit \n     is appropriate, given all of the relevant facts and \n     circumstances of a particular case.\n\n     SEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS.\n\n       Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     159(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) If a petition for an election requests the Board to \n     certify a unit which includes the employees employed at one \n     or more facilities of a multi-facility employer, and in the \n     absence of an agreement by the parties (stipulation for \n     certification upon consent election or agreement for consent \n     election) regarding the appropriateness of the bargaining \n     unit at issue for purposes of subsection (b), the Board shall \n     provide for a hearing upon due notice to determine the \n     appropriateness of the bargaining unit. In making its \n     determination, the Board shall consider functional \n     integration, centralized control, common skills, functions \n     and working conditions, permanent and temporary employee \n     interchange, geographical separation, local autonomy, the \n     number of employees, bargaining history, and such other \n     factors as the Board considers appropriate.''.\n                       TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\n     SEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Certain small businesses and labor organizations are at \n     a great disadvantage in terms of expertise and resources when \n     facing actions brought by the National Labor Relations Board.\n       (2) The attempt to ``level the playing field'' for small \n     businesses and labor organizations by means of the Equal \n     Access to Justice Act has proven ineffective and has been \n     underutilized by these small entities in their actions before \n     the National Labor Relations Board.\n       (3) The greater expertise and resources of the National \n     Labor Relations Board as compared with those of small \n     businesses and labor organizations necessitate a standard \n     that awards fees and costs to certain small entities when \n     they prevail against the National Labor Relations Board.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title--\n       (1) to ensure that certain small businesses and labor \n     organizations will not be deterred from seeking review of, or \n     defending against, actions brought against them by the \n     National Labor Relations Board because of the expense \n     involved in securing vindication of their rights;\n       (2) to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise \n     between certain small businesses and labor organizations and \n     the National Labor Relations Board; and\n       (3) to make the National Labor Relations Board more \n     accountable for its enforcement actions against certain small \n     businesses and labor organizations by awarding fees and costs \n     to these entities when they prevail against the National \n     Labor Relations Board.\n\n     SEC. 302. AMENDMENT TO NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT.\n\n       The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n\n                 ``awards of attorneys' fees and costs\n\n       ``Sec. 20. (a) Administrative Proceedings.--An employer \n     who, or a labor organization that--\n       ``(1) is the prevailing party in an adversary adjudication \n     conducted by the Board under this or any other Act, and\n       ``(2) had not more than 100 employees and a net worth of \n     not more than $1,400,000 at the time the adversary \n     adjudication was initiated,\n     shall be awarded fees and other expenses as a prevailing \n     party under section 504 of title 5, United States Code, in \n     accordance with the provisions of that section, but without \n     regard to whether the position of the Board was substantially \n     justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term `adversary \n     adjudication' has the meaning given that term in section \n     504(b)(1)(C) of title 5, United States Code.\n       ``(b) Court Proceedings.--An employer who, or a labor \n     organization that--\n       ``(1) is the prevailing party in a civil action, including \n     proceedings for judicial review of agency action by the \n     Board, brought by or against the Board, and\n       ``(2) had not more than 100 employees and a net worth of \n     not more than $1,400,000 at the time the civil action was \n     filed,\n\n     shall be awarded fees and other expenses as a prevailing \n     party under section 2412(d) of title 28, United States Code, \n     in accordance with the provisions of that section, but \n     without regard to whether the position of the United States \n     was substantially justified or special circumstances make an \n     award unjust. Any appeal of a determination of fees pursuant \n     to subsection (a) or this subsection shall be determined \n     without regard to whether the position of the United States \n     was substantially justified or special circumstances make an \n     award unjust.''.\n\n     SEC. 303. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Agency Proceedings.--Subsection (a) of section 20 of \n     the National Labor Relations Act (as added by section 302) \n     applies to agency proceedings commenced on or after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Court Proceedings.--Subsection (b) of section 20 of the \n     National Labor Relations Act (as added by section 302) \n     applies to

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 96--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n       A POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED HONORING OSKAR SCHINDLER\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Specter) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 96\n\n       Whereas during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Oskar \n     Schindler personally risked his life and that of his wife to \n     provide food and medical care and saved the lives of over \n     1,000 Jews from death, many of whom later made their homes in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Oskar Schindler also rescued about 100 Jewish men \n     and women from the Golezow concentration camp, who lay \n     trapped and partly frozen in 2 sealed train cars stranded \n     near Brunnlitz;\n       Whereas millions of Americans have been made aware of the \n     story of Schindler's bravery;\n       Whereas on April 28, 1962, Oskar Schindler was named a \n     ``Righteous Gentile'' by Yad Vashem; and\n       Whereas Oskar Schindler is a true hero and humanitarian \n     deserving of honor by the United States Government: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the Postal \n     Service should issue a stamp honoring the life of Oskar \n     Schindler.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 50th \nAnniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. As we do so, \nwe also remember the tragedy of the Holocaust and the events that \nculminated in the creation of a Jewish homeland.\n  I rise today to submit a measure to honor an individual who stands in \nthe highest esteem of the citizens of Israel, and throughout the world. \nI am pleased to be joined by the senior senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, in submitting this measure calling on the Postal \nService to issue a stamp commemorating the life of Oskar Schindler.\n  Millions of people around the world know the story of Oskar \nSchindler, whose heroism was brought to light by the author Thomas \nKeneally and the film maker Steven Spielberg. During the Nazi \noccupation of Poland, Oskar Schindler demonstrated that one person \ntruly could make a difference. He saved the lives of over 1,200 Jewish \nmen, women, and children, while risking his own life and that of his \nwife. Mr. Schindler also rescued approximately 100 Jewish men and women \nfrom the Golezow concentration camp, who were trapped in a sealed and \nfreezing railroad car.\n  Two of the individuals whose lives were saved by Oskar Schindler are \nresidents of New Jersey. Before the war, Abraham Zuckerman lived in \nKrakow, Poland. In 1942, he was sent to the Plaszow concentration camp \nwhere he faced unspeakable horrors and certain death. While he waited \nout his days toiling in a coal yard, one day, to his great fortune, Mr. \nZuckerman was told that he was one of the fortunate individuals whose \nname appeared on ``Schindler's List.'' Mr. Zuckerman was relatively \nsafe for a little more than a year, but when Schindler's factory in \nKrakow was liquidated, he was sent to a concentration camp at \nMauthausen and later Gusen II, where he was finally liberated. \nMeanwhile, Mr. Zuckerman's close friend Murray Pantirer was sent to \nanother concentration camp, Gross-Rosen, after Plaszow was shut down. \nOn his third day there, he was chosen as one of 900 workers for \nSchindler's new factory in Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia. Both men later \nemigrated to the United States. They have lived in New Jersey since \nshortly after the war where they started a home building business. To \nhonor Mr. Schindler, these men are responsible for over 20 Schindler \nCourts, Terraces and Plazas all over the Garden State.\n  Mr. President, we recognize that Mr. Schindler was a human being, not \ninfallible like many heroes. But his bravery has truly made him stand \nout and worthy of honor. There is nothing I can say that could describe \nhim any better than in the words of Mr. Zuckerman.\n  ``I am one of the Survivors and I owe my life to the courage and \nstrength of this great man. He was not a diplomat or a politician, he \nwas a very good manipulator. He had the courage and the knowledge to \nsave over 1200 Jews from death. He managed somehow to fool the Germans \ninto thinking he was on their side when all along he was going behind \ntheir backs to save the Jews. His life was always in danger but still \nhe persisted to do what he knew to be the right thing, he saved the \nJews anyway he could. He bartered, he lied, he used his own money, he \ndid everything humanly possible to save us. He was very unselfish as \nhis life could have ended at any time but still he did all he could to \nsave the Jews.''\n  Mr. President, Senator Specter and I are submitting this resolution \ntoday to call on the Postal Service to issue a stamp commemorating the \nlife of Oskar Schindler. Such a stamp would bring the story to millions \nof people. It would help us all understand that one individual can make \na difference in the lives of others.\n  We understand that we face somewhat of an uphill battle as Mr. \nSchindler is not a citizen of the United States. The Postal Service \ntells me that its policy is to issue stamps that depict American \nsubjects. But we say in response that Mr. Schindler's life was largely \ndevoted to the pursuit of freedom, to opposing tyranny, and to \nhumanitarianism. These qualities certainly represent the American ideal \nand we believe that Mr. Schindler deserves the honor that the Postal \nService has bestowed on other individuals who stood for these ideals. I \nam pleased to sponsor this important measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4917-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4917-S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                THURMOND (AND LEVIN) AMENDMENT NO. 2399\n\n  Mr. THURMOND (himself and Mr. Levin) proposed an amendment to the\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\nbill (S. 2057) to authorize appropriations for the fiscal year 1999 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In section 103(2), strike out ``$2,375,803,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$2,354,745,000''.\n       In section 201(3), strike out ``$13,398,993,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$13,673,993,000''.\n       In section 201(4), strike out ``$9,837,764,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$9,583,822,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              MURKOWSKI (AND BINGAMAN) AMENDMENT NO. 2400\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2057, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       Insert in the appropriate place:\n\n     SEC.   .

If no request for funds is made, the \n     Secretary shall provide a written explanation of the reason \n     therefore.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this legislation should have been the \neasiest thing we did this Congress. The Senate passed a bill on this \nissue by unanimous consent three times this Congress. This bill \ncontains nothing less than our Nation's energy security insurance \npolicy. This bill authorizes two vital energy security measures: the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and U.S. participation in the International \nEnergy Agency.\n  Both of these authorities have expired. Again, this year we have sent \nour soldiers to the Gulf to protect our Nation's energy security \ninterests. We owe it to our soldiers, and the Nation's civilian \nconsumers, to do everything we can to ensure that our energy insurance \npolicy is in effect.\n  However, to ensure our Nation's energy security fully, we need more \nthan just a simple extension of these authorities. We must change the \nantitrust exemption in EPCA to comply with current IEA policy. The IEA \nchanged its emergency response policy at our request, switching from \ncommand-and-control measures to more market-oriented coordinated \nstockdraw procedures. However, our laws haven't kept up.\n  Right now, our U.S. oil companies don't have any assurance that their \nattempts to cooperate with the IEA and our government in a crises won't \nbe a violation of antitrust laws. The IEA's efforts to respond to a \ncrisis are already being critically impaired, because they can't \ncoordinate with U.S. oil companies or even conduct exercises to prepare \nfor an emergency. Our oil companies want to cooperate with our \ngovernment and the IEA and strongly support this amendment.\n  For every year in recent memory, we have authorized this Act on a \nyear-to-year basis. Every year, we face a potential crises when these \nauthorities go unrenewed until the very end of the Congress. The \nprovisions of this bill are not controversial. However, there are those \nwho see any important bill as leverage.\n  This year, we are on the edge of a real crises. We have military \nactivity in the Gulf, and no clear authority to respond to oil supply \nshortages. Playing political games with this bill has always been \nirresponsible; now it is downright dangerous. In the future, the only \nway to avoid the annual crisis is to renew EPCA for more than one year. \nI am disappointed that we can't do that now. But for now, we must avert \nthe immediate crisis.\n  I have tried to address concerns about the future of the SPR. Like \nmany of you, I am dismayed by the recent use of the SPR as a ``piggy \nbank''. In 1995, DOE proposed the sale of oil to pay for repairs and \nupkeep, opening the floodgates to continued sales of oil for budget-\nbalancing purposes. So far, we've lost the American taxpayer over half \na billion dollars. Buying high and selling low never makes sense. We're \nlike the man in the old joke who was buying high and selling low who \nclaimed that ``he would make it up on volume.'' I am pleased that we \nwere successful in canceling the oil sale ordered by the fiscal year \n1998 Interior Appropriations bill. I thank the appropriators for \nkeeping my oil-sale cancellation amendment in the conference on the \nSupplemental Appropriations bill. By my calculations, we have saved the \nAmerican taxpayer over $500 million. I am also pleased that the \nPresident's budget does not propose oil sales. I hope we have broken \nthe habit of selling SPR oil forever.\n  We have already invested a great deal of taxpayer dollars in the SPR. \nWe proved during the Persian Gulf War that the stabilizing effect of an \nSPR drawdown far outstrips the volume of oil sold. The simple fact that \nthe SPR is available can have a calming influence on oil markets. The \noil is there, waiting to dampen the effects of an energy emergency on \nour economy. However, if we don't ensure that there is authority to use \nthe oil when we need it, we will have thrown those tax dollars away. \nSo, the first step is to ensure that our emergency oil reserves are \nfully authorized and available.\n  We are talking about people's lives and jobs. The least we can do is \nstop holding this measure hostage to political ambition. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the adoption of this amendment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       THOMAS AMENDMENT NO. 2401\n\n  Mr. THOMAS proposed an amendment to the amendment No. 2387 proposed \nby Mr. Hutchinson to the bill, S. 2057, supra; as follows\n\n       In the pending amendment, on page 1, strike lines 5 through \n     page 5, line 4.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HARKIN (AND WELLSTONE) AMENDMENT NO. 2402\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) proposed an amendment to \nthe amendment No. 2388 proposed by Mr. Hutchinson to the bill, S. 2057, \nsupra; as follows\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Customs Service has identified goods, \n     wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or \n     manufactured under conditions of convict labor, forced labor, \n     or indentured labor, in several countries.\n       (2) The United States Customs Service has made limited \n     attempts to prohibit the import of products made with forced \n     labor, resulting in only a few seizures, detention orders, \n     fines, and criminal prosecutions.\n       (3) The United States Customs Service has taken 21 formal \n     administrative actions in the form of detention orders \n     against different products destined for the United States \n     market, found to have been made with forced labor, including \n     products from the People's Republic of China.\n       (4) However, the United States Customs Service has never \n     formally investigated or pursued enforcement with respect to \n     attempts to import products made with forced or indentured \n     child labor.\n       (5) The United States Customs Service can use additional \n     resources and tools to obtain the timely and in-depth \n     verification necessary to identify and interdict products \n     made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced \n     or indentured child labor, that are destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (6) The International Labor Organization estimates that \n     approximately 250,000,000 children between the ages of 5 and \n     14 are working in developing countries, including millions of \n     children in bondage or otherwise forced to work for little or \n     no pay.\n       (7) Congress has clearly indicated in Public Law 105-61, \n     Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations, 1998, that forced or \n     indentured child labor constitutes forced labor under section \n     307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307).\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS PERSONNEL TO \n                   MONITOR THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH \n                   FORCED OR INDENTURED LABOR.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1999 to the United States Customs Service to \n     monitor the importation of products made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor, \n     the importation of which violates section 307 of the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON FORCED LABOR OR INDENTURED \n                   LABOR PRODUCTS DESTINED FOR THE UNITED STATES \n                   MARKET.\n\n       (a) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Customs \n     shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report on products \n     made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced \n     or indentured child labor that are destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (b) Contents of Report.--The report under subsection (a) \n     shall include information concerning the following:\n       (1) The extent of the use of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor in \n     manufacturing or mining products destined for the United \n     States market.\n       (2) The volume of products made or mined with forced labor \n     or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child \n     labor that is--\n       (A) destined for the United States market,\n       (B) in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \n     or section 1761 of title 18, United States Code, and\n       (C) seized by the United States Customs Service.\n       (3) The progress of the United States Customs Service in \n     identifying and interdicting products made with forced labor \n     or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child \n     labor that are destined for the United States market.\n\n     SEC. 4. RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED \n                   LABOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     determine whether any country with which the United States \n     has a memorandum of understanding with respect to reciprocal \n     trade that involves goods made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor \n     is frustrating implementation of the memorandum. If an \n     affirmative determination be made, the President should \n     immediately commence negotiations to replace the current \n     memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective \n     procedures for the monitoring of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor.

DEFINITION OF FORCED LABOR.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``forced labor'' means convict labor, \n     forced labor, or indentured labor, as such terms are used in \n     section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The term includes \n     forced or indentured child labor--\n       (1) that is exacted from any person under 15 years of age, \n     either in payment for the debts of a parent, relative, or \n     guardian, or drawn under false pretexts; and\n       (2) with respect to which such person is confined against \n     the person's will.\n       Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``For purposes of this section, forced or indentured labor \n     includes forced or indentured child labor.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 INHOFE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2403\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nSmith of New Hampshire, Ms. Collins, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \nHatch) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nbill, S. 2057, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in Title XXVIII of the bill, \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . MODIFICATION OF LIMITATIONS ON GENERAL AUTHORITY \n                   RELATING TO BASE CLOSURES AND REALIGNMENTS.\n\n       (a) Actions Covered by Notice and Wait Procedures.--\n     Subsection (a) of section 2687 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking out paragraphs (1) and (2) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following new paragraphs (1) \n     and (2);\n       ``(1) the closure of any military installation at which at \n     least 150 civilian personnel are authorized to be employed;\n       ``(2) any realignment with respect to a military \n     installation if such realignment will result in an aggregate \n     reduction in the number of civilian personnel authorized to \n     be employed at such military installation during the fiscal \n     year in which notice of such realignment is submitted to \n     Congress under subsection (b) equal to or greater than--\n       ``(A) 150 such civilian personnel; or\n       ``(B) the number equal to 50 percent of the total number of \n     civilian personnel authorized to be employed at such military \n     installation at the beginning of such fiscal year; or''.\n       (b) Availability of Funds for Certain Pre-Closure \n     Activities.-- Subsection (d) of the section is amended is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) No funds appropriated or otherwise available to the \n     Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for the \n     purpose of planning or carrying out a transfer of civilian or \n     military personnel or equipment in connection with a closure \n     of a military installation not covered by subsection (a) \n     unless the use of funds for that purpose is specifically \n     authorized by law.''.\n       (c) Definitions.--Subsection (e) of that section is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``(including a \n     consolidation)'' after ``any action''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) The term `closure' includes any action to inactivate \n     or abandon a military installation or to transfer a military \n     installation to caretaker status.''.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FURTHER ROUNDS ON BASE \n                   CLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) There may be a need for further rounds of base \n     closures, but there is no need to authorize in 1998 a new \n     base closure commission that would not begin its work until \n     three years from now, in 2001;\n       (2) While the Department of Defense has submitted a report \n     to the Congress in response to Section 2824 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, that report--\n       (A) based its estimates of the costs and savings of \n     previous base closure rounds on data that the General \n     Accounting Office has described as ``inconsistent'', \n     ``unreliable'' and ``incomplete'';\n       (B) failed to demonstrate that the Defense Department is \n     working effectively to improve its ability to track base \n     closure costs and savings resulting from the 1993 and 1995 \n     base closure rounds, which are ongoing;\n       (C) modeled the savings to be achieved as a result of \n     further base closure rounds on the 1993 and 1995 rounds, \n     which are as yet incomplete and on which the Department's \n     information is faulty; and\n       (D) projected that base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 \n     would not produce substantial savings until 2008, a decade \n     after the federal government will have achieved unified \n     budget balance, and 5 years beyond the planning period for \n     the current congressional budget and Future Years Defense \n     Plan;\n       (3) Section 2824 required that the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the General Accounting Office review the Defense \n     Department's report, and--\n       (A) The General Accounting Office stated on May 1, that \n     ``we are now conducting our analysis to be able to report any \n     limitations that may exist in the required level of detail. . \n     . . [W]e are awaiting some supporting documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish assessing the report's \n     information.'';\n       (B) The Congressional Budget Office stated on May 1 that \n     its review is ongoing, and that ``it is important that CBO \n     take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate \n     evaluation of DoD's report, rather than issue a preliminary \n     and potentially inaccurate assessment.'';\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office recommended that ``The \n     Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of \n     base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, \n     should follow an interval during which DoD and independent \n     analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have \n     been taken thus far.''\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that:\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n       (1) Congress should not authorize further rounds of base \n     closures and realignments until all actions authorized by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 are \n     completed; and\n       (2) The Department of Defense should submit forthwith to \n     the Congress the report required by Section 2815 of Public \n     Law 103-337, analyzing the effects of base closures and \n     realignments on the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     remobilize, describing the military construction projects \n     needed to facilitate such remobilization, and discussing the \n     assets, such as air space, that would be difficult to \n     reacquire in the event of such remobilization.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 INHOFE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2404\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brownback, \nand Mr. Smith of New Hampshire) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by them to the bill, S. 2057, supra; as follows:\n\n       In title XXVIII, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. .

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that India \nconducted three underground nuclear tests in the western desert state \nof Rajasthan on Monday, May 11, and two additional tests at the same \nsite on Wednesday, May 13. These tests were conducted without any \nadvance warning to the rest of the world and are a dangerous precedent \nfor future testing by other nations. No nation should think that it can \nconduct secret nuclear tests and not be held accountable for its \nactions. Furthermore, these tests run counter to an international \ncampaign to pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), of which I \nfully support, and are both irresponsible and unacceptable. The United \nStates and the international community must speak out against this \naction and act swiftly and justly.\n  India, which has not signed the 1970 nonproliferation treaty, gave no \nadvance warning about the nuclear tests on Monday and Wednesday. Indian \nPrime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said that the explosions in the \ndesert, 330 miles southwest of New Delhi, did not result in the release \nof radiation into the atmosphere. However, this is simply untrue. \nNuclear explosions, even when they are conducted underground, release \ndeadly radioactive materials into the atmosphere and water table, \nposing health risks for generations to come. Treating the human race \nand the environment with such complete disrespect is unacceptable and \nwill not go unnoticed.\n  While many of India's leaders have applauded these tests, the people \nof India are hurt the most. India is a country of extreme poverty and \nall Indians will be harmed by this act. On one hand, international \nsanctions are imminent which will pose further economic hardship on the \npoorest of the poor. On the other, the radiation from these nuclear \nblasts has severe health impacts on all Indians including those closest \nto New Delhi. It was irresponsible for the leaders of India to \nsacrifice the economic and physical well-being of its people for a \ndisplay of military might.\n  Moreover, countries that break international law by detonating \nnuclear devices are subject to denial of U.S. credits and credit \nguarantees.\n  Federal law also requires U.S. opposition to loan requests to \ninternational lending institutions and bars loans from any U.S. bank to \nthe Indian government except those that provide food or other \nagricultural commodities. I will bring the issue of international \nsanctions and international lending up with my colleagues on the Senate \nBanking Committee, which overseas World Bank issues, to ensure that \nappropriate actions are taken with regard to countries who disregard \ninternational law and conduct nuclear tests.\n  India, one of several nations widely suspected of nuclear capability \nwhich has not joined the 1970 CTBT treaty, now observed by 185 \ncountries, should be pressured to sign the treaty immediately. India's \nleaders acted with disregard and India must be shown that its actions \nare unacceptable. The United States will be forced to impose sanctions \non India, and I would urge swift action on this front. Nevertheless, \nthis irresponsible act by India should not be an impetus to step up the \narms race by Pakistan. Instead, Pakistan should exercise restraint and \ncaution while the international community imposes sanctions. In the \nlong-term, Pakistan will benefit most by responding to this action, not \nwith military buildup, but with a higher level of dignity and morality.\n  Mohandas Gandhi said, We must support friends even in their mistakes, \nhowever, it must be the friend and not the mistake we are supporting.'' \nIndia's decision to conduct nuclear tests was a mistake that was both \nirresponsible and unacceptable. Although I wish no ill on the people of \nIndia, the leaders of the country must accept responsibility for this \nmistake and the consequences that, no doubt, will follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4922-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4922-S4923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nArthritis Foundation on its 50th anniversary. Since its inception in \n1948, the Arthritis Foundation is stronger than ever and is forging \nahead with an increased commitment to providing help and hope for those \nwho suffer from the more than one hundred forms of arthritis and \nrelated conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, \nlupus, fibromyalgia and juvenile arthritis.\n  Arthritis, in its various forms, is a major national health problem, \naffecting more than 40 million people in the United States. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention predict that by the year 2020, \narthritis prevalence will increase to 59.4 million Americans--one out \nof every five people, including 285,000 children.\n  If that is not enough, the economic impact of arthritis is \nsignificant. I have been informed that arthritis results in 39 million \nphysician visits a year and more than half a million hospitalizations \nannually. Medical costs and lost productivity due to arthritis are \nestimated at almost $65 billion per year--approximately 1.1 percent of \nthe gross national product.\n  Through it all, the Arthritis Foundation has increased public \nawareness and has help provide guidance for combating arthritis. The \nArthritis Foundation, an Atlanta based nonprofit organization, supports \nresearch to find the cure for the prevention of arthritis and seeks to \nimprove the quality of life for those affected by this disease. \nFurther, the Arthritis Foundation encourages people with arthritis to \nseek early diagnosis and treatment, and provides programs to facilitate \nself-management.\n  The Arthritis Foundation's sponsorship of research for 50 years has \nresulted in major treatment advances for most types of arthritis and \nrelated conditions. The Foundation currently provides $16 million \nannually in grants to more than 300 researchers to help find cures, \npromote prevention and provide better treatments. Since its inception, \nthe Foundation has spent more than $200 million on research while \nsupporting more than 1,700 scientists and physicians.\n  The organization has informed me that they are moving toward a new \nera of public health activity that includes collaboration with the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention to develop the National \nArthritis Action Plan. They are seeking support for the inclusion of \narthritis in Healthy People 2010, the nation's strategic planning guide \nfor health promotion and disease prevention.\n  The National Arthritis Action Plan will focus on such elements as \ndefining the nature, extent and distribution of the arthritis burden; \nidentifying modifiable risk factors; developing creative and effective \npublic health programs and policies to reduce this burden; and \nimplementing and coordinating these programs and policies through \npartnership with government, voluntary, professional, private and \nacademic institutions and organizations.\n  The Arthritis Foundation also provides a large number of nationwide \ncommunity-based services to make life easier and less painful. These \nservices include self-help courses, water and land-based exercise \nclasses, support groups, instructional videotapes, educational \nbrochures and booklets, and continuing education courses and \npublications for health professionals.\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\n  In the past 50 years, the Arthritis Foundation has funded research, \nincreased public awareness and provided needed education and services. \nThese major contributions have placed the goal of curing and managing \nthe impact of some forms of arthritis within a realistic reach. I \ncongratulate the Foundation on this golden achievement and wish it \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4922-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF DR. H. JAMES MAHAN\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to \ntake a few minutes to honor the career of a champion of public \neducation, Dr. H. James Mahan, as he retires from the position of \nSuperintendent of Homewood School District Number 153 in Homewood, \nIllinois.\n  For 15 years, Dr. Mahan has led Homewood School District #153 down a \npath of educational excellence and innovation. In 1984, the district \nhad 1,450 students and 90 professional staff members. Today, there are \n2,240 students and 180 professional staffers. During this period of \nexpansion, Dr. Mahan worked to ensure that the quality of education in \nhis school district improved as well.\n  Under his stewardship, district schools have twice been named Blue \nRibbon Winners by the United States Department of Education. This \nsuccess is in large part due to the sound educational principles that \nhave been the basis of Dr. Mahan's leadership. He has developed \nmeaningful physical improvement plans, initiated the use of the \nInternet and other technology as classroom tools, and he has encouraged \nlocal businesses and organizations to provide his district's students \nwith hands-on learning experiences through internships and mentoring \nprograms. Furthermore, Dr. Mahan has instilled in his schools the \nprinciples of fiscal prudence, good discipline and teacher development.\n  Dr. Mahan's commitment to public education and to the students of \nHomewood School District #153 are commendable and serve as a model for \nothers to follow. I congratulate Dr. Mahan on this milestone of his \ncareer, and wish him good luck and Godspeed in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4923-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SPACE SYMPOSIUM\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of participating \nin the 14th National Space Symposium hosted last month by the United \nStates Space Foundation. The annual symposium was designed to display \nand discuss current trends in the space community, and the 1998 theme \nreflected what has become very significant to the development of the \nUnited States space industry: ``The Global Relevance for Space: Civil, \nCommercial and Military''. As the Foundation's President, Bill Knudsen, \nsaid in his remarks, ``Space is increasingly global in all aspects. The \nstrong interrelationship between government, private industry and \nmilitary space activities has created a completely new environment.''\n  The location of this symposium highlights the significant position of \nmy state of Colorado in the global space business. All aspects of space \nthrive in Colorado; we have an extensive and growing industry and a \nsignificant military presence.\n  The symposium addressed several issues and opportunities with a broad \ninternational flavor, and with a focus on commercial and market \nconcerns.\n  Demonstrating the interrelated nature of space activity, each of the \nsymposium's eleven professional panels had at least one representative \nfrom the civil sector, one representing the commercial perspective and \none from the national security perspective. This integrated approach \nproduced a spirited dialog on critical space issues.\n  The list of participants was impressive, a few especially captured my \nattention. NASA Administrator Dan Goldin detailed accomplishments of \nthe agency, announced cooperative efforts with the Air Force and \nsubstantiated the need for the International Space Station, rejecting \nsuggestions that the Russians should be dropped from the program. Mr. \nGoldin also spoke to what I believe may be NASA's greatest \naccomplishment: increasing their productivity while reducing their \nbudget. The NASA budget has decreased 30% since 1993, and in that same \ntime 10 new programs and numerous partnerships have been created. In \nthe coming era of public and private partnership in space exploration \nand development, NASA has established a high standard of efficiency and \nachievement.\n  The capstone panel, led by Mr. Golden, also featured General Howell \nEstes, Commander in Chief of NORAD and US Space Command. General Estes \nemphasized the marketplace as the driving force, while recognizing the \nnecessity of a proper partnership between the private sector and \ngovernment.\n  Robert Mallett, the Deputy Secretary of Commerce, stressed the need \nto recognize commercial space as the driver of a higher growth job \nmachine in industry that will deliver prosperity and security for \ncoming generations of Americans.\n  Our colleague in the House, Representative Curt Weldon, addressed \nnational security, space and arms control concerns as he spoke \npassionately from his experience of working with the Russians.\n  I spoke about the important mission of our military to secure the use \nof space, and my perspective as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee on space implications for national security. I believe that \nthe private and public sector must work together to ensure that the \nUnited States is the first and best in space. I support legislation in \nCongress to encourage commercialization of space, and in particular \nhave been supportive of the efforts of our Colorado companies that plan \nto operate remote-sensing satellites that will offer unique high-\nresolution satellite photos.\n  In addition to the panels, more than sixty exhibitors displayed the \nlatest in space technology at this international conference. The \nFoundation honored exceptional achievement in space activities, \nrecognizing NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for their public outreach \nefforts associated with last summer's remarkable Pathfinder Mission, \nand the career of space leadership of General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr. \nUSAF (ret.), the former vice chief of staff of the Air Force.\n  General Estes and others from the Space Command laid out the future \nof military space with the unveiling at the symposium of their Long \nRange Plan. Two technologies were inducted into the Space Technology \nHall of Fame, the Global Positioning System and Temper Foam, a NASA \nAmes Research Center technology used in medical and recreational \napplications. The Hall of Fame marketed its 10th anniversary of \nhonoring technologies originally developed for the space program and \nlater adapted to benefit others here on Earth.\n  The symposium's sponsor, the United States Foundation, is a national \nnon-profit organization with headquarters in Colorado Springs. The \nFoundation's mission it to aggressively advance civil, commercial and \nnational security space endeavors for a brighter future and to provide \nand support educational excellence through the excitement of space. The \nFoundation should be commended for this symposium and for their other \nimportant projects, such as the Mission HOME program, a public \nawareness campaign for the space community, and Space Discovery \ngraduate courses and teacher education opportunities.\n  This annual event has grown considerably in the past few years, and I \nexpect it to continue growing in scope and significance. I am already \nlooking forward to next April and the 15th Annual National Space \nSymposium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4923-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSECURITIES LITIGATION UNIFORM STANDARDS ACT OF 1998--AMENDMENT NO. 2397\n\n Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize a life-long \nKansas native, Lucile Wulfmeyer, who passed away on May 11, 1997. Her \nmemorial service at First Presbyterian Church included the following \nremembrance of Lucile, written by her elder daughter, Roberta Doerges:\n\n       My earliest memories of mother and my family roots seem to \n     materialize in the home she purchased at 316 S. Bluff. Here, \n     I remember a formal dining room converted to a family room; \n     learning to ride my first bicycle; and meeting the man who \n     would later become my father: Lawrence Wulfmeyer. What come \n     before all of that dims in childhood lost, but along with \n     Marian's ``I wuv you, Wawrance,'' and my manipulative acts to \n     prevent my mother's dating, I remember an abundance of \n     motherly patience and forbearance. The nearly four years \n     between my father, Francis Chambers' death, and my mothers' \n     union of 37 years to Lawrence, set the stage for revealing my \n     mother's life of service.\n       Today's stories might have described a woman with 18-month-\n     old and not-quite-three-year-old daughters as capitulating to \n     welfare, but not so for our mother. A woman wise beyond her \n     decade, she returned to work at Wichita's McConnell AFB and \n     managed to provide her daughters with a live-in housekeeper, \n     as well as financial support. I have always marveled at her \n     courage to do this: a ``woman's libber'' before her time, \n     working in a predominately male field, and providing two \n     young daughters with love and sustenance.\n       Knowing that she needed companionship, and a helpmate to \n     raise these little girls, Lucile married again in October of \n     1959. Lawrence's Brownie camera recorded two little girls, \n     dressed identically, and participating in the celebration of \n     their parents' union and a new father. A new home in East \n     Wichita, and a new family life ensued.\n       Always a large part of the family picture was First \n     Presbyterian Church: group calling on prospective new \n     members, UPY meetings and youth choir through junior and \n     senior high school years. Even the conception and realization \n     of the Wulfmeyer ``Dream Home'' in Clearwater did not dim \n     that emphasis. Many a Lucckock Class picnic, or a Brown \n     Sunday School Class open house was held at the home in \n     Clearwater, dubbed ``Spring Creek Acres,'' and the seat of so \n     many collective family memories.\n       Mother's life of service continued through all of those \n     years. Whether creating musical programs for Marian, Roberta \n     and Lucile to perform, or lovingly constructing costumes to \n     enhance them; whether taxiing busy daughters to endless high \n     school extracurricular activities, or typing term papers at \n     7:30 am (at 120 words per minutes proficiency, this was one \n     skill that was too tempting for at least her elder daughter \n     to overlook taking advantage of!) Reading and correcting \n     school papers, assisting with college choices, consoling \n     unrequited crushes--no act was too demeaning for Mother. Her \n     creative juices seemed endless; her power to be supportive \n     was astonishing; her innovation was impressive. (To this day, \n     I owe my own extensive and find vocabulary to her love of \n     literature, and the ingenious idea during our late high \n     school years to put a ``new'' vocabulary word on the table \n     daily, at breakfast. The challenge was not only to learn its \n     meaning, but, by dinner time, to be able to use it correctly \n     in conversation.)\n       My mother's ability to teach and instill was amazing. I \n     never remember learning the 23rd Psalm or the Lord's Prayer. \n     These were repeated to us as babies, following our father's \n     death, and were as much a part of our essence as eating or \n     speaking. The faith which she instilled in us was invaluable: \n     the unswerving foundation of a God who loves us, in spite of \n     any adversity.\n       Mother's ability to teach also shows through in her three \n     grandchildren: Autumn's love of art; Lauren's organizational \n     skills, service inclinations, and musical interests; Kyle's \n     appreciation of theater . . . all of these are owed in great \n     part to a grandmother who took the time of summer visits to \n     send grandchildren to art classes, or escort them to Wichita \n     Music Theater. That love and those lessons will last a \n     lifetime.\n       Small wonder that Lucile had already begun a life of \n     service as a young woman. Her father died when she was \n     seventeen. She assisted her mother through years of \n     illnesses, operations at Mayo, bitterness over poor health, \n     and tender care in her elder years. This attitude of service \n     also include care for her elderly father-in-law, Sidney \n     Chambers, and for Lawrence's mother, Clara. Her love and \n     service seemingly knew no bounds.\n       Those who loved Lucile will remember her devotion to \n     protocol, her gracious way of living, and her love of family. \n     They will remember her acute appreciation of the fine arts; \n     her gifts of writing prose and poetry; her love of reading \n     and of books, her fascination with history (especially \n     through the D.A.R.), and her delight in the unique (how many \n     American ``witches'' do you know)? She will be remembered for \n     her life of service to her family and her church; and her \n     appreciation of God's divine purpose.\n       While recent months may have seemingly robber her of many \n     of the things which she appreciated most, her inability to \n     enjoy those things completely made all of us who visited and \n     loved her, acutely aware of all those finer appreciations \n     which she enjoyed and instilled in others.\n       She was greatly loved, and will be greatly missed. ``Well \n     done, thou good and faithful servant.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/14/senate-section/article/S4924-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GENERAL CLIFTON B.

Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to one of \nour nation's fine young students, Ms. Kortney Sherbine of Cheraw, South \nCarolina. She has been named the South Carolina state winner in The \nCitizens Flag Alliance Essay Contest. Her essay, ``The American Flag \nProtection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . the Right Thing to \nDo'', is a thoughtful paean to our Nation's banner. I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The essay follows:\n\nThe American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . The \n                           Right Thing to Do\n\n                       (By Kortney Beth Sherbine)\n\n       It is my profound and adamant belief that an American Flag-\n     Protection Amendment must be enacted to unequivocally ensure \n     America's survival as a thriving, democratic nation. The \n     significance of our beloved flag is best immortalized through \n     America's heroic and valorous history. From the moment of our \n     country's inception, the flag has served as an inspiration \n     and motivation during times of exaltation as well as \n     tribulation. All Americans should be moved to tears as they \n     see Old Glory through Francis Scott Key's eyes as he peered \n     anxiously from a British prison ship during the War of 1812 \n     (World Book, 238). As he drifted in the Baltimore Harbor, the \n     sole affirmation of America's surviving liberty waved highly \n     in air. As he witnessed the perseverance of our flag, he \n     realized our nation was destined for greatness.\n       In addition, our flag's sacredness was poignantly displayed \n     at Libby's Prison where soldiers cut our banner in twenty-two \n     pieces saving it from desecration at the hands of the \n     Confederates (Krythe, 17). Subsequently, the American people \n     will never forget the powerful image of five marines and one \n     corpsman planting the Stars and Bars at Iwo Jima. These \n     aforementioned tributes to Old Glory should touch the very \n     core of our identity as American citizens. The planting of \n     the American flag throughout history has carved our role as \n     the great defender of democracy.\n       For over two hundred years, the flag has been the most \n     honorable, tangible shrine to freedom the people of the world \n     have witnessed. It is a beacon of hope and light for the \n     oppressed and downtrodden. The American flag is as necessary \n     and integral a part of our patriotism as God and family. It \n     is a symbol of the turmoil our nation conquered to become a \n     superpower today.\n       No action can be more disheartening and devastating to a \n     true American than seeing one of our own deface and desecrate \n     our most precious symbol of liberty. Throughout the span of \n     time, our fallen heroes have paid the ultimate debt for our \n     freedoms and rights. These great patriots sacrificed their \n     very\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\n     lives for the values and unalienable privileges that Old \n     Glory emulates. How dare our countrymen have the vile \n     audacity to dishonor the memories of our veterans and our \n     hallowed history? Captain William Driver reflected the true \n     American spirit as he proclaimed, ``Thank God! I lived to \n     raise Old Glory . . . I am now ready to die and go to my \n     forefathers'' (Adams, 26).\n       The media shows day after day how American citizens cling \n     to the philosophy of basic human rights in a democratic \n     society. We should hold the Stars and Stripes, the cloak of \n     our very freedom, dear to our hearts with an equal \n     conviction. Charles W. Stewart laced this concept with \n     eloquence as he reflected, ``The Stars and Stripes is our \n     sign of national sovereignty and unity. It is a symbol of the \n     Constitution as the cross is a symbol of Christianity'' \n     (Krythe, 26). We should value our flag's worth as we value \n     our very existence in this grand nation.\n       In 1989, our Supreme Court, through Texas v. Johnson, \n     invalidated the flag-protection laws in 48 states and the \n     District of Columbia (CFA, 3). Currently, five national \n     surveys show that 80 percent of Americans support a flag-\n     protection amendment (CFA, 1). A government should conform to \n     the wishes of the majority of its citizens. Our forefathers \n     were indeed wise as they anticipated the changing needs and \n     demands of future generations. They set forth two possible \n     routes for amendments. Firstly, two-thirds of the state \n     legislatures may call a convention for the proposing of \n     amendments. In addition, two-thirds of the Senate and House \n     can propose an amendment (Ritchie, 59). This wisely crafted \n     system of checks and balances has truly kept our country \n     operated by its citizens.\n       Among many basic rights, the first amendment of our \n     Constitution prohibits the government from restricting \n     freedom of speech (Ritchie, 65). An American's right to speak \n     out for one's beliefs was born in the colonial era and has \n     remained a unique component of our nation thereafter. The \n     Supreme Court has grossly contorted the intention of this \n     freedom and has made a mockery of it for the world to scorn. \n     Freedoms must have limitations for humans to live in harmony. \n     If no boundaries are enforced, chaos will certainly ensue. \n     The ``clear and present'' danger system of limiting freedoms \n     should extend to desecrating the flag (Ritchie, 67). \n     Consequently, when 80% of Americans are extremely offended by \n     the defacing of our most treasured symbols, the possibility \n     for clear and present danger is imminent and inevitable.\n       Vital steps do exist to allow the American people to have a \n     voice concerning the preserving of Old Glory. Laws should \n     reflect the feelings of the majority, not the whims of a \n     minority. A democracy is a government of action. Inaction \n     does not hold a place in our thriving nation. Many steps can \n     be taken by citizens to make positive changes in our \n     government. It is an American's right to contact members of \n     congress, contact the news media, write an editorial, talk \n     via radio, and circulate petitions and materials to show \n     support for his cause (CFA 1). Every true believer in the \n     United States of America should take these steps to save and \n     preserve our beloved flag.\n       If we want our great, democratic nation to survive, then we \n     must save the banner of our triumphs and freedoms. If our \n     symbol of freedom is destroyed, then our nation will surely \n     follow. By losing respect for our American flag, we \n     ultimately sacrifice the right to refer to ourselves as ``The \n     land of the free and the home of the brave.'' In essence, we \n     would merely reduce ourselves to ``The land of the ungrateful \n     and the home of the misguided.'' Why worry about foreign \n     nations stealing our freedoms when we are perfectly willing \n     to sacrifice them free of charge? We must protect our Stars \n     and Bars as adamantly as we fight for our very rights to \n     life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n       A wise President, Calvin Coolidge, summarized the necessity \n     of our respect for the flag as he urged, ``It will be futile \n     merely to show outward respect of our National Emblem if we \n     do not cherish in our hearts, an unquenchable love for, and \n     devotion to, the unseen which it represents'' (Adams, 30) \n     Seeing our flag flutter majestically in the air should move \n     every American to tears. We should be inspired to be \n     profoundly grateful for the great human sacrifices that have \n     provided us with a rare nation; a nation where all citizens, \n     regardless of race, sex, religion, or wealth have the right \n     to pursue their dreams and reach for the ``stars''.\n\n\n                              bibliography\n\n       Adams, John W.
