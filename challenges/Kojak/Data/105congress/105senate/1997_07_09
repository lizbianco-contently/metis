Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the solemn \nimportance of the investigative hearings that have just begun by the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Thompson, and the distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Glenn.\n  While it is unfortunate that some in Congress have attempted to \nportray this investigation as an effort by one side to make political \nhay, I want to briefly discuss why these hearings are crucial for all \nAmericans of whatever party or ideology.\n  Through the hard work and bipartisan effort of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, there has been evidence uncovered and indications of \nmuch more evidence to come that our American political system was put \nup for sale and that an alarming number of foreign interests were ready \nand willing to buy. While there have been indications of a wide array \nof illegal activities in connection with the 1996 Presidential \nelection, much of which the public is aware, Senator Thompson yesterday \nindicated that there may be much the American people do not yet know.\n  The chairman stated yesterday that his committee has evidence that \npoints to a concerted effort by the Chinese Government to improperly or \nillegally influence American foreign policy toward that country and \ntoward Taiwan. Mr. President, if this is, indeed, the case, then in my \nview the American people must know the truth. They have a right to know \nwhether the U.S. Government and U.S. officials who were charged with \nthe duty of serving the interests of the American people instead served \ntheir own special interests and the interests of others.\n  The U.S. Senate is attempting to find the truth through this \ninvestigation and I am hopeful and confident that it will do so.\n  Central to the investigation at this point is a name now well-known \nto the American people, John Huang. Mr. Huang has been a highly paid \nexecutive of a major foreign bank. He was appointed to be a high-level \ntrade official at the Commerce Department with access to an array of \nclassified documents. And finally, he was for a time a key fundraiser \nfor the Democratic National Committee. While alone each of these \npositions is laudable, in part what this investigation seeks to \ndetermine is whether or not Mr. Huang\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\nserved in all of these capacities at the same time, which would be a \ncrime.\n\n  Although it is becoming increasingly apparent that Mr. Huang did not \nact alone in his efforts to serve as an international influence broker, \nit is nevertheless interesting to discover that of the $3.4 million in \ndonations to the Democratic Party that Mr. Huang raised, the Democratic \nParty has returned almost half of that money, $1.6 million, to the \ndonors because the contributions were probably made illegally.\n  Now Mr. Huang has asked the Senate for immunity from future \nprosecution if he testifies before the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nWhether Mr. Huang is ultimately granted immunity or not, his conduct \nand that of dozens of others who have been subpoenaed must be \nuncovered. This will inevitably involve a give-and-take process between \nthe majority and the minority on the committee. That is to be expected, \ngiven the sensitive nature of this inquiry. But simply because the \ninvestigation touches on sensitive issues does not mean that it should \nnot move forward. In fact, the history of our country has been one of \nconstant vigilance against the kind of secret manipulation of power \nthat is at the center of this investigation. Only by fully exposing \nwrongdoing can we be satisfied that all that can be done is being done \nto tell those who would seek to thwart our system that America's \nforeign and domestic policy is not for sale.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the critical need to expose the illegal \nactivities of those in positions of authority in our Government, let me \nalso say that we in Congress should act to address the related issue of \ncampaign finance reform. Let me be clear: the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and this Senate have the duty and obligation to immediately \nand fully investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing with regard to \nthe most recent Federal election. But once the criminal investigation \nis complete, I am confident that the evidence brought out at these \nhearings will help shed light on how we might reform our campaign \nfundraising laws to prevent many of the abuses of the system that this \ninvestigation will also highlight.\n  I have introduced a bill in the Senate that I believe can serve as a \nvehicle to not only achieve consensus on this important and contentious \nissue, but that will put a stop to the types of excesses and abuses of \nour system that have eroded the integrity and public confidence from \nour Federal political system.\n  For example, my bill specifically prohibits contributions from any \nforeign entity or any foreign person, including green card holders who \nare not citizens of this country. I believe that effecting this change \nof current law would be a positive result of what we have learned from \nthe 1996 Presidential election. It is simply not healthy for our \ndemocracy to have foreign influence in the election process. That is a \nsacred right and a sacred responsibility that the American people have, \nto democratically elect our President, our Congress, and our other \nState and local leaders. Anything that impinges on that right is not \nwarranted, and I hope we will be able to take action soon to prevent \nthis type of conduct from ever happening again.\n  In addition to the issue of foreign influence in our election \nprocess, I am hopeful that the Governmental Affairs hearings, which I \nthink are being conducted in a very fair and bipartisan way, will also \ntell us what other things we should do to make sure that our campaign \nlaws protect the integrity of our election system.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nRepublican conference, Senator Mack, for asking us to come forward and \ntalk today about the importance of this investigation and the \nimportance of the integrity of our American election system.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Texas for \nher comments this morning and for her involvement in expressing the \nimportance of the actions on the part of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. I also want to express my support for the committee itself \nand the inquiry that began some 6 months ago. As elected officials, it \nis our duty not only to change the laws when necessary but to abide by \nthem. The hearings that began in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nyesterday are an inquiry into just how well the Clinton administration \nabided by the law during the last election cycle. The Democrat Party \nand the White House would like the American public to think that they \ndid nothing different than anyone else, and that everybody does it and \ntherefore we must change the law.\n  That just simply is not true. No, not everybody does it. Before we \nbegin considering what new laws to pass, we ought to examine who has \nviolated the ones we have on the books now. In my view, the \nadministration will have no standing to debate the issue of campaign \nfinance reform until they prove that we can live and that they can live \nwithin the law as it currently stands. It does little good to create \nnew laws if our leaders don't follow them with principle, integrity, \nand some semblance of morality. We ought to have leaders who adhere to \nthe spirit of the laws--rather than to push the envelope of propriety.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are credible allegations that the Clinton \nadministration exhibited precious little principle, integrity, or \nmorality in the conduct of their last campaign. The committee will be \nlooking into whether the Clinton administration knowingly accepted \nillegal foreign contributions, allowed money laundering to occur, or \nactively engaged in the unlawful solicitation of campaign donations in \nFederal buildings. Worst of all, the committee must determine the true \nnature and extent of what appears to be a calculated attempt by the \nChinese Government to buy influence in the last election.\n  Senator Thompson's committee has uncovered evidence of a detailed \nplan by China to illegally increase their influence over the United \nStates legal process. They found that China has invested substantial \nsums of money in this effort and that the White House was made aware of \nthe plan prior to the election but did nothing to prevent it from \nsucceeding. Disturbingly, the Chinese plan continues today. The \ncommittee must now determine who knew or should have known about this \nplan and how it came to be implemented.\n  I commend Senator Thompson and his team for uncovering this shocking \ninfiltration of our electoral system by another government. Judging by \nthe level of complaining by Democrats, he must be close to the truth. \nWhen you get right down to it, these hearings are about the lack of \nshame in this administration. No one in this administration is ashamed \nof the fact that they may have broken the laws to win the election. No \none in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that the \nPresident and Vice President reportedly leaned on donors from the \ncomfort of the White House. That is illegal. And no one in this \nadministration seems to be ashamed of the fact that overnight stays in \nthe Lincoln bedroom were for sale to the highest bidder. The White \nHouse should not be for sale. No one in this administration seems to be \nashamed of the fact that poor religious people were preyed upon for \nillegal donations. They should be beyond such political manipulation. \nNo one in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that \nfundraising safeguards were jettisoned so that illegal foreign cash \ncame rolling in with no questions asked. Compliance with our country's \nelection laws is not optional. No one in this administration seems to \nbe ashamed of the fact that a midlevel political appointee potentially \ncompromised our national security.\n  He should never have been in a position to do so.\n  This administration seems incapable of being ashamed of any of this. \nRather, they continue to rationalize their actions in an attempt to \ndeflect the negative publicity with hollow calls for campaign finance \nreform. Unlike others who attempt to tear down our current system, I \nhope Senator Thompson and the members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee are able to restore some confidence in our system through \nthese hearings. Calling people to publicly account for their wrongdoing \nis the first step in that journey.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Thompson for his forbearance. He has\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\nshown great tolerance and conducted himself like a gentleman, at times \nwhen courtesy has been hard to muster. The administration continues to \nstonewall the committee on producing documents; witnesses have claimed \ntheir fifth amendment privilege; targets have fled the country; and a \npaper trail consisting of millions of pages have been left for the \ncommittee to unravel.\n  Today, I express my gratitude to him for taking on this unpleasant \njob, and I wish the committee members patience and good judgment in \nexercising their duties to uncover what has heretofore been covered up.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe there is a special order \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Alaska that \nwe are now in a period of morning business.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today is the first day of testimony in the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs special investigation of the 1996 Federal election \ncampaign contributions. There is, of course, but one purpose to this \ninvestigation. That purpose is to review campaign financing practices \nduring the 1996 election to determine whether Federal laws were \nviolated.\n  I think it is fair to state that Federal campaign laws in question \nare relatively straightforward.\n  It is illegal under U.S. election law for a noncitizen to contribute \nto campaigns;\n  It is illegal for anyone to contribute to a campaign in someone \nelse's name;\n  And, it is illegal to solicit campaign funds on Federal property.\n  Yesterday, at the opening of these hearings, Chairman Thompson \nannounced exceedingly alarming evidence of violations of these Federal \nlaws. The gravest of these violations is an alleged covert plan by the \nChinese Government to subvert the 1996 United States election process.\n  I note, Mr. President, that was headlined in the Washington Post this \nmorning.\n  The chairman indicated that the plan implemented a series of alleged \nillegal efforts by high members of the Chinese Government to influence \nUnited States policy by giving substantial sums of money. The intent \nhad to be clear: To cultivate relations with the White House to \ninfluence foreign policy.\n  Two key figures in the committee's investigation are John Huang of \nthe Lippo Group and Charlie Trie, a Macao-based campaign fundraiser. \nBetween Huang and Trie, nearly $4 million in questionable funds were \nraised. Over half of those funds have already been determined to be \nimproper contributions and have appropriately been returned by the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n  This allegation goes to the very heart of the workings of our \nGovernment, and questions must be answered.\n  First would be: What efforts were used by foreign nationals to \ninfluence U.S. policy?\n  Second, to what extent was the U.S. political process infiltrated?\n  Third, ultimately, was the United States compromised at any \nparticular time?\n  Additionally, these hearings will focus on the disturbing use of \nPresident Clinton's perquisites of the Presidency as a fundraising \ntool.\n  Even though Federal law precludes campaign fundraising on Federal \nproperty, the committee has revealed the following information.\n  During the 5 years that President Clinton has resided in the White \nHouse, an astonishing 938 guests have spent the night in the Lincoln \nbedroom.\n  This figure is an unprecedented escalation of past Presidential \npractices.\n  Presidential historian Richard Norton Smith stated that there has \n``never been anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of \nthe White House for fundraising purposes * * * it's the selling of the \nWhite House.''\n  On March 15, 1997, the White House counsel, Lanny Davies, stated, \n``It's fair to say these additional functions at the White House were \nfor the purpose of encouraging support for the President's campaign, \nincluding financial support.''\n  These overnight guests at the Clinton White House donated at least $6 \nmillion to the Democratic National Committee.\n  Additionally, President Clinton hosted some 103 Presidential coffees. \nGuests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon and a Chinese \nbusinessman who heads an arms-trading company, donated some $27 million \nto the Democratic National Committee.\n  White House officials have denied that such events were planned with \nthe intention of raising specific amounts of money. However, President \nClinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes--who will testify before the \ncommittee--recently turned over a large number of documents that show \nfigures for both expected and actual donations from nearly every White \nHouse coffee.\n  Here's a comparison. President Bush hosted one Presidential coffee. \nNo money was raised. And I am told the cost was $6.24 cents.\n  The accuracy of that I will leave to the historians.\n  But, finally, Mr. President, on March 11, 1997, this body voted \nunanimously to hold this investigation.\n  I commend Chairman Thompson for his commitment to Congress and to the \nconstitutional duty of the oversight process; that is, to provide the \nAmerican people with a fair, unfiltered, and bipartisan view of the \n1996 campaign practices. The American public deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been in the chair for the last few \nminutes listening to some of the comments that have been made. I would \nlike to read one paragraph that I saw in yesterday's Wall Street \nJournal.\n  I would like to ask everyone, Mr. President, to listen very \ncarefully, because we are only talking about three of a long list of \nthings that are being investigated right now as far as the alleged \ntransgression of the President.\n  Yesterday's Wall Street Journal has the editorial of which this is \njust one paragraph:\n\n       Travelgate, trumped-up Billy Dale prosecution, the secret \n     health-care task force, the 900 FBI files and bouncer/\n     security chief Craig Livingstone, alerts to the White House \n     from high Treasury officials on Resolution Trust Corporation \n     investigations, the guy who told the congressional committee \n     he lied to his diary, the brightest minds in the Democratic \n     Party suffering massive memory loss at congressional \n     hearings, the ``lost'' Rose Law Firm billing records, Webster \n     Hubbell's passage of the Justice to jail, Vince Foster's \n     torment, the Lincoln Bedroom rented out, Charlie Trie on the \n     run, John Huang taking the fifth, Jim and Susan McDougal \n     convicted, the Buddhist monastery/money laundry, the drug \n     dealers let in for the White House photo-ops, the routinely \n     cavalier treatment of legal and judicial procedures, and \n     independent counsels appointed for three members of the \n     Cabinet, one sitting American President and, for the first \n     time in history, one First Lady.\n       Everyone does it? We don't think so. At least up to now.\n\n  In this long list of alleged transgressions, the investigation right \nnow is really only dealing with three things.\n  It is interesting for me that every time something comes up \nconcerning campaign contributions that have been taken illegally, the \nPresident comes out and says we need campaign finance reform.\n  I would only comment, as did the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski. How do we know that we need reform of campaign contributions \nuntil we live under the laws that we have today?\n  Currently it is illegal--under our current law--to accept foreign \nmoney from foreigners. It is illegal to launder money. It is illegal to \nsolicit or accept money on Federal property.\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\n  That is what this is all about.\n  So I just hope as the debate goes on about campaign finance reform \nthat we adopt an attitude that we should comply with the laws that are \non the books right now and see how far that goes to resolving the \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, I see that there is no other Senator seeking time, so \nI ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as if in morning business \non another matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7035-7", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STORM CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am very honored to be serving as the \nchairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Today at 11 o'clock we will begin again the discussion on the passage \nof the defense authorization bill.\n  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I have jurisdiction over \nthe readiness of our forces to defend America: Such things as military \nconstruction, such things as military pay, such things as training, and \nthe like.\n  In carrying out my responsibilities, I have visited many, many bases \nthroughout the world and here in the United States. I have had occasion \nto be recently in Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base; Fort Hood, TX; Corpus \nChristi Naval Base; and the Dyess Air Force Base.\n  My concern is that with all the people we have talked about and \ntalked to in the committee meetings that we have had in the Readiness \nSubcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we keep getting \nassurances from the administration that we are in a state of readiness \nthat would meet the minimum expectations of the American people, and \nyet the information that we get as we go around certainly contradicts \nthat. We have statements made by a number of people who are in the \nfield. When you get past the top brass here in Washington, we find that \nwe have very, very serious problems.\n  Mr. President, I plan to make several statements concerning this as \nthe development of and discussion on this bill takes place after 11 \no'clock, but I would just suggest that we have not found ourselves and \nput ourselves in a state of readiness that meets the minimum \nexpectations of the American people. The administration has said many \ntimes we are in a position to defend America on two regional fronts, \nand I can assure you that is not the case. In fact, as we watched the \nPersian Gulf war, I regret to say that we are not in a state of \nreadiness today to be able to defend America against that type of \naggression.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would first like to say I appreciate \nthe leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma. Senator Inhofe has done an \noutstanding job in working to preserve the defense of his Nation, and \nhis comments about our lack of preparedness are very serious. I think \nthis body, as a body traditionally considered to be the long-term \nevaluator of national security interests of this Nation, needs to \nlisten to what he says. I thank him for those comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7038-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7038-S7040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INVESTIGATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I rise at this time, Mr. President, to make some \nremarks about the hearings going on in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. I think they are most important hearings. I think it is \nimportant we remember that the committee, headed by the excellent and \nfine Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Fred Thompson, was commissioned by \nthis body. They were mandated by this body to go out and discover the \nfacts and to conduct an investigation of illegal and improper \nactivities in connection with the 1996 political campaigns. So they \nhave a responsibility and a duty that falls to them at this point \nwhether they want it or not, whether they wish they did not have it, \nand they have to see it through and do it in a formal and proper way. I \nthink the committee is at a point where it is not dealing with exact \nscience, but with a process by which that committee needs to go out and \nfind the facts, apply those facts to the law, to decide what actions \nought to be taken and to evaluate it that way.\n  It was by a 99-to-nothing vote that this Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, directed that committee to do its work. And so we ought to \nlet them do their work and let them follow the evidence where it leads, \nto let them apply that evidence to the law and to analyze the results \nand make recommendations for the future.\n  A key part of that investigation is gathering the facts. I served for \n12 years as a U.S. attorney. That was the Federal prosecutor for the \nsouthern district of Alabama. And, as such, I had the duty for many \nyears--to handle major corruption-type cases involving complex white-\ncollar crime, and so I have had a lot of experience in that field.\n  I have not been commenting on this case and the evidence because I \nthink we ought to let the committee do its work. I made one previous \nstatement about this investigation a few weeks ago addressing my \nconcerns to the grant of immunity, and I think we ought to talk about \nthat and a few other things today.\n  This investigation is dealing with a serious question, and that \nquestion is whether or not a foreign nation, not really considered a \nfriendly nation, Communist China, may have systematically and \nintentionally set about to influence the American election in 1996 and, \nin fact, to influence American policy.\n  We know that the President of this United States was a great critic \nof President Bush because he said President Bush was too accommodating \nto China and needed to be more tough in dealing with China. And then, \nafter he becomes President, we know that he now is a leading spokesman \nin this country for accommodation with China.\n  So whatever that is about, the facts in this case will have to tell \nus. But I do think it is clear that we are dealing with unusual types \nof problems with campaign financing. This may not be only a technical \nviolation of the law, but it is a situation in which we may have a \nforeign power, an adversary, a Communist nation, with the largest \nstanding army in the world, attempting to influence elections.\n  We need a bipartisan effort, similar to those conducted in the past. \nWe need the spirit of Howard Baker in the Watergate hearings who, as a \nRepublican, made sure that he cooperated in that investigation and \nsought the truth. We need the spirit of Warren Rudman, Republican, who \nparticipated in the Irangate matters that were investigated here. He \nalways sought to get to the truth regardless of politics. I have not \nseen that, frankly, by some in the leadership in the other party on \nthis committee. It seems to me there has been too much partisanship.\n  Now that those committee hearings are proceeding, they need to \nproceed professionally and objectively and all members need to pull \ntogether to find out the facts and get the truth out.\n  I did want to talk, Mr. President, about the question of immunity. We \nhad the not unusual, if you are familiar with complex prosecutions, \nsituation yesterday when the committee hearings commenced that the \nranking member from the Democratic Party announced that Mr. John Huang, \nwho had been the main focus in the investigation, was prepared to \ntestify if he were granted immunity.\n  I think we have to be very careful about that. In fact, at this \npoint, I would advise the members to say no to immunity at this point \nin the process. There may come a time when immunity is necessary, but \nat this point I do not think it is. That is my experience after many \nyears of prosecuting. You use immunity, first and foremost, to get the \ntestimony of the little fish, to find the people who may know something \nabout the case, and then that helps you develop the real facts of the \ncase and go on to the higher-ups.\n  I was very concerned a few weeks ago--and it is the only comment I \nhave made about this matter since I have been in the body--when members \nof the Democratic Party were refusing to grant immunity to little fish \nin this case. Now that they are talking about one of the top ones, they \nare suggesting that maybe we ought to grant immunity to him, but they \nwere objecting to and questioning the wisdom of granting immunity to \nwhat they called\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\nthe nuns and the priests in the Buddhist temple, those who have taken \nvows of poverty, and they have yet given large contributions to the \nDemocratic campaigns, and the investigators want to ask them questions \nabout where that money came from because there was a clear suggestion \nit was not their money, that somebody had given them that money and \nthen they had taken it and made the contribution, and that would be \ntechnically a crime. And their lawyers were saying, as good lawyers \nwould, ``we will tell you about it but my people didn't understand \nthis; they are not political sophisticates; we will tell you who told \nus; we will tell you who gave us the money; we will tell you who did \nit; but we don't want you to turn around and prosecute us.''\n  So that is the type of circumstance the committee must decide. You \nmay not want to prosecute those people anyway. They may not have \nunderstood what they were doing was against the law. So that is an \nappropriate circumstance for the committee to consider immunity.\n  I thought it was critical and a matter of stonewalling of that \ninvestigation to, across the board, just deny consideration of immunity \nfor those people, and now we are dealing with a situation in which on \nthe first day of the hearings comes the announcement that Mr. Huang, \nunder some complicated theory, would be prepared to testify if he is \ngiven immunity for everything he did except being a spy.\n\n  Well, my observation is that that is not a good way to proceed, and \nthere are several reasons why that is true. First of all, Mr. Huang \nwants to come in and get immunity from the things that it appears there \nmay be such evidence right now to convict him of.\n  That is not a bad deal, if they have evidence to convict you of a \nnumber of crimes. Let us say maybe it is money-laundering or maybe it \nis a violation of the Hatch Act or maybe it is the Ethics in Government \nAct or Illegal Foreign Contributions Act or campaign finance laws, in \nwhich you deliberately run money through someone else's name so that it \nwould appear to come from them and not from someone else. Those kinds \nof things can be violations of the law.\n  The investigators have done a lot of work on this. Perhaps they \nalready know the basic facts, and probably Mr. Huang knows what they \nknow also. So it would not be unusual for a good lawyer representing \nMr. Huang to see if he could not pull a little gambit, if he could come \nin on the first day of the hearings when everybody's attention is \nfocused on other things and announce, if you give me immunity, I will \ntell you what I know, but just remember, I don't need immunity for \nbeing a spy because you don't have the evidence about that perhaps. \nMaybe that is what he is thinking.\n  The context of this thing is very troubling to me. My advice to the \nmembers of that committee would be to be very, very careful about it.\n  There are a number of other things that are troubling to me. You have \nto remember that the grant of immunity can in fact undermine \nprosecutions later. We have to know that the Department of Justice, \neven though those of us on the Senate Judiciary Committee and others \nhave called on the Department of Justice to appoint an independent \nprosecutor and Attorney General Janet Reno has declined to do so, the \nDepartment of Justice is conducting an investigation of Mr. Huang. They \nmay already have evidence which indicates that he has committed crimes \nagainst the United States. And if that is true, then it is a real \nserious thing for the Senate to go through the process of granting him \nimmunity. In fact, I would think it would be very bad at this point; of \nall the people who are most prominently involved in this, who played a \nhigh role--and he was a high Department of Commerce official. These \nproblems are serious. Huang is a major player in the campaign finance \nscandal that we are seeing unfold, and I think he ought not readily be \ngiven any grant of immunity. I think it would undermine the legitimate \nprosecution that could go on later.\n  As a prosecutor, one thing I always tried to avoid was to be in a \nsituation in which I granted immunity to the main crook in the case. If \nyou have five people involved and you need the testimony of some others \nto maybe bring out the details, you do not give that immunity to the \nmain crook. You do not give immunity to the person you have the most \nevidence against already.\n  That does not make sense. I think that this is a gambit, this is an \nattempt to rush in here while this committee has a well-planned \nschedule to bring in the evidence that is in existence about this \nscandal and to bring it all to the fore, to disrupt that process.\n  The committee ought to stay the course. They ought to bring in the \nevidence from every source, and when they have all the evidence brought \nin, they then ought to objectively, coolly and professionally consider \nwhether or not Mr. Huang deserves immunity, but until then I say no. I \nthink we ought to be very careful about this process. It is a very \nserious thing.\n  Finally, let me just say that this process is important. The people \nof this country are entitled to know that there has been an objective \nand thorough evaluation of the allegations that have been so \nprominently talked about here. I think that is important. I think \nAmericans expect that. They would be concerned, rightly, if one of the \nprimary persons alleged to be involved in wrongdoing who could have \nbeen involved in maybe a half a dozen different criminal activities, \nwere to be given immunity at the very beginning of these hearings, and \ntherefore perhaps end up with a situation in which you have \nprosecutions against lesser offenders and the main culprit goes free. \nThat is a very serious matter. And sometimes in America, as one writer \nsaid a number of years ago, we suffer from a colossal inability to \ndiscriminate among levels of wrongdoing.\n  I would say to you that if some of the facts here turn out to be \ntrue, we are dealing with a very serious violation of American law and \ncampaign procedures involving millions of dollars, involving a \nCommunist nation, a Communist power attempting to influence this \nNation. I think that committee has to see it through. They have to get \nthe facts and call the shots, no matter what the consequences.\n  Mr. President, I salute the leadership of Senator Thompson and others \non that committee. I believe they are doing a good job and I am \nconfident that the truth will come out. I believe in this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak not to \nexceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time set aside for Senator Mack has \nexpired. This is morning business. Without objection, the Senator may \nproceed.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the entire legitimacy of this body and the \nHouse of Representatives, of the Presidency and of the administration, \ndepends upon its members, in the case of the Presidency the President \nhimself, having been freely chosen by the American people in an \nelection campaign conducted under certain rules consistent with the \nstatutes and the Constitution of the United States. It is a set of \nserious allegations about violations of those existing rules that is at \nthe heart of the investigation now being conducted by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  There are many who say the rules ought to be changed, and there can \nbe legitimate debate over how much and in what direction those election \ncampaign rules ought to be changed. The issue here and now, however, \narises under the current rules, arises under serious allegations about \nviolations of those current rules: The Hatch Act, the misuse of the \nWhite House, the use of covert foreign contributions to affect the \noutcome of the elections, money laundering, and a number of other \nviolations of what the laws relating to the election of the President \nof the United States are right now. In this connection we have the \nunfortunate spectacle that many--most of the key witnesses, of those \nwho know the facts, of those who participated in the alleged \nviolations, have either hidden themselves overseas beyond the reach of \nany subpoena or have stated that they will exercise their fifth \namendment rights and will refuse to testify unless they are immunized \nagainst the very offenses which so clouded last year's Presidential \nelection. In that connection, we have the regrettable response, a \nresponse almost without precedent, on\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\nthe part of one of the parties, that finding these witnesses is a \nRepublican problem, that grants of immunity to minor participants will \nnot be approved. How markedly, how strikingly this contrasts with the \ninvestigation of Watergate, with Iran-Contra, in which the party whose \nactions were being investigated cooperated fully in attempting to \ndetermine the truth of these allegations.\n\n  As we all recognize the vital importance of free and open and fair \nelections conducted in accordance with the rules, so, it seems to me, \nwe must all recognize the importance of determining whether or not \nthere were serious violations of those existing laws, because if we \ncannot enforce the law as it exists today, what point is there in \ndebating whether or not we ought to change and tighten those laws? We \nneed the investigations that are being conducted, both here in the \nSenate of the United States and in the House of Representatives today, \nto cast light on what actually took place during the course of last \nyear.\n  We asked for a special prosecutor. We needed the Department of \nJustice in order to determine whether or not there were criminal \nviolations that should be prosecuted in the criminal courts of the \nUnited States. But the classic justification, the rationale for this \nSenate investigation is the determination of facts: The breadth and \nextent of the violations of law that took place last year, who the \nviolators were, what consequences the committee of the Senate feels \nshould stem from those violations, and then and only then whether or \nnot there should be additional laws applicable to the next set of \nelections. This inquiry and this investigation is of vital importance \nto the American people. The American people deserve to know precisely \nwhat took place during the course of the 1996 Presidential election \ncampaign, on both sides; the breadth and the extent of violations of \nlaw, who violated the law, and who knew about and benefited from those \nviolations.\n  I call on all of the Members of the Senate to cooperate to the \nfullest possible extent in the determination of those facts and express \nmy hope that the results of this investigation will be enlightenment \nand far better practices in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee began his hearings on the alleged political campaign \nfinance irregularities of 1996. After all that has been written and \nreported in the press and elsewhere, it is time. Even before these \nhearings, a lot of facts are already known and how much more these \nhearings will reveal yet has to be seen. Knowing all the roadblocks \nthat could be posed in these hearings and these investigations, they \nmay reveal very little, or we may be surprised at some of the findings. \nNonetheless, the hearings must move forward. This body and the other \nbody, the House of Representatives, has the unsavory duty to \ninvestigate, reveal and inform the American people. I know no one in \neither Chamber relishes this assignment. To some it tends to polarize, \nand to some it confirms what they have already known.\n  John Quincy Adams, who returned to the House of Representatives after \nserving as President of the United States, in a heated debate over \nslavery, of which he was an ardent opponent, said, ``Duty is ours; \nresults are God's.''\n  The nature of these hearings is different, especially when we talk \nabout campaign financing. This one involves foreign entities attempting \nto politically infiltrate the American system. That is the concern of \nall Americans and in particular those of us who have taken the oath to \nuphold and defend the Constitution of the United States in face of \nforeign and domestic assault. To do otherwise is just not accepting our \nsworn duty and our obligation to the American people.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville, author of ``Democracy in America,'' way back \nin the early 1800's, wrote that America is great because America is \ngood. When America ceases to be good, it will cease to be great. That \nis as true today as it was then.\n  The alleged violations of the 1996 campaign did not start just in \n1997. One must remember, back in the fall of 1996, about mid-October, \nwhen the Democratic National Committee failed to file its campaign \nreport with the Federal Election Commission--some excuse that the \naccountants did not have it ready or it was not ready to go. In fact, I \ndon't recall whether it was filed at all until the elections were over \nin 1996. The point is, could full disclosure be working if there were \nobvious irregularities? If there were, did they take the attitude, \n``Why should we file?'' Were there campaign activities that could prove \nembarrassing right before the election? And I would ask, is that not \nthe main purpose of the present laws, full disclosure--full and timely \ndisclosure of campaign activities? Maybe the present law is working. \nMaybe, under the present law, we know what we know today. We must \nponder that.\n\n  The China connection has lots of us concerned. In fact, Americans \nshould be outraged at such an allegation, let alone proof. What was \ngoing on when John Huang received top security clearance without even a \nbackground check, 5 months before he began working at the Commerce \nDepartment? Why did this person still have a security clearance when he \nbegan working at the DNC? Why did John Huang attend over 100 classified \nbriefings, hold 95 meetings at the White House, have frequent access to \nthe President of the United States? I want to know that. I want to know \nwhy it was allowed to happen. The American people deserve to know. And \nwe have the duty to inform them.\n  It is apparent that inquiry is necessary because it seems to me that \nthis administration was willing to do whatever it took to win an \nelection. The facts that we know now--not allegations but facts--tell \nus that they broke current and existing laws. Are they above the law? I \ndon't believe so--as none of us are. They inadvertently allowed our \nnational security to be compromised? One has to question that.\n  So, the Governmental Affairs Committee is fulfilling a constitutional \nresponsibility by conducting oversight to find out whether the current \nlaws have been adhered to, of which we know some of them were not.\n  It is their duty to discover what laws were broken, and then we can \ndecide what can be done to improve enforcement of those laws.\n  This is about money laundering, illegal foreign contributions and \nunlawful receipts of campaign funds within Federal buildings. There is \ncredible evidence out there that indicates this administration was \nengaged in all of these violations.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that these hearings will get all the \nfacts out in the open for the American people. I commend Senator \nThompson and committee members for assuming that responsibility. It is \nan awesome responsibility and one that is not taken lightly by any \nMember of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of Representatives. It is \ntime that we proceed to get this out in the open and let the American \npeople judge what is right and what is wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7038-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7040-S7041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to offer some brief comments, \nif I may, regarding a good friend to many of us here who will be \nreturning to his country in the next few days. I speak of Dermot A. \nGallagher, Mr. President, the current Ambassador of Ireland to the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, Dermot Gallagher can leave the United States with \npride in the work that he has done for his Government and his country.\n  I have had the privilege, Mr. President, of working closely with \nDermot over the last 6 years, as many of us have. It has been an \nextremely positive experience, and I have come to consider Dermot not \nonly a competent diplomat, but a good friend, and a good friend to this \ncountry. Without doubt, Dermot Gallagher is a consummate professional, \nan able and talented diplomat, and an individual who has served his \ncountry with skill and grace. And in no small measure, he has been \nassisted in that process by his lovely wife Maeve who has been a \npartner in this endeavor of theirs over the last number of years.\n  It goes without saying that Ambassador Gallagher has had an \nextraordinarily busy and productive tenure as Ireland's Ambassador in \nWashington. From early 1994 until the present, Ireland, and \nparticularly the Northern Ireland peace process, have been front-burner \nissues for the Irish, the British, and our own Government.\n  Naturally, Dermot Gallagher has been in the thick of all of it. He \nhas been an effective spokesman for his Government with the State \nDepartment, the White House, and the Congress. He has also been \nenormously helpful, I might point out, Mr. President, to those of us \nwho have been actively involved in trying to get the peace process back \non track in that country following the tragic decision of the IRA last \nyear to break the August 1994 cease-fire.\n  Ambassador Gallagher may be returning home to Dublin, but I am \nconfident he will remain actively involved in many of the same issues \nwith which he has become so intimately knowledgeable. I say this \nbecause Ambassador Gallagher will be returning to Dublin to assume the \nposition of Second Secretary General within the Department of Foreign \nAffairs, where he will continue to play a major role in Anglo-Irish \nissues, especially in the Northern Ireland peace process.\n  Given the recent events in Drumcree, where once again violence \nerupted, Mr. President, in connection with the annual Orange Order \nparade season, he will have his work cut out for him. Dermot will play \na critical role in advising the newly elected Irish prime minister, \nBertie Ahern, on the most effective policies for the Irish Government \nto pursue in order to restore a climate of trust, peace, and \nreinvigorate the currently stalled peace process.\n  So, Mr. President, I know again I speak for all of my colleagues here \nwhen I bid Ambassador Gallagher and his wife Maeve and their family a \nfarewell and a thank you for a job very well done. We continue to look \nforward to working with him in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7041-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7041-S7042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEVELOPMENTS IN CAMBODIA CAUSE FOR CONCERN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for those of us who follow events in \nSoutheast Asia closely, recent developments in Cambodia are a cause for \ngreat concern.\n  The coup d'etat--and, yes, I employ that term even if the Department \nof State, for broader foreign policy reasons, does not--staged this \nweek by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen is a terrible setback for that \nstrife-torn country. Tragically, the expression by Mao Tse-Tung that \n``power grows out of the barrel of a gun'' applies nowhere more so than \nCambodia. A peace process initiated in 1991, culminating in the Paris \npeace accords, and manifested most significantly in the 1993 elections \nis dying.\n  The investment in that country since the signing of the 1991 accord \nby the international community of more than $3 billion, including $160 \nmillion from the United States, has clearly failed to eliminate from \nCambodia the intertwining of politics and violence. The removal from \npower of the Khmer Rouge, one of the most vicious guerrilla movements \nin history--the very people for whom Cambodia has become synonymous \nwith the image of bloodshed on a monumental scale--has not eliminated \nfrom the minds of Cambodia's leaders the notion of ``power from the \nbarrel of a gun.''\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter in Congress of facilitating \nthe development of normal political and economic relationships with \nformer adversaries in the Far East. I supported the opening of \ndiplomatic relations with Vietnam and the extension of most-favored-\nnation trade status to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. With many other \nMembers of Congress, I have invested considerable time and effort to \nhelping secure a peaceful and prosperous future for a region that has \nknown decades of warfare unimaginable to most Americans. I can only now \nfear for the future. The coup by Hun Sen represents a reversal of \nfortune that will prove, I fear, extremely difficult to resolve. The \nculture of violence that dominates major factions in Cambodia is alive \nand well and once again in power.\n  The response to the coup by the Clinton administration is \nunderstandably tempered by the knowledge that we will have to deal with \nthe new regime as a simple fact of life, as well as within a broader \nregional context. It is that regional context that worries me as much \nas the developments inside Cambodia. The visit by Hun Sen to Hanoi \nimmediately prior to his takeover of Phnom Penh sends a chilling \nmessage to those of us concerned about the region's future. Whether \nVietnam is culpable in the events in Cambodia is an issue that demands, \nand presumably will receive, serious attention.\n  The American public remains extraordinarily wary of any involvement \nby this country in Southeast Asia. That is understandable given the \nhistory of United States involvement there as well as memories of the \nyears of terror in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. That concern cannot \nand should not be ignored. That is why I was never under any doubt \nabout the popularity of some of my positions with regard to Southeast \nAsia. The United States, however, must remain engaged there. It cannot \nturn its back on a region of great importance to the entire Far East. \nConflict in Indochina, during a period when countries circle each other \nwarily over specks in the South China Sea that may or may not be rich \nin oil and natural gas, can easily have wider implications. We must \nwork to bring peace and stability to Southeast Asia. Both morally and \npractically, we must stay engaged.\n\n  I have met a number of times in the past with Hun Sen. He is a tough \nindividual not vulnerable to intimidation. He is capable of acting as \nruthlessly as he deems necessary. His troops have actively sought out \nMembers of Cambodia's elected Parliament with the clear intent of \nimprisoning those who oppose him and incorporating into his movement \nthose who do not. Cambodia's interior minister was captured and \nexecuted. Sam Rainsy, president of the Khmer National Party and a \nfriend of some of ours, expressed the situation appropriately when he \nasked, only partly rhetorically,\n\n       On what ground, following what rule, what law, what article \n     of the Constitution, what legal procedure can the Second \n     Prime Minister unilaterally ``dismiss'' the First Prime \n     Minister . . . (O)nly with the backing of his tanks Hun Sen \n     gave to himself the right to dismiss the First Prime Minister \n     and to announce the formation of a new government.\n\n  A reign of terror has been launched and a shadow has fallen over a \ncountry now known more for its violence than its awesome natural \nbeauty. Gunfire around the Angkor Wat Temple, revered by Buddhism and \nuniversally identified with solemnity, provides a sad contrast that \nillustrates all too well the tragic fate of Cambodia. The international \ncommunity, which invested so much time, energy, prestige, and money in \nestablishing in Cambodia a democratic form of government and the \nopportunity for the same peaceful and prosperous future enjoyed by so \nmany of Asia's countries, can be forgiven if it does not attempt a \nrepeat of its efforts earlier this decade.\n  The United States should, I believe, work to resolve this crisis and \nrepair the damage. I would be hard-pressed at\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nthe moment, however, to argue on behalf of foreign assistance for \nCambodia while a government that took power via coup d'etat rules in \nPhnom Penh and the ousted FUNCINPEC party negotiates in the northwest \nwith the Khmer Rouge. The administration must communicate more \nforcefully than it has to date to Hun Sen that his actions are \nunacceptable and it must meet with Prince Ranariddh while he is here in \nWashington at the highest possible level of government to convey our \ncontinued support for the democratically-elected government that was \nousted. It must be reiterated that Hun Sen was made Second Prime \nMinister and the Cambodian People's Party given a sizable \nrepresentation in Parliament not because of its popular support, which \nit lacks, but because of its history of extreme violence and \nwillingness to employ that violence to attain its objectives. It must \nbe illuminated the degree to which the international community bent \nover backward and the Cambodian people's interests sacrificed in order \nto bring the CPP into the coalition that was torn apart by the coup.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy that is Cambodia continues. The Senate as \na body, the Congress as an institution, and the administration as this \ncountry's representative abroad must communicate the message that the \nrecent events in Cambodia represent a reversal that cannot be accepted \nwithout a price. I, for one, stand ready to do my part.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now back on the defense \nauthorization bill, S. 936. We are ready to take up amendments. I want \nto inform my colleagues, if you have an amendment, come to the floor \nand present it. We are ready to act on these amendments. We have to \nfinish this bill this week. We have lots of amendments. If you want \nyour amendment acted on, you better come to the floor and see about it, \notherwise we are going to proceed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on one of the most \nimportant authorization bills to be debated by the Senate each year, \nthe defense authorization bill. In fact, if you consider that the first \nduty of government is to assure the life and freedom of its people, \nthen this is the most important authorization bill we will take up this \nyear.\n  Our debate, like most of what we do on this floor, will eventually \nproduce a law. In our democracy, Mr. President, law is really our \ncollective national imagining of how something should be. In this \ndebate, America imagines its Armed Forces and crafts a law that \nauthorizes their existence and shapes them to their tasks. This law has \nglobal reach and global consequences; so we should approach this debate \nwith seriousness, with respect for those who serve, and respect toward \nthose who wrestle with these issues on a daily basis.\n  Deserving respect in the latter category are our colleagues who serve \non the Armed Services Committee. They have produced a good bill, on \nbalance, and they have done an exceptionally difficult task in putting \ntogether this legislation because they have to consider not only the \nthreats to the Nation and the nonnegotiable requirements to repel those \nthreats today, but also to support the force that is already deployed, \nas they are in Bosnia. They also face tough budget limitations, along \nwith the demands of competing bureaucracies and those in the private \nsector who supply equipment and services for defense. Our colleagues on \nthe Armed Services Committee must balance near-term with long-term, \nreadiness with research, and through it all keep their eyes focused on \nthe overall good of protecting the Nation. Mr. President, I thank them \nfor taking on this tough task and producing such a good product. I \nespecially thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan for their fine work on this \nlegislation.\n  National strategy should be the basis for our consideration of the \nDefense authorization, and strategy is illuminated by history. We have \na history, in the aftermath of decisive military involvement overseas, \nof withdrawing from foreign commitments. The surest sign of our \nwithdrawal has always been the deep reduction of our Armed Forces. \nAfter World War I, we listened to our isolationist instincts, refused \nto join the League of Nations which our own President had created, and \ncut our military to the bare bones. Absent our leadership, Europe and \nAsia developed into a conflict which killed 50 million people--a \nconflict which only renewed American engagement could win. Again, after \nWorld War II, we deeply cut our military, only to be shocked into \nrearmament by the initial victories of Communist forces in Korea--\nforces which might well have been deterred had we kept our forces \ncapable. Again, after Vietnam we deeply cut our forces but fortunately \nrebuilt them when it became clear that our military was less capable \nthan our national strategy required. We wisely rearmed and created a \nforce which outlasted the Soviet Union and won a historic victory in \nthe cold war.\n  The clear lessons of history are: Stay engaged in the world and keep \nour Armed Forces congruent with the national strategy and with the \nthreats we\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nface. In other words, we should not withdraw from the world--we should \ncontinue to lead, and an essential component of leadership is Armed \nForces who can do what our strategy requires. Keeping those forces \ncapable means sizing and shaping and equipping them to deal with the \nthreats of today and tomorrow, changing and improving them so they can \nachieve their purpose.\n  Our forces have an overriding purpose: To defend the Nation. But they \nalso have subsidiary purposes: To defend our national interests and to \nsupport the stability which shields prosperity and democracy. We \nAmericans also expect our military to do more than just national \ndefense. We expect them to maintain and embody our national leadership. \nWe expect them to be the agent of America's desire to lead a response \nto anarchy or famine or other instances in which American values call \nfor action. These are the American values the world loves and depends \non, and our military delivers on them.\n  No other country on Earth has such a set of purposes for its armed \nforces, and no other country has the multifaceted, action-oriented, \ntake-charge people in its military who can accomplish any or all of \nthese purposes and think outside the box to do it better. Developing \nand nurturing such people is yet another essential task of our Armed \nForces.\n  The military that can answer the tall orders we place it cannot be a \nstatic institution, and our is not. It is not a status quo force. Some \nfail to see it, but in fact the U.S. military has become significantly \nsmaller since the cold war. In 1990, there were 2,069,000 active duty \nservice members. This bill authorizes 1,431,000 for fiscal year 1998. \nIn 1990, there were 18 active Army divisions and 10 divisions in the \nArmy National Guard. This bill authorizes 10 and 8 divisions, \nrespectively, for fiscal year 1998. The number of Navy aircraft \ncarriers has gone from 15--and 1 for training--to 22 and 1. Battle \nforce ships have gone from 546 to 346. Air Force fighter wings have \ngone from 24 active and 12 reserve to 13 active and 7 reserve. My point \nis not to argue with these reductions, which made sense in terms of the \nthreats and our commitments, but to note they occurred, and also to \nnote they have been traumatic, not just for the communities in which \nthey are located, but also for the services themselves.\n  Let me add parenthetically, whatever the size of our forces, they \nshould be supported by logistics and infrastructure that reflects their \nsize. If our forces get smaller, we should not retain unneeded military \nbasis. I, therefore, support the distinguished ranking member's \namendment to initiate a new base closure process. The money we can save \non excess bases is a matter for debate, but excess bases hurt readiness \nregardless of money because they add requirements for our most precious \nresource: personnel.\n\n  Too much of what passes for strategic decisionmaking in defense these \ndays is really about money. In my view, money is an issue only after \nyou decide on a strategy and the military component of the strategy. \nThe lesson of the cold war is, if we need something military to protect \nour country and achieve our strategic goal, we will pay for it, \nwhatever the cost. In examining this bill and our strategic direction, \nsaving money is not my highest priority. In fact, I don't think we \nspend too much on defense, given our global responsibilities and the \nsize of our economy.\n  My question is whether we are spending it on the right things. We can \nanswer it by reviewing the threats we are facing and will face in the \nfuture.\n  The top threat, the only threat that can instantly extinguish our \nnational life and the lives of scores of millions of our citizens, is \nRussian nuclear weapons. The mission of U.S. Strategic Command is as \nessential as ever. It is the fashion to consign the cold war to the \nhistoric past, and Russia today is a friendly country. Indeed, the \ngrowth of prosperity and democracy in a friendly, peaceful Russia ought \nto be at the top of our strategic priorities--the potential for such a \nRussia is one of the principal fruits of the cold war. Conversely, a \npoor, unstable, chaotic Russia threatens our security because the \ncommand and control of nuclear weapons could be weakened. The \nlikelihood of accidental launch or leakage of fissile materials into \nthe hands of criminals or terrorists is increased. No aspect of the \nproliferation problem is more potentially threatening than the \npossibility that Russian fissile materials get into the wrong hands.\n  The Armed Services Committee has understood the connection between \nRussian nuclear surety and our own national security. The Nunn-Lugar \nprograms are proof of that understanding and the strategic vision of \nthose two statesmen and many of their colleagues. The cuts made in \nthose programs in this bill suggest we may have briefly lost sight of \nthat vision, and I will join with the Senator from Michigan in seeking \nto restore the requested levels.\n  Russian nuclear weapons are an inescapable, obvious part of our \nstrategic reality. We also face a serious threat of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction to rogue States, countries like Iraq, Iran, \nLibya, and North Korea. One appropriate response to the threat from \nthese countries, when the threat matures and becomes specific, is \nmissile defense. But there are other responses that should not wait, \nincluding advanced research and development on the detection and \ntargeting of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Our global \nresponsibilities could propel us with little warning into a conflict in \nwhich these weapons, the so-called poor man's nuclear weapons, are \npresent, just as we now know they were during the gulf war.\n  A third threat is the conventional capabilities of potentially \nhostile states, and analysis suggests to me these capabilities are in \nbroad decline around the world, just as are the conventional \ncapabilities of many allies. Most countries can stage a decent military \nparade. But there are few who can sustain ground combat operations or \nan air campaign lasting more than a few days.\n  Recent history, and I am thinking especially of the performance of \nnon-United States NATO forces in the earlier UNPROFOR stage of Bosnia, \nshows there are not many armies willing to even engage in ground combat \nunless United States troops are in action alongside them. Likewise, the \nRussian invasion of Chechnya several years ago seemed to me to be a \nrepeated instance of Russian troops who would not leave the safety of \ntheir armored vehicles and their artillery positions to fight on the \nground. The Russians blew up a lot of things from a distance but they \ndid not win the war.\n  I am most grateful American soldiers and marines still have the \nwarrior spirit and have it in abundance, but I think we should \nrecognize that this spirit, at least at this time in history, is far \nfrom universal. There are many armed people in the world who are \nwilling to fight, but not generally on behalf of governments. The \nforeigners who are eager for a fight are likelier to be with Hizbollah \nor the PKK than with an established government. This reality, which may \nbe only a temporary condition, should be reflected in how we shape our \nforces. We may be overstressing the likelihood of conventional conflict \nand understressing the unconventional, although the latter may be more \nlikely. Let me add that unconventional operations have not been our \nforte, historically. As the nation-state declines in many regions and \ndissolves altogether in some parts of Africa, the potential for \nunconventional operations by U.S. forces grows larger.\n  Conventional naval threats also appear to be in decline. Certainly \nthere are no naval forces in the world remotely close to ours in either \nsize or capability. The Russian Navy is experiencing severe problems \njust in paying and feeding its sailors, much less getting underway. At \nleast temporarily, we may have the world's last real navy. But the \ngradual emergence of the navies of developing powers like China and \nIndia present a more distant threat that bears watching. At the other \nend of the spectrum, unconventional and shore-based attacks on our \nwarships are already a threat to our forces which, as in the Persian \nGulf, must come close to hostile coasts to maintain regional stability.\n  Our global responsibilities, in the opinion of the administration, \nrequire us to be prepared to fight simultaneously in two major regional \ncontingencies. Looking at the situation in North Korea, a regime which \nwas described to the Intelligence Committee\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nin open session earlier this year by Lt. Gen. Pat Hughes, the Director \nof Defense Intelligence, as ``terminal,'' I respectfully disagree with \nthe two MRC assumption. I think the likeliest near term possibility is \nfor a combination of one major and several minor simultaneous \ncontingencies which could be inconveniently located in terms of our \nlogistics structure. In my view, the soundest investment we could make \nis more airlift so we can rapidly force a favorable outcome in these \ncontingencies, and better sealift to sustain them.\n  As we take on new international responsibilities our military should \nbe appropriately tasked and shaped to carry them out. I note the Senate \nwill soon consider the expansion of NATO. Our most significant new \nresponsibility from this policy decision will be to be prepared to \ndefend the eastern border of Poland. That is the guarantee we will \nmake. It will not be a meaningful guarantee unless U.S. military forces \nare dedicated for this mission and train for it, and for all the \nlogistic support which will also be required. I have yet to learn how \nthis commitment, if we make it, will affect our force structure and \nwhat it will cost.\n  Every human environment is a potential military target or theater of \nconflict, and that includes the new environment of cyberspace, an \nenvironment which is essential to our national security and yet is an \nenvironment without international borders or government controls. If we \nare to defend our communications systems, our transportation systems, \nour power transmission systems, our medical care delivery systems, we \nmust defend our national information environment, our public networks. \nRobust encryption is an essential part of the defense of this \nenvironment as well as its assured, secure use by consumers, the \nprivate sector, and Government. The Secure Public Networks Act, which \nSenator McCain and I and others have introduced, aims to make set a \nglobal as well as a national standard for secure public networks. Our \nbill serves national defense as well as our commercial interest, and I \ncommend it to my colleagues.\n   Mr. President, as the threats and the environments change, it is our \nduty, as well as that of the administration, to ask ourselves if our \nforces are designed and equipped in the light of today's and tomorrow's \nreality. What is the likelihood that our Army will have to conduct \nlarge-scale armored operations against an enemy like the Iraqis of \n1991? Is the aircraft carrier the optimum fire support or air supremacy \nsystem in areas where we are denied access to airfields? What is the \nlikelihood of a major amphibious assault in today's world, or a mass \ntactical parachute jump? What are the tactics and platforms best suited \nto achieve rapid, overwhelming victory today and tomorrow?\n  We have in our military officers who can answer these and many other \nquestions essential to formulating the future of our forces. Our \nmilitary education system trains officers to think outside the box. \nWill their political masters in the Pentagon and White House let them? \nAre we in Congress open to real change or does it present political \nrisk to us that we would rather not face?\n  In the past, we have only made major positive changes in our military \nunder the pressure of external threats. Now we have the opportunity to \ndo it for ourselves. The seriousness of the tasks we assign to our \nmilitary, and the quality and spirit of those who serve and who are \nwilling--even enthusiastic--about going into danger for the rest of us, \ndemand no less.\n  Again, Mr. President, I commend both the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the distinguished senior Senator from South \nCarolina, and the Senator from Michigan, the ranking member of this \ncommittee, for their very constructive and important work. They have \nproduced a good piece of legislation. There are some changes that I \nwould like to make with their support, especially of the ranking \nmember. But overall they have kept the faith with the people of this \nNation and produced a piece of legislation that, if enacted, will \nenable the United States of America to continue to be safe and secure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from \nNebraska, who incidentally is the only Member of Congress who is a \nCongressional Medal of Honor winner, for the excellent statement he \njust made. It will be very beneficial to the country to hear a \nstatement like that.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, while I am on my feet, I ask unanimous consent that \nRon Moranville, a legislative fellow on Senator McCain's staff, be \ngranted privileges of the floor during the debate of S. 936.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Nebraska is still on \nthe floor, I want to add my voice to my good friend, the chairman of \nour committee, for his comments about the Senator's remarks. I only \nwish that every Member of the U.S. Senate could have been here to hear \nthe Senator from Nebraska.\n\n  It is a comprehensive statement. It is thorough. It is intellectually \nsolid. It is based, most importantly, on experience. There are some \ntimes theoretical statements that we hear that do not have that kind of \na base and experience.\n  The Senator talked about old values of this country and new threats. \nHe set forth what these new challenges and new threats are. But he also \nunderpinned our commitment as we hope to reflect in this bill with his \nhelp the old values which he has so superbly represented throughout his \nlife.\n  I just simply want to thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \ncommitment, for his dedication, for his patriotism, and for taking the \ntime to set forth in a document, as he did this morning, and in \nspeeches he gave this morning, some of the most critical challenges \nthat this Nation faces.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me not miss this opportunity to join \nour chairman and ranking member in saying good things about our dear \nfriend from Nebraska. I am glad I was over and got to hear part of his \nspeech.\n  Mr. President, I have waited until we got to a lull in consideration \nof amendments to come over today and talk about an issue which is very \nimportant to me and to my State. But I think more importantly it is \nvery important to our national security, and it is very important to \nthe American taxpayer who is intimately involved in all of these \nconsiderations as the ultimate payer for all that we undertake.\n  I want to apologize in advance to my colleagues because I want to \ncover a series of issues here that are related to base closing and \nprivatization.\n  We have had a protracted debate in the House of Representatives, most \nof which I would have to say I believe is based on a view of the facts \nthat do not comport with my view, and I think don't comport with the \nfacts. I think it is very important at least to have on record at one \nplace as we enter into the debate, which ultimately will occur in \nconference, on what this whole issue is about and what it is not about, \nbecause I want our colleagues to know that this is not a dispute among \nSenators that are simply representing the views and interests of their \nStates.\n  In my mind this is about a fundamental issue. I think when you cut \nthrough all of the rhetoric, when you separate out all of the random \nfacts that are out there in the debate, that the ultimate issue is, do \nyou believe in competition? Do you believe the taxpayer benefits from \ncompetition with a lower price? And do you believe that competition \nproduces quality and excellence? If you do, you are for it. If you do \nnot, you are against it. And it is my belief that these decisions about \nprivatization ought to be made on that basis.\n  Having thrown a bunch of ideas out there that to any listener not \ninvolved in this sounds to be random, let me go back to the beginning, \nback to the 1995 Base Closing Commission report, and then come forward \nto the present, to the House action and where we are today, and \nbasically try to set this whole thing in the context of facts. So let \nme begin with the base closing report.\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\n  As our colleagues are painfully aware--and especially if they \nrepresent a State as I do where bases have been closed--we adopted a \nbill establishing a commission to close military bases that were no \nlonger needed. I was a principal cosponsor of that bill. I supported \nit. I have voted for each of the recommendations of the Base Closing \nCommission including the recommendations that closed five military \nbases in my State. I am committed to continuing the base closing \nprocess. I will be one of the Senators, assuming that Senator McCain \nand I can work out some language differences, who will be cosponsoring \nSenator McCain's amendment to reinstitute the Base Closing Commission.\n  So I do not want anybody to be the least bit confused. I am in favor \nof closing military bases to reduce the overhead that we have which is \nliterally starving national defense, and in the process threatens our \nmodernization and threatens our ability to maintain the pay and \nbenefits that have allowed us to recruit and retain the finest young \nmen and women who have ever worn the uniform of this country.\n\n  I intend, assuming that we can work out these minor language \ndifferences, to cosponsor the McCain amendment to reinstitute base \nclosing, though it is very unpopular in my State, and very unpopular in \nthe country. The bottom line is we have cut national defense spending \nby over a third, and we have closed only 18 percent of the military \nbases.\n  We have a huge overhang from the cold war in the bureaucracy in \nWashington, around the world, and in our own country, which makes \nabsolutely no sense. We have more nurses in Europe than we have combat \ninfantry officers in Europe. We have a huge overhang of resources, \nfacilities, production capacity, and bureaucracy that ultimately have \nto be pared down to meet the defense needs of the Nation. And while I \nam not happy about doing it, while I worry that more military bases in \nmy State will be closed, I am for it because I think the national \ninterest dictates it.\n  I also believe it is a tragedy that cannot be avoided that the very \ncommunities whose support allowed us to operate military bases and \nfacilities that won the cold war and tore down the Berlin Wall and \nliberated Eastern Europe and transformed the world are the very \ncommunities that end up being hurt by this process. But the alternative \nto this process is that we end up with a huge bureaucracy where we are \nspending our money to maintain facilities rather than to maintain \ndefense. We have in terms of our ``tiger,'' so to speak, our military \nstrength today, too little tooth and too much tail. That is what the \nBase Closing Commission is about.\n  Having said all of that, let me go back to the Base Closing \nCommission Report of 1995. I want to talk about a base in my State. And \nthen from that I want to discuss this whole issue because I have never \nheard a debate since I have been here that has been more confused on \nwhat the real issues are than this debate about privatization.\n  Let me take you back to 1995. We are in the process of moving toward \ncongressional and Presidential elections. The Base Closing Commission \nrecommends, among other things, closing Kelly Air Force Base in San \nAntonio, TX, a huge facility with 14,000 employees. And they recommend \ntwo options. I want to read from the Base Closure Commission report, \nbecause one of the assertions that has been made in all this debate is \nthat the President is trying to use politics to overcome the \nrecommendation of the Base Closure Commission. There is only one \nproblem with that assertion, and that is it is not true.\n\n  Now, when the Base Closure Commission in 1995 closed Kelly, they had \ntwo recommendations as to what to do. One was consolidate the workload \nto other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as \ndetermined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council. In other words, \nthe recommendation was to close Kelly Air Force Base and then either \ntransfer its functions to another depot or put them out for private \nbids, and if under the procedures established by the Defense Depot \nMaintenance Council it is cheaper to do it in the private sector than \nto transfer it to a depot, DOD could do it that way.\n  Now, this is not me talking; this is not what I am in favor of. This \nis what was recommended by the Base Closure Commission.\n  Now, it does get confusing after that. You have a base closed, a big \nmaintenance facility in California, and you have a big maintenance \nfacility in Texas closed, Kelly Air Force Base, and President Clinton \nis running for reelection. Obviously, people in California are not \nhappy about the base closing. Obviously, people in Texas are not happy \nabout it. So what do you expect the President to do? Do you expect him \nto go around and say this is great? What the President did, which I \nwould have to say 9 out of 10 politicians would have done, including \nmany people on my side of the aisle, is he went out of his way to say, \nwell, look, all is not lost. Maybe we can privatize some of these \nfunctions in facilities that are currently at McClellan or currently at \nKelly. In other words, the President, in campaigning, did what any \npolitician would do. He took the options of the Base Closure Commission \nand wrapped them in as pretty a package as we could wrap them and led \npeople to believe that he somehow was going to support ``privatizing \nthese functions in place,'' which was a term that he used.\n  Now, those who oppose competition based on price and quality have \nseized on what the President did during the campaign and claimed that \nsomehow that violated the principles of the Base Closure Commission. It \nseems to me that as politicians we are all familiar, intimately \nfamiliar, practiced, in fact, in the skill of taking bad news and \nputting as pretty a face on it as you can. And what the President did \nall through the campaign in voter-rich California and Texas, two big \nStates with huge electoral votes, is he talked about the potential for \nprivatization. But I want to remind my colleagues that the President \nsigned the Base Closure Commission report. We had some effort in my \nState to try to encourage the President not to sign the Base Closure \nCommission report. I am proud to say that I rejected it, refused to \nparticipate in it and thought the President had no choice, and in the \nend he did not.\n  But to somehow assert, as has been done in the debate in the House \nand to some extent here, that the President has tampered with the \nprocess by trying to put a pretty face on a corpse is just not fair, \nand it misleads people about this whole debate.\n  Now, let me outline what we are actually talking about. We are going \nto have a contract where maintenance work on the C-5 is put out for \ncompetition. If a private contractor can do it for less, it will be \nprivatized to save the taxpayer money. Now, that private contractor can \ndo the work anywhere they choose, and obviously one of the options that \nis going to be bid will be the option of using the C-5 hangar which \nexists at Kelly and nowhere else--it would cost $100 million to rebuild \nit somewhere else--and doing the work not with Government employees but \nwith private employees. They will not get the contract if they cannot \ndo it for less.\n  So what is the issue here? Well, some people say the issue is DOD is \nnot following the Base Closure Commission report because they are not \nclosing Kelly Air Force Base. They are not closing McClellan Air Force \nBase. Well, look, we all want to take facts and try to use them to \nbolster our argument, but this is not true. No one is proposing that we \nnot close Kelly Air Force Base. No one is proposing that we not close \nMcClellan Air Force Base. There are a lot of people in San Antonio, \nthere are a lot of people in Texas, there are a lot of people in \nCalifornia who would rather not close these bases, but there is no \ndebate about it. The debate is about this: Should private industry have \na right to compete for the work that will no longer be done by the \nGovernment at Kelly and McClellan? That is the question. So nobody is \nsaying do not close the military bases. To listen to the debate in the \nHouse, you would think that is what is being proposed.\n\n  Now, that brings me to the next point I want to make. All throughout \nthe debate in the House of Representatives reference was made to a GAO \nstudy entitled ``Air Force Depot Maintenance: Privatization in Place \nPlans Are Costly While Excess Capacity Exists.''\n  Now, might I say that this is so typical of GAO work, because what \nhappened is somebody asked GAO to do a\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\nstudy that in essence said, if your whole objective is to reduce Air \nForce overhead, would you want to consolidate or would you want to \nprivatize? Nobody asked the question, if you want to save the taxpayer \nmoney, if you want to improve quality, what would you do? But to listen \nto the debate in the House of Representatives, where over and over \nagain people held up this study, you would think that the General \nAccounting Office had concluded that having the Government do this work \nrather than having a public/private competition, where we would decide \nwho does it based on who could do it better or cheaper, that GAO had \nlooked at this option and had decided the Government could do it \nbetter.\n  Now, when you actually look at their study, you find, in fact, that \nis not what the study looks at at all. What the study basically looks \nat is, if your objective is to reduce the level of overhead in depots, \nwhat you would want to do is consolidate. If your objective is to \nreduce the amount of excess capacity in private industry, as if that is \nour concern, you would want to consolidate into the depots. But when \nthey get down to cost, all they can say is that ``Air Force planning \nhas not progressed far enough to compare precisely the cost of \nprivatization of depot workload in place with the cost of transferring \nthe work to other unused depots.''\n  So, in other words, all the GAO study says is if the only options are \nto close Kelly and McClellan and transfer the work versus keeping them \nopen, operating at the same cost, you ought to close them and transfer \nthe work, especially if your sole objective is to reduce overhead. I do \nnot disagree with a word this study says, but the problem is it does \nnot have anything to do with the debate that is being conducted. The \ndebate is not about excess capacity. The debate is about cost. The \ndebate is about dollars and cents: Is it cheaper to have public/private \ncompetition, or is it cheaper to simply have the maintenance work done \nin Government depots?\n  Interestingly enough, there was another study on this subject which \nwas never referred to in the debate in the House, and this is a July \n1995 study done by the Congressional Budget Office. I want to remind my \ncolleagues this study was done before the Base Closure Commission \nreport and was in no way colored by anybody trying to tilt the evidence \nin favor or against privatization.\n  Now, the CBO study basically concludes, comparing the public sector, \nwhere the Government does maintenance work with Government employees, \nversus the private sector, that ``shifting depot work to the private \nsector might reasonably be expected to save $1 billion annually in the \nlong run.''\n  In other words, you have two studies. One looks at whether or not to \nclose a facility and shift the function, where those are the only two \noptions--and which is not what we are debating at all. The other study \ntries to look at competition between the public sector and the private \nsector in doing this work, and--something that should not come as \nstartling to an American--competition means lower prices and higher \nquality, and this study projects about $1 billion of savings from \ncompetition once you fully implement competition.\n\n  Let me summarize then what the real issue here is about. The real \nissue here is not about closing two Air Force maintenance facilities. \nNobody is arguing that these two bases should not be closed. But what \nis being argued, and being argued with some passion, is whether or not \nwe ought to look at the least costly way of doing this work. Should we \nsimply close these two military bases, which everyone supports, and \nshift the functions to other Air Force maintenance facilities, or \nshould we put out this work for bids, and if it can be done cheaper in \na Government depot, do it there, and if it can be done cheaper by the \nprivate sector, do it there?\n  That is what the issue really is about, but you would never know it \nfrom the debate. The debate we hear really goes in two directions. One, \nwe are talking about keeping bases open that the Base Closure \nCommission closed and that violates the agreement. Nobody is talking \nabout keeping the bases open. They are going to be closed. We are going \nto bring down the flag. The military personnel are going to be shifted. \nNobody is debating that option. The question is, should we allow a \nprivate contractor, who would come in and lease a facility that will \nbelong in this case to the city of San Antonio, a C-5 hangar that does \nnot exist anywhere else in America, should a private contractor be able \nto come in and lease that facility and compete with other private \ncontractors and with the Government to maintain, for example, the C-5?\n  That is the question. Obviously, if we have private competition, that \nis going to mean that our remaining depots are going to have to \ncompete.\n  I am not going to get into the business of trying to determine the \nintentions of our colleagues. I never try to impugn anybody's \nintentions. But let me talk specifically about that issue. I have \nproposed a compromise that I think makes sense. In this sort of \nsupercharged environment where this has become one State versus \nanother, we have not yet worked out a compromise, but I wanted to \noutline what my compromise is because I think in the future we are \ngoing to have to come to some conclusion here.\n  My proposed compromise is the following thing. We have in this bill a \nrequirement that 50 percent of our maintenance work be done in \nGovernment depots and no more than 50 percent be done by the private \nsector. This is an arbitrary provision. It ought to be repealed. We \nought to make the decision based on defense needs and cost. But what \nhas really happened here is that at the very time when defense spending \nis being cut, you might initially believe that, well, with defense \nhaving been cut by a third, we have all been forced to make tough \ndecisions, and in the name of a strong national defense and in the name \nof the security of the United States, we are all forced to make \ndecisions about cutting overhead and waste and protecting special \ninterests, dropping that so that we can get the most return we can on \nour defense dollars. You might think that would happen. But I am sorry \nto say that I think there is every evidence that exactly the opposite \nhas occurred, that what has happened with defense spending declining is \nthat our defense facilities and the people who live in those \ncommunities and those who represent those communities have started to \nview defense like welfare or an entitlement, that somehow because you \nhave a defense maintenance facility, for example, that you are entitled \nto the work and the fact that we have less of it makes you more \nentitled.\n\n  So what we have seen in the House is sweeping language that would bar \nprivatization and price competition for all practical purposes, forcing \nthe Air Force to do something they do not want to do. The Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of the Air Force, the uniformed leadership, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the people who are trying to preserve a strong \ndefense desperately want the ability to engage in price competition. \nThey understand we won the cold war because the private sector can do \nthings well. So what they want to do, with the limited amount of money \nthey have, is take a requirement and put it out for competitive bids \nand get the most return we can by having competitive bids. So that, if \na depot in some State wants work, they have to prove they can do it \ncheaper than any other depot or than any other private sector person \nwho might do that work.\n  I have offered to our colleagues on the other side of this issue to \nsit down with them and define a level playing surface, so that we can \nbe absolutely sure that this is going to be a fair competition. But, \nbasically, what has happened, I am afraid, and I am unhappy to say, is \nthat increasingly defense is being viewed as an entitlement or welfare \nprogram, where, as we have less of it, rather than spending our money \nmore efficiently, there is a demand to protect the interests of \nindividual communities and individual military facilities. If we follow \nthis procedure, we are going to end up with a less effective military \nforce, we are going to end up with less procurement of new equipment, \nwe are going to end up with poorer pay and working conditions, we are \ngoing to end up with a military that does not represent the best and \nthe brightest in our society.\n  What my proposal has been is the following: Leave this division of \npublic/private work in place, at least temporarily. I would have to say \nthat logic\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\ndictates that we ought not to have any arbitrary division, that it \nought to be done based on competition. But my proposal is the \nfollowing, that within this arbitrary division set out in law, in our \nbill 50-50--no more than 50 percent can be contracted out--leave that \nprovision in place, but add a provision that says that, if a private \ncontractor using a level playing surface that takes into account all \ncosts, where a bidder has to have a firm, fixed price and where you \ndon't pay them if they have a cost overrun, they have to eat it, and \nwhere you impose a fine and other penalties on them if they don't meet \nquality requirements and a timetable, including disbarring them from \ndoing defense work, then have a full and fair competition, however we \nwant to define it. I would define it to include all costs, including \nretirement and overhead, and require the public and the private sector \nto have fixed-price contracts, and then make them live up to the \ncontract.\n  I am trying to work out a compromise and break this impasse that not \nonly fractures the Senate and House but that threatens our national \ndefense efficiency, in my opinion. What I am willing to say is, OK, \nstay with the 50-50 arbitrary division except in the cases where the \nsavings are 10 percent or greater. In other words, begin with a \npresumption that it is worth 10 percent to have the Government do it, \nbut if the private sector can do it for more than 10 percent less than \nwhat the Government can do it for, let the private sector have the \ncontract. In other words, give a 10-percent bias toward the Government. \nIf you really are concerned about efficiency, it seems to me that is \nmore than a reasonable proposal. What it would say is that any time the \nGovernment in its depots can do the work within 10 percent of what the \nprivate sector can do it, we leave the existing restrictions in place. \nBut in those cases where the savings are at least 10 percent or more, \nlet the private sector have the opportunity to bid on it and, if they \nwin the bid by that margin, let them have the work.\n\n  That is, I believe, the ultimate solution to this problem. I don't \nthink it makes sense economically. I think it is tilted toward \nGovernment procurement, Government provision of maintenance. But to try \nto reach a compromise, it is what I am in favor of. But let me make it \nclear, not only do I believe the position I have taken is right for \nAmerica and right for the taxpayer, but the idea that companies in \nTexas or anywhere else don't have a right to bid on work and, if they \ncan do it cheaper, get the contract is so alien to everything that I \nbelieve and everything that I believe is in the national interest that, \nif there is any provision in this final bill that stops competition, \nthat precludes price competition to benefit the taxpayer, I am going to \nvigorously resist.\n  Also, I might note that the President has said that he would veto the \nbill if such a provision were in it. I hope my colleagues, at the very \ntime when we are all down here bemoaning the decline in defense \nspending and the threat it poses to our security, I hope we are not \ngoing to put ourselves in a position where we are defending special \ninterests and the President is vetoing the bill because we are more \nconcerned about the pork barrel and treating defense like welfare than \nwe are concerned about providing for the national defense.\n  Let me go to the final point. So confused has this issue become that \nwe now have colleagues who are saying that they are not going to \nsupport another base closing commission because of what the President \nsupposedly has done about the last one. Our chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Ted Stevens--we all know and admire him--\nhe is quoted in today's paper in the following way: ``Senator Ted \nStevens, Alaska Republican, said there will be no further closure until \nMr. Clinton backs off his plan to protect bases in California and \nTexas.''\n  Let me respond by saying, obviously the President, like any good \nparade leader, when the Base Closing Commission proposed one of the \noptions being price competition, the President grabbed his baton and \ngot out in front of the parade. He just thought it was a great idea and \nhe thought that we would almost certainly do it. And he was for it. He \nwas very much for it. Because people were getting ready to vote on \nwhether to renew his contract or not.\n  But it is not what he said that is important; it is what his \nadministration did. The point is, they didn't do it. All they have said \nis that they want to follow the Base Closing Commission report where \nthey would put out bids, and if the private sector can do the work on \nthese closed military bases, or anywhere else, cheaper than the \nGovernment can do the work internally, they want to do it.\n  So, are we going to base the public policy of the country on \npolitical posturing by a candidate for office during a contested \nPresidential election? The plain truth is, the President said over and \nover he was for privatization and he believed that contractors at these \nbases would win the competition. But he didn't change Government \npolicy. He didn't say we are going to write the proposals so that they \nhave to win. In fact, the Defense Department believes, our Secretary of \nDefense believes, the Secretary of the Air Force believes, the \nuniformed services believe, that we could save as much as 30 percent by \nhaving price competition.\n  So, what a terrible confusion we find ourselves in, where we are \ntalking about not moving forward with necessary policy because the \nPresident, taking the best provisions of the Base Closing Act from a \npolitical point of view and trying to hide behind them, somehow \nconfuses people. We are going to let a contract on C-5 maintenance. If \nit can be done cheaper by the private sector, it will be done by the \nprivate sector. If it can't, it won't. Now, if it is cheaper to be done \nby the private sector--and I believe it will be substantially cheaper--\nbut if it is, do I expect the President to make a statement about it \nand say: I am delighted that a private contractor in California or \nTexas or Timbuktu has gotten this contract? Yes, I expect him to do \nthat. But does that change the fact that the taxpayer has benefited? \nThat defense has benefited? No. So, I urge my colleagues to go back and \nlook at this issue.\n\n  A final point and I will yield the floor. This is not, in my mind--\nand I believe demonstrably it is not a fact--to say that this is a \ndispute between the Senators who represent Texas and California on one \nhand and the Senators who represent States that have Air Force depots \non the other hand. In fact, I had the great privilege, as our \ndistinguished chairman will remember, of serving on the Armed Services \nCommittee for 6 years. Every day in every way on every issue, I \nsupported privatization as a member of that committee. Now, granted, if \nthe situation were reversed and we had closed a maintenance facility in \nsome other State and we were moving it to Texas, my position would be \nmore difficult than it is today, because the national interest and my \nState's little special interest would be at least partially on a \ndifferent side. But I don't believe that my position would be any \ndifferent than it is today. I cannot imagine that I would ever oppose \nprice competition as a way of getting the largest return on our dollar. \nI hope, if the day ever comes that I have to go against something that \nI believe in as strongly as I believe in price competition, that maybe \nI'll get out of the way and let somebody else do this job.\n  The point I want to make in concluding is this is not a dispute among \nStates. Granted, everybody can look at this, this collage of facts and \npolitical posturing, and they can pick and choose what they want. They \ncan take reports that do not have anything to do with price competition \nand say, ``You see, it's cheaper to let the Government do it and have \nno price competition.'' Anybody who has lived in America for more than \na day would know this can't be right. But you can do that. You can take \npolitical posturing and make whatever you want to out of it. But, when \nyou get down to the bottom line, this is a debate about price \ncompetition, are you for it or are you not for it? I'm for it.\n  Let me say, I want to work something out. This ends up, in a sense, \npitting me against some of the Members for whom I have the highest \naffection. There is no Senator I love more than the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell, or Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma. I was \ninstrumental, as chairman of the senatorial committee, I think, in \nhelping to elect both of them.\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\n  I want to work out an agreement where everybody can feel that we have \na good national policy, and their interests are protected. If there is \na legitimate concern about full and fair competition, if people are in \nany way concerned that the Air Force is going to tilt the competition \nto benefit private contractors at the expense of depots, which I don't \nbelieve because I think every pressure will be in the opposite \ndirection, but the point is, if people are concerned about that, I am \nwilling to sit down and work with them and come up with an ironclad \nsystem.\n  I am willing to bring private accounting firms into the certification \nprocess to guarantee that it is a fair competition. I am willing to do \nwhatever we have to do to safeguard the competitive process. But I am \nnot willing to let what I perceive to be special interest treat defense \nspending as welfare and say this belongs to us, even if we can't do it \nbetter, even if we can't do it cheaper, that the fact that we have done \nit means that we ought to have it forever.\n  We all have to resist that. We all have to represent our States. That \nis why we are elected. But we have to also look at the overriding \nnational interest.\n  I wanted to come down today and go over all these issues because \nsomeday, the Senate is going to have to reach a decision on this. I \nthink as it stands now, this decision will be made in conference. I \nhope that we can, in conference, preserve the ability to have price \ncompetition. I am hoping that next year, we can sit down and work out \nan agreement where everybody believes and is confident, to the degree \nwe can make people confident, that their individual interests are \nprotected.\n  But the issue here is not preventing base closures. We are going to \nclose the bases. The flags are coming down. We are already moving \npeople. Nobody is disputing that. Despite all the political rhetoric to \nthe contrary, we are closing these bases. The question is: Should we \nuse price competition to determine whether some of their functions go \nto other bases or whether they go to the private sector? And the Base \nClosing Commission recommended that we do that. So nobody is here \ntrying to override the Base Closing Commission. What we are here trying \nto do is to implement the Base Closing Commission recommendations.\n  We all, obviously, look at an array of facts, and we often try to \ntake the facts that bolster our case. I think that is only human \nnature. But I believe that if a person gathers all the facts and cuts \nthrough all the irrelevant issues and gets to the bottom line on this \nissue, it is: Do we believe in competition? Do we believe that we can \nmaximize the effectiveness of national defense by having public-private \ncompetition where the best provider at the lowest price wins? I believe \nwe do. I believe that is the principle that most Members of the Senate \nand the House believe in.\n  I wanted to take the time today--and I thank my colleagues for their \nforbearance in this lengthy speech--to at least get on the public \nrecord what one Member believes the facts to be.

Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to my friend and \ncolleague from South Carolina, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Levin and others who have done, I think, a \nwonderful job in putting this bill together. I commend them for it. It \nis comprehensive, from a parochial standpoint. There are issues in my \nState that are addressed in this defense authorization bill which I \nthink are extremely important from a national security standpoint, \nmaintaining an industrial base, the teaming approach, the creative \napproach that the Defense Department has come up with that Electric \nBoat Division and Newport News in Virginia have joined together in a \nteaming process for the next generation of submarine technology that \nwill allow both of those industrial bases to maintain their viability \nwell into the next century.\n  Mr. President, stepping back a bit and looking at the Defense \nauthorization bill as a whole, I'd like to complement my colleagues, \nSenator Thurmond and Senator Levin, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee for bringing to the floor a bill that \nprovides for the Nation's defense in a sound and fiscally responsible \nmanner.\n  Let me comment on several provisions of the bill in particular.\n  First and foremost, this bill supports the submarine teaming plan \nwhich will save hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and keep our \ncurrent submarine industrial base viable for the near future. The Navy \nestimates that this teaming plan will save $650 million, or about half \na submarine, when compared to straight competition. That's a fact, and \nit has not been disputed. In this era of cost cutting, teaming on \nsubmarines is clearly the best course. Moreover, if at some point in \nthe future there is enough work for full competition between two \nsubmarine builders, only the teaming plan will ensure that two \nsubmarine builders still exist.\n  It is far too early, however, to become complacent on this matter, \nfor high hurdles remain, but I plan to do my utmost to make sure that \nthis plan, fully backed by the Navy, becomes law.\n  On a related matter, I'm glad to see that we are on track in \nauthorizing funds to complete the third and final Seawolf submarine. \nJust last week, Electric Boat in Groton, CT, turned over to the Navy \nthe U.S.S. Seawolf, the first submarine in the class and the most \nadvanced submarine in the world. It once again demonstrates that the \nNation looks to Connecticut to produce the world's finest equipment for \nthe world's finest fighting forces.\n  This bill also calls for 36 UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, a testament \nto the continued need for these versatile aircraft used by nearly every \nbranch of the Armed Forces as well as a host of countries around the \nworld. Also, these helicopters are ever-present in disaster relief \noperations, from the wildfires in California to the floods in the \nDakotas. This bill will ease a bit the National Guard's massive \nshortfall in modern helicopters. Any National Guard adjutant general \nwill attest to the outstanding capabilities of these helicopters, \nespecially when compared to the aging, Vietnam-era UH-1 Huey \nhelicopters many units may be forced to continue to use for the coming \nyears.\n  Finally, this bill holds off on more rounds of base closures and I \nsupport that position. Although I've stood behind base closure rounds \nin the past, we don't have a good handle at this point on the costs and \nbenefits from those previous rounds, so I'm disinclined to go forward. \nThe GAO has found that, while there are probably eventual savings that \naccrue from BRAC rounds, the specific amounts cannot be pinned down \nfrom the available data. Furthermore, GAO has found that environmental \ncleanup costs have been underestimated and revenue from land sales has \nbeen overestimated--both resulting in lesser savings than DoD had \ninitially calculated.\n  That is why I have signed onto an amendment offered by Senator Dorgan \nthat has the support of both the majority leader and the minority \nleader. The amendment simply requires that we closely examine the data \nfrom the four previous base closure rounds as well as the shutdowns \nscheduled over the next year before we go forward with additional \nrounds. This doesn't seem too much to ask when we consider the \ndifficulties that confront communities that surround a military base on \nthe closure list. We owe it to those communities to provide accurate \nestimates rather than the more familiar overstatements of savings used \nto justify their extreme hardship.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, this is an amendment that was \nadopted in the other body's consideration of the authorization for the \nArmed Services of this country, adopted 417-0. But I thought it was \nworthwhile for this body to speak as well to this issue.\n  I speak of the gulf war illnesses, Mr. President, that virtually \nevery Member of this body and others have expressed deep concern about \nto the members of their own States who served in the gulf war. We know \nnow that at least 10 percent of the 700,000 that served in the war may \nhave been afflicted with a gulf war illness of one kind. To the credit \nof General Schwarzkopf and others who testified in recent weeks, it was \nsuggested this matter ought to be pursued.\n  It is mystifying and disturbing to many exactly what kind of exposure \nthose men and women were subjected to. I do not know that anyone can \ntell you categorically what the answer is yet, but this amendment \ntracks some of the conclusions reached by the General Accounting Office \nthat they revealed in a recent report about the gulf war illnesses. The \nauthor of the amendment in the House, as well as myself, tracked that \nreport, drafted this language, and are asking our colleagues to support \nit so that we might not only get to the bottom of this and provide the \nkind of treatment that our veterans deserve, but also maybe minimize in \nfuture situations being faced with the kind of difficulties that we \nhave all heard about in various hearings that have been held in this \nbody and the other over the last number of months regarding this issue.\n  This amendment, as I mentioned a moment ago, will provide, I think, \nsome real solace, not to mention significant help, particularly help to \nthe 700,000 members of the Armed Forces who served in the Persian Gulf \nwar. And perhaps as many, as I said, as 10 percent of them who may be \nsuffering from some form of these Persian Gulf war illnesses. It is a \nmodest attempt to help those people.\n  In a $268 billion defense bill, I do not think we ought to find it \ntoo difficult to provide $4.5 million, which is what this amendment \ndoes, to study the most effective treatments of gulf war illnesses and \nencourage efforts to replicate those treatments. If there is one thing \nI think this body and this Nation can agree on, it is to do better by \nour gulf war veterans.\n  Clearly, our colleagues in the House recognized the imperative here. \nThat body approved an amendment 417-0.\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly describe this amendment and why I \nthink it is necessary.\n  This amendment will require the Defense Department and the Veterans \nAdministration to work together to determine what is working in the \ntreatment of gulf war illnesses. While the DOD and VA have taken an \nimportant step of offering examinations to all who fought in the \nPersian Gulf war, those agencies have not examined the adequacy and \neffectiveness of treatments after those initial examinations.\n\n  Mr. President, let me, just as an aside here, suggest as well \nutilizing the forum of this body to urge the gulf war veterans to visit \ntheir veterans hospitals in their States to be examined. There are \n5,000 people in my State who served in the gulf war. Only about 400 to \n500 have showed up at the veterans hospital in West Haven to be \nexamined to determine whether or not they may be suffering any of the \neffects of the gulf war illnesses.\n  Many have had no effects whatsoever. But we are being told by experts \nthat some of the reactions are delayed reactions, and they may not be \nshowing up in the normal predictable course of events in a timely \nfashion. But if more people would just go for that half an hour \nexamination, I am confident that the overwhelming majority will not \nfind that they suffered any consequence, but it would be helpful for \nthem and their families, but it would assist us immeasurably as we try \nto get to the bottom of this issue.\n  This, as I said, is an amendment that would help us identify some of \nthe treatments that are working. This is based on the General \nAccounting Office report that was recently released and called \n``Improved Monitoring of Clinical Progress and Reexamination of \nResearch Emphasis Are Needed.'' It clearly asserts that neither the DOD \nnor the VA has a mechanism in place to monitor the effectiveness of \ntreatment after those initial exams. This amendment would provide such \na means, one that I feel is long overdue.\n  But it is not enough, in my view, to take just a close look at the \npresent treatments. I think we must look ahead to make sure we do not \nrepeat the mistakes. And this amendment will take steps on that front \nas well.\n  For example, the Defense Department has been unable to provide the \nlocation of military units at certain times during the Persian Gulf \nwar. Specifically, we are apparently uncertain of troop movements in \nthe proximity of the ammunition depot at Khamisiyah when it was \ndestroyed.\n  That is why this amendment, I think, would be helpful in requiring \nthe Defense Department to develop a plan to collect and maintain \ninformation regarding the daily location of units engaged in a \ncontingency or combat operation. Had we done that during the gulf war, \nwe would know where our troops were when the emissions of chemical or \nbiological agents occurred. That is vitally important information.\n  Furthermore, both the General Accounting Office and the President's \nAdvisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses have highlighted the loss or \nincompleteness of military medical records. Now, years later, as \nresearchers attempt to determine who is and who is not suffering from \nan illness that resulted from their service in the Persian Gulf war, \nthe fact that in many cases they cannot piece together medical \nhistories does not allow them to make an informed decision.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, would therefore require the Department \nof Defense to put a system in place that would accurately record the \nmedical condition of service members prior to their deployment and \nretain such data in a centralized location to ease future access. \nAgain, this is a modest proposal that would have prevented, I think, \nour current difficulties had it been in place prior to or during the \nPersian Gulf conflict.\n  Concerning the fact that troops in the Persian Gulf were given drugs \nthat did not yet receive FDA approval for usage, this amendment would \nrequire that members of the Armed Forces at least be notified when they \nreceive an investigational new drug. That way, if such drugs are \nrequired, at least our troops will not have any mistaken impressions \nabout them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. It gives the Defense Department and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs wide discretion and simply guides their action in \nareas where I think there have been some shortcomings.\n  The final objective is a better understanding of the best treatments \nof these illnesses and to guard against similar problems in the future.\n  Again, even though we have passed legislation banning the use of \nchemical weapons--the treaty--I think we all realize that this may be a \nreoccurring problem in the future. And this modest amendment, I think, \nwould go a great distance to alleviating some of these problems.\n  Again, I emphasize that this has been adopted by the other body \nunanimously. I think it would be worthwhile\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\nif this body were to express its opinion on this issue as well.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I offer this amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. President, I am not asking for a rollcall vote on this. One may \nbe necessary.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this \namendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill. This \namendment would better coordinate DOD's and VA's response to Persian \nGulf war illnesses and would provide a plan to better protect the \nhealth of our troops during future deployments.\n  At the outset, it is important to note that DOD and VA have made a \nlot of progress on the important issues surrounding the illnesses \nsuffered by veterans of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war. They have \ncoordinated their efforts in areas of evaluation, research, and \noutreach in ways that will benefit gulf war veterans as well as \nveterans of future deployments. But I think we all agree that there is \nstill much to be done. This amendment builds on the coordination and \nprogress that has been made so far. Therefore, I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to join in support of this important measure.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have \nwitnessed firsthand the human costs of the gulf war. It is my belief, \nand that of many others, that the casualties of this war continued long \nafter the battles were over. This is true of many wars, but the chronic \nhealth problems of many of the men and women who served in the gulf war \nhave been particularly devastating as they have had to continue to \nfight to be heard and to get the care and benefits they have earned. \nTheir battles should have been over by now, but their struggles are \nstill ongoing. This amendment would go a long way to help address some \nof their concerns, and it puts some measures in place so that \nhopefully, we will not repeat our mistakes with the next deployment.\n  This amendment is important because it would require a joint plan \nfrom the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for \nproviding appropriate health care for veterans of the gulf war, \nincluding those serving in Reserve units. It would require that this \ncare be appropriate to the specific health problems or illnesses of \ngulf war veterans and that the quality and effectiveness of their \nhealth care be carefully monitored.\n  This amendment also attempts to address some of the lessons we have \nlearned form the gulf war. It calls for DOD to improve medical tracking \nof service members deployed overseas in contingency or combat \noperations through the use of pre- and post-deployment medical \nexaminations and through improved recordkeeping of immunization and \nhealth records. It calls for a plan to improve collection and \nmaintenance of troop location information so we can better reconstruct \nrisks and exposure data when unanticipated exposures such as Khamisiyah \noccur. It also would provide that service members receive timely notice \nof use of unapproved or investigational drugs, and it would require \nadequate record keeping of the administration of such drugs.\n  This amendment would authorize $4.5 million for the funding of \nclinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols \nfor gulf war veterans who present with ill-defined or undiagnosed \nconditions. It would call for a review of the previous Federal research \nefforts examining gulf war illnesses, as well as recommendations for \nthe direction of future research efforts.\n  In my rule as ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \nhave witnessed the struggles of America's gulf war veterans. I have \nheard their testimony in our hearings and I have met with them in \nhospitals and in their homes. I have received testimony from \nrepresentatives from DOD and VA and I have heard their concerns and \nexplanations. The course of events stemming from the gulf war, the \nresulting health problems, and our Federal response have contributed to \na lack of public trust on this issue. This amendment is a step toward \nmaking things right and restoring our veterans' trust. I am proud to \ncosponsor this amendment and I encourage my colleagues to support it as \nwell.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut is a very worthy one. I have been asked to review it, and \nother members of the committee asked to review it, including a Democrat \nmember. And so, if it is agreeable to the Senator from Connecticut, we \nwill have the amendment in line. Whether it is accepted on a recorded \nvote, we will know later on this afternoon.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. I would not have to at this moment then make a \nrequest for a recorded vote, but I could wait on that if that became \nnecessary?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  I would like to move to another two matters, if I could, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 765\n\n (Purpose: To commend Mexico on the conduct of free and fair elections \n                               in Mexico)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleague from \nArizona, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 765.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SECTION.   .\n\n       (A) Congress finds that--\n       (1) on July 6, 1997, elections were conducted in Mexico in \n     order to fill 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 32 seats \n     in the 128 seat Senate, the office of the Mayor of Mexico \n     City, and local elections in a number of Mexican states;\n       (2) for the first time, the federal elections were \n     organized by the Federal Electoral Institute, an autonomous \n     and independent organization established under the Mexican \n     Constitution;\n       (3) more than 52 million Mexican citizens registered to \n     vote,\n       (4) eight political parties registered to participate in \n     the July 6, elections, including the Institutional \n     Revolutionary Party (PRI), the National Action Party (PAN), \n     and the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD);\n       (5) Since 1993, Mexican citizens have had the exclusive \n     right to participate as observers in activities related to \n     the preparation and the conduct of elections;\n       (6) Since 1994, Mexican law has permitted international \n     observers to be a part of the process;\n       (7) With 84% of the ballots counted, PRI candidates \n     received 38% of the vote for seats in the Chamber of \n     Deputies; while PRD and PAN candidates receive 52% of the \n     combined vote;\n       (8) PRD candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano has become \n     the first elected Mayor of Mexico City, a post previously \n     appointed by the President;\n       (9) PAN members will now serve as governors in seven of \n     Mexico's 31 states;\n       (B) It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the recent Mexican elections were conducted in a free, \n     fair and impartial manner;\n       (2) the will of the Mexican people, as expressed through \n     the ballot box, has been respected by President Ernesto \n     Zedillo and officials throughout his Administration;\n       (3) President Zedillo, the Mexican Government, the Federal \n     Electoral Institute, the political parties and candidates, \n     and most importantly the citizens of Mexico should all be \n     congratulated for their support and participation in these \n     very historic elections.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I offer on behalf \nof myself and my colleague from Arizona. This really is an amendment \ncommending the people of Mexico, the Government of Mexico, and the \npeople of Mexico as well, for this remarkable election that occurred \njust last Sunday which, for the first time in 68 years, has changed the \npolitical landscape of that country.\n  One might ask, ``Why are we offering a resolution on this? They had \ntheir election. So be it.''\n  Mr. President, for over the last number of years, the only time the \nissue of Mexico has come up on the floor of the Senate has been in a \nusually highly critical way having to do with the issue of drugs, \nnarcotics, and our concern there. We had a debate on the North American \nFree Trade Agreement; obviously, that provoked a lot of criticism.\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\n  I thought it might be worthwhile for this body to take a moment out \nto say to our neighbor to the south, we applaud you as a people and as \na Government for the election that you went through last Sunday.\n  To those who were victorious, we congratulate them. To those who \nlost, we express our regrets for you. We commend President Zedillo for \nhaving embraced the results, who saw to it that a process was in place \nthat would not allow the corruption that occurred in the last election \nwhen apparently people who were legitimately elected were denied those \nvictories.\n  The people of Mexico voted in strong numbers. There is a new mayor \nfor the city of Mexico. Mexico, in the past, has not had freely elected \nmayors.\n  So while we as a Congress have been critical of Mexico in the past, I \nthink it is worthwhile to take a moment out to say, ``Well done,'' and \nthat Mexico has done an excellent job here. It is the first election. \nWe hope there will be many more like it in the years to come. \nObviously, one election is only the beginning of a process, but it is \ngood for those of us who wanted to see improved relations between \nourselves and our neighbor to the south.\n  My colleague from Arizona has spent a good deal of his time as a \nMember of this body interested in Mexico, not just from a geographical \nstandpoint, although the State shares a border with our neighbor to the \nsouth, but because of his concern, as well, over the issue of narcotics \nand trade, the border issues which his State and other States in the \nSouthwest face all the time.\n  We are not reluctant, as a body, to raise our voice where criticism \nis due. It is worthwhile to take a few moments out and to offer praise \nwhere praise is due. The people of Mexico, the Government of Mexico, \nthe candidates and the parties involved, I think, are worthy of taking \na moment out to congratulate them on their election last Sunday and to \nurge they continue in that process in the years ahead.\n  I urge the adoption of this language, and on this amendment, at some \npoint, I will want to get a recorded vote because I am sure it will be \nunanimous, and I think it may be worthwhile to have such a recorded \nvote when it is appropriate and proper to do so.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nConnecticut on proposing this amendment.\n  As he has pointed out, quite often when something goes wrong in \nMexico, we and our colleagues are quick to take the floor and \ncriticize, which is our role. But I think, as the Senator from \nConnecticut also pointed out, when something good happens, it is also \nimportant for us to take the floor and encourage our neighbors to the \nsouth in continuing the very difficult process toward a free and open \nsociety, which has been very difficult and arduous.\n  I also agree with the Senator from Connecticut we ought to have a \nvote on this amendment to tell the people in Mexico and their leaders \nof our support and our interest. Quite often, as I travel, especially \nin Latin America with my friend from Connecticut, I continue to be \nsurprised at how much attention is paid to what we say here, how much \nattention is paid to what we do here. Quite often, we will do a \nunanimous-consent agreement, it comes to the floor, and it will make \nheadlines all over that particular nation which is affected. Usually it \nis in the negative.\n  I cannot elaborate on what the Senator from Connecticut said except \nto point out again--I believe the first time the Senator from \nConnecticut and I traveled together was in 1987. If, 10 years ago, he \nand I had been in a conversation and I said, ``Guess what? In Mexico, \nan opposition party is now the mayor, a member of the opposition party \nis now the mayor of Mexico City,'' which has the largest concentration \nof people in Mexico, ``that many of the Governorships have been taken \nover by both opposing parties, both on the right and on the left, and \nthat by all judgments that it was a free, fair, and open election,'' \nthe Senator from Connecticut and I would have been accused of \nirrational thinking, to say the least, because it was not in the realm \nof possibility 10 years ago.\n  Now what has happened in Mexico, we are seeing a transition which, by \nthe way, will be characterized and fraught with great danger and \nperhaps violence because of the inequities that exist in Mexico that we \nare all aware of, but a major step forward was made. It is an important \nlandmark election in the history of the country of Mexico where the \nruling party not only allowed but encouraged a free and fair process, \nwhich we all know was not the case before.\n  I think that we, the representatives of the American people, should \ndo everything in our power to applaud, appreciate, and encourage such \nactions. I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut, whose long \ninvolvement of many years on these issues is important, and it has been \nan honor and a privilege for me to have the opportunity of working with \nhim, as we have seen our neighbors to the south, not just Mexico but \nthe other nations in Central and Latin America, make a transition for \nwhich I think holds a prospect for the peoples of our hemisphere which \nmost observers thought was highly unlikely, if not impossible, in the \nrecent past.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. There is a good editorial in the Hartford Courant, entitled \n``Mexico's Bloodless Revolution.'' I ask unanimous consent that that \narticle be printed in the Record to underscore the point the Senator \nfrom Arizona and I have made with this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Mexico's Bloodless Revolution\n\n       It's hard for most Americans to grasp the momentous nature \n     of Mexico's election last Sunday.\n       Imagine if the same political party controlled Congress and \n     the White House for almost 70 years. Imagine if the party won \n     successive elections through fraud and ruled in a manner as \n     imperious as a dictatorship. Then imagine that the party, in \n     spite of its tremendous power, lost an election.\n       That's what happened in Mexico. Ever since its founding in \n     1929, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, \n     has run the government as a fiefdom. The party's long rule \n     was unnatural. In a healthy democracy, voters usually prefer \n     periodic change if only to remind officeholders who is in \n     charge.\n       Until recent years, Mexicans lived under a quasi-democracy. \n     Although people voted for president, Congress and municipal \n     officers, the outcome was pre-ordained.\n       As democracy swept through Latin America and the rest of \n     the world--even Russia--Mexicans became convinced that their \n     system stood out as a democracy in name only. To their \n     credit, President Ernesto Zedillo and his recent predecessors \n     understood the necessity of change, albeit much too slowly.\n       Mr. Zedillo helped form an autonomous election council that \n     included no government officials and was not dominated by \n     PRI. To minimize fraud, every voter's photograph was included \n     on an identity card. Polling officials received special \n     training and political parties and candidates received \n     campaign funds from the treasury.\n       The turnout was estimated at 75 percent of the 52.2 million \n     registered voters, and the elections were judged by \n     independent observers to be clean. Unofficial results showed \n     PRI losing its majority in the lower house of Congress.\n       Mr. Zedillo could become the first Mexican president since \n     1913 to face an opposition legislature. Even though his \n     party, PRI, lost, he proclaimed that ``all Mexicans can say \n     with pride and with unity that democracy has been \n     institutionalized in our country.''\n       One honest election does not institutionalize democracy, \n     but it's a big step forward. Mexico's northern neighbors can \n     only be pleased by this historic development.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee. \nCertainly a case can be made that this is not directly bearing on the \ndollar amounts here, but there is a security issue involved.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 763\n\n  (Purpose: To congratulate Governor Christopher Patten of Hong Kong)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have an amendment that will not require a \nrecorded vote. The reason I am offering it here is for the sense of \ntimeliness. Again, I appreciate the indulgence of the members of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I now send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 763.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill at the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   . (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds \n     that--\n       (1) His Excellency Christopher F. Patten, the now former \n     Governor of Hong Kong, was the twenty-eighth British Governor \n     to preside over Hong Kong, prior to that territory reverting \n     back to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997;\n       (2) Chris Patten was a superb administrator and an \n     inspiration to the people who he sought to govern;\n       (3) During his five years as Governor of Hong Kong, the \n     economy flourished under his stewardship, growing by more \n     than 30% in real terms;\n       (4) Chris Patten presided over a capable and honest civil \n     service;\n       (5) Common crime declined during his tenure and the \n     political climate was positive and stable;\n       (6) The most important legacy of the Patten administration \n     is that the people of Hong Kong were able to experience \n     democracy first hand, electing members of their local \n     legislature; and\n       (7) Chris Patten fulfilled the British commitment to ``put \n     in place a solidly based democratic administration'' in Hong \n     Kong prior to July 1, 1997.\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) Governor Chris Patten has served his country with great \n     honor and distinction; and\n       (2) He deserves special thanks and recognition from the \n     United States for his tireless efforts to develop and nurture \n     democracy in Hong Kong.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for reasons that will become obvious as I \nengage in these remarks on why I am offering this amendment at this \ntime, this amendment congratulates Chris Patten, who served as the \nGovernor General of Hong Kong. We can wait, I suppose, a few weeks, and \nit might lose its sense of timeliness.\n  I think Chris Patten did a remarkable job in Hong Kong. He was the \nsource of a lot of criticism within the People's Republic of China and \nelsewhere because he spoke up on behalf of democracy in Hong Kong and \nestablished the first freely elected assembly in Hong Kong, which we \nare hopeful will be reinstituted based on commitments that have been \nmade.\n  I thought it might be worthwhile for us as a body here to express our \nappreciation for the job that Chris Patten did during his tenure as a \nGovernor of Hong Kong. It was a remarkable and historic tenure.\n  Before the July 4th recess, I spoke at some length about Chris \nPatten's accomplishments as the last Governor of Hong Kong under \nBritish rule. Much of what I said at the time I have sought to \nincorporate in the sense-of-the-Congress amendment.\n  Mr. President, we all watched the pomp and circumstance on Monday, \nJune 30, as the clock in Hong Kong ticked toward midnight. At 1 minute \nbefore midnight Hong Kong time we witnessed the Union Jack being \nlowered for the last time, and the unfurling of the People's Republic \nof China flag in the night sky.\n  That was truly a historic occasion. Appropriately, the events were \nattended by representatives from governments around the world. July 1, \n1997, will at the very least, become an important footnote in the \nhistory of the 20th century.\n  Having said that, I think the U.S. Senate should also acknowledge \nwhat preceded those events--the very impressive accomplishments of the \nGovernor, Chris Patten, during his tenure in Hong Kong. We should thank \nhim, I think, for his service to his own country, but more importantly, \nin many ways to the people of Hong Kong. Simply put, that is what my \namendment seeks to do.\n  I hope my colleagues support this expression of our appreciation and \ncongratulate him for a job well done on behalf not only of his own \nnation, the people of Hong Kong, but for all democracy-loving people \naround the globe.\n  I ask for the adoption of the amendment at the appropriate time. I \nwill reserve the yeas and nays. I do not want to take up time for a \nrecorded vote unnecessarily.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside and I be allowed to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent I be able to proceed until I \ncomplete my remarks, which will be 20 or 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7048-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7052-S7091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CHINESE MILITARY EXPANSION AND UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, no one did more to bring peace and \nprosperity in our time than our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. \nPresident Reagan's economic and foreign policies gave us the longest \npeacetime expansion in our history and, indeed, did fulfill an ambition \nof this country to make the world safe again for democracy. But more \nthan that, Ronald Reagan called us to our highest and best; we never \nspoke with more certainty or sat taller in the saddle than when Ronald \nReagan was riding point.\n  In his second inaugural address, Reagan spoke of the danger of \nsimple-minded appeasement, of accommodating countries at their lowest \nand least. ``History,'' said President Reagan, ``teaches us that wars \nbegin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.'' \nHaving seen the death and destruction of five wars in his lifetime, \nPresident Reagan's was a lesson learned at some expense. It was a \nlesson which he refused to repeat. And from his experience was borne \nthe policy of peace through strength--a strategy that recognized that \nwishful thinking about our adversaries is a betrayal of our past and a \nsquandering of our freedom.\n  But today, the administration seems to have forgotten this costly \nlesson. It seems driven not by foreign policy so much as by foreign \npolitics, willing to pursue that which sounds historic rather than \nadopting policies that are historically sound.\n  Nowhere is this administration's failed thinking more apparent than \nin United States policy toward China. As I noted on the floor 2 weeks \nago, Beijing has embarked on a military buildup that may soon threaten \nsecurity interests in Asia, including our own. China already has the \nworld's largest military at 2.9 million and is taking steps to enhance \nits force projection capabilities, including the acquisition of a blue \nwater navy and a 21st century air force.\n  China is not an enemy of the United States. I sincerely hope that \nWashington and Beijing can develop a forthright and an enduring \nrelationship. For such a relationship to develop, however, security \nissues must be addressed and fundamental questions about those issues \nmust be answered.\n  What does it mean when China engages in a dramatic military buildup \naimed at achieving superpower status? What does it mean when China \nproliferates technology for weapons of mass destruction and signs a \n$4.5 billion arms deal with the terrorist State of Iran? What does it \nmean when China fires missiles in the Taiwan Strait and seizes small \nislands in the South China Sea? For this belligerence suggests a China \nbent on regional domination.\n  While China's official military budget is roughly $8 billion, Beijing \neffectively conceals military spending through off-budget funding and \nrevenue. Reliable estimates place China's military spending from 4 to \n10 times the official budget. Russia alone, has made over $7 billion in \narm sales to China since 1990, and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \nunderemployed Russian nuclear engineers have been hired by China in the \nlast several years.\n  Mr. President, the People's Liberation Army of China, has 20,000 \ncompanies, business enterprises, that funnel revenue into the \nmilitary's coffers. These PLA companies are not the kind of competitors \nwe want to welcome to the American market. Companies with ties to the \nPLA benefit from their special relationship with Beijing and have been \ninvolved in criminal activities ranging from smuggling assault weapons \nonto the streets of San Francisco to stealing defense-related \ntechnology.\n  So what, then, has this explosion in military spending wrought? \nFirst, a missile program that will soon give China the capacity to \nbuild hundreds of highly accurate ballistic missiles. Second, short- to \nmedium-range ballistic\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\nmissiles that will provide Beijing with versatile nonnuclear weapons to \ntarget U.S. military personnel in a variety of contingencies if they so \ndesire.\n  And, as if this were not enough, China is modernizing its long-range \nnuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles with mobile ICBM systems \nand advance reentry technology. Due to the potential of secret \nunderground construction which is said to be available in China, China \ncould have as many as 130 of such missiles with a range of 8,000 miles. \nChina's missile modernization program is accompanied by the buildup of \nChina's Air Force.\n  By 2010, China could have over 100 SU-27 and SU-30 aircraft. The SU-\n27 is comparable to, and may be more advanced in some areas than, the \nU.S. F-15C Eagle. Russia has been the primary provider of these \naircraft and has signed a $2.2 billion coproduction agreement with \nChina to help Beijing develop the domestic capacity to produce these \nplanes.\n  China's ultimate goal is to acquire an all-weather Air Force within 5 \nyears. Attack aircraft, precision-guided munitions, airborne early \nwarning and control systems [AWACS], and large transport aircraft are \nall items on Beijing's wish list. With the help of Russian arms \nsuppliers, China is putting the pieces of this lethal puzzle in place.\n  Beijing is also working to develop a blue water navy. Their ambitions \nare perhaps summed up best by the words of Admiral Liu Huaqing. ``The \nChinese Navy,'' said Admiral Liu, ``should exert effective control of \nthe seas within the first island chain. Offshore should not be \ninterpreted as coastal as we used to know it. Offshore is a concept \nrelative to the high seas. It means the vast sea waters within the \nsecond island chain.''\n  Mr. President, it just so happens that the first island chain China \nseeks to control encompasses Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and some \nof the most critical shipping lanes in the world. The South China Sea \nalone accommodates 25 percent of the world's maritime trade and 75 \npercent of Japan's oil shipments.\n  To achieve Admiral Liu's objective, Beijing has purchased Kilo-class \nsubmarines and Sovremenny-class missile destroyers from Russia. In \naddition, the United States Office of Naval Intelligence [ONI] cites a \nNational People's Congress report that China is seeking to build two \n48,000-ton aircraft carriers, each with 40 combat aircraft, by the year \n2005.\n  China's arms buildup would be less disturbing if Beijing were acting \nto resist aggression by an enemy power. But China faces no grave \nsecurity threats, leaving us with troubling conclusions about Beijing's \nreal intent. China has historically demonstrated a willingness to \nsettle territorial disputes with force, and greater capacity can only \nincrease the likelihood of belligerence in the future.\n  Since WWII, a catalog of China's regional conflicts covers almost her \nentire periphery. China has invaded Tibet and Vietnam, entered the \nKorean war, ousted Vietnamese forces from several islands in the South \nChina Sea, fought India twice and Russia once over boundary disputes, \nand--not to forget the most consistent aspect of China's military \nadventurism--threatened Taiwan with military exercises and outright \ninvasion of Taiwanese islands close to China's shore.\n  China currently has territorial disputes with India, Russia, Japan, \nVietnam, and has vied with the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, \nand Malaysia for control of the resource-rich and strategically \nimportant South China Sea. To defend its claim, Beijing has already \nconstructed five naval installations in the Paracel Islands and seven \ninstallations in the Spratly Island group.\n  And what has been the Clinton administration's response to the rising \nChinese military threat? Appeasement at every turn. China proliferates \nmissile, nuclear, and chemical weapons technology to rogue regimes like \nIran; in fact, China is identified by the CIA as the world's worst \nproliferator of weapons of mass destruction. And yet, the \nadministration refuses to impose consistently sanctions authorized by \nU.S. law.\n  The China Ocean Shipping Co., better known as COSCO, is implicated in \nweapons smuggling to the United States and missile transfers to \nPakistan, and the President personally assists the city of Long Beach, \nCA, in leasing the local United States naval harbor to COSCO.\n  The China National Nuclear Corp. orchestrates most of the nuclear \ntechnology transfers to Pakistan and Iran, and the administration \nresponds by approving Export-Import Bank loans to help this Chinese \ncompany complete a nuclear reactor in China.\n  These examples reveal an underlying laxity also clearly seen in \nPresident Clinton's dismantling of export controls for sensitive \ntechnology. President Reagan's formation of the Combat Command [COCOM] \nhelped enforce an international embargo of sensitive technology exports \nto the Soviet Union and effectively expanded America's technological \nlead. Unfortunately, having confused short-term profits with long-term \nsecurity, this administration has undermined our export control \nframework.\n  For example, advanced U.S. aircraft engines have historically been a \nprotected item on the munitions list of goods and services. Sales of \nMunitions List items are illegal to any country without formal approval \nfrom the State Department. In addition, sales of Munitions List items \nto China were prohibited after the Tiananmen Square crackdown and could \nonly be permitted with a Presidential waiver.\n  Instead of openly issuing a waiver for the sale of aircraft engines \nto China, the Clinton administration quietly took airplane engines off \nthe Munitions List and shifted their control from the Department of \nState to the Department of Commerce. Licenses for the sale of aircraft \nengines were quickly issued by then-Secretary Brown, and they continue \nto this day.\n  In addition to aircraft technology, export controls for \nsupercomputers have also been relaxed. As Senator Cochran has argued so \ncompellingly on the floor this week, supercomputers are not extra large \nversions of a Macintosh or an IBM, but advanced machines that can \nsimulate warfare contingencies and model sophisticated weapons.\n  The Bush administration defined supercomputers as machines that could \nperform 195 MTOPS--million theoretical operations per second. The \nClinton administration relaxed export controls by changing this \ndefinition to 2,000 MTOPS, a tenfold increase in the capability of \nnoncontrolled supercomputers within 2 years. Shortly thereafter, the \nClinton administration raised the threshold to 7,000 MTOPS for export \nof supercomputers for civilian use.\n  In the euphoria of the post-cold war world, the Clinton \nadministration seems to have forgotten that civilian and military \ndistinctions have little use in a Communist State like China where \nGovernment control of industry ensures that civilian technology is \napplied to military ends and where thousands of so-called businesses \nare literally owned by the military.\n  Again, as Senator Cochran has noted, United States companies have \nused these relaxed regulations to sell 47 supercomputers to China. \nDozens more have been indirectly shipped to China via Europe, the \nPersian Gulf, and East Asia. The Clinton administration cannot account \nfor where many of these computers are located or how they are being \nused.\n\n  As Stephen Bryan, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, writes:\n\n       Thanks to * * * the Clinton administration, the Chinese can \n     now conduct tests of nuclear weapons, conventional \n     explosives, and chemical and biological weapons by simulating \n     them on supercomputers. Not only can they now make better \n     weapons of mass destruction, but they can do a lot of the \n     work secretly, thus threatening us with an additional element \n     of surprise.\n\n  For too long we have heard the argument that if the United States \ndoes not sell technology to Beijing, China will simply acquire the \nproducts from other sources. This contention is as familiar as it is \nflawed. United States military and dual-use technology is often a \ngeneration ahead of its Russian and European counterparts. How can the \nUnited States call on other nations to stop transferring dangerous \ntechnology when America is giving China some of the most advanced \ntechnology in the world?\n  A final thought. This week the Government Affairs Committee began \ninvestigating an ominous and startling facet of our national security--\nthe security of this Nation's democratic elections. Every American has \nan interest\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nin investigating the alleged plot of the Beijing government to \ninfluence the election of our President and Members of this Congress. \nTrying to corrupt American elections is shocking, outrageous, and \nwrong. And, if true, it must be dealt with in a forthright and forceful \nfashion.\n  In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what Ronald \nReagan gave us throughout the 1980's, and that is what this country is \nlooking for now. Leaders are willing to call this Nation--and nations \naround the world--to their highest and best, not accommodate them at \ntheir lowest and least.\n  Continued appeasement can only lead to further belligerence from \nBeijing. We must not let China slam shut the gate of freedom. We must \nshow the quiet courage and common sense that have marked our foreign \npolicy since America's first days.\n  It is time for America to place restrictions on high-technology \nexports to Beijing by supporting the Cochran-Durbin amendment; time to \nimpose consistently sanctions on China for proliferating weapons of \nmass destruction; time to restrict United States market access to PLA-\nfront companies; and time to let Beijing know that American security \ninterests in East Asia will not be compromised. So, that 1 day, the \nlong tug of memory might look favorably upon us as we look approvingly \non those who fought for freedom in decades passed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 670.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 670, as modified.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just as a courtesy to my colleagues, \nlet me say that I am not offering a new amendment. This is an amendment \nthat I introduced yesterday morning. I wanted to take advantage of this \ntime to speak about this amendment.\n  This amendment would authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer \n$5 million out of the $265 billion Pentagon budget--some $2.6 billion \nmore than the President himself asked for--to the Secretary of \nAgriculture, to be used for outreach and startup grants for the school \nbreakfast program.\n  Mr. President, this amendment involves a very small amount of money. \nWhile it involves a small amount of money--at least given the kind of \nmoney we are dealing with here--it actually speaks to a very large \nquestion. I think the question has to do with what our priorities are.\n  I think it is a distorted priority to provide the Pentagon with $2.6 \nbillion more than it originally asked for. For the third year in a \nrow--these are one of the few times I can remember in my adult life \nthat the Congress actually wants to provide the Pentagon with more \nmoney than the Pentagon has actually asked for. At the same time, when \nit comes to some really vitally important programs that dramatically \naffect children's lives, we don't make the investment.\n  By way of background: In the welfare bill that passed last Congress, \n$5 million was eliminated from a critically important program, which \nwas a program that on the one hand provided States and school districts \nwith the information they needed--call it an outreach program--about \nhow they could set up a breakfast program, and on the other hand, it \nprovided some badly needed funding for some of the poorer school \ndistricts to actually, for example, purchase refrigerators in order to \nhave milk.\n  It is difficult to understand how this could have been cut, \nespecially given the heralded success of the school breakfast program. \nSome things I guess we do not know enough about, but we do know that a \nnutritious breakfast really is important in enabling a child to learn. \nWe also know that if a child is not able to learn, as I said yesterday, \nwhen he or she becomes an adult they may very well not be able to earn. \nThis is a small amount of money that makes a huge difference.\n  So this amendment says that out of a $265 billion Pentagon budget, \nsome $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, can't we authorize \nthe Secretary of Defense to be able to transfer $5 million--$5 \nmillion--for school breakfasts? For what I would call catalyst money \nthat gets necessary information out to the States and school districts \nand some needed assistance by way of refrigerators and resources to \nenable them to expand the school breakfast program.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out by way of context that there are \nstill some 27,000 schools that do not have school breakfast programs \navailable. There are some 8 million vulnerable, low-income children, \ntherefore, who are not able to participate. Too many of those children \ngo to school without having had a nutritious breakfast.\n  This may seem abstract to many of us in the Senate, but it is a very \nconcrete and a very important issue.\n  This amendment has the support of FRAC, the Food Research Action \nCenter, which has a longstanding history of working on childhood hunger \nand nutrition issues. It has the support of the Elementary School \nPrincipals Association, the American School Food Services, and Bread \nfor the World.\n\n  Mr. President, I might point out that these organizations have a \ntremendous amount of credibility for all of us who care about hunger \nand malnutrition. These are organizations that have been down in the \ntrenches for years working on these issues. I don't think anybody can \nquarrel with the values and ethics of Bread for the World and the work \nthat they have done, much of it very rooted in the religious community, \nand the American School Food Services. These are food service workers. \nThese are the people who know what it means when they can't provide a \nnutritious breakfast to low-income students.\n  This is a special endorsement for me because my mother was a food \nservice worker.\n  What the Elementary School Principals Association is saying by \nendorsing this amendment is simply this: If a child hasn't had a \nnutritious breakfast, how is that child going to be able to learn?\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about the extent of hunger \nand the scope of the problem. This is from the Food Research Action \nCommittee.\n  Approximately 4 million American children under the age of 12 go \nhungry, and approximately 9.6 million are in risk of hunger. According \nto estimates based on the results of the most comprehensive study ever \ndone on childhood hunger in the United States--this was the community \nchildhood hunger education project--based on the results of over 5,000 \nsurveys of families with incomes below 185 percent of poverty, applied \nto the best available national data, FRAC estimates that of the \napproximately 13.6 million children under age 12 in the United States, \n29 percent live in families that must cope with hunger or the risk of \nhunger during some part of one or more months in the previous year.\n  Let me just raise a question with colleagues before we have this \nvote. I just think that this goes to the heart of what we are about. \nThis goes to the heart of priorities.\n  I, as a Senator from Minnesota, tire of the symbolic politics. We \nhave had the conferences on early childhood development. The books and \nthe reports, the magazines, the TV documentaries have come out.\n  We know--let me repeat this--we know that in order for children to do \nwell, it is important that they have a nutritious breakfast. We know \nthat when children are hungry, they don't do well in school. We know, \nas parents and grandparents, that we want to make sure that our \nchildren and our grandchildren start school after having a nutritious \nbreakfast. And we also know, based on clear evidence, that sometimes we \ndon't know what we don't want to know--that there is a significant \namount of children who still go to bed hungry or still wake up in the \nmorning hungry and go to school hungry.\n  Why can't the U.S. Senate make this small investment in this program \nwhich was so important in enabling States and school districts to \nexpand the school breakfast program?\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to bring this amendment to the floor of the \nSenate over and over and over again starting with this defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Let me just read. I am assuming that my colleagues are interested in \nthis information, and I am assuming that we want to address the \nproblem. Let me just talk a little bit about this relationship between \nhunger and nutrition and learning.\n       Undernutrition increases the risk of illness and its \n     severity.\n       Undernutrition has a negative effect on a child's ability \n     to learn . . .\n       Iron deficiency anemia is a specific kind of undernutrition \n     and is one of the most prevalent undernutritional problems in \n     the United States especially among children. Even mild cases \n     lead to shortened attention span, irritability, fatigue and \n     decreased ability to concentrate . . .\n       Hunger leads to nervousness, irritability, disinterest in \n     the learning situation, and an inability to concentrate . . .\n       Hunger . . . disrupt(s) the learning process--one \n     developmental step is lost, and it is difficult to move on to \n     the next one.\n       A United States Department of Agriculture study of the \n     lunch and breakfast programs demonstrated that these programs \n     make nutritional improvements in children's diets.\n\n  I could go on and on, but--I see my colleague from Arizona in the \nChamber--I will try to summarize. Let me just make it clear that the \ndata is out there. And over and over again, in report after report \nafter report, we see clearly that malnourished children are not going \nto do well in school, and we know that 8 million low-income children \nare not able to participate because there is no School Breakfast \nProgram.\n  We had a $5 million USDA outreach program that enabled school \ndistricts to get started, provided them with badly needed information, \nprovided them with refrigerators if they needed that, and we eliminated \nit. And at the same time we have a Pentagon budget that is $2.6 billion \nmore than the Pentagon asked.\n  We all say we care about children. We are all referring to these \nstudies that say children have to do well in school, we are talking \nabout the importance of good nutrition, and here we have an opportunity \nto make a difference.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to over and over again come to the floor \nwith amendments that speak to this question. One more time, just in \nterms of looking at the endorsements for this amendment, we have \nendorsements from FRAC, which is Food Research and Action Center--FRAC \nhas been as involved in children's nutritional issues as any \norganization I know--the Elementary School Principals Association--they \nare saying to us, colleagues, at least make sure that children are able \nto have a nutritious breakfast. I think the elementary school \nprincipals know something about learning and something about children \nat this young age--American School Food Services and Bread for the \nWorld.\n  I hope we will have strong support for this amendment.\n  I point out by way of conclusion that if you look at participation in \nthe School Breakfast Program from 1976 to 1996 --and remember, once \nupon a time, I say to my colleagues, we used to think this program was \nonly for rural areas, for students with long bus rides, students who \nwere not going to be able to eat at home. Now what we find is the \nreality that in many of these families there are split shifts, \ndifferent shifts, both parents working, and all too often these kids in \nurban areas and suburbs come to school and they really have not had a \nnutritious breakfast.\n  We saw a good increase in participation in the School Breakfast \nProgram from 1976 to 1996, but now what has happened as a result of \neliminating this small $5 million outreach program is there is \ntremendous concern from USDA all the way to the different child \nadvocacy organizations that the participation is going to begin to \ndecline.\n  So here is an opportunity, colleagues, to invest a small amount of \nmoney in the basic idea that each child ought to have the same \nopportunity to reach his or her full potential. This is an opportunity \nfor all of us to come through for these vulnerable children, \nunderstanding full well--and I know my colleague from Arizona is out \nhere, but I say to him and this really is my conclusion--understanding \nfull well that, indeed, there is a linkage to reform and to the work \nthat he and others are doing on trying to get the money out of \npolitics. There are a number of us who are absolutely convinced we have \nto act on this agenda. That is to say these children and these families \nare not the heavy hitters; they are not the big players; they are not \nthe givers; they do not have the big lobbyists; they all too often are \nfaceless and voiceless, and that it is profoundly wrong. I hope to get \n100 votes for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before I call up my amendment, I wish to respond to my \nfriend from Minnesota for just a moment on his amendment. I preface my \nremarks by saying I know of no more passionate or compassionate Member \nof this body than the Senator from Minnesota, nor do I believe that \nthere is anyone in this body who articulates as well as he the plight \nof those who, as he pointed out, may be underrepresented here in this \nbody in our deliberations. I have grown and developed over the years a \ngreat respect and even affection for the Senator from Minnesota because \nof my admiration for his incredible commitment to serving those who may \nnot always have a voice.\n  But I say to the Senator from Minnesota that this amendment, like \nmany others, is what I call the Willie Sutton syndrome. When the famous \nbank robber was once asked why he robbed banks, he said, ``Because \nthat's where the money is.'' And time after time I see amendments that \nare worthwhile and at times, as the Senator from Minnesota just \narticulated, compelling, but they come out of funds that are earmarked \nfor national defense. In my view, that is not an appropriate way to \nspend defense money.\n  I would also quickly point out that this is not the first time it has \nhappened. There are literally billions of dollars now that we spend out \nof defense appropriations and authorization that have absolutely \nnothing to do with defending this Nation's vital national security \ninterests, again because of the Willie Sutton syndrome. Although I \nadmire and appreciate the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, I \nwould oppose it, not because of its urgency but because of its \ninappropriate placement on a defense appropriations bill. And I would \nalso like to work with the Senator from Minnesota when the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill comes to the floor to see if we cannot provide that \nfunding, which the Senator from Minnesota appropriately points out is \nnot a great deal of money given the large amounts of money we deal with \nand also considering the importance and urgency of the issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield at this moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Minnesota \nfor a comment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from Minnesota for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. The respect is mutual.\n  I just wanted to say--it was going to be a question, but I can just \nmake a comment instead--as a matter of history, the School Lunch \nProgram was created by the Congress 50 years ago, and I quote, ``As a \nmeasure of national security to safeguard the health and well-being of \nthe Nation's children.'' It was a direct response to the fact that many \nof the young men who were drafted in World War II were rejected due to \nconditions arising from nutritional deficiencies. So there is, in fact, \na direct linkage to national defense.\n  It is, in fact, very much a national security issue to make sure that \nchildren have full nutrition and that we do not end up with men and \nwomen later on who have not been able to learn, not been able to earn \nand may, in fact, not even be healthy enough to qualify to serve our \nNation.\n  So it is an interesting history, and I just wanted my colleague to \nknow that this program is very much connected to national security.\n  My second point is I too look forward to working with my colleague in \nthe future. But I hope to win on this amendment now. This is simply a \nmatter of saying, look, we have a budget\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nthat is $2.6 billion over what the Pentagon asked. There have been \nplenty of studies which have pointed out excesses in the defense \nbudget. Can we not at least authorize the Secretary of Defense to \ntransfer this $5 million.\n  And then, finally, I say to all my colleagues that I think there is \ngoing to come a point in time where people cannot--and I know the \nSenator from Arizona is not trying to do this--but people cannot say, \nwell, we shouldn't vote for this now; we can't vote for this now; we \nwon't vote for this now; there will be a more appropriate place; there \nwill be a more appropriate time. And I find that when it comes to all \nthese issues that have to do with how can we refurbish and renew and \nrestore our national vow of equal opportunity for every child, the vote \nalways gets put off. It always gets put in parenthesis. So I absolutely \ntake what my friend from Arizona said in good faith. I look forward to \nworking with him. But I do think that on this bill, on this amendment, \nthis is the time to vote for such a small step for a good many very \nvulnerable children in our country.\n  I thank my colleague for his graciousness.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 705\n\n      (Purpose: To authorize base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendments and ask that the clerk call up amendment No. 705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Coats, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 705.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize two \nadditional base closure rounds in 1999 and the year 2001 consistent \nwith the recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review, known as \nthe QDR. The amendment authorizes a process which is identical to the \nprocess established in 1990 for the last three BRAC rounds. The \namendment also contains language which addresses the politicization in \nthe last BRAC process which permitted the President to implement \nprivatization in place at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases.\n  I might point out that I am working with the Senator from Texas [Mr \nGramm], in trying to frame language to modify the amendment at the \nappropriate time which would allow the Secretary of Defense to \nprivatize where it can be proven to be of benefit to the taxpayer. We \nare still working on that legislation.\n  Mr. President, we need to authorize additional base closure rounds to \ncorrect a current imbalance in force structure and \ninfrastructure. After four base closing rounds, only 21 percent of the \nmilitary installations in the continental United States have been \nreduced. Our force structure, however, will have been reduced by over \n36 percent by the time that quarterly defense review recommendations \nare complete. Obviously, retaining excess base infrastructure is \nunnecessary with a smaller military force and wastes scarce defense \nresources that are essential to future military modernization.\n\n  I think it is important to frame the debate about this amendment in \nthe terms of the realistic approach we have to take to future defense \nbudgets. I do not believe there is any of us here, barring a national \nsecurity emergency, who believes we are going to see increases in \ndefense spending, certainly not increases in defense spending which \nwould justify the size of our infrastructure as it exists today. It \njust is not possible, in a period, in real terms, of declining defense \nbudgets, to maintain this infrastructure and, at the same time, \nmodernize our force and provide the men and women in the military with \nthe necessary tools to fight and to win any future conflict with a \nminimization of casualties.\n  I am very confident that the United States has emerged at the end of \nthe cold war as the world's No. 1 superpower. I don't think there is \nany doubt about that. But I also think it is important to point out \nthat we are seeing problems within the military that some of us, with \nthe benefit of experience and old age, recognize as having happened \nbefore. We are now seeing a failure to meet our recruitment goals for \nour All Volunteer Force. We are now seeing a derogation of our \nreadiness capabilities in parts of the military establishment. We \nclearly are not modernizing the force in a way that will give us the \nability to maintain our technological edge, which has made us the \nworld's No. 1 superpower and won the magnificent victory of the Persian \nGulf war.\n  So, if you accept the premise that there will be at best a leveling \nof defense spending, and certainly realistically speaking a decline, at \nleast in terms of inflation if not worse, then there really is no \nargument against closing more bases. I have heard some very interesting \narguments and we will hear on the floor some interesting arguments \nagainst base closure. One that has some legitimacy is that, either in \nreality or by perception, the last base closing round was politicized \nby the President of the United States by privatizing in place two major \nbases, both of them with very large electoral votes. I wish that had \nnot happened. It has caused an enormous amount of acrimony and division \nwithin this body, within America, within the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. And this particular reauthorization of further BRAC rounds \nwill not allow a privatization in place to take place. So it will be \nwell, I am sure, by some, to lament the politicization of the process \nas took place--or the perception that it took place, depending on which \nside you are on in the argument--of the last BRAC process.\n  But it does not change the reality. It does not change the reality \nthat we have a significant imbalance between operating forces and \ninfrastructure. In other words, we don't need the number of bases that \nwe have in our defense establishment in order to match up to the \nfighting forces that we must maintain. If we maintain that base \nstructure, it will siphon more and more funds unnecessarily into a base \nstructure and away from the much needed funding, such as pay raises, \nsuch as operations and maintenance, such as training funds, such as \nmodernization of force, such as recruitment, such as, for example, \naddressing the problem we are seeing right now in aviation in the \nmilitary, an exodus of pilots from the military to go with the \nairlines. One of the reasons is pilots are putting pen to paper and \nfiguring out that after a short period of time financially they will be \nbetter off as airline pilots than as military pilots.\n  If you couple that with ever-increasing deployments and separation \nfrom family and home, this is causing a hemorrhaging from our most \nhighly skilled and highly trained branches of our military.\n  Another argument you are going to hear is that we are spending too \nmuch money on other functions, such as peacekeeping. All of us regret \nthat we have had to spend--I believe the estimates are now up to \nsomewhere around $7.5 billion or $8 billion on peacekeeping in Bosnia. \nI regret that, too. I hope that by next June 30 the United States will \nnot only be out of Bosnia militarily but also financially. I will bend \nevery effort that I can, short of jeopardizing the lives of those young \nmen and women and short of provoking another conflict in the region \nwhich may cost the United States more in the long run, but I will do \neverything in my power to see that we stop spending that money on \npeacekeeping.\n  But what in the world is the connection between the money we are \nspending on peacekeeping and the base infrastructure? What is the \npoint? There is none, because whether we had a large or small \nestablishment, we would still be spending too much money on \npeacekeeping.\n  So, I respect the arguments that will come in opposition to this \namendment. Those are the two primary arguments. But I fail to see the \nrelation between those arguments and what we have to do in the national \ninterest.\n\n  One of the interesting things that has happened since the end of the \ncold war is that we see very little, if any, interest in national \nsecurity issues and national defense on the part of the American \npublic. I think in some ways that\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nis good news, because the American people feel content. They do not see \na threat to our security out on the horizon. And, although that \nsentiment does not prevail when Americans are killed in places like \nSomalia and others, generally speaking there is no urgent feeling on \nthe part of the American people that we need to spend, not only not \nmore, but even as much as we are spending on national defense.\n  It is also true, however, that we do have to maintain a certain \nlevel, otherwise we will not maintain our position in the world. It is \nalso true in my view that, if we don't wish to be the world's No. 1 \nsuperpower, then it is a very valid question as to who, then, do we \nexpect to be the world's No. 1 superpower? Because other nations, I \nthink, would be perfectly willing to do so.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter to Chairman Strom Thurmond, and I \nquote from it:\n\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live. We ask your assistance in addressing this \n     difficult issue.\n       Sincerely, John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff; Joseph W. Ralston, Vice Chairman; Dennis \n     Reimer, General, United States Army, Chief of Staff; Jay L. \n     Johnson, Admiral, U.S. Navy, Chief of operations; Ronald R. \n     Fogleman, General, United States Air Force; Charles Krulak, \n     General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter and a letter \nI will read in a few minutes from the Secretary of Defense be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) \n     appropriately notes, achieving the type of force this country \n     will need in the 21st century requires significant increases \n     in our investment accounts. Given other pressures on the \n     federal budget, we must make every effort to find the funds \n     within the Department of Defense budget.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure \n     has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR \n     reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the \n     department will have been reduced by over 36 percent.\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live.\n       We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph W. Ralston,\n       Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Dennis J. Reimer,\n       General, U.S. Army Chief of Staff.\n     Ronald R. Fogleman,\n       General, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff.\n     John M. Shalikashvili,\n       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Jay L. Johnson,\n       Admiral, United States Navy Chief of Naval Operations.\n     Charles C. Krulak,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: As you consider the Fiscal Year 1998 National \n     Defense Authorization Bill, I urge you to add a provision \n     that would permit the Department to conduct two additional \n     base closure and realignment rounds, in FY99 and FY01. \n     Reducing excess infrastructure was an essential element of \n     the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The Department has \n     already reduced its overseas base structure by almost 60 \n     percent and must now bring its domestic base structure into \n     balance with its force structure.\n       With the expiration of the previous BRAC legislation, the \n     Department needs a process to close or realign excess \n     military installations. Even after four rounds of base \n     closures, we have eliminated only 21 percent of our U.S. base \n     structure while force structure will drop by 36 percent by \n     FY03. The QDR concluded that additional infrastructure \n     savings were required to close this gap and begin to reduce \n     the share of the defense budget devoted to infrastructure. \n     Base closings are an integral part of this plan. The QDR \n     found that the Department has enough excess base structure to \n     warrant two additional rounds of BRAC, similar in scale to \n     1993 and 1995.\n       The Department estimates two additional base closure rounds \n     would result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion \n     annually. These savings are critical to the Department's \n     modernization plans. We must modernize our force structure \n     over the long term, laying the groundwork now for the \n     platforms and technologies our forces need in the future. \n     Without the ability to modernize, we would face future \n     threats with obsolete forces. Additionally, the Department \n     will continue to waste resources by maintaining excess \n     military installations, impacting readiness.\n       As you may know, when I was in the Senate, a base in my \n     state was closed as a result of the 1991 BRAC. Therefore, \n     making a recommendation for further BRAC rounds is not \n     something I take lightly. However, the Service Chiefs all \n     believe that additional BRAC rounds are necessary. Further, \n     there have been many communities which have been successful \n     in their base reuse efforts. I am enclosing, for your \n     consideration, additional information on BRAC, the views of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff and community success stories \n     including a New York Times piece on how Charleston survived \n     the closing of the Charleston Naval Base.\n       I would greatly appreciate your support for an amendment to \n     authorize additional base closures and would be pleased to \n     answer any questions or to discuss this matter with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n       Enclosure\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not think we can lightly ignore--or \nnot seriously consider, I guess is a better way of saying it--this \nletter from the individuals that we have asked to lead our military. \nEvery one of these individuals knows the pain and hardship that comes \nabout when a base is closed. But each of these individuals has been \ncharged by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to \nrun our military establishment. And all of those individuals feel, not \njust supportive of what Secretary Cohen is saying, but obviously that \nthis is a very important issue if they are going to be able to carry \nout their responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Bill Cohen, former Senator Bill Cohen, whom we all know quite \nwell. Secretary of Defense Cohen says:\n\n       Reducing excess infrastructure was an essential element of \n     the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Department has already \n     reduced its overseas base structure by almost 60 percent and \n     must now bring its domestic base structure into balance with \n     its force structure.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Base closings are an integral part of this plan. The QDR \n     found the Department has enough excess base structure to \n     warrant two additional rounds of BRAC, similar in scale to \n     1993 and 1995.\n       The Department estimates two additional base closure rounds \n     would result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion \n     annually. These savings are critical to the Department's \n     modernization plans.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       These savings are critical to the Department's \n     modernization plans.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       As you may know, when I was in the Senate, a base in my \n     State was closed as a result of the 1991 BRAC. Therefore, \n     making a recommendation for further BRAC rounds is not \n     something I take lightly. However, the Service Chiefs all \n     believe that additional BRAC rounds are necessary.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it might be appropriate to point out at this \ntime, in light of what I just read from Secretary Cohen's letter, that \nthere are bases in my State that I know will be vulnerable in light of \ntwo additional rounds of base closing. And I know that I will have to \ngo back to my home State, if one of them is closed, and say: Yes, I'm \nthe guy who proposed the amendment for two more rounds of base \nclosings.\n  But I will also tell the people of my State that I did it because I \ntold them, when I sought to serve in this body, that I would act in the \nnational interest first. I would also add that we went through a base \nclosing in my State, in the case of Williams Air Force Base, and I am \nhappy to say, by the way, as has been the case in many bases in many \nareas of the country, that the community has ended up by generating \nmore economic benefit than less. That certainly has not been in all \ncases, but it certainly has been in many.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that there are several urban \nsuccess stories: Charleston Naval Base, Charleston, SC, where currently \nthere are 32 agencies reusing this former naval base; Pease Air Force \nBase, Portsmouth, NH, the establishment of\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\nPease International Tradeport created more than 1,161 new jobs; \nSacramento Army Depot, Sacramento, Packard Bell NEC, the country's \nlargest manufacturer of personal computers, has created more than 5,000 \njobs at this former depot; Williams Air Force Base, now known as the \nWilliams Gateway Airport, quickly emerged as an international aviation \nand aerospace center where more than 20 companies engage in aircraft \nmaintenance; Mather Air Force Base; Gentile Air Force Station, \nKettering, OH; Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino; Fort Benjamin \nHarrison, Indianapolis; Griffiss Air Force Base; Cameron Station, \nAlexandria; Naval Air Station/Naval Aviation Depot Alameda, Alameda--\nthe list goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, there are a large number of success stories. That does \nnot diminish the fact that in some rural areas there will be \nsignificant economic impact. There is no doubt about that. But it also \nis part of the BRAC process that economic impact is a factor in the \ndetermination of a base closing.\n  Mr. President, I have talked too long a time, probably, on this \nissue, because the issue is well known to my colleagues. I am grateful \nto my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, who, along with me in the \nArmed Services Committee deliberations, tried to--we were cosponsors of \nan amendment; had it put in the authorization bill. We were defeated on \na tie vote. I appreciate the efforts of Senator Levin very much on this \nissue.\n  This is a nonpartisan issue. It is an issue that has to do with the \nfuture military capabilities of this country and our ability, over \ntime, if called upon, to defend our vital national security interests. \nIt is not possible to modernize the force, maintain the level of \ntraining and readiness and recruit the qualified men and women in an \nall-volunteer force if we refuse to put back into balance the base \nsupport structure with the fighting forces and operational forces that \nare necessary to do the fighting.\n  My friend from Virginia, Senator Robb, former Marine Corps officer, \ncarries around with him from time to time a chart that is very simple. \nIt shows what he calls the tooth to tail--tooth being the fighting \nforces, the tail being those in support--and how those two lines have \ndiverged steadily over the intervening years. With this BRAC closure we \nmay not cause that trend to reverse, but at least we can level it off. \nI believe we must do so.\n  I know there will be a lot of debate on this amendment, and I hope we \ncan agree to this and move forward.\n  I feel so strongly about this particular issue that unless we do \ninclude a base closing round and unless we do something about the depot \nissue, if I were the President of the United States, I would be very \ntempted to veto this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from California yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg Renden, \nSenator Wellstone's intern, be allowed the privilege of the floor for \nthe duration of the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, in my 4\\1/2\\ years in this body, I have not seen an \neffort as egregious, as badly flawed, as unfair as the base closure \nprocess. I happen to have great respect for the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from Michigan, but I think to adopt this amendment at \nthis time is really only to continue this kind of egregious pursuit. I \nhope, in the course of my remarks, to at least point out some of the \nareas where I find the base closure process very wanting.\n  The Senator from Arizona spoke of States with big electoral clout, \nand I would have to plead guilty. No State has bigger electoral clout \nthan California. I also hasten to point out that no State has suffered \nmore base closures than California--29 bases cited for closure to date, \nand the largest number of jobs lost all across this Nation. In net jobs \nlost to date, California has lost 123,000 net jobs. The next State in \nnet jobs lost is Pennsylvania at 35,000. So we are more than four times \nPennsylvania's job loss. The next highest State in total number of \nbases closed to California is Texas, then Pennsylvania, then New York, \nthen Illinois.\n  If I really believed that this was going to end up being an important \ncost saving for the U.S. military, I would say, ``All right, Dianne, \nyou may represent this State, but, by and large, this is for the best \ninterest of the military.'' I don't believe it, and I have seen no \nevidence to date to corroborate that. I believe strongly that it is \nmuch too soon to begin another round without having some of this \ninformation.\n  We don't know how much the four rounds cost. We don't know how much \nthe four rounds have saved. And we haven't met our commitments to local \ncommunities impacted by these closures, despite the letter of the \ndistinguished Secretary of Defense to the contrary.\n  The CBO--even the CBO--the 1995 BRAC Commission, they both say wait. \nCBO recommends waiting until at least 2001 for another round. They say:\n\n       The Congress should consider authorizing an additional \n     round of base closures if the Department of Defense believes \n     that there is a surplus of military capacity after--\n\n  And I stress the word ``after''--\n\n     all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, \n     however, should follow an interval during which DOD and \n     independent analysts examine the actual impact of the \n     measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like this distinguished body to know that we \ncannot get a single figure from the U.S. Navy as to what the cost \nsavings actually will be from the closures of the Navy bases in the \nState of California. Not a single figure. They will not give us \nestimates. And yet we are going to run ahead, pass another round and \nbegin this same procedure again. It doesn't make any sense.\n\n  Let me quote what the BRAC 1995 commission itself recommended:\n\n       . . . the Commission recommends that the Congress authorize \n     another Base Closure Commission for the year 2001 . . . \n     [giving] military services time to complete the current \n     closures in an orderly fashion--\n\n  Which has not happened, I might allude to--\n\n     while ensuring that the Defense Department has the \n     opportunity in the future to make further reductions . . .\n\n  In addition to these new BRAC rounds beginning too quickly, and \ncontrary to what DOD and supporters of this amendment claim, the base \nreuse process has been cumbersome and has been fraught with \nbureaucratic nightmares.\n  Secretary Cohen's letter of June 24 says that the DOD has assigned \n``transition coordinators'' to each base to solve closure problems and \nto speed the process. Well, let me say, as one Senator from California, \nthis approach has not worked well. I have had to intervene with DOD for \ncommunities in my State numerous times to fight for a community's needs \nin just this past year alone.\n  Let me speak for a moment about environmental costs. I think every \nMember of this body knows that the costs of environmental remediation \nare grossly underestimated, grossly underbudgeted. DOD claims it is \n``empowering communities'' by speeding base cleanup, and I would like \nto give you the results in California of what is termed ``speedy base \ncleanup.''\n  Environmental remediation--that is just remediation--is in place at \nonly 29 percent of the Army BRAC sites; 14 percent of the Navy BRAC \nsites; and 18 percent of the Air Force BRAC sites in my State. \nEnvironmental remediation has not been completed at a single base \nclosed in any of the four rounds in the State of California.\n  This issue is important, because without clean property, transfers by \ndeed cannot occur and individuals cannot get financing. Therefore, if \nthey don't have the bases cleaned up, they can't be effectively and \nfully put to use.\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\n  Let me take the four California instances that the Secretary of \nDefense raises in his letter. First, Castle Air Force Base. That is in \nCalifornia's Central Valley. It was closed by BRAC in 1991. To date, \nthere have been 262 separate sites at this base identified for cleanup; \n65 of these sites have not yet even been evaluated to determine what \ncontaminants are in the soil or water; and none of the sites--none of \nthe sites--on this base, held out as a model, have remediation efforts \ncurrently in place.\n  Second base: Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento was closed by BRAC \nin 1988. To date, there have been 87 sites identified for cleanup; 15 \nhave not yet been evaluated to determine what contaminants are in the \nsoil or the water; and only 39 of the sites, or 44 percent, have \nremediation efforts in place. So 55 percent of the sites haven't even \nbegun to be worked on yet.\n  Another of these sterling examples, Norton Air Force Base in southern \nCalifornia, closed by BRAC in 1988. To date, 25 sites have been \nidentified for cleanup; 6 have not yet been evaluated to determine what \ncontaminants are in the soil or water; and only 10 of the sites, or 40 \npercent, have remediation efforts in place.\n  None of the environmental cleanup has been completed at any of the \nbases anywhere in California. These were bases, Mather and Norton, that \nwere closed nearly 10 years ago, and yet they are not close to being \nclean. No transfer by deed have yet occurred at Norton and a very \nlimited number of these transfers by deed have occurred at Mather.\n  Alameda Naval Air Station and Naval Aviation Depot was closed by BRAC \nin 1993. One of the real problems I had when this was closed was that \nAlameda had 7,600 units of housing that were going to be vacated. The \nfleet, the nuclear carriers were to be moved to Everett and San Diego. \nEverett had no housing for the wings. Housing had to be built. MilCon \nwas not included in the cost of closing that base.\n\n  To date at Alameda, there have been 30 sites identified for cleanup. \nOnly one of these sites has not yet been evaluated to determine what \ncontaminants are in the soil or water. But none of the sites have \nremediation in place. So at Alameda, they have done some \nidentification; they have done no remediation.\n  Sacramento Army Depot was closed by BRAC in 1991, and this is \nprobably California's most successful reuse site to date. They have 16 \nsites identified for cleanup. All cleanup sites have been evaluated, \nand 12 sites, or 75 percent, have remediation efforts in place.\n  It should also be pointed out, there is no deadline for the \ncompletion of environmental cleanup at BRAC sites. Let me, once again, \nmake this point clear. Communities can't reuse a base when they don't \nknow when it is going to be clean. The law has been liberalized to \nallow long-term, interim leases to be granted for dirty property, but \nthese leases are limited in scope, and the potential buyer cannot \nobtain financing under these circumstances, and this has further \ndelayed and deterred base reuse.\n  DOD has given communities estimates as to when their bases will be \nclean, but DOD will not guarantee these completion dates, and every \nyear, environmental cleanup is underfunded and every year it is delayed \neven more.\n  The Air Force estimates that Castle Air Force Base should have \nenvironmental remediation in place by the year 2000 and that it should \nbe complete by 2018. So the total base cannot be transferred into \nprivate reuse at Castle Air Force Base until the year 2018.\n  The Air Force estimates that Mather should have environmental \nremediation in place by 1999 and that this should be complete by the \nyear 2027. So it will take to 2027 for the process to be completed and \nthe base to be transferred.\n  The Air Force estimates that Norton Air Force Base should have \nenvironmental remediation in place by 1999, and that this should be \ncomplete by 2012. So, again, one has to wait for the base to be \ntransferred.\n  DOD is also far behind on the transfer of base closure property, due \nin large part to environmental contamination. In my State, and this is \nthe largest State, only 4 percent of the acreage--4 percent of 79,618 \nacres--have been transferred by deed to new owners.\n  So we are contemplating here a new BRAC closure round when only 4 \npercent of the land covered in California has been deeded to new \nowners. It does not make sense. If one is thinking about the \ncommunities and really means that reuse should work, how can you go \nahead with a new round where you have 80,000 acres of land and only 4 \npercent of them at this stage have been deeded to a local entity?\n  Only 19 percent of these acres have been transferred by long-term \nlease, and a whopping 49 percent are still sitting there with no action \non any kind of transfer having taken place.\n  So one-half of the acreage that has been closed in California has no \nplan for a transfer at this stage, and we are still contemplating a new \nround.\n  Many of these base closure communities are working hard to make the \nbest of their misfortune and many are optimistic about the prospects of \nbase reuse. But before we pile on these additional rounds, let us look \ncandidly at some of the difficulties they are facing.\n  In Tustin, CA, the community is trying to reuse the Tustin Marine \nCorps Air Station. After 14 months of negotiations for an interim lease \nfor one of the large blimp hangars and the loss of nine potential film \ntenants, a lease was approved by the city of Tustin and the Navy's \nSouthwest Engineering Division. When the Pentagon subsequently rejected \nthis lease, the prospective tenant, Walt Disney Productions, simply got \nfed up and left to lease space elsewhere.\n  So here you had a base with a prime potential tenant, and the \nbureaucratic nightmare that has ensued caused it to be rejected, and \nDisney walked off and went somewhere else. So that was the 10th one \nthey lost.\n  At Norton Air Force Base, the Worldpointe Trade Center project that \nSecretary Cohen lauds in his June 24 letter will not happen due to a \nlack of financing. The community has regrouped, though, and now this \nproject will be replaced by an industrial park that will take 5 years \nto build and yield only 40 percent of the jobs hoped for with the trade \ncenter development.\n  At Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento, the Air Force and Sacramento \nCounty have finally reached agreement on the sale of 1,200 housing \nunits. It took four separate appraisals and 5 years of negotiations to \nfinally reach the price of $4.25 million--the same price as the \ncounty's 1993 appraisal.\n  At George Air Force Base in southern California, it took 20 months to \nget a signed economic development conveyance. It was submitted by the \ncommunity in February 1995 and finally signed in 1996.\n  Another EDC at Mare Island Naval Shipyard was submitted in January of \n1996--of 1996--and a year and a half later is still pending. They are \nstill waiting for a decision.\n  The city of Long Beach just completed a negotiated sale with the \nformer Long Beach Naval Hospital. After 18 months of negotiations, the \ncity will have to pay the Navy $8.6 million to buy back this 30-acre \nsite that the city sold to the Navy in 1964 for 10 dollars. So they \nsold it to the Navy for 10 dollars and now they buy it back at $8.6 \nmillion. To make matters worse, the Navy required that the city provide \nthe Navy with a letter of credit to secure two promissory notes to buy \nback the property. This cost the city of Long Beach an additional \n$50,000.\n  Finally, the goal of base closures was to save DOD money so that we \ncould modernize our force. If anybody could come in here and say, look, \nthe Navy has saved x dollars in California by closing bases, I would \nsay, OK, now we know either it was cost efficient or it was not cost \nefficient and we have a sound basis on which to make another judgment.\n  But as I said before, the Navy will not give my office a single \nfigure as to what cost savings can be anticipated from closure of major \nNavy bases in the State of California. Yet, we are going to go about \nanother round today.\n  The GAO and the CBO both say that DOD's estimated savings cannot be \nquantified. GAO and CBO cannot quantify what the military says the \nsavings estimates are.\n\n  DOD has not included the total cost of environmental cleanup in its \nnet savings figures. By 2001, DOD claims\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\nthat it will have saved nearly $14 billion from BRAC. To their credit, \nthey did include the cost of environmental cleanup through 2001. That \nwas $7.3 billion. But they did not include the cost of BRAC cleanup for \nthese sites after 2001. In California alone this will cost another \n$1.56 billion.\n  So, in the costs that have been provided by the military to this \nbody, with California alone it is $1.56 billion shy, short, lacking, \nnot defined, not there; and yet we would go ahead with another round \nregardless of knowing what the true costs and true savings actually \nare.\n  Let us look at how much additional cleanup funding four of five \nCalifornia success stories will need past the year 2001.\n  Castle will require an additional $53.1 million.\n  Mather will require an additional $73.8 million.\n  Norton will require an additional $1.25 million.\n  Alameda Naval Air Station and Naval Aviation Depot will require an \nadditional $73.4 million.\n  None of this is counted before we make the decision. And I am just \ngiving you four bases here--not 29.\n  The true costs of BRAC should include all of these costs related to \nclosure, not just those funded directly by the BRAC account. Until they \ndo, frankly, I will not vote ever for another round. Just because these \ncosts are funded from other Federal accounts does not mean that they \nare any less real.\n  So what is happening, Mr. President, is that they fund some of this \nfrom other accounts and they do not cost them in. So that way the \nmilitary costs look less, but the Federal costs--it is all the same, it \nall comes from the same taxpayer, all goes into the same budget, but it \nis not counted here.\n  DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment grants to base closure \ncommunities for base reuse planning, $125 million. It is not counted \nhere, not counted as a cost. It is a cost? Of course it is a cost.\n  The Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration \ngrants to base closure communities, $371 million. It is not counted \nhere as a cost.\n  FAA grants to establish airports at closed bases, $182 million. It is \nnot counted here.\n  It is like MilCon, except MilCon is in the defense budget. These are \nnot in the defense budget. They are necessary, but not counted.\n  Department of Labor job retraining grants, $103 million. It is not \ncounted in the cost of base closure.\n  So without at least a firm accounting of how much the first four \nrounds of BRAC cost and how much was saved, I cannot and I do not \nbelieve any Member of this body should support a new round.\n  We have moved too fast in closing these bases. We need to look at the \nbottom line. What are these closures costing, not only the Defense \nDepartment, but the FAA, the Department of Commerce, the Department of \nLabor in retraining grants, the Office of Economic Adjustment? What are \nthe costs? And factor those costs in. What are the costs of MilCon for \nall of the rounds? Factor those costs in as well.\n  Later this afternoon it is my understanding that Senator Dorgan will \nbe offering an amendment to propose a study to come up with just this \nvery information. I think to proceed with another round until the study \nis done and until we have the specific information would really be a \nmajor, major mistake.\n  We need to look at operations and maintenance. We need to look at \nmilitary construction, environmental cleanup costs, base reuse costs \nand economic redevelopment costs also funded by the Federal Government, \nunemployment compensation costs, military health care costs and force \nstructure costs. All of this should be looked at, I believe, by an \nindependent agency, figures ascertained on which responsible people can \ndepend, and then another decision can be made on another day about \nanother round.\n  I think this is ill-advised. It is too fast. And it will simply \ncomplicate one flawed procedure with another flawed round.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment which has \nbeen offered by Senator McCain to have an additional two rounds of base \nclosings. I do so for many, many reasons. But let me just cite first \nthat we have a recommendation which is as strong a one as I have ever \nseen from the uniformed military of this country, pleading with us to \nreduce excess baggage, the infrastructure that they no longer need \nbecause it is costing money which is desperately needed elsewhere.\n\n  We cannot successfully do what we need to do for the defense of this \nNation, they are telling us--and I will quote that letter in a moment--\nif we continue to carry excess infrastructure which we simply no longer \nneeded. Now, we are going to hear lots of reasons why it is tough to do \nit and lots of reasons why we should not do it. We will address those \none by one.\n  But when you get a letter, which we have received, signed by the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, every single member, a so-called 24-star letter, \nit does not happen very often around here. But when we get a letter \nfrom General Shalikashvili and the Vice Chairman Joe Ralston, and each \nof the Chiefs signing a letter as succinct and to the point as this one \nis, I think we ought to give it the most serious consideration. We \ncannot just shed this and say, base closing is tough or we cannot prove \nprecisely how much money it saves. We have a pretty good idea, by the \nway, and I will get to that in a moment. But we just cannot simply say, \nbase closings are tough. And they are. Let me tell you, my State knows \nit. Percentagewise, it is one of the 10 hardest hit States with base \nclosings, and we still have facilities where people feel they are at \nrisk.\n  But this is what the letter from the Joint Chiefs says. It is \naddressed to our chairman, Senator Thurmond. I am going to read it all. \nIt is a short letter, but it is very much to the point.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman.\n       As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) appropriately \n     notes, achieving the type of force this country will need in \n     the 21st century requires significant increases in our \n     investment accounts. Given other pressures on the federal \n     budget, we must make every effort to find the funds within \n     the Department of Defense budget.\n       Now that is point one. We have to make every effort we can \n     to find the funds necessary for future investments in the \n     defense of this country inside the defense budget. That is a \n     statement based on reality. It is a statement based on the \n     desire of all of us to get down to a zero deficit and to \n     begin to pay off the national debt. It is a statement based \n     on the reality that the defense budget is not going to grow \n     faster or in a different way than what we have projected in \n     our 5-year defense budget, unless, of course, world \n     circumstances change.\n\n  Then the letter goes on:\n\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure \n     has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR \n     reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the \n     department will have been reduced by over 36 percent.\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live.\n       We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue.\n\n  Now, they are asking our assistance to do something which is \ndifficult, and it is difficult politically, and every one of us knows \nthat. I don't think there is any one of us who has a facility in our \nState that we have not been worried about it, that we have not gone to \nbat for, that we have not been an advocate for and, in some cases, have \nwon a battle for a base and, in other cases, lost a battle for a base.\n  That is one of the reasons we are here, to be advocates for our \nStates, and we do that proudly. I have done that for bases in my State. \nI have won some and I have lost some. We have lost every Strategic Air \nCommand base in my State--all three, gone--and it has been painful. \nThey have been in rural communities. In one case, most recently, up in \nthe Upper Peninsula of Michigan, it was the largest single employer in \nthe Upper Peninsula, Sawyer Air Force.\n  Has the environmental cleanup gone as predicted? It has not gone as \nfast.\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\nHave we struggled to make sure the leases are available to people who \nwant to lease that property? We have; we work with them every day. Is \nit working out OK? It is. Is it tough? It is. Have there been \ndislocations? Yes. But is there any alternative if we are going to do \nour job to come up with the necessary resources to defend this country? \nIs there any alternative but to shed the excess baggage which our Joint \nChiefs are asking us to shed? This is not easy for them, either. Those \nare communities that they have their hearts and souls in. But what they \nare telling us is we must bite this political bullet again if we are \ngoing to save the funds necessary for modernization, for investment \naccounts, for readiness, for the other things which we need to do in \nour defense budget.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review reached the same conclusion. The \nSecretary of Defense has reached the same conclusion. So the amendment \nis simple. It authorizes the same process that we used in 1991, 1993, \nand 1995 for two new rounds in 1999 and 2001. We have changed this \nprocess over the years. We have tried to make the environmental cleanup \nfaster. We worked on the leases to make sure that they be available to \nlease land, even before it was finally cleaned up. We tried to improve \nthe notice requirements, the fairness requirements. We made lots of \nchanges over the years. But to say we are going to not continue to do \nwhat our uniformed military says we must do to avoid wasting billions \nof dollars each year because it is politically difficult or because we \ncannot determine the precise amount, in an audited fashion, of the \nsavings, it seems to me, is inconsistent with the desire of this body \nto protect the Nation's defense.\n  This process has the Secretary of Defense, again, making \nrecommendations to a commission, nominated by the President, confirmed \nby the Senate. During those confirmation hearings, we got into all of \nthe kinds of issues and concerns which each of us has relative to base \nclosing. The commission, after being confirmed by the Senate, reviews \nthese recommendations and makes their own recommendations to the \nPresident. The President then reviews the recommendation, either sends \nthose back to the commission for additional work or forwards them, \nwithout changes, to the Congress, and then the recommendations of the \ncommission go into effect unless disapproved by a joint resolution of \nthe Congress. That is the process.\n  Has it been perfect? It has not. There have been many changes made in \nthis process over the years. This amendment is open to other changes in \nterms of how do we approve the process. But to say that the process is \nnot perfect means we should perfect it. It does not mean that we should \nditch it when it has led to significant savings already and when it is \nessential to lead to additional savings in the future.\n  The case for closing more military bases is simply clear, and it is \ncompelling. From 1989 to 1997, the Department of Defense reduced total \nactive duty military end strength by 32 percent, and that figure will \ngrow to 36 percent by 2003 as a result of the recently completed \nQuadrennial Defense Review, known as the QDR. So we are going to be \nreducing the active end strength, the number of people in our military, \nby 36 percent. But even after the four base closure rounds that are now \ncompleted, the reduction in domestic base structure will be 21 percent. \nSo we have a gap. We have excess. We have surplus. We have baggage we \nmust shed. We have facilities that are no longer being fully used, \nfacilities that are not being run in a way which makes economic sense. \nThese are facilities which we can no longer justify keeping.\n\n  Which are those facilities? Does anyone really believe that we on the \nSenate floor could decide which facilities need to be closed? It was \nthe inability of the Congress to make those kinds of decisions which \nbrought the Base Closure Commission into effect to begin with. We \nrealized a few years back that we could not close bases ourselves. It \nis too difficult politically. There are too many pressures on us. There \nare too many tradeoffs that are possible. So we created a BRAC \ncommission, giving ourselves a final right to veto, but basically \nsaying that this is the only realistic way we are going to downsize the \nunneeded structure.\n  Now, this year, General Shalikashvili, who is our Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, testified before our committee as follows: ``As difficult \nas it is politically, we will have to further reduce our \ninfrastructure. We, perhaps, have more excess infrastructure today than \nwe did when the BRAC process started. In the short run, we need to \nclose more facilities, as painful and as expensive as it is.'' That is \nhis quote.\n  One line in that quote, I hope, if nothing else, will remain with us: \n``We, perhaps, have more excess infrastructure today than we did when \nthe BRAC process started.''\n  Now, both the QDR and the independent National Defense Panel--and \nthis is the group of citizens outside the Defense Department that have \nbeen appointed by the President--both the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, inside the Defense Department, and the independent National \nDefense Panel have concluded that further reductions in DOD \ninfrastructure--that is the base structure of the Department of \nDefense--are essential to free up the money that we need to modernize \nour forces.\n  On May 23, Secretary Cohen wrote to the chairman, Senator Thurmond, \nand to me, asking the Congress to act this year on his request to \nauthorize two additional base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001. Though \nwe will not get the final report of the National Defense Panel until \nlater this year, they do have an interim report dated May 15 which \naccompanies the Quadrennial Defense Review. This is what the outside \ncitizens panel said about base closures:\n\n       We endorse the Secretary's plan to request authority for \n     two additional rounds of base closure and realignment. We \n     strongly urge the administration to support legislation that \n     will start this process in 1999 and encourage Congress to \n     approve the request despite constituency challenges.\n\n  Several weeks ago, the Armed Services Committee received a letter, as \nI indicated, which all six members of the Joint Chiefs signed. We do \nnot get these 24-star letters every day or every week or even every \nyear. I am not sure I can even remember the last 24-star letter that we \nhave received. But now the Chiefs, every one of them, say that the \ncommittee should reduce base structure supported by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  While I have read this letter, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. \nPresident, that a copy of the letter from the Chiefs be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman. As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) \n     appropriately notes, achieving the type of force this country \n     will need in the 21st century requires significant increases \n     in our investment accounts. Given other pressures on the \n     federal budget, we must make every effort to find the funds \n     within the Department of Defense budget.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure \n     has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR \n     reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the \n     department will have been reduced by over 26 percent.\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live.\n       We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph W. Ralston,\n       Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Dennis J. Reimer,\n       General, United States Army, Chief of Staff.\n     Ronald R. Fogleman,\n       General, United States Air Force, Chief of Staff.\n     John M. Shalikashvili,\n       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Jay L. Johnson,\n       Admiral, United States Navy, Chief of Naval Operations.\n     Charles C. Krulak,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The service chiefs have also made the case for shrinking \nour base structure. In testimony before the committee, General Reimer \nsaid:\n\n       We cut 36 percent out of the force structure and 21 percent \n     of the infrastructure in\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\n     the Army. I think we need to balance those two out or we are \n     going to pay a heavy price that we should not have to pay.\n\n  The testimony of the service chiefs makes this point very clear. The \nissue is not base closures or no base closures. The issue is either we \nshrink the base structure or we are going to have to cut modernization. \nIf we make the wrong choice and do not close any more bases, this \nproblem is not going to go away. If we keep excess bases open and try \nto protect modernization by cutting the size of our forces instead, \nthat will further increase the amount of excess base structure, which \nwill, in turn, increase the pressure to close bases.\n  This problem is not going to go away. This problem will get worse if \nwe delay it. If we cut forces instead of closing bases, that will \ninevitably lead to increased operating costs and increases days away \nfrom home for the smaller number of personnel who will be left. This \nissue is not going to go away. It will fester and get worse unless we \naddress it. It will not be easier to determine and make this decision a \nyear from now or 2 years from now than it is now.\n  The reason there is so much pressure coming from our defense \nestablishment to authorize more base closures is because the Defense \nDepartment understands that reductions in the base structure are \nessential to the modernization of our forces. Every dollar we spend to \nkeep bases open that we do not need--excess bases--is a dollar we \ncannot spend on modernization programs that our military forces do \nneed.\n  As Secretary Cohen said in his preface to the QDR report:\n\n       In essence, our combat forces are headed toward the 21st \n     century, but our infrastructure is stuck in the past. We \n     cannot afford this waste of resources in an environment of \n     tough choices and fiscal constraint. We must shed weight.\n\n  This is not just a choice which the Defense Department faces. This is \nnot just Secretary Cohen's problem. This is our problem, and it is a \nproblem which will get worse unless we make this decision earlier \nrather than later.\n  We cannot just tell the Department of Defense, ``Reform yourself.'' \nThe Department of Defense can reform if they want to, which they do, \nbut they can't reform if we can't let them. It requires legislative \naction. As General Fogleman, who is Chief of Staff of the Air Force, \nsaid to our committee, ``Getting lean and mean is no easy feat. We can \nbe mean if we have to, but we need your help to get lean.''\n  Make no mistake, if we don't act this year to approve and to \nauthorize additional base closure rounds, there will not be any \nadditional base closures before the turn of the century. No bases have \nbeen or will be closed outside of the Base Closure Commission process \ncontained in this amendment, and every year we delay facing this issue, \nwe delay achieving the potential savings that we need to modernize our \nforces.\n  Now, the argument has been made that we can't prove exactly how much \nprevious base closures have saved. I agree that we don't know exactly \nhow much base closures have saved. We can't audit it; it is not that \nprecise. But I don't know of any disagreement over the fact that \nclosing bases has saved, and will save, substantial amounts of money. \nThe savings don't always come as quickly as the Department of Defense \noriginally forecasts, for a number of reasons. But the savings have \nbeen there, and they are documented.\n  The CBO concluded in that same report, which was read before, that \n``BRAC actions will result in significant long-term savings.'' Now, the \nDepartment of Defense makes an estimate on savings. These estimates are \navailable for Members of the Senate. They are based on 100 or so \nreports of base closings. Their estimate is that implementing the BRAC \nactions in the first four rounds will result in $23 billion in one-time \nimplementation costs--that is the cost--and this is offset by savings \nof $36.5 billion--that's the savings--for a total net savings of $13.5 \nbillion. So that is between 1990 and 2001 when the implementation of \nthe first four rounds is supposed to be concluded. That is a net \nsavings--deducting the investment from the gross savings--of $13.5 \nbillion. That's what Secretary Cohen has written us. That is what he \nhas testified to. That is the best information that is available.\n  Secretary Cohen estimates that each of the additional BRAC rounds \nthat he is asking the Congress to approve will save $1.4 billion a year \nonce they are fully implemented. That is comparable to the savings that \nwill be achieved from the 1991 and 1995 rounds.\n  Maybe 5 years from now we are going to find that the actual savings \nfrom the first four rounds of base closures will be slightly smaller or \nslightly larger than the $5.6 billion I have referred to. But there is \nno question that there are large, ongoing savings from shrinking our \nbase structure. Before the first base closure round, we had \napproximately 500 domestic military bases. When all of the bases from \nthe first four BRAC rounds are closed, we will have about 400 bases. So \n80 percent of the bases will remain after all four BRAC rounds are \nimplemented, even though we will have seen a reduction of one-third of \nour force structure.\n  Now, the exact amount that we are saving is impossible to prove--\nthese are approximations and estimates--for lots of reasons, including \nthe fact that these savings represent money we would have spent to pay \ncivilians we no longer have and to operate bases that we no longer \nhave. So they are, by definition, estimates; we can't audit them. But I \ncannot imagine someone trying to argue that we are not going to save \nlarge sums of money by operating 400 bases instead of 500 bases. That \nis 100 fewer bases at which we have to pay for electricity, heat, \nwater, telephone service, maintenance, and security.\n  These BRAC savings, Mr. President, are an important part of the funds \nthat are going to finance the future modernization of the armed \nservices that will keep our military the most technologically advanced \nand lethal fighting force in the world.\n  Some people have expressed concern that funds from base closures may \nnot go toward modernization. But this amendment includes a provision \nthat would require the Department to ensure that all savings that come \nfrom future base closings go toward modernization programs.\n  Now, over the last few months, another issue has been raised, an \nissue relative to the question of privatization in place. Some of our \ncolleagues complain about the implementation of the 1995 Base Closure \nCommission recommendation with respect to the closing of two Air Force \ndepots, at Kelly and Sacramento. There are clearly very strong feelings \non this issue, and understandably so. I don't agree with those who say \nthat what happened, however, in 1995, whatever one's view of those \nevents are, somehow justifies refusing to ever close any more bases.\n  My own view is that we should let the market decide the most \nefficient way to redistribute the workload of these two closing depots \nand that the way to let the market decide that is through a fair and \nopen competition.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense John White testified before our Readiness \nSubcommittee in May that the Department's policy is no longer to \nprivatize the work of these two closing depots in place, but to compete \ntheir workload between the public depots and the private sector. \nSecretary Cohen wrote a letter to the majority and minority leaders \nreaffirming the Department's policy of competing this work. He also \ntestified before our committee that, ``If you disagree with giving the \ncommission this kind of discretion''--he was referring to privatization \nin place-- ``then you can always restrict it in the future.''\n  That is what the amendment does. To address the problem of \nprivatization in place for future BRAC rounds, this amendment includes \nlanguage that would allow the Secretary of Defense to privatize in \nplace the workload of a closing military installation only when it is \nexplicitly recommended by the Base Closure Commission as either the \ncorrect way to close the base or as one option.\n  But whatever our view is of privatization in place at the two air \nlogistic centers that were closed by the 1995 Base Closure Commission, \nthat is no reason to cut off our nose to spite our face and keep excess \nbase structures open at a huge, unjustifiable cost in the future.\n\n  As I said a moment ago, I know personally how painful the base \nclosing process is. Michigan never had a very large military presence, \nbut we rank seventh among all States in the percentage of total BRAC \njob losses. So we\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\nknow in our State, and we know that we have a few additional facilities \nthat some people think could be at risk.\n  If we are serious about modernizing our military forces and if we are \nserious about maintaining the qualitative technological edge that we \nhave, then we have no choice but to reduce our infrastructure costs so \nthat they are in line with our foresight.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs are right. We need to \nclose more bases if we are going to modernize our forces, and we are \nnot going to be able to do that unless this amendment is adopted.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nbehalf of the overall defense bill and to give credit where credit is \ndue in regard to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nThurmond, and the distinguished ranking member from Michigan, Senator \nLevin. I want to pay tribute to their leadership. I think the committee \ndid great work, and there was much bipartisan agreement. I think we had \na very difficult task in this regard.\n  I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to a study called \n``America's National Interests'' by the Commission on America's \nNational Interest. It was about a year ago, and I served on the \ncommission with some very qualified people who have a great deal of \nexpertise in regard to defense matters. The cochairs were Robert \nEllsworth, Andrew Goodpaster, and Rita Hauser. The study was done by \nthe Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard University \nand also by the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom and the Rand Corp.\n  Basically, they had an executive summary that pretty well said this: \nNo. 1, American foreign policy and American national interests don't \nreally represent a very high blip on the national attention radar \nscreen. They said America was adrift. ``In the wake of the Cold War, \nthe American public's interest in foreign policy has declined sharply \nand political leaders have been pressed to attend to immediate domestic \nconcerns.'' Certainly that is true. ``After four decades of unusual \nsingle-mindedness in containing Soviet expansion, we have seen five \nyears of ad hoc fits and starts.'' This was last year, remember. ``If \nit continues, this drift will threaten our values, our fortunes, and \nindeed our lives.''\n  I think the committee took an important first step in trying to end \nthis drift. They mentioned confusion and the lack of a national \nstrategy as we try to determine how much money to spend on defense, \nwhich, after all, is the first obligation of the Federal Government.\n  So having said that, I want to again thank Senator Levin and Senator \nThurmond for their leadership. However, I must rise in opposition to \nthe amendment as argued for by Senator Levin and as proposed by Senator \nMcCain. I am talking about BRAC. I am talking about the effort to, \nobviously, reduce the excess infrastructure that we have in regard to \nour national defense system.\n  I want to make it very clear and I want to really emphasize that I do \nnot support--and I don't know of anybody in the Senate or, for that \nmatter, in the House of Representatives who supports--carrying excess \nor unproductive capacity in our military infrastructure. After all, how \ncould anybody stand up here and say that they were supporting that? \nHaving said that, I don't think we should sign onto another BRAC \nprocess until we are confident that the process will be done without \nmaking it a political football or without receiving an answer to \nseveral very fundamental questions, which I would like to go into.\n  No. 1, we need to certify what is meant by overcapacity. Everybody \nseems to agree that there is excess capacity in the structure of the \nmilitary. I think that is obvious. Senator Levin just went over that. \nBut if you ask different people where exactly that excess \ninfrastructure exists, a variety of answers will certainly be given. \nMany argue that there is a great disparity between the reduction of \nmilitary end-strength, down 36 percent--Senator McCain mentioned that. \nEvery proponent of the BRAC process and of this amendment will tell you \nthat the military end-strength is down 36 percent and reduction of \nmilitary base structure is down 21 percent. Now, there is a \nrelationship between these two. I know that. But there is no numerical \ncorrelation that would define what percentage of base closure we should \nstrive for. That is extremely important. If there were such a numerical \ncorrelation, closing any of our bases would help bring the percentage \nin line.\n\n  I think common sense tells us that it is a lot more complex than \nsimple percentages. If we all agree that excess capacity exists--and I \nthink we do--I think that the Department of Defense, before we approve \nsomething like this amendment, should develop a certified list defining \nthat excess capacity. What's wrong with that? I might add, I think we \nprobably have that list already prepared. Why not really delineate the \namount of excess and the priority of eliminating that excess and the \ndifficulty of restoring the capability if required by a military \noperation? Let me repeat that. Let us try to delineate the amount of \nexcess and the priority of eliminating that excess and, most important, \nthe difficulty of restoring the capability if required by a military \noperation.\n  Once you lose the base, once you lose that infrastructure, like \nHumpty-Dumpty, it is off the wall, gone; you can't regain it. It is not \nreasonable to agree to a BRAC if we don't fully understand the nature \nand location and the amount of the reported excess.\n  I have the same letter from Secretary Cohen and the letter \nillustrated on the minority side from the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nexpressing their support for a BRAC. Secretary Cohen, a good friend, a \nformer colleague, said this: ``With the expiration of the previous BRAC \nlegislation, the Department needs a process to close or realign excess \nmilitary installations. Even after four rounds of base closures, we \nhave eliminated only 21 percent''--here we go again--``of our U.S. base \nstructure while force structure will drop by 36 percent by fiscal year \n2003.''\n  Let me repeat again what I think is a fallacy. Secretary Cohen's \nletter--I know it is not his intent, but his letter suggests the direct \ncorrelation, again in percentage points, between base closures of 21 \npercent and force structure reductions of 36 percent. There is no \ndirect correlation between the reduction of troops and how many bases \nshould be cut. There is, of course, a connection, but to suggest there \nis some kind of a mathematical correlation is false. It is misleading. \nExactly how we could get into indiscriminate cutting of facilities--the \nassumption of such a simple-minded statement is that all bases are \nequal.\n  Senator Levin has just indicated that of 100 bases remaining, and \nthere is a need to reduce base structure by perhaps 15 percent, that \nany 15 bases would do the trick. Unfortunately, this is the exact \nargument--down 36 percent in troops but only 21 percent in bases--which \nwas made in behalf of this whole argument. It is the very reason we \nneed to understand which bases are in excess and which bases support \nthe strategy. If it is 15 percent and you cut 15 bases out of 100, if \nthat doesn't have anything to do with what kind of a base it is, what \nkind of force is there, or what the mission of the base is, I don't \nthink that correlation really makes any sense.\n  Let's talk about the type of facilities to be considered once the DOD \ndevelops a certified list of excess capacity, and then what specific \ntypes of facilities to be considered for closure should be provided. If \nthe Department of Defense demonstrates that certain types of facilities \ndo not represent excess capacity, it doesn't make any sense to include \nthem in the process. Why would we want to do that?\n  The effect of this action would shorten and focus the BRAC process. \nWe would have successful BRAC, we would eliminate a lot of the \nheadaches, pain and suffering, and the politics that the proponents of \nthis amendment always talk about. Just as important, it would let those \ncommunities with military facilities as neighbors know whether they \nneed to be concerned or not and prevent them from spending large sums \nof money to help save their bases. That is what happens.\n  As soon as this amendment is passed--I hope it does not; the \ncommittee did not pass it and the House of\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\nRepresentatives did not pass it--every community next to a base in \nAmerica will hire a consultant, spending large sums of money, and will \nend up in BRAC purgatory. It is not necessary. We could shorten the \nprocess and get this job done with a better process.\n  Let's talk about the criteria to be used for closure recommendations.\n  There needs to be a full discussion of the criteria used for the BRAC \nprocess. I have the old criteria here somewhere, but, obviously, this \nisn't the criteria that is going to be used. This is the former base \nrealignment and closure criteria. I thought the new criteria were going \nto be judged on the Bottom-Up Review and the QDR and the National \nDefense Panel. The National Defense Panel hasn't made a comment on \nwhere we are headed in terms of national defense strategy. We don't \nhave the criteria yet. I think we are putting the cart before the \nhorse.\n  So, at any rate, I think we need a full discussion of the criteria \nused for the BRAC process to ensure the results of the process are \nconsistent with the strategy, as I have indicated, of the Bottom-Up \nReview and the QDR. For example, it makes little sense to me to use the \nsame criteria of the last BRAC since we have substantially altered the \nmilitary since then and our strategy has been changed. That is why we \nare going through this. A critical analysis of the criteria and their \nweight in the process is required. We should not inadvertently cut meat \nfrom our capacity if fat exists somewhere else simply because the \ncriteria we used is flawed.\n  I want to talk about cost for just a moment. It seems to me, despite \nthe claims of, I think, $2.7 billion that the letter indicated that we \nare going to save--and I think Senators Levin, McCain, and others \nlisted $13.5 billion by the year 2001--I question that either in \nmagnitude or when those savings will be seen. The whole purpose of this \nprocess, as proposed by the authors of this amendment, is to save the \nprecious defense dollars.\n  Let me point out that we are supposed to be talking about national \nstrategy here. The committee did its best, but in terms of trying to \ndetermine how much we spend on defense in the post-cold-war period, we \nsaid, ``OK, you can have all the strategy you want, but don't spend \nmore than $250 billion.''\n  So it is budget driven and numbers driven, and the whole key argument \nin behalf of this is to save the precious defense dollars and use them \nfor procurement and modernization and quality of life. So you close the \nbases. You save the money. And, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nSecretary, and the proponents of the amendment said, we are going to \nimprove the quality of life, modernization, and procurement.\n  Well, I am not sure that those savings will be there. And, second, I \nwill tell you where the money will go. If we could earmark this money, \nmaybe put it in a lockbox and give the key to Senator Thurmond--I sure \ntrust him as to where the money should go--I might support this. But do \nyou know where the money is going to go? Peacekeeping missions. For \npeacekeeping missions since President Clinton took office: 1993, $2.441 \nbillion; 1994, $1.9 billion; 1995, $2.16 billion; 1996, $3.3 billion; \n1997, projected $3.27 billion. I am not sure that even accounts for \nBosnia.\n\n  We are talking about savings that are going to occur in the outyears. \nAnd, yet, we have been using the peacekeeping fund for modernization \nand readiness and quality of life? That is what has been happening. If \nwe could earmark these savings for all of the very good purposes that \nproponents of this amendment are talking about, it might be one thing. \nBut we are not.\n  So what will happen is that we will go through this whole process \nonly to find out that we are putting a lot of people into what I call \nBRAC purgatory only to find out that we don't have the separation by \nthe people who really do that right now between those bases that are \nneeded and not, and also the problem with cost savings only to find out \nthat it will be spent for peacekeeping.\n  I am not opposed to peacekeeping in every instance. But it seems to \nme in terms of our national strategy and in America's national \ninterest, I am not sure that that has been simply well spent.\n  I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nFeinstein of California, and I would like to say that I know that it is \nthe right thing to do in regard to base closures. Nobody in this \nSenate--nobody anywhere--is for saving excess infrastructure. That is \njust not a possible position, and we shouldn't do that.\n  I might add in closing, Mr. President, that I am one who is concerned \nabout some of my colleagues who with some degree of condescending \nunderstanding look at me and say, ``Well, now, you know, we all have \npolitics, and we all have the pain of politics.'' I know it is going to \nbe hard. This is not premised on any base in Kansas. This is based on a \nfirm belief that this may be the right thing to do. But we are going at \nit the wrong way, and it is very premature.\n  So for the reasons that I have listed--and I would only add that \nthere is no reason why we can't wait on the QDR, the review, and the \nNational Defense Panel, have the new criteria, certify the excess, \nearmark the savings, and, yes, then go ahead with some kind of a BRAC. \nThere is no reason why we can't do that. But it seems to me that we are \nrushing to judgment here, and I think it would be very \ncounterproductive. I think we should watch out for the law of \nunintended affects.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona and as agreed to by the Senator from Michigan and urge my \ncolleagues to take another look at this. Let's take a little time. \nLet's do this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to two of my staff members, Tom \nVecchiolla and Peggy Kline, during the pending consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, thank you.\n  First of all, I would like to commend the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking member, \nSenator Levin, for their tremendous efforts in bringing the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill to the floor. I certainly think they have \ntaken a great deal of initiative and leadership in putting this \nlegislation together. I appreciate their efforts in that regard.\n  I certainly want to associate myself with the remarks made by the \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, on the amendment that has been \noffered by our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. It is an \namendment that I certainly will oppose in proposing more rounds of \nmilitary base closures and realignment.\n  I am certain the committee rejected the call for new base closings, \nand the Senate should follow suit.\n  As we all know, the administration has asked for two more rounds of \nbase closings with the intent of realizing $2.8 billion per year in \nsavings from these new BRAC rounds. The administration further stated \nthat these estimated savings are to be used to meet the well-\nestablished requirements for $60 billion in procurement funding which \nis necessary to modernize our forces to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n  I have consistently asked the question as to exactly what has \nhappened to the savings in the past four BRAC rounds that started in \n1988. The Pentagon estimated the savings to occur from those four \nrounds to be in the area of $57 billion over the next 20 years with the \nannualized savings of upwards of $5.6 billion per year starting in the \nyear 2001. In its April 1995 report, the GAO estimated that such \nsavings projects their estimates at less than $17 billion over the next \n20 years, past the number that had been projected by the Department of \nDefense, with annual recurring savings possibly being in the area of \n$1.8 billion in the year 2001.\n\n  Mr. President, GAO conducted a further analysis and issued a \nfollowing report in April 1996. In this report GAO found that the total \namount of actual savings that may be estimated from the four previous \nBRAC rounds is uncertain, for a number of reasons, the primary of \nwhich, according to the\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\nGAO, is that the DOD accounting systems do not provide adequate \ninformation or isolate their impact from that of other DOD initiatives.\n  Despite the fact that the DOD has complied with legislative \nrequirements for submitting annual costs and savings estimates, the GAO \nfurther stated that the estimates' usefulness is limited because the \nestimates are not budget quality and that the inclusion of these \nestimates of reduced personnel costs by all of the services are not \nuniform and, further, the GAO determined that certain community \nassistance costs were excluded. In fact, in one example, GAO identified \nthe fact that DOD BRAC cost estimates included more than $781 million \nin economic assistance to local communities as well as other costs.\n  In December 1996, the Congressional Budget Office, in its report, \nstated that it was unable to confirm or accept DOD's estimates of cost \nsavings because the DOD is unable to report actual spending and savings \nfrom BRAC action.\n  So now we have the Pentagon, the GAO, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice with differing estimates on what has actually been saved and \nwhat is supposed to happen as a result of these four BRAC rounds since \n1988. There is no consensus on the numbers. That, indeed, in my \nopinion, is a significant problem, if we are to predicate future \nclosings on these savings and estimated savings for the future.\n  The fact is we are chasing an elusive infrastructure savings because \nthere is no straight-line corollary between the size of our forces and \nthe infrastructure required to meet two nearly simultaneous major \nregional conflicts. The Department of Defense has even admitted to the \nGAO investigators that they do not have accounting systems in place to \nisolate the impact of specific initiatives such as BRAC.\n  So, in fact, we have no comprehensive adjustment of the reduction of \nthe infrastructure that has occurred as a result of the four previous \nrounds of base closings and the impact on munitions as well as our \nforces. In fact, when these base closing rounds were first initiated, \none of the greatest concerns that I had was that they would \nunderestimate the cost of savings and overestimate the savings to \naccomplish the base closings.\n  Mr. President, the projections for national defense outlays decrease \n34 percent over the period from 1990 to the year 2002. We have all seen \nthe downward pressure in defense spending. In fact, we have seen a \nreduction of more than 40-percent in the defense budget since 1985. \nFuture years' defense plans call for a 40 percent increase in the \ndefense modernization budget within the confines of an overall defense \nbudget that essentially will remain flat over the next few years. But \nyet, we have seen a procurement budget that has plummeted from $54 \nbillion in 1990 to today's level of just over $42 billion.\n  It is interesting, because in the same time that we are seeing a \nreduction in procurement, we have had four previous rounds of base \nclosings. You might have thought that money would have been invested in \nthe procurement budget, but, in fact, the contrary has happened because \nagain the Department of Defense underestimated the cost that is \nrequired to close these bases and overestimated the savings.\n  As of May 1997, the DOD has invested $14 billion in base closings. \nThe total implementation costs of the four previous BRAC actions \nthrough 2001 are estimated at $23 billion. Through fiscal year 1996, \nthe DOD estimates that it may have saved through cost avoidance \napproximately $10 billion.\n  So, in simple terms, to date we have spent $14 billion to avoid costs \nof $10 billion. Yet, we are promised by the DOD that the savings is in \nthe outyear savings--savings that even DOD's own budget analysts say \nthey are not equipped to track.\n  The promise for the outyears has been a recurring theme for the \nPentagon over the last 4 years. How many times have each of us heard \nthat the fix for the procurement account is in the outyears? And each \nyear we see the administration's request for procurement steadily \ndecline. In fact, in each of these 4 years since the Pentagon completed \nthe Bottom-Up Review an investment in the procurement accounts has \nactually been postponed.\n  The procurement request for 1998 is $42 billion, whereas the fiscal \nyear 1995 program had projected reaching $54 billion by now. So we have \nnot seen the funding promised, and the DOD cannot show it to us in its \nown budgets, and the reasons are obvious. The funding has migrated \nelsewhere.\n  In its own Quadrennial Defense Review, the DOD said the $18 billion \nmeant for procurement under the 1995 plan has disappeared. The QDR \nreport tells us that the funding migrated to three places. First, it \nwent to unprogrammed operating expenses such as contingency operations \nlike Bosnia. The second place was unrealized savings from initiatives \nlike outsourcing or business process reengineering which failed to \nachieve the objectives and expectations, similar to the failure to \nachieve the levels of savings expected in the previous four BRAC \nrounds. And the third, of course, was new program demands.\n  The QDR stated national defense policy of shape-respond-prepare \nreinforces the fact that U.S. forces will conduct smaller scale \ncontingency operations for peacetime engagement. These operations \ninclude, according to the report, intervention, limited strike, no-fly \nzone enforcement, peace enforcement, peacekeeping, humanitarian \nassistance, and disaster relief. The QDR further projects that U.S. \ninvolvement in the smaller scale contingency operations will increase \nover the next 20 years.\n  So we can expect more and more peacekeeping operations, far beyond \nthe traditional missions of peacekeeping operations, that are going to \nrequire more robust military requirements. The QDR cites the obvious \nproblem that DOD has had with the constant migration of funds which \nwere planned for procurement ending up in operation and support \nactivities. This certainly has been the case in the last few years to \npay for operations like Bosnia and other areas where we have developed \npeacekeeping operations.\n  Since 1991, in over 39 separate contingency operations in Southwest \nAsia, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, et cetera, it is estimated that the \ntaxpayers will pay over $17 billion for these operations. And as I \nillustrate in this chart here today, I think we can get an example of \nthe multiple operations that the United States has been engaged in just \nin the decade of the 1990's. We know that in 1989 we spent less than \n$100 million in peacekeeping operations. In the decade of the 1990's \nalone we have spent the grand total of $17.2 billion and counting.\n  We all know the administration has underestimated the costs of our \nparticipation in the forces in Bosnia, not to mention the length of \ntime. It is estimated that we will spend upward of $6.8 to $7 billion \nuntil June 1998. My expectation is that we will have underestimated \nthose costs as well. But we have spent a total of $17.2 billion in \npeacekeeping operations. That is an exorbitant price that we are now \npaying for unbudgeted, for the most part, operations and missions \nelsewhere--unanticipated and in most cases unbudgeted. The cost for \nBosnia, as I said, has been over $7.2 billion, assuming we withdraw in \nJune 1998. The cost for these operations have quadrupled--quadrupled--\nsince 1991. The fact is the Department of Defense has been heavily \ntaxed to meet these deployments.\n  We know that of the $17.2 billion that will have been spent in \ncontingency operations through June 1998, about $8 billion of this \namount was reimbursed to the Department of Defense by Congress through \nsupplementals. The Department of Defense, however, has also told us \nthat $2.3 of the $17.2 billion total were service absorbed costs, \nfunding that was taken directly out of procurement and other accounts \nto pay for these operations.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that the remaining difference of almost $7 \nbillion was siphoned from procurement accounts as well as the \noperations and readiness accounts to pay for these contingency \noperations. We have asked the Department of Defense for these figures \nand they cannot provide them. As of 1997, we readily know that we were \nfacing over 2.5 billion dollars' worth of unfunded contingency \noperations and that required, as we know, a supplemental appropriation \nwhich we passed a couple of weeks ago. But we must ask the question, \nbecause it has been asked but it has not been answered, how many \nmodernization programs got impacted as procurement\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\ndollars were siphoned from the modernization programs by the DOD \ncomptroller to pay for these unprogrammed operations? It is obvious \nthat this is a persistent problem. We know that we can expect more of \nthe same. In fact, the QDR report that was issued by the \nadministration, as I said previously, expects that small scale \ncontingency operations will be high over the next 20 years, so that we \nliterally cannot anticipate the numerous unbudgeted operations in which \nthe United States will participate.\n  The State Department did a compilation in 1995 of the voluntary \ncontributions of the United States in 13 other countries to support \nU.N. peacekeeping operations. The United States provided for 54 percent \nof those costs--54 percent--11 other countries, NATO countries and \nAustralia, 45 percent, and Japan less than 1 percent.\n  So it is obvious and clearly apparent that the United States is \nassuming an enormous cost and burden for these peacekeeping operations. \nAnd as I also said earlier, these peacekeeping operations are not \nwithin the traditional operations as we have known them in the past \nwhere we are upholding and enforcing a cease-fire agreement that has \nbeen reached by two or more parties. These operations have gone beyond \nthat to peace enforcement where we are imposing a peace on recalcitrant \nparties. That requires more military expertise, weaponry, and \nrequirements on the part of our own military as we have seen not only \nin Somalia but, of course, as we have seen in Bosnia.\n\n  The point of all of this is that what we are seeing happening in the \nDefense Department's budget is that more and more of the funds are \nbeing drawn from operations and the readiness account, indeed, from \nmodernization, because even the administration has not been able to \nmeet its own procurements modernization goal of $60 billion. The fact \nis a $17 billion gap in the modernization goal because that money is \nbeing drawn away into these operations.\n  I believe that the pressure to come up with more base closing rounds \nis premised on the need to finance these operations; that we will see \nwhatever savings we can achieve from base closings will not be realized \nin the modernization accounts. The fact is we have no guidance from the \nadministration in terms of what the administration is apt to spend on \nbase closings because we know there are enormous up-front costs just in \nthe environmental cleanup arena alone, not to mention all the other \ncosts associated with base closings that require up-front expenditures. \nSo we do not have the costs nor the real savings realized in the \nfuture. And yet at the same time we are spending more and more of the \nDefense Department's immediate funds on these peacekeeping operations \nfor which we have not been able to precisely project what the costs \nwill be in the future.\n  These missions have quadrupled since 1991. We can expect more of the \nsame. And yet we do not have a comprehensive analysis of the impact of \nthe four previous rounds. They have not been completed. They have not \ncome through yet. And so the administration is now asking for two more \nrounds without even knowing what the previous rounds have exacted in \nterms of the impact on our forces, our mission, as well as our \ninfrastructure.\n  We know that once a base is closed, it is lost forever; it is \nirreplaceable, and yet we have had no thorough analysis done on what \nthe impact will be for the future. I believe that the pressure for more \nbase closing rounds from the administration is due to the fact that \nmore of these dollars are being siphoned away from modernization and \ninto peacekeeping operations. So we could have two more rounds, but we \ndo not know what the savings will be, we do not know whether or not it \nis going to go into modernization, and we do not know what the impact \nwill be on our forces as well as our mission.\n  I believe we are relying on a flawed approach to achieve the savings \nfrom infrastructure reductions that have yet to be realized, and we are \nfinding that the Defense Department is spending billions of dollars on \ncontingency operations which have little or no relevance to our vital \nnational interests, and yet we are willing to cut the heart out of our \nmilitary infrastructure within our sovereign borders without fully \nevaluating the impact to our national defense.\n  The fact is I believe that we are on a collision course with less \nthan expected savings from base closings and an increased number of \ncontingency operations that will result in a further degradation of our \nforce readiness and it will delay much needed procurement.\n  I realize that we are facing limited resources within the Defense \nDepartment's budget and within our own overall Federal budget, but we \nmust also be concerned for our troops and our resources, that they are \nnot overtaxed in support of these numerous contingency operations over \nwhich we obviously have had little control. We have to take a more \njudicious approach to the deployment of our forces in view of our \nconstrained resources as well as protecting our vital national \ninterests, not only for today but also for tomorrow.\n  So I ask the Senate to reject the amendment that has been offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona because I believe clearly that we have to \nbegin a thorough examination of what has already transpired before we \ntake any future actions that we will regret, and at the same time I \nhope that it will put some pressure on this administration to begin a \nthorough reexamination of the necessity of constantly deploying troops \nin areas that perhaps they should not be engaged.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman and ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee for their handling of this bill and for \ntheir help in bringing it to this particular position. I particularly \nwant to commend my friend, the ranking member, the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, for his advocacy of this particular amendment. I \nam pleased to join as a cosponsor with the Senator from Michigan and \nthe Senator from Arizona and others. But I recognize it is a very \ndifficult amendment for all concerned, as the Senator from Michigan so \neloquently explained a few minutes ago on this floor. I know his \nparticular State was more impacted in terms of strategic air base \nclosures.\n  My own State is more dependent on defense spending on a per capita \nbasis than any other State in the Union. Year after year more defense \ndollars, per capita, are spent in Virginia than in any other State. So \nthis is not a popular or easy issue in my own State. But I have tried \nto analyze the reasons why most of those who do oppose this particular \namendment are opposed. It seems to me, Members are opposing another \nBRAC round for three principal reasons: No. 1, unwillingness to endure \nthe pain of another closure round; No. 2, concerns about the accuracy \nof estimated savings; and, No. 3, concerns over the integrity of the \nprocess.\n  Regarding the pain of closures, I can only say that I see the choice \nas a simple one. We can either preserve jobs and facilities in our own \nStates or we can provide desperately needed funding to ensure that our \ntroops can fight and win in future wars, which, of course, is the \nreason that we have a national defense capability in the first place. \nBy virtually every expert estimate, early in the new century we will \nsimply be unable to fund a force necessary to support a very prudent \nand measured national military strategy.\n  During the cold war, our massive base infrastructure had substantial \nduplication built in because of enormous uncertainties about the scale \nand consequences of a strategic war with the Soviet Union. Much of that \nduplication we probably could have done without, but I would certainly \nconcede that military construction in Members' home States or districts \nhas undeniable appeal politically. But we no longer have the luxury of \nduplicating infrastructure just to keep the folks back home happy.\n  As many have noted, every dollar we keep spending on bases we don't \nreally need is a dollar we cannot spend on maintaining end strength, \nreplacing aging weapons systems, advancing our military technology to \nensure dominance of the future battlefield, and keeping quality of life \nat a level that will ensure strong recruiting and retention.\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\n  The second rationale for opposing a new BRAC round stems from the \nassertion that because we don't know exactly how much we saved from \nprevious BRAC rounds, that we should not go forward until we do. If we \naccept this rationale, however, we would never have another round of \nbase closures, which I suspect would be just fine with many who cite \nthis reason for opposing the effort. But if our net savings from \nanother BRAC round are significant, although indefinite, it seems to me \nwe ought to move forward now. Why should we postpone doing what we know \nwe are going to have to do anyway, just because our estimate of savings \nare imprecise, as long as we know they are significant?\n  The reality is that the long-term savings from the first four-base \nclosure rounds will exceed $5 billion a year when they are completed. \nIt just so happens the Secretary of Defense is still seeking \napproximately that much money to meet the modernization objectives that \nhe set forth in the Quadrennial Defense Review. New base closure \ncommissions, if they are courageous enough to close the bulk of the \nremaining excess bases, should add billions in additional savings. If \nMembers want to conduct more studies on exactly how much has been and \nwill be saved by BRAC rounds, that's fine, but let's not hold up this \nprocess for a study that we know will tell us that billions will be \nsaved.\n  The third reason Members are opposing a new BRAC round is their \nconcern about the integrity of the BRAC process in light of the attempt \nto privatize-in-place the work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force depots, \nor ALC's. To avoid any future ambiguities about this matter, a \nprovision here clarifies that privatization in place will be allowed \nonly if the BRAC explicitly permits this at a military installation.\n  None of these reasons for opposing another base closure round, in my \njudgment, is compelling. The responsible thing to do, I believe, for \nour Nation's security is to cut excess infrastructure as soon as \npossible. Waiting will only delay the inevitable and cost our military \nbillions in funds that are badly needed for maintaining force \nstructure, supporting training and day-to-day operations, and \nadequately funding modernization.\n  I urge my colleagues, in this case, to make the responsible choice, \nthe choice that the Secretary of Defense, that all of the service \nSecretaries, that all of the service chiefs and that all of the CINC's \nagree is the only responsible choice, and that is to begin another \nround of BRAC closures as soon as possible.\n\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 771 to Amendment No. 705\n\n     (Purpose: To require a report on the actual costs and savings \n attributable to previous base closure rounds and on the need, if any, \n                  for additional base closure rounds)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a second-degree \namendment to the amendment that has been offered by Senators McCain and \nLevin, an amendment that was just supported by my colleague and friend \nfrom Virginia. I do this with great respect for the views of those who \nhave offered the amendment on base closing. But I come to a different \nconclusion than they do on this subject, and represent that conclusion \nwith a second-degree amendment. When I conclude my remarks, I will send \nmy second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  I would tell my colleagues I offer the amendment on my behalf, on \nbehalf of Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Conrad, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Boxer, Senator Burns, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nRoberts, and Senator Ford.\n  I am offering this second-degree amendment to the amendment now \npending, which would authorize two additional rounds of base closures, \none in 1999 and the other in the year 2001.\n  For those unfamiliar with the issue of base closures, they should \nknow that we have established in this country previously, on several \noccasions--actually, through four rounds, but three of them really full \nrounds--something called the Defense Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission. And the Commission then begins to study what kind of \nmilitary installations do we have in this country, where are they, what \nis their capability, and how many of them might now be surplus and \nmight be closed in order to save money for the future. That is what the \nbase closure process was about.\n  I have supported the base closure process on those occasions. I have \nvoted for it and believed it was appropriate, as we downsized the \nmilitary after the cold war, that we also then needed to get rid of the \nsurplus in our facilities and save the money that we can save that is \nnecessary for other areas, such as training and readiness and weapons \nprograms and other priorities. So I have supported that in the past, \nbelieving that as you downsize force structure, you also are going to \nhave surplus military installations that must, in fact, be closed.\n  In the process of doing that, we have ordered the closures in the \nrounds of 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. That resulted in the decisions to \nclose 97 military installations in this country. The military is \nslightly over halfway through the process of closure of these 97 \ninstallations; slightly more than one-half of those bases have, in \nfact, been closed. In fact, the second base closure round is scheduled \nto finish this month, and those are the bases that the 1991 Base \nClosure Commission decided to close. The 1993 and 1995 closures, the \nthird round and the fourth round, they will be shut down completely--\nand they are in the process now--but they will be shut down completely \nperhaps in the year 2001. So we have been involved in the substantial \nshutdown of military facilities under the Base Closure Commission \nprocess, have done it now for a number of years--9 years this process \nhas been in effect--and now the proposal in this defense authorization \namendment is to say, let's have two additional rounds of base closures.\n  What is the problem with that and why do I offer an amendment? Let me \ndescribe my amendment first and then describe the problem. I say in my \namendment that the Secretary of Defense shall prepare and submit to \nCongress, to the defense committees of Congress, a report on the costs \nand the savings attributable to the base closure rounds before 1996, \nand on the need, if any, for additional base closure rounds. The rest \nof the second-degree amendment describes what we would like the \nSecretary to report to us on. The amendment also would prohibit the \nfunding of further base closure commissions until the Congress has \nreceived that report.\n\n  But I would like to go through a series of charts, to tell you why I \nthink there are significant questions that must be answered before this \nCongress should authorize one additional or two additional rounds of \nbase closures.\n  The General Accounting Office, the GAO, which is the congressional \naccounting watchdog agency, says that ``Congressional auditors can't \nverify the estimates of base closure savings''; the Department of \nDefense ``cannot provide information on actual savings'' from the \nprevious rounds; the DOD's savings estimates, according to the GAO, are \n``inconsistent . . . unreliable . . . incomplete.'' That is the GAO.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, says: ``The Congressional Budget Office was unable to confirm \nor assess the Department of Defense's estimates of costs and savings \nbecause the Defense Department is unable to report actual spending and \nsavings for BRAC actions''--in other words, the base closures.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also says:\n\n       CBO cannot evaluate the accuracy of DOD's estimates without \n     empirical data.\n       The DOD does not track . . . actual savings that have \n     accrued.\n\n  And on the specific subject of the McCain-Levin amendment, the \nCongressional Budget Office says this about additional rounds of base \nclosing:\n\n       The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round \n     of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out.\n\n  And then it says, and this is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand:\n\n       That consideration, however, should follow an interval \n     during which the Department of\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\n     Defense and independent analysts examine the actual impact of \n     the measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  Finally, CBO says:\n\n       Such a pause [or an interval] would allow the Department of \n     Defense to collect the data necessary to evaluate the \n     effectiveness of initiatives and to determine the actual \n     costs incurred and the actual savings achieved.\n\n  That is not me. It is not a conservative or liberal or Democrat or \nRepublican; that is the General Accounting Office, the GAO, the \ninvestigative watchdog, and the Congressional Budget Office, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, saying that after all of these \nrounds of base closures, they can't get information about what have the \ncosts and the savings been.\n  What has been the experience? What is the impact for the American \ntaxpayer on all of this? How much do you save when you close them down? \nAnd what have been the costs of closing them down?\n  The Congressional Budget Office says it would be a reasonable thing \nto do to have an interval to really evaluate what are you doing, what \nare you achieving, how much are you saving. That is why I think it \nmakes no sense for us in this authorization bill to proceed immediately \nnow, before nearly one-half of the bases that have been previously \nordered closed are closed, and say, ``Well, now, let's do two \nadditional rounds. We don't know what the costs and benefits are of the \nprevious rounds, we don't know what the savings to the taxpayers have \nbeen, we don't know what the costs have been, but let's order two more \nrounds.''\n  So I offer a second-degree amendment that says the Secretary of \nDefense shall prepare and submit to the congressional defense \ncommittees a report on the costs attributable to base closure rounds. \nLet's get a full accounting before we move for two additional base \nclosure rounds.\n  Let me respond to some of the other statements that have been made on \nthis issue. Proponents of more base closures suggest more closures are \nneeded to match the base infrastructure to our force structure. They \nsay as the force structure comes down, clearly we should be able to \nclose some bases, and that is true. But let's look at the figures.\n  According to Congressman Hefley, the chairman of the House National \nSecurity Committee's Subcommittee on Military Installation and \nFacilities, if you measure by plant replacement the value of bases in \nthe United States and around the world, base infrastructure has fallen \nby 27 percent, very close to the one-third or 33 percent reduction in \nforce structure. Other estimates of reduction in base structure are \neither not calculating the plant replacement value or they are \ncalculating values of only bases in the Continental United States, \nwhich ignores the 43 percent reduction in U.S. bases overseas.\n  In addition to that, the military's operational bases--that is, the \nbases that host the combat units--are already closing down in \nproportion to the defense drawdown. For example, when all the BRAC \nrounds are done, the Air Force will have closed 22 of 74 major air \nbases, 30 percent; the Navy will have closed 10 of 17 naval stations, \nnearly 60 percent, and 12 of 29 naval air stations, 40 percent; the \nArmy will have closed 10 major combat and training facilities, about \none-third of those Army bases. So with respect to the operational \nbases, there has already been an appropriate amount of base closing \ndone.\n  Proponents of the amendment to authorize two additional rounds of \nbase closings say we need more base closing rounds in order to be able \nto afford new weapons. We will achieve savings from base closings and, \ntherefore, be able to afford the new weapons programs. Let's examine \njust a bit what these arguments mean by asking what the savings from \nbase closures are or will be or have been with what sketchy information \nwe have.\n  There are various estimates of savings from the BRAC implementation \nperiod from 1988 to the year 2001. The Congressional Budget Office in \nDecember said they were not able to get very much information. They \nestimated, with what information they had, that we would save $5.3 \nbillion in that period, this despite four base closing rounds in \nclosures that began 9 years ago.\n  So, if this number is accurate, with sketchy information, yes, base \nclosures save some money but very slowly, and if future base closing \ncommissions decide to close bases in 2001, the savings would be \navailable, again, very slowly perhaps by the year 2010. And the savings \nhere are only estimates from sketchy information that both the GAO and \nthe Congressional Budget Office indicate is unreliable and incomplete. \nThey say the information on this is simply not available from the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The Government Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office \nalso say in closing military installations that the Department of \nDefense has not taken into account the full cost of environmental \ncleanup when a base is closed, the accurate proceeds from the sale of \nland in closing bases, the economic transition costs, especially those \nnot funded by the Department's base closing program, the higher costs \nof operation at bases that gain missions from the bases that are closed \nand higher construction costs at the bases that gain missions.\n\n  In summary, Mr. President, my amendment is important because it would \nrequire the Pentagon to report to Congress on what have been the actual \ncosts and savings in four base closing rounds over nearly a 10-year \nperiod. Until and unless we get information about what are the costs \nand benefits, I don't think we ought to legislate in the dark, and that \nis what we would be doing if we were to decide now to rush off and \nauthorize two additional rounds of base closures without knowing the \nimpact of, the costs of, or the benefits of the closures in the \nprevious four rounds.\n  I am pleased to offer the amendment with some very strong support \nfrom some very influential Members of the Senate. The majority leader, \nSenator Lott, is a cosponsor; the minority leader, Senator Daschle; the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nThurmond; and many others.\n  I think all of us feel the same way. There may be at some future date \na need to reconcile further base capacity with troop strength. We \nunderstand that, we have understood that through four rounds of base \nclosings. However, there will also be, and is now, a requirement that \nwe understand exactly what we are doing, what are the costs and what \nare the benefits, and this would not be the time to authorize \nadditional rounds of base closures prior to our having the information \navailable on what we have done in the past.\n  One final point. All of us perhaps have some parochial interests, and \nI would certainly understand if someone said, ``Well, but you have some \nmilitary installations in your State.'' Yes, we do, and I have \nsupported previous base closing rounds despite the fact that we have \nmilitary installations, and it would probably not be in my best \ninterest to do that, but I supported that because I understand we must \nreduce capacity in these installations.\n  But, I also understand that every time you go through a base closing \nround, there are additional costs imposed on nearly every community \nthat has a military installation that is not calculated anywhere on \nthese papers, and that is the cost of the economic investment that \ndoesn't happen and the stunted economic growth in a community because a \npotential investor says, ``That, community, I don't want to invest \nthere at the moment. I want to wait a couple years to see if that \nmilitary installation, that community is going to be there for the \nlong-term future. If not, that region is going to have 20 percent \nunemployment, and the last thing I want to do is lose my investment.''\n  So community after community after community has imposed on it a \nstunted cost of economic development whenever we begin this process.\n  I am not here today to say I will never support another BRAC round, \nbut this is the wrong time to initiate two additional rounds. If we \nlook in the future at what the overcapacity might be, if there is, in \nfact, an overcapacity, then we should respond to that. But I do not \nwant, in this circumstance, to authorize two rounds before we know the \nfull cost, the full value and the full benefit of previous base closure \nrounds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ford from the \nState of Kentucky be added as a cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin-McCain \namendment and in support of the Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment. Before I \nspeak on the substance, I want to, again, take note of the tremendous \nleadership we are receiving from the Armed Services Committee chairman, \nthe Senator from South Carolina, and the cooperation we are getting \nfrom the Senator from Michigan as they try to move this legislation \nthrough. They are doing an outstanding job. I know we will start a \nseries of votes later on this afternoon, and we continue to look \nforward to completing this very important legislation before the week \nis out.\n  Mr. President, I have followed these base closure recommendations, \nso-called BRAC issues, now for many years. I was in the House when it \nwas first proposed by a young Congressman from Texas, Dick Armey. I was \na member of the Rules Committee, and he came to me and asked about how \nto get this procedure to be considered, to get it through the Rules \nCommittee, to get it to the floor of the House of Representatives. I \nremember specifically telling him how the procedure would work, but \nassuring him from the beginning I would oppose it.\n  I have always been opposed to this approach. It is one more example \nof Congress not being able to deal with the tough issues of what we \nneed in terms of facilities in this country and passing the decisions \noff--the tough decisions off--to others, in this case the Commission. I \ndon't think that is the way it should be done, and that is not the way \nit was done until recent years.\n  In the past, the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, would make \nrecommendations to Congress. Congress, through the appropriate \ncommittees--Armed Services and the Appropriations Committee--would \nconsider those recommendations and, in some instances, base closures \nwere approved, including facilities in my own State and probably most \nStates in the Nation, and in others, it was rejected. But somehow over \nthe years, it became more and more difficult to close these bases or to \nmake decisions, to make changes in the bases, and so these so-called \nBRAC rounds gained some currency and were pushed and, in fact, passed \nthrough the Congress.\n  We have been down this old BRAC road before, three-and-a-half or four \ntimes, if you will. I maintain it has not worked well. First of all, we \nfound that it is a very difficult process. There is always concern \nabout the fairness of how it is done. There are always some \nimplications or indications that some political considerations came \ninto play, and there always will be. But also I think it is important \nthat we remember what it does to the communities and to the people who \nare involved.\n  These are just not nameless, faceless people. These are bases in \ncommunities, communities that are disrupted by these proceedings, \ncommunities and States spending millions of dollars trying to prove the \nworth of their bases. So we know that it has had an impact on the \ncommunities where these bases have existed.\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\n  We know it has created problems for the Defense Department among the \nvarious branches. We know that it is almost totally impossible to \nassess the real damages or the benefits or the savings from these \nclosings. We have seen this in instance after instance. For instance, \nwe have made decisions that certain bases would be closed and there \nwould be certain savings. Yet, we have found that it has been very \ndifficult to move toward closing those bases and getting the savings \nfor no other reason than we have found, in many instances, that there \nare environmental problems in cleaning up those bases before they can \nbe turned over to the private sector or the local communities.\n  To this day, the recommendations of previous BRAC's have not been \ncompleted. We have bases or facilities, depots that supposedly were \ngoing to be closed. They are not closed. So without having had an \nopportunity to really assess the damage that has been done to our \ncapabilities and our facilities for the military of this country, \nwithout having an opportunity to really get these bases closed and, \ntherefore, the savings achieved, we have now the recommendation that we \nhave not one but two more of these base closure rounds.\n  I think that it has been a very dubious process that has caused lots \nof problems, and it should not go forward again with two more rounds \nuntil we fully understand the ramifications and the implications of \nwhat we have already done.\n  So that is why I think that the Dorgan amendment is a better \napproach. It doesn't say that we will never have another base closure \nround, although I can't envision myself voting for one in the future \nanymore than I have in the past, but it does set up a legitimate, \nlogical process to assess what has already happened, what has been \nachieved in terms of savings as a result of those decisions, what it \nhas done to our capabilities militarily, before we go forward with \nanother round.\n  The amendment that has been offered by Senator Dorgan and others \nallows already authorized base closures and realignments to go forward, \nand that is important, I emphasize again, because what has already been \nagreed to has, in fact, not been completed. This would include the 97 \nbase closures and the 55 realignments that have already been agreed to.\n\n  Economic and fiscal ramifications of closing and realigning bases \nCongress has already authorized will stretch well into the 21st \ncentury. The Pentagon estimates on the savings cannot be supported. \nGAO, for instance, recently concluded that the ``Department of Defense \ncannot provide [accurate] information on actual savings.'' The \nCongressional Budget Office has stated that it ``was unable to confirm \nor assess DOD's estimates of cost and savings because the Department is \nunable to report actual spending and savings for [these] actions.'' As \na result of all these factors, CBO observed that additional base \nclosures ``should follow an interval during which DOD and independent \nanalysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken \n* * * ''\n  The Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment sets up a logical process to review \nwhat we have already done before we go forward with recommended rounds \nin the future. The last Base Closure Commission concurred in the \nassessment and stated that another round of base closures should not \noccur until the year 2001--not 1999, as proposed in the Levin-McCain \namendment. That is an important point. The last Base Closure Commission \nspecifically recommended that there not be another one until the year \n2001, if then, so that we could get our work done, see what happened, \nand then make an informed judgment about whether to go forward with it \nagain in the future.\n  This amendment provides the Pentagon with the time to develop \naccounting techniques so they can fully and accurately reflect the \ncosts and savings from previous and future rounds of base closures, and \nit requires the Pentagon to prepare a report on the financial \nramifications of past and future base closures and to have the report \nreviewed by GAO and CBO.\n  In short, Mr. President, this sets up a process to take a look at \nwhat we have already done, evaluate it, make sure we understand the \ncost savings or the costs that have been expended to try to achieve \nwhat has already been agreed to before we go forward, and then and only \nthen after that review should we make an informed decision about \nwhether or not to have another round.\n  I am going to hand out to my colleagues when we start having votes a \nlist that I had prepared of facilities and activities that were \nconsidered by the Base Closure Commissions in the years 1991 to 1994, \nbut not closed. There is a long list. And I just want to ask my \ncolleagues, whether they be from California or Connecticut or Georgia \nor Minnesota or my own State or any other State, take a look at what is \non this list.\n  Think of what you have already been through, and think of the impact \nit would have on the military if some of these facilities, which are \nvery fine facilities that are important for our training for the Air \nForce, for the Navy, if they should be threatened once again with being \nclosed. Do you want that? So I will have this list, and I invite my \ncolleagues from all over the United States to take a look at this list.\n  This should not be done. We should not be closing down needed \nfacilities and needed bases in the United States while we are sending \nour military men and women on humanitarian missions around the world. \nWe are looking after the needs and problems around the world. That is \nfine. But what about the impact and the needs in our own communities of \nour own constituencies and most importantly of the military itself?\n  I vigorously oppose the Levin-McCain amendment and I will go along \nwith the Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment because I think it is a better \nalternative and that it sets up a logical process to evaluate whether \nor not we should ever have another Base Closure Commission.\n\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague from \nMississippi in urging our colleagues to vote no on the McCain \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the entire process dealing with base closure is a \nprocess that Congress entered into with the administration, a joint \nprocess where we said we would work together, set up a commission, a \ncommission of experts, we call it BRAC, the Base Closing Commission, \nand they would make recommendations and send those to the President. \nThe President would either accept it or reject it. He could not modify \nit. If the President did not agree with those recommendations, he could \nsend it back to the Base Closing Commission and they could change it. \nBut he has two options: He accepts it or rejects it.\n  Same thing with Congress. Under the procedure that was set up--I \nmight mention, it worked quite well the first three rounds. The \nPresident took the recommendations; then he would forward those on to \nCongress, and then Congress accepted them. We could not amend it. We \ncould not say that it included a base from the Senator from Montana's \nhome State, the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, so \nwe will send that specific recommendation back, or maybe a \nrecommendation to close a base in the home State of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina or Mississippi, those are powerful Senators, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the majority leader \nrespectively.\n  We did not touch those. We did not set it up that way. We set it up \nso an independent commission of experts, appointed and I might mention \nconfirmed by the Senate, would work and work very hard. One of the \ntoughest jobs around was for this commission to travel to all the bases \non the so-called suspect list or the possibility list. They would visit \nthese bases, and then they would make their recommendations.\n  I might mention in the process, they would probably terrify the \nindividual communities and all the individuals associated with those \nbases. They would terrify them because they were afraid they might lose \ntheir job, they were afraid they might be on the final base closure \nlist, they were afraid they might lose a job they think is a pretty \ngood job--in all likelihood it is a good job, and they do not want to \nlose it.\n  So Congress had to--I don't know if it should be called collective \nwisdom,\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\nbut we said, ``Let's put it on this group, these real experts, a lot of \nretired military people, people that are going to spend the time and \nreally investigate and analyze which bases should be closed.'' We have \ntoo much base infrastructure, so we had to close them. So that was the \nprocess. And it worked quite well the first three rounds.\n  Then in the fourth round President Clinton changed it. We had the \nsame Base Closure Commission, a good commission. They made their \nrecommendations, sent it to the President, and said accept it or reject \nit. President Clinton did neither. He said: Well, we're going to accept \nall the recommendations except for two, except for ones in California \nand Texas. There are a lot of electoral votes. We have an election \ncoming up. So he did not accept the base closure recommendation.\n  He tried to modify it. He said: ``Well, we won't close two bases. \nWe'll privatize them and keep them in existence.'' That was not what \nthe Base Closure Commission had said. Congress did not have that \noption. We were not able to say, ``Wait a minute, we want to close all \nthese on the list except \nfor--'' We did not do that.\n  So the President, in my opinion, violated the law. And I think the \nlaw is very clear. Other people debated, ``Wait a minute. Does he have \nthe flexibility? Does the Base Closing Commission give him the option \nto privatize in place or is this something he created?'' I think it is \nsomething he created. That was not the intent of the Base Closing \nCommission.\n\n  Could he fudge? Could he interpret it that way? Well, he did. So far \nhe has gotten away with it. But that was not what the base closing law \ncalled for. That was not the intent of the Base Closing Commission. And \ncertainly the President circumvented the will of the BRAC, and of the \nbase closing process. I think he destroyed a lot of good will in the \nprocess.\n  A lot of people might have been willing to say, well, we might comply \nwith another round, but I will tell you, you cannot comply with another \nround if you think the executive branch might violate that trust or \npoliticize this process. And that is exactly what President Clinton \ndid.\n  I might even read for my colleagues an op-ed article from the \nWashington Post at that time, July 14, 1995. I will just read this part \nof it.\n\n       Over the past couple of weeks [President] Clinton has been \n     engaged in a highly publicized effort to ensure that many of \n     the jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento will be \n     privatized. That is rather disingenuous. If the privatization \n     is real, it will merely perpetuate the expensive overcapacity \n     that the base closing is supposed to reduce. If the private-\n     sector jobs rapidly fade away after another election or two, \n     the people who held them will rightly consider the whole \n     effort a sham.\n\n  What he had was an effort to win votes, and again violate the \nprocess. And so should we have another couple of base closing rounds? I \ndo not think so. No, not as long as there is not an understanding that \nwe are all going to be in this boat together, the President is going to \nabide by the law and Congress is going to abide by the law. The \nPresident certainly did circumvent the law in this case.\n  I will read to you a quote from a speech President Clinton made in \nTexas. He said:\n\n       On July 1st, you were dealt a serious blow when the \n     Independent Base Closing Commission said that we ought to \n     shut Kelly down. At my insistence and my refusal to go along \n     with that specific recommendation, the Air Force developed \n     the Privatization In Place Plan that will keep thousands of \n     jobs here at this depot.\n\n  That was made October 17, 1995.\n  President Clinton is exactly right, he refused to go along with the \nspecific recommendation of the Base Closing Commission. The point is, \nif he wanted to disavow the Base Closing Commission decision, he could \nhave sent it back to the Commission. He said, ``I will agree with all \nthese, but not these two.'' And that would have been the process to \nfollow; he could have sent it back to the Base Closing Commission.\n  Maybe they would have reconsidered; maybe they would not have. But he \ndid not do that. He said: I am going to accept and amend. And the law \ndid not give him that right. So he violated the process, and created a \nnew process, and one, in my opinion, where he undermined the \ncredibility that we have under this law that worked in the first three \nrounds and did not work in the fourth round. He politicized the \nprocess.\n  Should we just have another two rounds? I do not think so. I just \ncannot see that Congress would allow another round or another two \nrounds and terrorize all these communities if they think, and the \nindividual Members of Congress think, ``Well, wait a minute. Maybe \nwe're not going to do this on military value. Maybe we're going to do \nit on politics. Because politics entered the last round, maybe politics \nwill be in the next round.''\n  The President found a clever way of doing it. We do not have to close \nany base. We will just privatize in place. We do not have to lose any \njobs. He promised in California--there were 8,700 jobs the day the base \nclosures were announced, and he said, we will have 8,700 jobs in the \nyear 2001. We will have 5,000 jobs a few years later than that. We will \npromise you jobs forever. That is not privatization in place. That is \nelectoral politics.\n  And it is a real shame he introduced election politics into the base \nclosing process, some real violation of trust for every single Member \nthat had a base closed in any round--any round. If you were willing to \nsay, OK, we will put our bases at risk since we are all doing it \ntogether for the good of the country, for the good of national defense, \nI am willing to leave my rights alone as a Senator to participate in \nthis process for the good of national defense and the good of our \ncountry because we know we have to do it, we know we have to reduce \nexcess base capacity, if we are not going to play politics a lot of \npeople said they are willing to do that. Then President Clinton plays \npolitics.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nMcCain amendment. We should not have additional base closing rounds in \nthis Senator's opinion until and unless we comply and until or unless \nwe make absolutely, totally, completely, sure that politics will not be \ninvolved in any future round.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the Dorgan-Daschle \namendment. I think that is the logical step to take at this time. I \nwish to commend the majority leader, Senator Lott, the assistant \nmajority leader, Senator Nickles, for their excellent talks that they \nmade on this subject. I wish to commend all others who took that \nposition or the opposite position for participating in this debate. \nThis is a very important subject. I am very pleased that so many \nSenators have taken part in this debate, which is very helpful to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to make a long talk. We have had a lot \nof talk the other day. I expect to speak less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, and that of many of my colleagues, the \nSecretary of Defense has not made a sufficient case for additional base \nclosures. The one point that has been a common theme throughout the \ndebate on additional base closures rounds has been the extent of actual \novercapacity in the existing infrastructure. I am not satisfied that we \nhave accurate data on this matter and should not vote for any \nadditional rounds until we have an independent assessment of the \novercapacity.\n  As a second concern is that I believe that the desire for supposed \nsavings is becoming the sole driving force for additional base closure, \nwithout consideration of continuing requirements. The Department has \nnot identified the up-front cost of doing another closure round and I \nam worried that, based on experience, most of the claimed savings will \nnot materialize, or be used for modernization.\n  Mr. President, it is also important that the Congress understands on \nhow the Department plans to proceed with the next BRAC and whether it \nwill focus on facilities where excess capacity truly exists. I do not \nneed to remind my colleagues that we have had four rounds of base \nclosures, and that many of our communities have endured tremendous \nturmoil and great losses because of them. These communities were under \nthe impression that the closures they endured would resolve the \novercapacity problem. I recall the Department's claiming that BRAC 95\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\nwould be ``The Mother of all BRACs.'' In facts, this was a gross \noverstatement. I suggest that the Presidential campaign had a role in \nlimiting the scope of BRAC 95, and the communities and the Nation are \nnow bearing the consequences of that action.\n  Despite the stated good intentions of my colleagues, I oppose taking \naction at this time. We must have a better understanding of the excess \ncapacity, what the future military requirements will be and how the \nDepartment will pay for this expensive undertaking. Until we have that \ninformation, I urge the Senate to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just briefly, a few comments on the BRAC \namendment of Senator McCain, myself, Senator Robb and others.\n  First, on the cost question. The Defense Department has testified on \nthe savings. Their testimony is part of the record. The Under Secretary \nfor Defense, John Goodman, before the Readiness Subcommittee of the \nArmed Services Committee, testified that their estimate of net cost in \nsavings are as follows: 98 major installations closed through BRAC, \ncosts through 2001, when they would be fully implemented, $23 billion; \nsavings through 2001, in billions, $36.5 billion. That is a $13 billion \nsavings during that period, and then after 2001, recurring savings, \nevery year, because we had the courage to pass four BRAC rounds, of \n$5.6 billion.\n  Now, that is our modernization shortfall. That is why the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, every single one of them, plead with us, in a very \ndirect letter, plead with us to support the Secretary of Defense in his \nrequest for two more BRAC rounds.\n  Now, there is no use coming to this floor and talking about the need \nto modernize or to make sure we have the most advanced forces in the \nworld, the most ready forces in the world, with the highest moral in \nthe world, when we are not willing to take the steps that are necessary \nto make those things possible. We know we are not going to get \nincreases in the defense budget. We know we have a 5-year budget that \nwe have to live within.\n  So the question, then, is, are we going to keep excess baggage, \ninfrastructure, which the Defense Department says is no longer \nnecessary? It is a tough choice. I could not agree more with my friends \nfrom Oklahoma and Mississippi and others who have spoken about the \ndifficulty that communities go through. My communities in Michigan have \ngone through it and will again if we pass this BRAC round. Three Air \nForce base communities, all three SAC bases, gone. We know something \nabout that. We know about the pleas that we made to the BRAC commission \nand the Defense Department. We know about that. We know the urgencies \nof those pleas. But there is no alternative.\n  History has proven over and over again that if you are going to get \nrid of excess infrastructure--and we know we have excess, and the \nexperts are telling us that--it seems to me we have no reason to \ndisbelieve the Joint Chiefs when they tell us we have this major \nsurplus of capacity. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, says we have more excess capacity now than we did when \nwe started the BRAC process because we have reduced the size of our \nforce. Are we listening? When we get these kind of pleas from the \nuniformed military not to waste money on bases that they cannot afford \nto maintain, are we listening to them, or are we going to take an easy \nway out, which is to say give us a report.\n  We have a report: the Defense Department. That is the report. That \nchart is the report for the Defense Department. Now, can they prove \nthose figures so that they can be audited? No, these are estimates of \nthe Defense Department. That same Congressional Budget Office which \npoints out that the estimates cannot be confirmed with precision, also \nsays this, which is not reported. I didn't hear the opponents of this \namendment quote this part of the CBO report, although I may have missed \nit, in fairness to them. I didn't hear it. CBO believes that BRAC \nactions will result in significant long-term savings.\n  Now, we can delay it. They will be longer term. We heard the \nargument, ``Look how long it has taken for the environmental cleanup,'' \nand that is true. It will take longer if we don't close a base, to \nclean up that base environmentally, than if we do. We know that, by the \nway, historically. We have money to clean up bases we are closing where \nwe don't have money to clean up bases that are staying open. If we are \nworried about the speed with which a base is cleaned up, they are \ncleaned up more quickly, I say, ironically and sadly, when they are \nclosed than when they are kept open. That is a pretty sad comment, but \nthat is a fact. That is the reality.\n  So if we want to speed up the environmental cleanup, you don't keep a \nbase open to that purpose, and you surely don't delay closing bases \nwhich need to be closed if the environmental cleanup has taken too \nlong. It will take longer if you delay the closing. Delaying closing of \nneedless infrastructure does not speed up the environmental cleanup of \nthat infrastructure; it delays the environmental cleanup of that \ninfrastructure.\n  Now, we are talking here about a significant sum of money in this \ndefense budget. I want to just repeat these estimates: $5.6 billion is \nthe estimate. People say, ``Well, we don't have the dollars.'' Yes, we \ndo. Here is the report from the Defense Department. There is the chart \nfrom the Defense Department. These documents here are the basis of that \nreport. I am not so sure how many of us want to go through each one of \nthese to see if those figures add up to the $5.6 billion, but here they \nare. The savings are real. Even the CBO, which says they can't confirm \nthe precision, the accuracy of these estimates, says, again, CBO \nbelieves that BRAC actions will result in significant long-term \nsavings.\n\n  We just got a report from Secretary Cohen addressed to Senator \nThurmond, a letter that reads as follows: ``As the Senate moves to \nfinal consideration of its version of the FY 98 defense authorization \nbill, I urge you to support the McCain-Levin amendment authorizing BRAC \nrounds in 1999 and 2001.''\n  Now, he is giving the estimate of the two additional rounds in terms \nof the recurring savings. I am sure this is what the next sentence \nmeans, because we had this testimony, in effect.\n\n       We estimate two additional rounds would result in savings \n     of approximately $2.7 billion annually.\n\n  I know from previous testimony he is referring to the recurring \nsavings. That is a significant hunk of change, even in the defense \nbudget.\n  And then he says something we ought to listen to.\n\n       These savings are absolutely critical to the department's \n     modernization plan.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       There have been some questions regarding the savings \n     actually realized from previous base closures. We have taken \n     these questions seriously and asked the Department of Defense \n     Inspector General to take an independent look at this issue. \n     The Inspector General's preliminary results indicate that \n     there is no basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly \n     cost effective.\n\n  I am going to repeat that before I continue because that is sort of \nthe bottom line here.\n\n       The Inspector General's preliminary results indicate that \n     there is no basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly \n     cost effective.\n\n  And then Secretary Cohen goes on to say:\n\n       The preliminary audit examined BRAC 1993 actions, including \n     the largest Navy closure, Mare Island, and eight Air Force \n     Bases closed or realigned. For these bases, the IG found that \n     DOD overestimated costs by $148 million and underestimated \n     savings by $614 million.\n\n  The IG's report is attached to his letter. This report goes through \nsome of the reasons why they actually underestimated here the savings.\n  So, instead of, at least on this study by the IG, the bases actually \nsaving us less than predicted, the closing of those bases that were \nstudied by the IG turned out to save us more than was projected by a \nsignificant amount, and the reasons for it, again, were set forth in \nthe IG's report.\n  There is another argument that we have heard, and that argument is \nthat this action has been politicized. There will be arguments back and \nforth as to whether or not the privatization in place that occurred at \ntwo facilities was consistent or not with the Base Closing Commission. \nYou can argue that either way. Obviously, the State that is affected \npositively by the President's or the Defense Department's decision \nfeels it was perfectly within the\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nscope of the Base Closing Commission's report. The States which were \nnegatively affected, in their view, by that decision argue it was not \ncontemplated by the Base Closing Commission.\n  The Base Closing Commission report, however, says that these \nfacilities ``consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots \nor''--and that is the critical word for those who argue one side of \nthis issue, ``or''--``or to private-sector commercial activities as \ndetermined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.''\n  Well, the Defense Depot Maintenance Council determined those two \nactions should be taken so that they could be privatized in place. I \nthink that, at least, is reasonably, arguably, provided for by the Base \nClosing Commission report. It says ``or''--``to consolidate the \nremaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private-sector commercial \nactivities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council,'' as \nthe alternative to consolidating the remaining workloads to other DOD \ndepots.\n\n  Two options were laid out by the Base Closing Commission. The DOD \nfollowed one option. They privatized in place. But whichever side of \nthat argument one takes--and we have heard both arguments--that is no \nexcuse, even if one follows the view that that was politicized, that \nthey should not have been privatized in place. They should have gone to \nother DOD facilities, and that was a political decision.\n  If one accepts that argument and concludes that is right, what reason \nwould that be not to have future rounds of base closings? What we \nsimply would do, as we have done in this bill, is to make sure that \nthere will be no privatization in place in the future without the \nspecific recommendation of the Base Closing Commission, which is \ncreated in this amendment. Why would we want to cut off our nose to \nspite our face, even if one believes that it was politicized? Why would \nwe want to say we don't want to save $2 billion in the future because \nDOD or the President politicized the last round? We will cure the \nproblem and disallow privatization in place, unless it is explicitly \nprovided for by the Base Closing Commission--more explicit than the \nlanguage that I even read.\n  Now, our amendment does that. We are not going to cure the perceived \nproblem of this privatization in place action by denying future base \nclosings and denying savings of $2.3 billion a year, which Secretary \nCohen says is the estimated savings from the next two rounds of base \nclosures. We are not going to cure that problem. We are going to make \nour problem worse, not better.\n  Now, we can address that problem, and some may want to do that with \namendments on this floor. If they wish, they are free to try to offer \namendments to reverse that decision. My own view is that we ought to \nmake sure that that action is competitive and is certified by the \ninspector general of the Department of Defense as being a fair and open \ncompetition as between the various alternatives that are sought here.\n  Let the marketplace decide--that is my view--in a fair and open \ncompetition. But there have been some proposals that maybe there ought \nto be amendments to cure what is perceived to be that political \nproblem. That at least addresses the problem. Denying future rounds of \nbase closings, which will deny us savings of billions of dollars, \ndoesn't cure the perceived inequity or unfairness that resulted, many \nfeel, from the privatization in place decision of the Defense \nDepartment. We are not curing the problem. We are just denying \nourselves savings.\n  So there is not a logical connection between those two actions. Now, \nI understand. If I were representing one of those three States, I know \nI would feel the same way they do. At least I think I would. I can \nunderstand that. We all represent States and feel passion for the \nStates we represent. We all represent our States as advocates. We \nbelieve in them and we believe they ought to get a fair shake. When we \ndon't think they got a fair shake, we are on the Senate floor pleading \nfor our State. So I understand.\n  As I said, I understand the pain of base closing. We have been \nthrough it, and we might face more. But I also understand what the \nJoint Chiefs are telling us when they say we have excess, surplus \nbaggage, that the infrastructure exceeds the number of personnel that \nwe now have. ``The tail is too big for the tooth,'' as they say in the \nmilitary. We have to slim down. When General Shalikashvili, who is a \ndistinguished soldier, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, says we have more \nsurplus capacity now than we did when the BRAC closing process began, \nwe should listen.\n  We are listening. We have offered this amendment to give us a chance \nto proceed to shed the excess weight that Secretary Cohen has asked us \nto shed, to save the billions that we need and cannot afford to waste \nif we are going to fully protect and defend the security of this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Michigan for a very lucid and, I \nthink, fact-filled discussion of this issue, which I believe has become \nmore Orwellian in nature, if I might characterize it as that.\n  We are now debating whether closing a base will save money or not. If \nthat were not the case, Mr. President, we made a terrible mistake at \nthe end of World War II. We should have kept all the bases open that we \nbuilt all over America during World War II and should not have closed \nany of them. I am, frankly, astonished.\n  Now, I think there have been valid arguments made over the process. \nThere have been arguments made as to whether the process was \npoliticized in the last round of BRAC. I think that there have been \nsome valid points here. But, Mr. President, anyone in the world, I \nthink, can understand that if you have to reduce a business, a \ncorporation, or whatever it is, because the in-flow of money has been \nreduced, then you have to close a number of facilities because you \ndon't have the business.\n\n  Mr. President, the military, in many ways, is a business. They are \nassigned a mission. They receive money to carry out that mission, and \nthey build the facilities and equipment and hire the men and women to \ncarry out that mission. Then, as that mission is reduced and the amount \nof money to support that mission is reduced, you shrink the size of the \nsupport establishment.\n  It is not really very complicated. To make an argument that a base \nclosing does not save money over time, really, to me, defies all logic. \nYes, there have been costs associated with base closings that were not \nanticipated. I will certainly agree with that. A lot of it had to do \nwith environmental cleanup. But the fact is, Mr. President, that those \ncosts would have been incurred anyway and probably would have been \nhigher as years went by and the pollution and the environmental \npoisoning would have become greater. So to somehow say that because we \nhad to clean up bases that were closing does not justify the bases \nbeing closed, that ignores the fact that sooner or later the \nenvironmental cleanup would have had to take place.\n  Now, Mr. President, if you have three bases and you only need two, \nthen you need to keep paying the electric bill at the third base, keep \nthe runways paved and the housing up and the grass cut. All of those \nare costs that are associated with excess inventory. So when you don't \nhave the requirement for that inventory because the mission has been \nreduced--the funding in this case--then you reduce the support \nestablishment. I don't know how it could be much less complex than \nthat.\n  When we talk about CBO estimates, DOD savings estimates are \ninconsistent, unreliable, and incomplete, maybe they are. Maybe they \nare all those things. But you can't deny the fundamental fact that \nunless you believe we are going to increase defense spending, we have \nto have a better match-up between the support establishment and the \noperating forces, and that because our reduction in overall funding and \nour failure to implement the reductions in the support establishment is \nnot matched up, we therefore are losing in this ``tooth to tail'' \nratio, which the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, has talked about \non occasion.\n  One of the opponents of this amendment said that Congress should be \ndoing this. I totally agree that Congress should be making these \ndecisions. It is a lack of courage on the part of Congress that we have \nto turn to a\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\ncommission. But, Mr. President, it is perfectly clear that for 17 years \nnot a base was closed, even though there was a requirement, in the view \nof one and all, to do so. It was because Congress didn't have the \npolitical will to do it. That is why we resorted to the Base Closing \nCommission.\n  Now, if I had the confidence that Congress would act in a responsible \nfashion and we would close bases as necessary, then I would not support \nthe commission. But the record is perfectly clear that, for all those \nyears, we were unable to close a base because Congress was politically \nparalyzed, so we had to give the responsibility and the blame to a Base \nClosing Commission.\n  The Senator from Michigan has already referred to the letter of the \nSecretary of Defense. I am told that a letter from the President is \ncoming over. The inspector general of DOD found that, in some cases, \nthey overestimated cost by $148 million, and they underestimated \nsavings by $614 million. The inspector general is a well-respected \nindividual, and her memorandum, which is contained in the cover letter \nby Secretary Cohen, I think is abundantly clear.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't like to drag out this debate too long. I think \nthat some arguments have been made that I think are important to be \nmade by the opponents of this amendment. I want to make it clear that \nif the Dorgan second-degree amendment is not tabled, the Senator from \nMichigan and I intend to have a vote on our amendment up or down. So we \nwill raise that amendment again until there is a final adjudication by \nthis body on the McCain-Levin amendment. I hope that the Dorgan second-\ndegree amendment is tabled and we can have an up-or-down vote on the \nother.\n  The Senator from Michigan pointed out and showed the stacks of \ninformation that have been sent over to the Senate. The Senator from \nMichigan and others have pointed out the abundance of information that \nhas been sent over by the Department of Defense and the forms and \nreports as to how much money has been saved and where and under what \ncircumstances. Yes, we underestimated the environmental cleanup costs, \nbut we have underestimated the environmental cleanup costs in every \ntoxic waste site in America, not just on military bases. Those toxic \nwaste sites are not going to go away just because the base remains \nopen. Sooner or later, that problem is going to have to be addressed. \nSo I hope that we will act in agreement.\n  One other thing. The letter from the chiefs of the services that came \nover, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--many of the \nallegations I have heard quite often are that members of the military \nare empire builders, they never want to give up a base or a weapons \nsystem, and they never met a weapon system they didn't love. These \nindividuals are calling for these tough decisions to be made because \nthey know what will happen if we don't close these bases. It will not \nfree up the money, which is absolutely vital, in their view, to \nmodernizing the force and retaining the men and women we need in the \nAll Volunteer Force, to provide sufficient funds for training and \noperations in order to keep our military the best in the world, because \nyou can't siphon off all this money into support functions and expect \nus then to have enough money left over to carry out the operations that \nare necessary.\n  So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will move to table the \nDorgan second-degree amendment. I hope we can dispense with this issue \nas soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to talk \nabout this process. I have to say that having gone through the three \nBRAC processes we have had in the past, having traveled from city to \ncity to make the cases that we made, having fought very hard to try and \nmake sure the process was honest and decent, having lived through it, \nwhere the defense depot in Ogden was shut down--we felt, for very poor \nreasons. The only reason was that it was more interior, it seems to me, \nthan the bases on the various coasts. But it seems to me that that was \none of its great advantages. It would be much more difficult to attack \nif we got into difficulty.\n  But we lived with that. We lived with the shutdown of the Tooele Army \nBase, which literally had the greatest heavy-duty vehicle repair \nfacility in the world, just completed at a cost of almost $200 million \nto the taxpayers. And they shut down. Now they wish they had not \nbecause they now don't have the facilities or quite the same capability \nto take care of Army heavy-duty vehicles. It was a stupid thing to do. \nBut that is what they did, in spite of the fact that Utahans have the \nchemical weapons destruction facility there. And we put up with all of \nthe hazardous problems of storing chemical weapons in Utah and even \ntransporting them around with various aspects in and out of Utah and \nwith the chemical weapons demilling that we do there.\n  Utahans have always been very patriotic. They have supported the \nmilitary as much, if not more so, than any other State in the Union, \nand I think the attitude is still that way in spite of some of these \nglaring inequities that have occurred. We lived with those. We can \naccept them.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Arizona. We should shut \ndown bases that do not deserve to compete, or really aren't \ncompetitive, or really are dealing with old, worn-out, less modernized \nfacilities and also equipment, and work done on various less modernized \npieces of equipment. But what we are getting very upset about lately is \nthat we went all through this BRAC process, and we worked our tails off \ntrying to make a case for the Hill Air Force Base and Ogden Air \nLogistics Command. We did. It came out No. 1 without question. It was \nthe best Air Logistics Command in all of the Air Force--in all of the \nmilitary. The work force was one of the best in the history of the \ncountry. And we won. So did Tinker Air Force Base. So did Warner \nRobins.\n  Mr. President, they won because they were more competitive. These \nthree bases won because they could do a better job. They won because \nthey literally made sense as far as keeping our Air Force modernized \nand working well with the best equipment possible. Three work forces \nappeared to be the best, and certainly Hill was No. 1. Since that has \nhappened, Hill has gone down to about a 54 or 55 percent utilization of \ncapacity.\n  I have to say this. With that low utilization of capacity, which \nshould be up around 85 percent had the transition work been given to \nHill, and which we hope will be given to Hill, if we could get it up \nover 70 percent of capacity, as high as 85 percent of capacity, Hill \nAir Force Base would be so competitive that nobody could compete with \nthem in the world today. But at 54 or 55 percent, it means that the \ncosts are much higher than literally they would be if we were utilizing \nthe capacity in a fair and decent manner.\n  I have to say that we have had many Air Force people tell us they \ndon't want to ever see Hill hurt because it is the best Air Logistics \nCommand in the armed services today. But their hands are somewhat tied \nby the administration that is playing politics with the BRAC process.\n  The administration has indicated because there are two Presidential \nStates involved that even though the full BRAC process said that \nMcClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento had to be shut down and that \nKelly Air Force Base in San Antonio had to be shut down, the \nadministration has indicated they don't want them shut down. As a \nmatter of fact, they are now talking about privatization in place. It \nis nice to talk about that if all things were equal--if literally good \nbusiness principles were practiced; if literally there was not any \nstacking of the deck in either case; if literally the regulations that \nwould be written would be fair. Maybe there could be an argument for \nthat.\n  But the only argument that should be made for privatization in place \nis after the consolidation of the three Air Logistic Commands that won \nthe competition. Once they are consolidated, then I have no problem \nwith trying to place some privatization and have private companies bid \non some of the work.\n  Keep in mind that one reason why we don't go straight to \nprivatization is because during time of war, we want to be able, above \nall things, to be functional, and we don't want to have to\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nworry about whether prices are going to be jacked up by private \ncompanies, or whether or not we have the capacity to take care of the \nneeds of our fighting men and women overseas, or for any other number \nof reasons.\n  Mr. President, the President's politicization of the BRAC95 process \nhas become a common theme on this floor. I admire the willingness of so \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to explicitly state \nthat privatization-in-place was not intended by BRAC, and that this \ndeliberate evasion of the BRAC recommendations can only portend defeat \nfor those seeking future BRAC rounds.\n\n\n           utah does not deserve to lose three bracs in a row\n\n  My State, Utah, does not deserve to lose in three successive BRAC \nrounds. We lost 5,000 jobs from the closure of two installations, the \nTooele Army Depot in BRAC91 and the Defense Depot at Ogden in BRAC93. \nBut Hill Air Force Base, and the Ogden Air Logistics Center, is a \ndifferent case.\n  Hill is the best of the best among maintenance depots, rated as a \ntier I installation. That means the highest military value. By \ncontrast, Kelly and McClellan were rated tier III--meaning the lowest \nmilitary value. To privatize at the worst depots is to demean the \nmerits of the Air Force and BRAC decisions to preserve the best, and \nthe best is the work force at Hill.\n  I can make the case that BRAC91 was wrong. The Army put $250 million \ninto the finest consolidated maintenance depot for wheeled combat \nvehicles in the world. A couple of years later, it shut it down and \nmoved the work to the Red River Army Depot at Texarkana. Then what do \nyou think happened? Red River was designated for closure! But it gets \nworse--DOD virtually abandoned Tooele until the Tooele County \nCommission, to its everlasting credit, aggressively beat the bushes for \nusers, successfully bringing Detroit Diesel onto the former base.\n  The point is that Utahns can and do turn bad situations into \nsuccesses. We can deal with adversity, but we do not have to deal with \nthe type of unfairness and outrageous discrimination that is being \ndealt to my State by the President.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Hill met the best of the BRAC95 \nparameters, which included military value and return on investment.\n  Utah is a terrific investment for the Air Force and the Nation:\n  DOD is mindful of Utah's value for the same reasons that domestic and \nforeign businesses flock to the State. And they certainly don't come \nbecause of our political clout alone--after all, we have only five \nelectoral votes.\n  Utah's attraction lies with its people, its business climate, its \nyouthful and well-educated work force.\n  The State has the highest educational level in the United States, \naccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  Money Magazine and Business Week, among other sources, repeatedly \ncite it as the best place to do business, the best place to live, and \nthe so-called Software Valley of the World.\n  And its workforce is the youngest in the country and teeming with \nskilled college graduates who work. Ask any business in Utah about the \nUtah work ethic; in fact, ask the BRAC commissioners! Ask the Air \nForce!\n  In a few words: Utahns are the real return on investment, and it is \nwhy the Air Force and BRAC have heavily endorsed the retention of Hill.\n  Utah's military value is unmatched. The BRAC commissioners didn't \nmiss a thing in assessing Hill's military value. It hosts the gateway \nto the Nation's largest exercise site, the Utah Test & Training Range, \ncovering 2,675 square miles. This is the only range in the world on \nwhich every active Air Force aircraft can exercise--keep that point in \nmind. If Hill is not properly used, or if the President's privatization \ndeception causes an underutilized Hill to suffer in a future BRAC \nround, I will tell you now that this range will not longer be available \nto DOD. It is just that simple. People in Utah are going to turn \nagainst them.\n  Even though we have been the most patriotic State, or equal to any \nother patriotic State in the Union.\n  I will not allow the citizens of my State to become a DOD trash can--\ndumping bombs on our fragile terrain, using our remote regions for \ndeveloping chemical defenses or demilitarizing dangerous chemical \nmunitions, for example. We tolerate as day-to-day sacrifices certain \nactivities that we see other States revolting against.\n  We want Hill's military value appreciated and developed precisely the \nway that BRAC intended, and that means consolidating core workload at \nHill. We want this work at the best depot. Like most other Americans, \nwe do not want privatization of the workload at the site of the worst \ndepot. We want the ICBM depot at Hill to flourish, the F-16 \nlogistics management program, and the C-130 depot programs to be \nexpanded as intended. We deserve--because we have earned--the F-22 and \nJoint Strike Fighter depot programs over the next decade.\n\n  Hill does not work well at the current 50-percent capacity usage \nlevel, nor at the 66-percent level which it would have in the outyears \nif privatization in place occurs. We work best when we are at full \ncapacity, and that is why BRAC directed a consolidation package that \nwould put Hill at 86-percent utilization in the year 2001. It was done, \nto repeat myself, because Hill is the best of the best.\n\n\n                hill reflects the utah ``can-do'' spirit\n\n  Mr. President, Utah is a State populated initially by pioneers who \nlived and overcame adversity--even in the face of outrageous unfairness \nand persecution. Today, the Old Mormon Trail is alive with men and \nwomen of all ages, and of all faiths, who are re-re-creating that \nspirit as they trek toward Utah.\n  We overcame the unfairness of Tooele Army Depot loss, as I mentioned.\n  Despite our remote location, we are a literate, sophisticated State \nwith 17 percent of the Utah adult speaking a foreign language, most \nfluently.\n  Our small State with just over 1 million persons in the work force, \nhas over 1,800 information technology and computer software companies.\n  Our unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, while our job creation rate is \ntwice that of the United States at 7.3 percent.\n  And, we are the fifth fastest growing State.\n  Mr. President, I could go on--but my point has been made, I believe. \nIt is that, like many other Members of both the House and Senate, we \ndemand fairness. When we appoint an independent commission, we expect \nits recommendations to be honored by a Chief Executive who is President \nof all the people, not just those with the greatest number of potential \nvotes.\n\n\n                         privatization in place\n\n  Mr. President, the Base Realignment Commission--BRAC--issue that \naffects us most deeply is the evasion of the BRAC recommendation to \nconsolidate workload at a public depot or at a commercial private \nsector facility. This BRAC recommendation has been distorted by the \nClinton administration to allow what has now become known as \nprivatization in place.\n  In the next few minutes, I will present eight reasons why \nprivatization in place will not work. It is not economically feasible, \nand it is inherently unfair to the public depot competitor:\n  First, it will worsen already deteriorated efficiency in the depot \nsystem;\n  Second, GAO has identified current wasteful depot practices that beg \nreform, something that privatization in place can't provide;\n  Third, past depot reforms have not succeeded;\n  Fourth, the problem of excess capacity is not solved;\n  Fifth, it will not produce promised cost savings;\n  Sixth, the best depots are being sacrificed on a shaky political \nalter;\n  Seventh, the case for privatization in place has yet to be made; and\n  Eighth, the privatization-in-place competition lacks the elements of \nfairness expected in Government solicitations.\n\n\n  privatization-in-place will compound identified depot inefficiencies\n\n  Mr. President, the Depot Caucus is an informal group of Members of \nCongress with strong interests in averting the problems of depot waste \nand inefficiency. Our goal is to ensure the availability of high-\nreadiness equipment to our Armed Forces.\n  Depot operations are part of service logistics, which is probably the \nmost difficult of all military specialties.\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nEven some of history's top military strategists, Napoleon and von \nClausewitz, to name two of the greatest, failed to insert military \nlogistics into their battle plans and strategies. Yet, military \nlogistics has long been one of the great strengths of our military \nservices. It has also been an undeniable cause of our success on the \nbattlefield.\n\n  My point here is that we cannot afford the inefficiencies and waste \nthat privatization in place will bring to an already cumbersome depot \nsystem in DOD.\n\n\n        gao has found depot operations wasteful and inefficient\n\n  GAO has identified $2.5 billion of losses over 4 years directly \nrelated to an Air Force depot system that is already encumbered with 40 \npercent excess capacity. In its May 1997 report on defense depot \noperations, the GAO said ``DOD consistently experienced losses [in \ndepot operations] * * *, and has had to request additional funding to \nsupport their operations.''\n  Why do I raise this specific point? Because depot operations are \nexpected to at least break even. That has always been one of the Air \nForce depot system's ever-elusive goals. But, instead, the system will \nsustain operating losses for fiscal year 1997, which the Air Force \nestimates at $1.7 billion. This exceeds even the GAO forecasted losses.\n  Let me add that operating losses is an auditor's term of art. GAO's \nmandate is to audit organizational and operational procedures to \nevaluate efficiency and effectiveness, predictors of program quality.\n\n\n     depot financial management reforms have helped only marginally\n\n  This is not to say that DOD hasn't been working the problem; it's \njust not getting any better. Let me give you an example.\n  In 1995, DOD streamlined the financial management of its depot \noperations by devolving control over depot financing from the office of \nthe Secretary of Defense to the military services. This reform shifted \naccountability for the Defense Business Operating Fund [DBOF], placing \nit at the service level. I share GAO's demand for better \naccountability. But the problems plaguing DBOF just followed the so-\ncalled reforms.\n  First, the Air Force, not unlike the Navy, advance billed its \ncustomers, which are the military units sending equipment to the depots \nand which pay for the services of the depots. The advance billing came \nto $2.9 billion, which was to ensure that sufficient cash balances were \navailable to pay for the goods, services, and other stock items \nrequired by the depots to service the assets. Still, the Air Force will \noperate this year at the $1.7 billion deficit that I mentioned earlier.\n  The second point regarding this reform is that there is simply too \nlittle demand for depot service. It's a classic supply-demand problem \nthat every undergraduate encounters in textbooks. I suggest to my \ncolleagues that if they owned a chain of auto repair facilities--let's \nsay 5--and there was significant excess capacity, the logical thing \nwould be to close two garages and consolidate the work in the remaining \nthree. Unlike a lot of what the Air Force does, this is not rocket \nscience.\n  But, I can't place too much blame on the Air Force. They have four \nbig problems, the last of which is beyond their control:\n  First, they're faced with 40 percent overcapacity;\n  Second, they have a resulting $1.7 billion deficit this year;\n  Third, there are gross inefficiencies and distortions that always \naccrue to business planning when you have to advance bill your \ncustomers; and\n  Fourth, they now have some members of their board of directors, \nincluding Congress, telling them to throw caution to the wind and \nsustain these inefficiencies anyway!\n  Many Members of this body have run businesses. Is there anyone here \nwho could keep afloat under these conditions?\n  My last point on current inefficiencies is that these problems were \nnot unknown before we compiled the Defense depot provisions in the bill \nbefore us today.\n  You'll recall that during the BRAC process we used a sophisticated \nanalytical modeling technique called COBRA [Cost of Base Realignment \nActivities]. The parameters and formulas applied by the COBRA model \nlong ago uncovered the same problems. Academicians say that a model's \nstrength is related to its ability to predict and explain. The accuracy \nwith which BRAC uncovered, explained, and predicted the problems that \nwe are discussing today suggests COBRA's efficacy. Perhaps some other \nagencies of government ought to try it.\n\n\n                     the problem of excess capacity\n\n  Mr. President, the GAO testified before the Senate Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee hearing last month. In his testimony before \nthat panel, the Assistant Comptroller General made the following \nobservation on excess capacity. DOD's 40 percent excess capacity, he \nsaid, ``is a significant contribution toward inefficiency and high cost \nof DOD's maintenance program and in generating significant losses in \nthe depot maintenance activity group of the services' working capital \nfunds.'' This was in further reference to the annual $1.7 billion \nannual Air Force depot system loss referred to earlier.\n\n  Still more importantly, the GAO testimony continued--and I want to \nemphasize the following remarks:\n\n       The Air Force's plans for implementing BRAC recommendations \n     will do little to reduce excess capacity and will likely \n     result in increased depot maintenance prices.\n\n  Here, of course, the GAO witness was referring to Air Force proposals \nto implement privatization in place to avoid the BRAC recommendation \nfor the consolidation of workload to depots or other commercial private \nactivities. In the case of San Antonio and Sacramento, this expressly \nexcludes privatization in place as an alternative to closure.\n  Mr. President, as a customer of the depot system, you don't have real \nmarket choice if you cannot utilize alternatives to suppliers who lock \nyou into higher prices. My point is that depots are forced to be \ninefficient, both as competitors as well as business operators, where \nwe deny them the opportunity to rid themselves of excess capacity to \nbring down costs.\n  The problem of waste gets worse. GAO found a $689 million loss from \ncontinued excess capacity related to the DOD privatization in place \nplan. If you multiply this amount over 6 years, which is the statutory \nperiod for the phase-out of BRAC closures, the loss to the taxpayers is \na staggering $4.1 billion. Imagine what it would be if an 8-year \ncontract, as proposed in the McClellan competition, were to be awarded!\n  Again, I plead with my colleagues who have been in business to stop \nand think about this--could you keep your customers if you just kept \nraising prices, while requiring them to disperse badly needed operating \nfunds to pay for services in advance?\n  It may be great theater, but it's a lousy business practice. And it \nis even worse as public policy. We are gouging the taxpayers to \nsubsidize such outrageous waste. We need to put a stop to it by \npreventing privatization in place.\n\n\n          privatization in place does not produce cost savings\n\n  Mr. President, GAO has also criticized the overly optimistic \nassumptions about cost savings that were anticipated from privatization \nin place where it had been authorized. I repeat: where authorized, to \ndistinguish from the plain language of the BRAC recommendation \nregarding Sacramento and San Antonio, which stated ``consolidation . . \n. to commercial private sector activities,'' which in no way allows the \ninference of privatization in place. Privatization in place was not \nintended. This is a point clearly made by the ranking minority member \nof the Readiness Subcommittee and junior Senator from Virginia on this \nfloor last Thursday evening.\n  But, let me turn to a case study where privatization in place was \ndirectly recommended by BRAC. Let's look at the results. I refer to the \nBRAC 1993 decision regarding the Air Force Aerospace Guidance and \nMetrological Center located at Newark AFB, Ohio. GAO performed an audit \nof facility operations under privatization in place and found that the \nAir Force itself estimated costs to be $9 to $32 million higher than \nthose before the operation went private. In fact, I was told by the Air \nForce over the weekend that there remain nearly 150 government \nemployees at the site.\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\n  Despite this history, the solicitation for privatization at McClellan \nis actually forecasting a 25 percent cost savings! Every sensible \ngovernment accountant that I've spoken to claims this figure is at best \nvastly inflated.\n\n\nthe president is sacrificing the best depots on a shaky political alter\n\n  Politicization of the BRAC process is risky both economically and \nmilitarily. The consequences are already quite clear:\n  Both the House an Senate will deny the President future BRAC rounds. \nWho among us can support continuation of a process that has become \nblatantly political? Who is willing to roll the dice with the \nlivelihoods of workers in their States, let alone the lives of our \nservicemen and women?\n  We are denying DOD critically needed modernization moneys that were \nto come from the BRAC savings.\n  Worse, still, we are courting the serious deterioration of combat \nefficiency and safety if our armed services do not get technologies--\ntechnologies which are already in the hands of our adversaries, some of \nthem Third World countries.\n  There is not the least likelihood that demand will rise to meet the \nsustained levels of excess capacity perpetuated by the President's \nactions. For example, modern weapon systems have reduced programmed \ndepot maintenance. The F-16, for one, has no routine depot-maintenance \nrequirements. And that aircraft is to be replaced by the Joint Strike \nFighter, which has even a longer mean-time-between-failures \nrequirement--MTBF means the average that a system can operate without \nmajor replacement or overhaul. The F-22, which will replace the F-15, \nalso has no programmed depot maintenance.\n\n  But the problems of excess capacity get worse. GAO has calculated \nthat the 5 depots left in place will have 57 million direct work hours \nto perform 32 million direct work hours of labor, and, the requirement \nwill fall by over 37 percent to 20 million direct work hours by 1999. \nThis means that the depot system will have over 2\\1/2\\ times the amount \nof labor it needs.\n  Mr. President, the President's politicization of BRAC is costing our \ndefense structure the best of the best.\n  The BRAC decision could not have been more clear. Hill AFB was a Tier \nI depot, meaning that it had the highest military value. San Antonio \nand Sacramento, by contrast, were Tier III--or installations which had \nthe lowest military value. The ratings were made by the Air Force and \nused extensively in the BRAC rounds. Yet, the Air Force is now being \nbrow-beaten by its political masters in the Clinton administration into \nrenouncing its own objective rankings.\n  At the same time, these Tier III installations are being extended the \nsame rewards that were fairly won by the hard work of the Utah, \nGeorgia, and Oklahoma bases. Mr. President, what does this say for \nmerit? Or, will the Senate merely go on record with the message that \nlots of electoral votes carry the day?\n  What statement are we making to motivate government employees to \nprovide their best effort? How much political distortion and corruption \nof good performance are we willing to tolerate?\n  Let me put a more positive face on some of these problems. Let's \nconsider the value to the taxpayer of pursuing the BRAC \nrecommendations, that is, keeping the best, while eliminating the \npoorer performers. According to GAO, the elimination of the San Antonio \nand Sacramento depots, as proposed by BRAC, would produce the following \ngains:\n  Excess capacity, by 1999, would fall from 65 percent to 27 percent. \nOn the other hand, if the bases are not closed, San Antonio will have \n89 percent of its maximum capacity idled, while Sacramento will be at \n90 percent;\n  Average hourly rates would be reduced by $6 per hour; and\n  That $182 million would be saved annually from these types of \neconomies of scale and efficiencies.\n  Regrettably, I have to say that the President's attitude toward the \nnoncoastal Western States, and especially my own State of Utah, cannot \nescape our attention. It should be foremost in the thoughts of every \nSenator from this region.\n  The President has repeatedly interfered with, tried to disrupt, and \ntried to knock off course the most economically vibrant regional \neconomy in the Nation.\n  Need another example? Among other punitive land use regulations, he \nhas usurped without prior consultation 1.7 million acres of land in my \nState, arbitrarily removing them from economic development and other \ngenerally beneficial uses. I refer here to the grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument.\n  It troubles me substantially that the President, even though he is in \nhis second term, is simply not acting as the President of all the \npeople and all the States. He is acting as the President for the large, \nelectorally rich States. If this were not true, the decision to \nimplement the BRAC recommendation would be a no-brainer.\n\n\n      The privatization in place competition is inherently unfair\n\n  Mr. President, I have done a thorough assessment of the proposal for \nprivatization in place at McClellan. I find two major flaws that \nstarkly stack the deck against the public depot and favor private \nbidders.\n  First, the public depot bidders are forced to bear an unfair share of \nthe costs of transitioning the Sacramento depot from active Air Force \nstatus.\n  The DOD Cost of Competition Handbook stipulates that both public and \nprivate bidders must cite the transition costs in their bids. However, \nthe private bidder doesn't include the costs of early retirement, \nseparation, or relocation for workers at Sacramento who lose their \njobs. But the public depot shows it as an accounting charge because \nit's paid by the taxpayer.\n  This becomes a form of double accounting. In fact, BRAC intended, and \nCongress provided the moneys, to fund personnel transition costs \nregardless of who wins. Yet, the impression is left that this is a cost \nthat will be integrated into the depot's cost to its customers.\n  Second, the private bidders get substantial financial and performance \nadvantages from the use of the excess capacity intended to be closed by \nBRAC.\n  The local redevelopment authority can determine its own cost of \nleasing the facility to the private bidder. What an incentive. There is \nnothing to keep the leasing agreement from covering just about \nanything, such as depreciation writeoffs, improvements, and even \nequipment and facility maintenance. All of this allows the private \nbidder to be artificially low.\n  Yet another inequity denies the public depot from beginning military \nconstruction related to the workload transfer until the contract is \nawarded. This means the work must be performed at the Sacramento \nlocation for an indeterminate period of time, adding to the public \nbidder's cost. And, of course, reducing the fairness of the \ncompetition.\n  The McClellan bid consists of a 5-year contract with three 1-year \noptions, for a possible total award of 8 years. The options are \nperformance based. This means that the LRA is certain to expend moneys \non facilities maintenance in order to allow the private contractor to \nachieve better productivity, and through that level of performance, \nensure the option awards. The public depot, on the other hand, must \ninvest in facilities modernization and reflect this investment in its \ncost.\n\n\n         the case for privatization in place just can't be made\n\n   Mr. President, on the basis of all available evidence, we should \nconclude that privatization in place cannot fairly or reasonably \nproduce cost savings. More likely, it will contribute to waste and \ninefficiency. In support of this proposition, I want to make the \nfollowing closing arguments:\n  First, depots are already among the most critical or so-called high-\nrisk areas of the Federal Government.\n  High risk is a special designation used by GAO to alert Congress to \nareas that are highly vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement.\n  Second, GAO has already forecast that, by the end of fiscal year \n1999, San Antonio will have 89 percent of its maximum productive \ncapacity as excess, while Sacramento's excess capacity will be at 90 \npercent. Both of these levels are more than twice the current 40 \npercent excess capacity that we are arguing about today. In other \nwords, the problem is going to be doubly bad by the end of the next \nfiscal year if we don't solve it now by ending privatization in place.\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\n  Again, these problems are caused in great part by diminished workload \nrequirements related to force downsizing. Yet, as I said earlier, it is \nthe savings generated by reducing infrastructure that are fueling our \nability to modernize our equipment, something that almost every Member \nof this body knows is necessary.\n  Third, GAO told the Appropriations Committee panel that: ``the Air \nForce has the most serious excess capacity problem.'' The combined \nlosses could reach about $500 million if the Sacramento and San Antonio \nfacilities are kept in the inventory.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the value of the BRAC findings that I \nmentioned earlier. I need to repeat this: in making its determinations \nregarding both these depots, BRAC leaned heavily on the Air Force's own \ndesignation of the Sacramento and San Antonio ALC's as so-called Tier \nIII installations. This means, as most of us involved in the BRAC \nprocess will recall, that the installations had the lowest military \nvalue. I challenge anyone to argue that there is some redemptive value \nthat could follow from the revival of installations that the Air Force \nitself realized should be closed.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that Utah has been on the low end of the \nBRAC process in other areas. My State has lost two installations. I \nmust admit that I fought hard to prevent those losses. I do not deny \nthe trauma that the closure of such a large military facility causes \nStates and communities. And, I admit that if the situation were \nreversed, I might be making the same weak arguments my colleagues from \nCalifornia and Texas are making today. I am well aware of what is at \nstake for my colleagues from Texas and California.\n  But, this does not excuse the Clinton administration from its \nresponsibilities either to the defense of our country, to the ensuring \nthe safest possible equipment for our servicemen and women, or to the \ntaxpayers who are footing the bills. The President needs to take the \nbroad view. And, by rejecting the BRAC recommendations--and \ncompromising the entire BRAC process for unsupportable political \nreasons--he clearly has not.\n  We should not tolerate diversions from, or the politicization of, the \nBRAC recommendations. The very nature of downsizing means that there \nwill be losers and survivors. We must make every effort to protect the \nintegrity that the process itself demands.\n  But, more importantly, one of our essential duties under the \nConstitution is to provide for the common defense. Congress and the \nPresident have the ultimate responsibility for the support of our Armed \nForces. It is a duty we cannot delegate. I simply ask each of my \ncolleagues these questions:\n  Do we fulfill that duty when we knowingly allow diversions that \nproduce gross inefficiencies in the operation of military services from \nthe recommendations of an independent commission?\n  And do we honor our obligations by denying funds produced by these \nrecommendations for the provision of technologically superior equipment \nand training for our fighting men and women?\n  We need to affirm our duties and obligations. Only then will we take \na major step toward giving our citizens and our fighting men and women \nthe type of defense the country expects.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, in conclusion, that I want this \nprocess to work. It is very difficult for me to support a future BRAC \nprocess if this is going to be politicized the way we see it being \npoliticized right now. After all, the pain, suffering, inconvenience, \nand difficulties in traveling around the country and meeting time after \ntime with the military, with the various administrations, and so forth, \nto have to put up with what is going on right now is just unacceptable.\n  Frankly, I can't support a future BRAC process if that is the best we \ncan do with this one, which I thought was fair and which came out with \nvery tough decisions. They weren't easy. I feel sorry for anybody who \nhas lost anything. But we have lost plenty, too.\n  All I can say is, if we lose this, then I am never going to get over \nit. I don't think the people of Utah are going to get over it, and I \nthink, frankly, the country will be poorer for it, and I think our \nnational security interests will be poorer for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions and Senator Inhofe be added as cosponsors to amendment 420 \noffered by Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. today, there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided between \nSenator Wellstone and Senator Thurmond, or his designee, and 15 minutes \nof debate between Senator Gorton and Senator Inouye; and, immediately \nfollowing that debate, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to \nthe Wellstone amendment 670, to be followed by a vote on or in relation \nto the Gorton amendment 424, to be followed by a vote on or in relation \nto the Dodd amendment 765; and, finally there be 2 minutes for debate \nequally divided before the second and third vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that no \nother amendments be in order to the above-listed amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Dorgan \namendment with reference to base closures pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to speak for a few moments on the subject. \nI will not take long.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan-Domenici amendment to \nrequire the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress \ndetailing the costs and savings of previously authorized base closure \nrounds and on the need, if any, for further base closure rounds prior \nto the Congress authorizing the Department to move forward with \nadditional closures. This amendment stands for a simple proposition. It \nsays that as Members of Congress we will take our oversight \nresponsibilities seriously when major decisions that affect the lives \nof all Americans are on the table. It says that we will take a long \nhard look at where we have been before we chart a course for where we \nare going. We owe the people we represent a commitment to carefully \nanalyze what the last four rounds of base closure dating back to 1989 \nhave accomplished before we decide to give the authority to the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct two more base closure rounds. This \namendment does not say that additional base closure rounds are not \nnecessary, or that they will not be needed in the future. This \namendment simply requires that the Congress be able to have essential \nfactual data about the costs and savings associated with previous \nrounds before we authorize legislation that would give the Department \nof Defense the authority to conduct new rounds. This amendment is \nreasonable, it is fair, and it offers a common sense approach to the \nserious modernization problems we face.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear before I begin that I understand \nthe argument of those who say that BRAC savings are an important part \nof the funds that will finance the future modernization of our Armed \nForces and keep our military the most technologically advanced and \nlethal fighting force in the world. I understand that the Quadrennial \nDefense Review and the National Defense Panel established by the \nCongress concluded that further reductions in the DOD base structure \nare essential to free up money we need to modernize our forces. I am \naware that in a recent letter, all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nurged the Congress to ``strongly support further reductions in base \nstructure proposed by the Secretary of Defense.'' Nevertheless, Mr. \nPresident, the question is not whether the savings are needed, the\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\nquestion is will the necessary savings for force modernization be \npresent if we conduct two more rounds of closure? In that regard, no \none can guarantee that the savings will be present after two more \nrounds. No one can guarantee the projected savings from previous rounds \nwill be what they are currently estimated. The QDR did not guarantee \nthe savings will be present, the National Defense Review Panel has not \nassured the Congress that the savings will be present, and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff has not assured the Congress that the savings will be \npresent if we close more bases.\n  There have been four rounds of base closure--1988, 1991, 1993, 1995. \nThey have resulted in decisions to close 97 of 495 major bases in the \nUnited States. Between 1990 and 2001 the DOD estimates that BRAC \nactions will produce a total of $13.5 billion in net savings. After \n2001, when all of the previous BRAC actions must be completed, steady \nState savings are estimated by the DOD to be $5.6 billion per year. CBO \nestimates that it will cost $23.4 billion to close all 97 bases. These \ncosts are mostly due to environmental cleanup at closing bases, 30 \npercent, additional operations and maintenance at receiving bases, 35 \npercent, and additional construction and renovations and receiving \nbases, 30 percent.\n\n  CBO projects at total of $57 billion in savings by the year 2020. CBO \nestimates that DOD will save about $28.7 billion during the BRAC \nimplementation process, 1988-2001, which means a net savings of only \n$5.3 billion during those years. Half of the $57 billion in savings are \nprojected to come from lower operations and maintenance costs; a \nquarter from less spending on personnel, including civilians whose jobs \nare eliminated; the remainder comes from projected land sales.\n  Mr. President, the main question we must ask ourselves is how \nreliable is this cost savings information? The answer, unfortunately, \nis that no one really knows. Not the Department of Defense, not the \nCongress, not the President.\n  We in New Mexico have had a fair amount of experience with the base \nclosure process and one fact that we have learned is that what the \nDepartment of Defense estimates in savings cannot, and should not be \ntaken for granted. We need to examine carefully whether the savings \npromised have some basis in reality. The responsible choice is to see \nwhere we have been before we set a course of where we are going.\n  For example, during the 1995 BRAC process the Secretary of Defense \nrecommended that Kirtland Air Force Base undergo a major realignment. \nBefore we took a long hard look at their numbers for costs and savings, \nthe Department of the Air Force estimated that it would spend $277.5 \nmillion to realign the base while projecting a $464.5 million in \nsavings over 20 years.\n  Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that not only did we \nfind that the Air Force's costs and savings were wholly inaccurate, but \nthat after careful analysis by my staff, knowledgeable members of the \ncommunity, and others in the congressional Delegation, the Secretary of \nDefense for the first time in the history of the BRAC process wrote to \nthe BRAC Commission and told them that ``* * * the recommendation for \nthe realignment of Kirtland Air Force Base no longer represents a \nfinancially or operationally sound scenario.''\n  Specifically, we found that if the Air Force major realignment of \nKirtland Air Force Base passed that the Department of Energy would have \nto assume $64 million in conversion costs and that it would cost an \nadditional $30.6 million per year to maintain the safety, security, and \nviability of the critical base operations that remained.\n  Mr. President, the New Mexico experience with BRAC may be unique, but \nit serves to make the essential point that we are making with this \namendment. The driving factor behind base closure decisions should \ncontinue to be the overall cost to the taxpayer. In our case, the \noriginal half-billion cost savings turned out to be a half-billion new \ncost to the taxpayer. The message of the New Mexico experience is that \nwe need to carefully examine the Department's projected costs and \nsavings in order to thoughtfully determine whether it is a wise \ndecision to give the Department of Defense the legislative authority \nthey need to conduct additional base closure rounds. The Dorgan-\nDomenici amendment will give the Congress the necessary data to make \nthis decision in a thoughtful and precise manner.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senators from New Mexico and North Dakota are not \nthe only people who think that the Department of Defense's current \ncosts and savings projections may not be reliable. The Congressional \nBudget Office says it ``cannot evaluate the accuracy of DOD's estimates \nwithout empirical data.'' In even stronger words the CBO states that \nthe ``Department is unable to report actual spending and savings for \nBRAC actions.'' CBO recommends that, ``Congress could consider asking \nDOD to establish an information system that would track the actual \ncosts and savings of closing military bases. The system could apply to \nBRAC IV bases because DOD is just beginning to shut down those bases \nand virtually all the work remains to be done.''\n  In addition to the CBO's analysis, the Government Accounting Office \nhad this to say, ``DOD cannot provide accurate information on actual \nsavings because (1) information on base support costs was not retained \nfor some closing bases and (2) the services' accounting systems cannot \nisolate the effect on support costs at gaining bases.''\n  Mr. President, the task we have before us is clear. My advice to \nSenators is to make the responsible choice and let us take a careful \nlook before we leap into two new rounds of base closure. There will be \nenough time for the Department of Defense to close additional bases if \nthe costs and savings of the first four rounds prove to be accurate. \nEven those who argue for additional base closure rounds today will not \ntell you that the future of our military's capability rests on deciding \nat this moment in time to give the DOD the authority to conduct \nadditional rounds of base closure. By making the responsible choice \ntoday and voting for the Dorgan-Domenici amendment Senators will show \nthat they are concerned about the modernization of our forces by \nrequiring the data that shows the savings required to finance that \nmodernization will be present at the end of the closure process.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Dorgan-Domenici amendment will \nprovide the information necessary for the Congress to make decision of \nwhether to authorize additional rounds of base closure sound, well \nreasoned, and based on fact. I ask my colleagues for their support, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to speak briefly in favor of the Dorgan-\nLott second-degree amendment and associate myself with that amendment. \nI do think it is important before we go forward with additional BRAC's \nthat we know and can certify the amount of money that has been saved by \nprior BRAC rounds. I do not think we have taken that into \nconsideration. There is a lot that is also associated with closure \ncosts.\n  But more to the point on this particular issue, it seems to me that \nwe have been through this BRAC process here now for several rounds, and \nsome of that may have been very healthy to do, but that we ought to \nstop and appraise just what was good about that, and, more importantly, \nI think we need to go through a BRAC on domestic discretionary \nspending. Let us look at some of the programs that are discretionary \nprograms, not entitlement programs but discretionary programs, say, \nwithin the Department of Commerce or, say, within the Department of \nEnergy. Let us go through a BRAC there. Let us take a look at those and \nhave a vote up or down. We ought to be focusing our effort there where \nwe know we have some wasteful programs. We know there is money that is \nbeing wasted and spent not for a good reason or cause.\n  We have gone through that on some of the military bases as far as \nlooking at some bases that may not be necessary to have, but would it \nnot be so much wiser now to focus on some of these discretionary \nprograms? They are in the media virtually every day--the Advanced \nTechnology Program being a corporate welfare program, for one instance. \nWe have other programs that have been identified. We have a fleet of \nships under the Commerce Department that we have been saying for\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\na long time ought to be privatized rather than being run there. That is \na wasteful spending program. I have a list of those that I think we \nought to go through far before we start up some other BRAC round in the \nmilitary when we do not even know what sort of cost or what sort of \nsavings we have had associated within it.\n  So, Mr. President, I just think we have a lot better things that we \ncould be doing with our time and focus on rather than going back \nthrough a BRAC round. I do think it is constructive, through the \nDorgan-Lott approach, to get a sense of where we are costwise, get a \nsense of what cost we have with closing a military base, get a strategy \ngoing here which guarantees that further base closures will not \njeopardize national security. We need to look at all those things \nbefore we go forward with another BRAC round.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The floor is available. Any Senator who now wishes to \nexpress himself on the other side of this issue has the opportunity. We \nare going to be voting here in just a little bit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose efforts to \nauthorize additional rounds of base closings. I believe that it is bad \npolicy to close more bases without accurately knowing the ramifications \nof previous cuts.\n  Congress has already approved four rounds of base closings, the \nlatest round occurring in 1995. My State of California has suffered \nunfairly during this process, losing 27 major installations. Job losses \nfrom these closings are estimated to exceed 250,000, and the total \neconomic loss will top $8 billion.\n  Although the California economy is experiencing an economic upturn, \nunemployment in my State continues to run two percentage points above \nthe national average. It is clear that communities in California are \ndisproportionately being hurt by the BRAC process.\n  It is unfair to ask my State to bear the brunt of yet another round \nof base closings. It is even more egregious to ask Californians to go \nthrough another round of closings when they are still suffering from \nprevious rounds. Past BRAC rounds will continue to weigh heavily on my \nState because many bases from the 1995 closure round will not close \nuntil 1999 or after. Furthermore, some of these closures have not \nproven to be cost-efficient, and that is one reason why we are not \nseeing the savings that had been previously promised.\n  I believe that we should not even consider future base closings until \nwe have had the time to properly analyze the ramifications of the \nprevious four rounds. We need to have solid data about the long-term \ncosts and benefits of base closures. More importantly, we need to make \nsure that we understand the effect these closures have had on the real \npeople whose lives drastically change when a base in their community is \nclosed.\n  That is why we should pass the Dorgan Amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor. This amendment would require the Department of Defense to \nissue a report on the long-term costs and savings incurred from the \nprevious rounds of base closings before future BRAC's could go forward. \nI simply can not see how we can entertain the idea of additional rounds \nof base closures without first having the benefit of solid data and \nhard numbers from previous BRAC's.\n  Mr. President, Californians are amazingly resilient. They have \novercome devastating floods, disastrous earthquakes and terrorizing \nfloods. Our state has gone through a lot. But I promise that California \nwill not suffer further economic damage from another round of base \nclosings until I have exhausted every tool available to me as a \nSenator. I urge my colleagues to oppose a new round of base closures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say just a \ncouple of more words about the amendment that is now pending. It is a \nsecond-degree amendment offered to the first-degree amendment that had \nbeen previously offered by Senator McCain and Senator Levin.\n  I indicated when I started out I have great respect for both of them. \nWe reach a different conclusion and come to a different judgment on \nthis question, and I do want to say in response to some of the \ndiscussion that has been held in this Chamber that this is not a \nquestion about whether closing bases saves money. I accept the notion \nthat closing military installations saves money.\n  That is why I have been involved in supporting four previous base \nclosing rounds. It clearly will save money. We do not know how much. I \ndo not think anyone here knows how much. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has reviewed it, the Government Accounting Office has reviewed \nit, and they are trying to understand how much money is saved and what \nare the costs. Are we saving a little bit of money and having very \nsubstantial costs? Are we saving a lot of money? We do not know. There \nhas not been a decent accounting.\n  I am not standing here quibbling about whether closing additional \nbases will save money. It likely will save money. The question is \nshould we in this authorization bill launch two additional rounds of \nbase closures when the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office \nindicate--especially CBO indicates --it would be wise for us to have an \ninterval at this point during which we fully understand what we have \ndone in the previous four rounds by which we have said let us close 100 \nmilitary installations only about 50 of which are now closed.\n  Let us finish the job we have done in the previous four rounds before \nwe decide whether and when we initiate two additional rounds of base \nclosing. We might discover that the basis for the previous closures and \nthe conditions under which those closures were ordered and the \nexperience of those closures might persuade us to do something \ndifferent, maybe closing other installations in a different way. I do \nnot know. But we ought to have the benefit of that experience and that \nknowledge before we proceed.\n  That is the issue. I know the Senate Democratic leader is in the \nChamber and wishes to speak on this subject, and I shall not go \nfurther. I may have something to say later. But this is an interesting \nand, I think, a useful discussion for us to have, and I appreciate the \ncosponsorship of both the majority leader and the minority leader to my \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his extraordinary work on this particular amendment \nand appreciate very much his advocacy and the effort he has made \nthroughout the day to make the case. He and others have spoken \neloquently and very persuasively. There is little else I can add. \nNevertheless, I do want to touch on a number of issues largely for the \npurpose of emphasis. I think it is very critical that we have an \nopportunity to talk through this matter as carefully as we can.\n  Let me also give great credit to our distinguished ranking member. I \nhave had the good fortune to work with him on so many issues, and it is \nextraordinarily rare that I find myself in disagreement with him on \nanything. So for me to be in this position, in fact standing at his \ndesk, is a very uncomfortable situation, to say the least.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Democratic leader will reciprocate just for a \nmoment and yield, I am also standing at his desk, so we are even.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank Senator Thurmond, the distinguished chairman, \nwho is standing at another desk, for his leadership and the effort he \nhas made in moving this bill.\n  Past Congresses have approved four rounds of base closures --1988, \n1991, 1993 and 1995. We have already agreed to close 97 out of the 495 \nmilitary bases and realign an additional 55 bases. I have joined with \nmany others in voting yes every step of the way. Yes on authorizing \nfour rounds of base closures. Yes on closing 97 bases. And yes on \naligning 55 others. So, let no one doubt this Senator's willingness to \ncast a difficult vote in support of our national defense. I have done \nso in the past and am prepared to do so in the future.\n  However, voting to close more bases at this time makes no sense--for \nour military, for our budget and, perhaps most importantly, for local \ncommunities. This is the position not only of the Senators from the \nDakotas and\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\nSenators from across the country, it is also the position, as the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota noted, of the Congressional \nBudget Office, of the General Accounting Office, and even the Base \nClosure Commission.\n  I will get back to that in just a minute. The principal argument \nadvanced by supporters of this particular amendment is a fiscal one. \nThe Pentagon needs to achieve savings to stay within its $1.4 trillion \nbudget.\n  Setting aside the issue for the amount of whether the Pentagon really \nneeds $1.4 trillion--and given the current international circumstances \nand the sacrifices we are asking of important domestic problems--we \nneed to look at the proponents' claims about future significant \nsavings.\n  According to Pentagon's figures, we did not break even on base \nclosures until 1996, nearly a decade after we began the current phase \nof base closings. In other words, the Pentagon's figures indicate we \ndid not save one dime during the first eight years of base closures; \ninstead we spent billions and billions of additional dollars. It is \nonly after nearly a decade of economic dislocation and hardship that \nthe Pentagon's own analysis begins to demonstrate any net savings.\n  In fact it takes up to 6 years to close a base once Congress has \nauthorized its closure, and of the 97 bases Congress voted to close \nsince 1988, we have actually closed just over half this number. Since \nthe last round of base closures was passed in 1995, it will take the \nPentagon until the year 2001 just to complete action on the bases we \nhave already voted to close.\n  So, Mr. President, the question is, since we have not even closed \nabout one-half the bases that were scheduled for closure, why is it \nthat we are now making the effort to move to close still more before we \nhave completed our work on the last ones?\n  CBO and the General Accounting Office do not trust Pentagon figures. \nIn fact, CBO's analysis shows that the Pentagon has consistently \noverestimated the savings that will accrue from a given round of base \nclosures. In the first round, the Pentagon estimated that we would \nachieve $844 million in savings for the period 1990 to 1995. \nSubsequently, it turned out that instead of saving money, the round \nactually lost $517 million. For the second round of base closures, the \nPentagon initially estimated that we would save $2.916 billion from \n1992 to 1997. What happened? We did not save $2.9 billion. We will be \nfortunate to save about one-third of that amount, roughly $972 million. \nFor the third round, the Pentagon estimated that we would lose $715 \nmillion for the period 1994 to 1999. It now estimates we will not lose \nquite as much, about $553 million. Clearly less than a stellar record \nfor the Pentagon's forecasters.\n\n  So the estimates according to the Department of Defense itself, which \nhas generated this kind of skepticism from the General Accounting \nOffice and the Congressional Budget Office, is that we are not doing as \nwell as we had originally anticipated; we are not making the savings in \nbase closings that we expected.\n  The sharp fall in Pentagon savings estimates are really represented \nby this graph. The Pentagon's forecast for savings from the first round \nof base closure was reduced by 161 percent for the period 1990 to 1995. \nIn the second of base closures, the Pentagon savings estimate has been \nrevised downward by 67 percent. And in the third round, the Pentagon \nhas already acknowledged that it miscalculated by about 23 percent.\n  This chart proves as clearly, I think, as anyone can that on the \nbasis of savings there is real reason to question whether or not we \nhave achieved the stated goals of the Base Closure Commission--\n161 percent off the mark in the first one, 67 percent off the mark in \nthe second one and 23 percent off the mark in the third one.\n\n  GAO and CBO, two independent congressional advisory organizations, \nhave each conducted thorough examinations of the costs and savings \ninherent in the base closure process. And they concur in their \nfindings: They can reach no conclusions on savings from base closures, \ngiven the Pentagon's current accounting system. As expressed by GAO in \na recent report, ``[the Defense Department] cannot provide accurate \ninformation on actual savings''. As stated by CBO in a December 1996 \nreport, ``CBO was unable to confirm or assess DOD's estimates of cost \nand savings because the [Defense] Department is unable to report actual \nspending and savings for [base closure] actions.''\n  What we do know so far is that there has been a gross overestimation \nof what will have achieved in savings to date. So, before we decide to \ngo to yet another round, the question presents itself, is this the \nright time? Not knowing how much we are going to achieve, not knowing \nwhether or not we are going to save or actually spend more money, is \nthis the time to commit to yet another base closing round?\n  As I said, there are a lot of different policy questions involved \nhere. One is savings. Another is the tremendous ripple effect through \nthe local economies that will be felt well into the next century with \nyet another base closing round. We are going to be living with severe \ndislocations and economic loss, we know that. We are also going to be \nliving with short-term degradation in military capability as individual \nmilitary units pick up their operations and move from one base to the \nother.\n  And we really have not looked at alternative approaches to achieve \nsavings within the $1.4 trillion defense budget. And there are \nalternative cost saving approaches. For example, the bill before us \ncontains an additional $5 billion additional commitment for weapons \nsystems that were either not requested by the Pentagon or not requested \nin the quantities proposed in this bill. Let me say this again. This \nbill contains over $5 billion for weapons systems that the Pentagon \njudged unnecessary for national security. By my calculation if we were \nto attempt to save this same $5 billion through base closures alone, it \nwould take until nearly the end of the first decade of the 21st \ncentury. In other words, by paring back weapons systems that even the \nPentagon did not request, we could save today what would take roughly a \ndecade to accomplish through base closures--even if we accept the \nPentagon's rosy and highly questionable assumptions regarding potential \nsavings.\n  So, instead of focusing exclusively on surplus bases, perhaps we need \nto be discussing other ways with which to achieve any necessary \nsavings. Looking at surplus weapons systems may be one way to do it. I \nam prepared to look at any and all options. However, before we commit \nto an approach that may not generate savings and that may not give us \nthe framework within which a very thoughtful consideration of \ninfrastructure can take place, we should do what this second-degree \namendment sets forth.\n  The second-degree amendment is based on two major assumptions. First, \nCongress should allow already authorized base closures to go forward \nbefore we cause still more dislocation and hardship. Second, Congress \nshould be fully informed about the implications of past and future \nclosings before we commit ourselves to still more closings.\n  Therefore, rather than launch another round immediately, the second-\ndegree provides the Pentagon with time to develop accounting techniques \nso that they and we can fully and accurately understand the costs and \nsavings from previous and future rounds of base closures. This \namendment requires the Pentagon to prepare a report on these financial \nchanges and to have that report reviewed by the GAO and CBO. Finally, \nour amendment requires the Pentagon to do all of this in a timely \nmanner.\n  Just as important is what this amendment does not do. The amendment \ndoes not preclude future base closures that may reveal themselves to be \njustified once we fully understand the ramifications. If there are to \nbe future base closures, we simply want to be able to ensure that we \nunderstand where we are today in terms of infrastructure changes we \nhave already approved and to be able to accurately assess the long-term \nimpact of any proposed future changes. That is the concept that I think \nthe CBO itself has articulated.\n\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, consideration of \nadditional base closures ``should follow an interval during which DOD \nand independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that \nhave been taken thus far. Such a pause [they add] would allow the \nDepartment of Defense to\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\ncollect data necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives and \nto determine the actual costs incurred and savings achieved. Additional \ntime would also allow more informed assessment of the local impacts of \nthe bases already closed.''\n  Finally Mr. President, after hearing the views of GAO and CBO, I ask \nthe Senate to consider the perspective of the last Base Closure \nCommission. Largely as a result of the continued turbulence and the \nlack of hard information, the Commission itself recommended that \nCongress not authorize another round of closures until the year 2001. \nOnly our amendment is consistent with the findings of the Base Closure \nCommission.\n  So based upon the analysis presented to us by CBO, by the GAO, by the \nBase Closure Commission, I think to move yet another round at this time \nis just premature.\n  My record on base closures is clear. I have supported then when I \nthought they were needed and would produce the desired outcome--a \nleaner, more effective military that minimizes disruptions to our \ncommunities. GAO and CBO indicate that the Pentagon cannot tell us \ntoday what we have saved from past rounds, let alone yet-to-be \ndetermined future rounds. The only statement that can be made with any \nconfidence is that our communities will suffer dislocations and \ndisruptions well into the 21st century from actions that we have \nalready taken.\n  The case for inflicting additional suffering on them is far from \ncompelling, especially when there are many other ways to achieve the \nnecessary efficiencies within our defense budget. What we need to do is \nto find them. GAO, CBO, and the Base Closure Commission all acknowledge \nas much.\n  Let's work together to see that happens. Only one base closure \namendment protects the interests of our military and our communities, \nthat is the second-degree amendment pending. I urge its support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter we \njust received from the Secretary of Defense about the savings which \nhave resulted from BRAC 1993 actions, a letter dated July 9, 1997, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate moves to final \n     consideration of its version of the FY 98 Defense \n     Authorization Bill, I urge you to support the McCain-Levin \n     amendment authorizing BRAC rounds in 1999 and 2001. We \n     estimate two additional rounds would result in savings of \n     approximately $2.7 billion annually. These savings are \n     absolutely critical to the Department's modernization plans.\n       There have been some questions regarding the savings \n     actually realized from previous base closures. We have taken \n     these questions seriously and asked the Department of Defense \n     Inspector General (DoDIG) to take an independent look at this \n     issue. The IG's preliminary results indicate that there is no \n     basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly cost \n     effective. The preliminary audit examined BRAC 93 actions, \n     including the largest Navy closure (Mare Island) and eight \n     Air Force bases closed or realigned. For these bases, the IG \n     found that DoD overestimated costs by $148 million and \n     underestimated savings by $614 million. I have attached a \n     copy of the IG's preliminary report for your review.\n       I would greatly appreciate your support for two additional \n     BRAC rounds and hope you find this information useful in your \n     consideration of the McCain-Levin amendment.\n       Enclosure.\n     Bill Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, June 23, 1997.\n     Memorandum for Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense \n       (Acquisition and Technology)\n     Subject: Review of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Costs \n       and Savings\n\n       This is to provide the interim results of the audit being \n     conducted by this office in response to the Under Secretary \n     of Defense for Acquisition and Technology memorandum of \n     February 7, 1997. The audit objectives are to compare the \n     BRAC costs and savings estimates in previous budgets with \n     actual experience and to identify lessons learned regarding \n     management controls for estimating and tracking BRAC costs \n     and savings.\n       The lack of records makes retroactive reconstruction of \n     actual costs and savings from pre-1993 BRAC impossible at \n     this point. Likewise, it is too soon to assess BRAC 95 costs \n     and savings. We have focused our review, therefore, on the \n     BRAC 93 round. The audit universe for BRAC 93 is comprised of \n     cost estimates totalling $7.3 billion and savings estimates \n     of $7.5 billion through FY 1999. The bulk of both the BRAC 93 \n     budgeted costs and savings, $5.2 billion and $4.6 billion \n     respectively, was related to Navy installations. During the \n     first portion of the audit, we reviewed the experience at the \n     largest BRAC 93 site, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and all \n     eight Air Force BRAC 93 sites. In addition, we started \n     identifying construction project cancellations at all Navy \n     sites. The nine fully audited installations had BRAC cost \n     estimates of $1.1 billion and savings estimates of $1.8 \n     billion.\n       The initial audit results indicate that the Navy and Air \n     Force erred on the side of conservative estimating, over-\n     estimating costs at the sites reviewed by up to $148 million \n     and underestimating savings by $614 million. The reasons for \n     the variances included:\n       Some cost estimates were related to block obligations for \n     one-time implementation costs, which were never adjusted to \n     reflect actual disbursements. Researching these largely \n     invalid obligations could free up significant funding for \n     current BRAC requirements.\n       Canceled military construction projects valued at $8 \n     million at Mare Island were not counted in savings estimates.\n       An additional $58 million of canceled construction projects \n     at other Navy BRAC 93 sites was not counted because \n     incomplete projects funded in prior year programs were not \n     counted, even if they were curtailed.\n       The Navy assumed that 40 percent of the indirect civilian \n     labor costs at Mare Island would transfer to other shipyards, \n     but the audit indicated minimal related increases in other \n     shipyards indirect costs.\n       Reductions for base operation support costs at Mare Island \n     were underestimated after the first year of closure.\n       Documentation did not exist to explain differences between \n     the Air Force biennial budget and reductions reflected in the \n     Air Force Future Years Defense Plan.\n       The results of the audit to date, while not fully staffed \n     nor statistically projectable across either BRAC 93 or all \n     BRAC rounds, appear to corroborate the DoD position that \n     concerns that BRAC has not been highly cost effective are \n     unfounded. As a result of consultation with the Deputy Under \n     Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs and Installations), \n     we plan to continue auditing the BRAC 93 costs and savings. \n     In our audit report this fall, we will provide \n     recommendations for management controls on estimating and \n     tracking costs and savings for any future BRAC rounds.\n       We hope that this update is helpful. If there are \n     questions, please feel free to contact me or Mr. Robert J. \n     Lieberman, Assistant Inspector General for Auditing, at (703) \n     604-8901.\n                                                     Eleanor Hill,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I indicated before, Mr. President, since we are talking \nabout estimated savings, the IG that was requested by the Department of \nDefense to make these estimates found that the costs were overestimated \nby $148 million and savings underestimated by $614 million, which means \nin this study by the DOD IG, there were significantly greater savings \nthan had been predicted by the BRAC commission. That, of course, is \nsomewhat different--very different--in terms of the evidence of that \npresented by the distinguished Democratic leader. We are not sure \nwhether the leader's numbers came from the original Department of \nDefense estimates before they went to BRAC, and that is something we \nwill check out, because in all but one case, the commission produced \nsavings significantly less than had been requested by the Department of \nDefense.\n  Finally, relative to the argument that the cost of previous base \nclosures have been underestimated, one of the reasons the original \nDepartment of Defense estimates were high was that they estimated the \nsavings from the sale of land. We changed the rules in the middle on \nthat one. The revenue never materialized because we changed the rules, \nvery consciously, to provide that most base property would be given \naway when the base was closed rather than sold. We did that to make \neconomic redevelopment more feasible. That has benefited all of our \nStates just about where these closings have taken place. So that is \nanother possible\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\nexplanation for the difference in these numbers.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota, there will now be 15 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from South Carolina. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, which is an amendment \nthat I have offered with Senator Harkin, from Iowa, is very simple and \nstraightforward. It authorizes, so it is not subject to a point of \norder, it just authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the \nSecretary of Agriculture $5 million over the next 5 years, $25 million \naltogether. That is $5 million out of a $265 billion Pentagon budget, a \nbudget that is some $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon itself has \nrequested.\n  So out of that $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon has requested, \nthis is an amendment that says take $5 million and transfer it to the \nSecretary of Agriculture; that is to say, authorize the Secretary of \nDefense to transfer this to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  This $5 million program per year was eliminated. We should never have \ndone that. This is to correct an egregious mistake that we made. This \nhas everything in the world to do with malnutrition and hunger among \nchildren. This $5 million has been used effectively nationwide--a small \namount of money--as a catalyst, as an outreach program, to enable \nStates and school districts to set up and expand the School Breakfast \nProgram. As a matter of fact, I think one of the reasons it was \neliminated was that it had been so successful, in fact, in enabling \nschool districts to expand the School Breakfast Program, the argument \nthen being we would have to invest more resources in the School \nBreakfast Program.\n  I read from a letter received from the Food Research & Action Center \nthat points out that only ``seven of ten, 71.4 percent, of the schools \nthat offer school lunch participate in the School Breakfast Program. \nThis represents only 65,000 of the almost 92,000 schools that'' \nparticipate. ``Additionally, just 39.6 percent of low-income children \nparticipating in the National School Lunch Program also participate in \nthe School Breakfast Program. While more than 14 million low-income \nchildren participate in the National School Lunch Program, only 5.6 \nmillion participate in the School Breakfast Program.''\n  Is it too much to ask, as we keep talking about our children being \nour most precious resource, given the fact that all these children are \nGod's children, is it too much to ask for $5 million to be put back \ninto this program that has been so successful? That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, there are 8 million children who don't participate, \nand if these children had a chance to get a good breakfast and these \nchildren, therefore, were not hungry, they would be in a much better \nposition to learn. When children are hungry and children do not have a \ngood breakfast and can't start out the day, they are not going to be \nable to learn, and when they are not able to learn, as adults, they are \nnot able to earn. This amendment should be adopted with 100 votes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by \nSenator Wellstone in regard to the School Breakfast Program.\n  I remind my colleagues that the President proposed the repeal of \nthese startup grants during last year's welfare debate. In addition, \nthe Democratic substitute welfare reform bill contained a provision to \nrepeal these grants. Obviously, people across the political spectrum \nbelieve this grant program to be unnecessary.\n  I also remind my colleagues that this requirement was not identified \nin the budget request, and presently, about four in every five low-\nincome children already attend a school with a school breakfast \nprogram. The breakfast program has expanded to the extent that it is \nnot clear additional funds are necessary or would have the effect of \nbringing more schools into the program.\n  The last point I want to make is that transferring funds from the \nDepartment of Defense, even making the authority discretionary, is bad \nprecedent. We shouldn't make this a precedent. We, in the Congress, \nshould make these decisions and not delegate them to the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Mr. President, we have a budget agreement. We should not void this \nagreement and our responsibilities to make these decisions. I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 4 minutes, 18 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am waiting for my colleague, Senator Harkin. I ask \nunanimous consent to add Senator Harkin as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that a variety of letters of \nendorsement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Food Research &\n\n\n                                                Action Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Senator Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We are writing to enthusiastically \n     support your amendment to the DOD Reauthorization Bill which \n     would authorize the transfer of funds from DOD to the school \n     breakfast and summer food start up and expansion programs.\n       Both the school breakfast and summer food programs remain \n     under-utilized and many public and private sponsors require \n     special initial funding to get programs off the ground. \n     Funding is necessary to inform potential sponsors of the \n     availability of these programs and how to qualify.\n       Only approximately seven of ten (71.4%) of the schools that \n     offer school lunch participate in the School Breakfast \n     Program. This represents only 65,000 of the almost 92,000 \n     schools that offer school lunch also offer school breakfast. \n     Additionally, just 39.6% of the low-income children \n     participating in the National School Lunch Program also \n     participate in the School Breakfast Program. While more than \n     14 million low-income children participate in the National \n     School Lunch Program, only 5.6 million participate in the \n     School Breakfast program. Participation rates for the Summer \n     Food Program are even lower.\n       Your amendment and your efforts on behalf of low-income \n     children will not only serve the immediate need to get food \n     into children's bellies, but will also serve the long-term \n     goal of feeding their brains, and getting them ready to \n     learn!\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward Cooney,\n       Deputy Director.\n     Ellen Teller,\n       Senior Attorney for Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Bread for the World,\n\n                                  Silver Spring, MD, July 9, 1997.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: Bread for the World, a grassroots \n     Christian citizens' movement against hunger, heartily \n     supports your efforts to strengthen the School Breakfast \n     Program. We hereby endorse your amendment to require the \n     Secretary of Defense to transfer $5 million to the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to provide funds for outreach and startup for \n     the School Breakfast Program.\n       We agree with you that a hungry child can not learn the way \n     they should and we know that in the end, this hurts not only \n     the child, but our society as a whole. A nation as blessed as \n     ours should not allow children to go hungry.\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to hungry children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lynette Engelhardt,\n     Domestic Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       AFSCME,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the 1.3 million \n     members of the American Federation of State, County and \n     Municipal Employees (AFSCME), we strongly support your \n     amendment to transfer $5 million from the Department of \n     Defense to the School Breakfast Program to fund the outreach \n     and startup grant program.\n       The School Breakfast Program has proven successful in \n     improving the health and educational achievement of children \n     who have been able to participate. Unfortunately, about \n     27,000 schools do not offer the School Breakfast Program \n     because they lack the\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\n     capital funds needed to meet the startup costs. This deprives \n     eight million low-income children of the opportunity to eat a \n     nutritious and healthy meal in school. In prior years, the $5 \n     million grant program was critical in enabling schools to \n     establish a breakfast program.\n       We support your amendment to continue the outreach and \n     startup School Breakfast grant program with $5 million for \n     fiscal year 1998 by transferring the funds from the \n     Department of Defense's budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to transfer $5 million to the Secretary of \nAgriculture for school breakfasts\n  The purpose of the nondefense program that Senator Wellstone wants to \nsupport with defense funds may be laudatory; however, the amendment is \nill-considered and very problematic.\n  First the amendment would, in principle, violate the bipartisan \nbudget agreement that Congress has completed with the President and \nthat we are working hard to enforce: the amendment would reduce the \namount of defense spending the agreement specifies and would increase \nnondefense discretionary spending above the levels of the agreement.\n  Second, the amendment would violate the intent of firewalls that \nCongress has adopted over the years--and as recently as the 1998 budget \nresolution that we just passed last month. As all Senators know, these \nfirewalls are designed to prevent transfers between defense \ndiscretionary spending and nondefense discretionary spending, and they \nestablish a 60-vote point of order against such transfers. However, the \namendment has been modified to go to great lengths to circumvent a \nBudget Act point of order and has confused the issue of whether it \nactually constitutes a Budget Act violation.\n  Third, the amendment imposes an unfair obligation on the \nAppropriations Committee. If the amendment is passed, the \nAppropriations Committee is given the Hobson's choice of having to \nrepeal the Wellstone amendment or to seek a directed scoring of the \ntransferred money so that it would count as nondefense discretionary \nspending--as it should. This would, in turn, require the relevant \nappropriations subcommittees to find offsets for this additional \nnondefense discretionary spending. If the Appropriations Committee \nreports a Defense appropriation bill consistent with the letter and \nintent of the Wellstone amendment, it will immediately be subject to a \n60-vote point of order.\n  For all of these reasons, the Wellstone amendment is bad legislation, \nand I urge all Senators to reject it, whether or not they favor the \nprogram that would benefit from this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this should be an easy vote for \nSenators: $5 million out of over $2 billion more than the Pentagon \nasked for to have an outreach program and enable local school districts \nto buy refrigerators so they can have a school breakfast program so \nthat we can make sure that all of our children go to school and are \nable to learn.\n  It is that simple. I mean, where are our priorities? We can't even \ncome up with $5 million? This is not a mandate. This just simply \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer this. This is a way \nthat we as a Senate can, in fact, commit a little bit more by way of \nresources to make sure that there is an adequate nutritious breakfast \nfor more children who go to school in America. How in the world can you \nvote against it?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, thirty-nine seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask whether or not the other side intends to \nrespond at all? If not, I will finish up. I am trying to wait for \nSenator Harkin, but I will go ahead and conclude. Might I ask whether \nthe other side has yielded back its time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina wishes to keep \nhis time reserved.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, a report from Tufts University Center \non Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition on the link between nutrition and \ncognitive development in children states that even before results are \ndetectable, inadequate food intake limits the ability of children to \nlearn, affecting their social interactions, intuitiveness, and overall \ncognitive functions.\n  Come on, we have to stop having all of these conferences on early \nchildhood development and talking about children, and now we know that \nwe have some 8 million children who don't get a chance to participate \nin this program, we know there are many children who are malnourished, \nand we know for $5 million a year out of this budget, which is $265 \nbillion, $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, we can't even \nmake this kind of small commitment to children in America? That is what \nthis vote is about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is reserved. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as he may require to Senator \nCoverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for the \n5 minutes, 40 seconds remaining of the time of the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from South Carolina and compliment \nhim on his fine work as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 771\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as \na cosponsor of the Dorgan-Lott-Daschle second-degree amendment to the \nMcCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the McCain amendment purports to create \nanother series of base realignment closure commissions. I am opposed to \nthat and have so stated and have so advised the Secretary of Defense. I \ndo not believe there should be another Base Realignment Closure \nCommission until the administration can certify to the Congress that \nall the work of the previous Base Realignment Closure Commissions has \noccurred and properly.\n  Many of us, particularly in the States affected by Air Force depots, \nbelieve the President and the administration undermined BRAC and \nundermined the confidence in the people and the Congress with regard to \nits integrity, because essentially the President overrode the 1995 BRAC \nrecommendations, in our judgment, particularly as they relate to Kelly \nAir Force Base in Texas and McClellan Air Force Base in California. \nThat is in dispute. I certainly acknowledge the comments and \ncharacterizations that have been made by the good Senators from Texas \nand California.\n  But this issue must be resolved and it must restore the confidence of \nthe Congress and it must reassert an integrity into the process for the \npeople who undergo this horrendous process, that the legislation has to \napply to the President, the administration and the Department of \nDefense, not just to the people in Congress.\n  I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment and in support of the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by Senators Dorgan, Lott and Daschle.\n  I yield any remaining time back to the managing Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table Wellstone amendment 670.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has not been yielded back on both \nsides.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield back any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina yields back \nthe remainder of his time. The Senator from Minnesota has 52 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Wellstone \namendment. This School Breakfast Program has been one of the best in \nthis country. Already we have kids getting school\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\nlunches, but they don't get the school breakfast.\n  I say that if you ever want to see a clean plate, you go to a school \nbreakfast program. These kids come in, they are hungry, there is not a \ndrop of food left when they put those trays back into the hopper. The \nschool lunch may be a little different.\n  If you really want to have an impact on early childhood education and \ngetting these kids to learn, this is the place to put the money. It was \nwrong to take it out of welfare reform. I tried at that time to put the \nmoney in, and we could not do it. It was wrong for this to be taken out \nin the welfare reform to save that kind of money. It does not save \nmoney. It ruins lives because we are not providing the money for the \noutreach program for the school breakfast startups and for the summer \nfeeding program.\n  This is a small amount of money. I think out of this whole defense \nthing we could at least authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer \na measly $5 million to get this job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is now yielded back. Time has expired \non this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 424\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 424 \noffered by the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton]. Debate on this \namendment is limited to 15 minutes equally divided between Senator \nGorton and Senator Inouye.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to speak on amendment \nNo. 424 to the defense authorization legislation that was proposed \nyesterday by my colleague, Senator Gorton. I am a cosponsor of this \namendment to require the Navy to reopen the selection process for the \ndonation of the USS Missouri.\n  From the beginning, I have followed closely the Navy's handling of \nthe Missouri, working with Senator Gorton, Congressman Norm Dicks, the \nWashington congressional delegation, and my constituents. The ``Mighty \nMo'' is a relic of immense importance and historical significance. It \nwas on the decks of this great battleship that World War II came to a \nwelcome end.\n  The Missouri is particularly valued by the residents of my home State \nwhere she has been berthed for most of the last 40 years in Bremerton. \nShe is a source of great pride to the veterans in my State, many of \nwhom served in World War II, including in the Pacific theater and \naboard the Missouri.\n  I have reviewed yesterday's debate over the amendment, and I want to \ntake this opportunity to make several additional remarks for the \nRecord.\n  I first want to commend both Senator Gorton and Senator Inouye. The \ndebate was indicative of the immense interest in the Missouri and all \nof the States that competed for the honor of displaying this important \npiece of our history.\n  While I cannot speak for the other applicants, I know of the care, \nthe time, and the commitment demonstrated by the Bremerton, WA, \ncommunity in preparing its proposal to the Navy. Bremerton, Kitsap \nCounty and Washington State have developed a kinship with the ``Mighty \nMo.'' It is because of this kinship with the battleship, and our 40-\nyear record of paying tribute to the Missouri each and every day, that \nI continue to believe that Bremerton is the ideal home for the \nMissouri.\n  Last August, the Secretary of the Navy announced the decision to \naward the Missouri to Honolulu, HI. Following the Navy's decision, \nsignificant questions were raised regarding the Navy's process in \nawarding the battleship. It is those questions, including a General \nAccounting Office report, that brings me here today to seek the \nSenate's support for our amendment to reopen the Missouri donee \nselection process.\n  I want to reiterate what our amendment seeks to accomplish. We simply \nseek only the Senate's support to instruct the Navy to conduct a new \ndonee selection process. We do not seek to influence or prejudge that \nselection process. We only want a fair competition administered by the \nNavy in a manner worthy of this great battleship.\n  I recognize that the Navy is under no obligation to conduct a \ncompetition for important relics like the Missouri, but the fact is the \nNavy did conduct a competition for the Missouri. Having conducted this \ncompetition, I think it is only fair to the competing communities to \nexpect the Navy to conduct itself in an aboveboard and a forthright \nmanner.\n  Clearly, significant mistakes were made by the Navy in the Missouri \ncompetition. The GAO report clearly identifies the Navy's numerous \nshortcomings in this competition. Proponents and opponents can and do \ndiffer over whether the Navy's handling of the competition influenced \nthe outcome. But I find it very difficult to conclude that all \ncommunities were treated fairly by the Navy. And that is what we are \nasking for today. It really is just a simple matter of fairness for all \nof the competing communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton-Murray-Feinstein \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the matter before us goes much deeper than \nthe gallant lady, the U.S.S. Missouri. It involves the process of \ncompetition in the U.S. Government. Every day there is some \ncompetition. There is a competition between two great manufacturing \nplants to see whether this plant should build a tank or that plant. \nThere are competitions going on as to what company should build the \njoint strike fighter or the C-17 or the B-2. Should it be Boeing? \nShould it be McDonnell Douglas?\n  These competitions are part of the life of the U.S. Government. And \nif we look upon this measure before us as a simple Missouri amendment, \nthen we have not seen the deeper picture; we will be setting a very, \nvery dangerous precedent, Mr. President.\n  This competition was won fairly and impartially. If the Congress of \nthe United States is to take a step to overturn this decision, then \nwhat will happen to all the other competitions that we have been faced \nwith? Whenever there is a contest on who would build that submarine--\nshould it be Norfolk or should it be Connecticut?--if Connecticut wins, \nshould Norfolk come to the Congress and appeal the case, or vice versa?\n  Mr. President, let me just read once again from the letter from the \nSecretary of the Navy. The Secretary says--and this is from a letter \ndated June 10; and it is part of the Record at this moment:\n\n       I have reviewed the General Accounting Office report .  .  \n     . and I find that it contains nothing that would warrant \n     reopening the process. The General Accounting Office stated \n     that the Navy ``impartially applied'' the donation selection \n     process, and that all applicants received the same \n     information at the same time .  .  . I remain confident that \n     my selection of Pearl Harbor was in the best interest of the \n     Navy and our Nation, based on the impartial review of the \n     relative merits of the four acceptable applications. .  .  . \n     The General Accounting Office also noted, however, that none \n     of the applicants requested clarification on any aspect of \n     these two criteria [that the proponents speak of].\n\n  No one complained about the process when it was ongoing. The \ncomplaints come at the end of the process.\n  It may interest you, Mr. President, to know that the State of \nMissouri--and this ship is named after the State of Missouri--by \nresolution that was passed unanimously by the Missouri Senate, the \ngeneral assembly, the House of Representatives concurring:\n\n       . . . memorialize the Congress of the United States, the \n     President of the United States, the Chief of Naval \n     Operations, and the Secretary of the Navy to take any \n     appropriate action necessary to permanently locate the U.S.S. \n     Missouri at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii, next to the \n     U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, for the purpose of serving as a \n     Naval Memorial and Museum. . . .\n\n  There is another organization, Mr. President. It is the Iowa Class \nPreservation Association. The U.S.S. Missouri is an Iowa class \nbattleship. I will not read the whole letter, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\n                  Iowa Class Preservation Association\n\n     To: Mr. Jerry Kremkow, USS Missouri Memorial Association, \n         2610 Kilihau St., Honolulu, HI.\n       Dear Mr. Kremkow, The Iowa Class Preservation Association \n     is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to acquiring \n     the museum rights to one of the Iowa Class Battleships \n     currently in storage.\n       All four ships were recently released by the US Navy and of \n     these only the USS Missouri, which looks like she's heading \n     to Pearl Harbor, seems safe from the scrap yard. Our \n     organization plans on acquiring and establishing one of the \n     three other ships as a museum in the city of San Diego, CA. \n     We believe that the combination of port facilities, tourism \n     base and the lack of capital ship museums on the west coast \n     would make San Diego an ideal location for a ship exhibit.\n       Our major concern is that the East Coast already has \n     several battleship and aircraft carrier museums and has \n     reached it saturation point. There is no way all three \n     battleships will be able to survive on the East Coast. \n     Therefore unless we can bring one of the three to the West \n     Coast, it is highly likely that at least one of these fine \n     ships will be scrapped.\n       As stated the purpose of our group is to save one of the \n     ships that is in danger of being lost due to lack of support. \n     As long as your organization is diligently seeking to acquire \n     the USS Missouri we will support you and not seek to obtain \n     the Missouri. We personally feel that a berth near the USS \n     Arizona Memorial would be an appropriate place for such an \n     historic ship. We look forward to working with your \n     organization in saving two of the magnificent battleships.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Daniels,\n       President.\n     Steven Rupp,\n       Vice President.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. It says that:\n\n       The Iowa Class Preservation Association  .  .  .  is \n     dedicated to acquiring the museum rights to one of the Iowa \n     Class Battleships currently in storage.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We personally feel that a berth near the USS Arizona \n     Memorial would be an appropriate place for [the Missouri].\n\n  Here we have a letter from the Navy League of the United States. And \nI ask unanimous consent that this letter, as well as another, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Navy League of the United States,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. John H. Dalton,\n     Secretary of the Navy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Dalton: I am writing on behalf of The USS \n     Missouri (BB63) Memorial Association and its efforts to have \n     the Battleship enshrined at Pearl Harbor.\n       As you are probably aware, the Navy League of the United \n     States is quite strong in the Pacific Area and particularly \n     in Honolulu which has the largest Navy League Council in the \n     world. This project has the complete support of the Pacific \n     Area Navy League, which has supplied much of manpower and \n     motivation to move this effort along for the past two years.\n       Our Hawaii Navy League councils, led by the Honolulu \n     Council have a proven record of ``getting the job done'' with \n     projects such as The Pearl Harbor Memorial, The Bowfin \n     Memorial, commissioning of USS Lake Erie and provisions of \n     MARS equipment for vessels deploying out of or thru Pearl \n     Harbor. We feel that this tribute to peace and victory \n     belongs along side of the revered USS Arizona Memorial in \n     Pearl Harbor. We urge you to look favorably on this project \n     and award USS Missouri to the Memorial Association for its \n     purposes.\n           Yours very truly,\n     J. Walsh Hanley.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Navy League of the United States,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, July 9, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: In Executive Session this afternoon the Board \n     of Directors of the Mid-Missouri Council of the Navy League \n     of the United States voted in favor of the transfer of the \n     battleship U.S.S. Missouri to Pearl Harbor. We feel this is \n     the most appropriate location for the Missouri.\n       We are opposed to the Gorton Amendment and urge you to vote \n     against it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Herman Smith,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. In part it states:\n\n       This project has the complete support of the Pacific Area \n     Navy League, which has supplied much of [the] manpower and \n     motivation to move this effort along for the past two years.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the American Legion of the \nDepartment of Missouri, Inc. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                 Department of Missouri, Inc.,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: I am writing on behalf of The American \n     Legion State of Missouri to express our stronger possible \n     disagreement with the proposed Gorton Amendment (S. Admt. \n     424) to the Defense Authorization Bill (S. 936).\n       If adopted, this amendment will stop the transfer of the \n     battleship Missouri to Pearl Harbor and force the Secretary \n     of the Navy to reopen the competition. The American Legion \n     State of Missouri in convention voted unanimously to transfer \n     the battleship to Pearl Harbor. The 1996 General Assembly \n     State of Missouri unanimously passed a concurrent resolution \n     supporting the transfer to Pearl Harbor.\n       Pearl Harbor was chosen by the Secretary of the Navy after \n     rigorous evaluation as the site most suitable for \n     memorializing the Missouri. The process was fair and honest, \n     and the results should be carried out. We agree with this \n     decision.\n       USS Missouri belongs in Pearl Harbor, within sight of USS \n     Arizona, where future generations can come and understand \n     American's involvement in World War II, from beginning to \n     end.\n       I urge you and the honorable members of the United States \n     Senate to vote against the Gorton Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         James S. (Jim) Whitfield,\n                       Chairman, Legislative Assistance Committee.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. This letter makes it very clear that:\n\n       [The] USS Missouri belongs in Pearl Harbor, within site of \n     the USS Arizona, where future generations can come and \n     understand America's involvement in World War II, from \n     beginning to end.\n\n  Mr. President, the GAO report has been cited. The GAO report makes it \nvery clear that Pearl Harbor won the competition without question. And, \nmore importantly, Hawaii did not lose the competition even if it is \nbased solely on financial and technical issues.\n  Mr. President, I realize that no one relishes the thought of losing. \nWe all want to win. But the human affairs of this Nation would tell us \nthat at times one wins and another loses. And if we are to set a \nprecedent that whenever someone loses that he will come to Congress to \nappeal his case, the process that we have established for the past \ndecades to determine decisions that are very necessary to our Defense \nDepartment, if such be subject to appeal at each turn by the Congress, \nwe will get nowhere.\n  I just hope that those of us here will recognize from this report and \nfrom all other reports that this competition was won fairly and \nimpartially and that it is in the public interest and the interests of \nthe Navy and our Nation that this ship be based in Pearl Harbor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  There are approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds remaining for the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, as Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I had previously moved to table the \nWellstone amendment. It seems there is some misunderstanding, but I so \nmove to table the Wellstone amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table the Wellstone amendment numbered 670, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, a few years ago, when the battleship \nMissouri was decommissioned for the second time, after more than 30 \nyears, the Navy began a process to determine where it could become a \npermanent historic monument. The Navy carried on that process over an \nextended period of time under the rules that had been applicable to all \nprevious donations.\n  Two weeks before it made its final decision, the Navy informed the \napplicants of two additional and quite separate considerations. It did \nnot tell any of the applicants the weight those considerations would be \ngiven. It did not inform them of the fact that they could submit \nadditional items. They were really quite separate from the first set of \nconsiderations. At the end of that first round, Bremerton and Honolulu \nwere essentially tied. At end of the second and unfair round, the Navy \nawarded the Missouri to Honolulu.\n  The General Accounting Office--our General Accounting Office--has \nreported these changes, has reported that this was the wrong thing to \ndo, and has reported that the Navy should change its processes in the \nfuture.\n  My amendment does not seek to change the location of the Missouri. It \njust asks the Navy to start the process over again, to treat all \napplicants fairly, to set the rules in advance, and not to change the \nrules just before the game is over without telling people what the \nweight of the new rules will be.\n  I ask for your votes on it as a matter of simple fairness to all of \nthe applicants--both in California and Washington and in Hawaii--in a \nprocess which is very important to each one of these communities and \nwhich the Navy, very regrettably, has carried on in a totally unfair \nfashion to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, this proposal is very important both to \nthe opponents and proponents. I am still unable to hear because of the \nnoise in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask that Janice Nielsen, a \nlegislative fellow working in Senator Craig's office, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the duration of the debate on S. 936, the \ndefense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the GAO report makes it very clear that \nthe competition was impartial and fair and that, when all the numbers \nwere counted, Pearl Harbor was the winner because, as the Secretary of \nthe Navy has indicated, it will serve our Nation's interests and the \ninterests of the U.S. Navy to have the Missouri memorialized and made \ninto a monument next to the Arizona so that all Americans from this day \non will be able to see in one place the beginning and the end of World \nWar II.\n  But, more importantly, Madam President, this amendment does not \ninvolve just the Missouri. It involves the process of competition. If \nthe Congress is to be called upon at each time whenever someone loses, \nwhere do we end? Whenever there is a competition for the building of a \nsubmarine, should the losing State come forward to the Congress and ask \nfor reconsideration? If they lose a carrier, should the losing State \ncome here and ask the colleagues here for reconsideration? We have \ncompetition going on at every moment of the day.\n  Madam President, let us not set a bad precedent. I think the time has \ncome for decision. The merits are clear. The State of Missouri is in \nfavor of their ship being berthed in Hawaii. The American Legion is in \nfavor of that. The Navy League of the Pacific is in favor of that. I \nthink the Nation would prefer to have the U.S.S. Missouri have its \nfinal resting place in Pearl Harbor where it belongs.\n  Thank you, very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question occurs on amendment No. 424 offered by the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton].\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous-consent that the \nremaining rollcall votes in this series be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I was unavoidably delayed by the weather \ncoming in and just missed that last vote. I wonder if it would be all \nright with my colleagues if I ask unanimous consent to be recorded in \nfavor of the tabling on the last vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian informs the Presiding \nOfficer that unfortunately that unanimous-consent request is not \npermissible under the Senate rules.\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. That is acceptable to me, if the Record will indicate that \nI made the request.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I hope that the Record will show nothing \nwith reference to the Parliamentarian. The rule clearly states that \nonce the Chair has announced the results of a vote no Senator may be \nallowed to vote. Moreover, the Chair cannot even entertain such a \nrequest under the rule.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I withdraw that request. I wouldn't want \nto do anything to offend the rules. I have been flying in from Nairobi, \nAfrica, for the last 32 hours on British Airways, which has been on \nstrike, and had to change. And I can't tell you what I have gone \nthrough in the last 32 hours to try to get here for these votes. But I \nwouldn't want to offend the rules.\n  So I will leave it at that.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe 10 minutes equally divided, prior to a vote on the Dorgan second-\ndegree amendment to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I yield my 10 minutes to Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2 \nminutes. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, could we have order? We are limited to \nthe time we have, and I think it is important everybody be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have cut defense since 1985 by 34 \npercent. We have closed 18 percent of the military bases. We have more \nnurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers in Europe. We \nhave a huge\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\noverhang of bureaucracy, a huge overhang of bases that we have to shear \ndown to the size that is required for the force that we are now willing \nto fund in the House and Senate. In short, with this huge overhang of \nbureaucracy and bases, we have a tiger but increasingly the tooth is \ntoo small and the tail is too long.\n  Nobody wants base closings. We have closed five bases in my State. \nBut we all know it is something that needs to happen. So I intend to \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I intend to oppose \nthe Dorgan amendment, which for all practical purposes kills the \nunderlying amendment.\n  I think basically we have to recognize defense has been cut by 34 \npercent. We have closed only 18 percent of the military bases. If we \nare going to preserve modernization, if we are going to keep the pay \nand benefits to maintain the finest people in uniform we have ever had, \nwe are going to have to close more military bases.\n  So, I hate it, as I am sure many of our colleagues do, but there is \nno alternative, given the amount of money that the House and Senate are \nwilling to appropriate. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Dorgan \namendment and to support the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could we clarify the unanimous consent agreement we are \noperating under? I understand there is 10 minutes equally divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents of the Dorgan amendment, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas has just used information that is \nnot accurate. He is referring only, when he talks about 18 percent, to \nthe bases in this country. We have also closed bases overseas. When you \nadd that to it, the total bases closed represent about 27 percent of \nthe infrastructure.\n  But the point of my second-degree amendment is to say this: Let us at \nthis point not authorize two additional rounds of base closures until \nwe figure out what we have done, what the consequences of what we have \ndone are in the last four rounds. We do not have all the facts about \nwhat the last four rounds have given us in terms of costs and benefits.\n  Let me not speak for myself. Let me have the Congressional Budget \nOffice do it, and the GAO has done something similar. It says:\n\n       The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round \n     of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out.\n\n  That is what CBO says. Then CBO says:\n\n       That consideration, however, should follow an interval \n     during which the DOD and independent analysts examine the \n     actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  Why does CBO say that we ought to wait and take a measure of what we \nhave done? Because they cannot get the facts. No one knows what are the \ncosts and what are the savings. What CBO is saying is let's figure out \nwhat we have done. We have ordered the closure of nearly 100 military \ninstallations and only about half of them have been fully closed. At \nthis point, let us finish that closure, assess the costs and the \nbenefits, and then proceed, if necessary, to authorize additional base \nclosures.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield a minute-and-a-half to me?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield a minute-and-a-half to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I join the majority leader in \nsupporting the Dorgan amendment. I do so because, in our recent trips \noverseas, we have found a new military base, a U.S. military base in \nKuwait; we have a new one at Prince Sultan in Saudi Arabia; we have \nbeen expanding a new one at Aviano, in Italy. The Hungarians believe we \nare going to continue to maintain their base once they join NATO.\n  It will take no Base Closure Commission for the administration to \nstart closing bases overseas. I would rather see them stop building new \nbases overseas. But, certainly we need a report like this to try and \nget some idea about what is going on.\n  Last, I would say this, almost 40 percent of our military personnel \ntoday who are combat personnel are overseas. I do not believe we should \nhave a Base Closure Commission to decide how many bases to close here \nat home until they return. It is not time to have a new base closure \ncommission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona will yield me 1 \nminute?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 60 percent of the bases overseas have been \nclosed, and that is a fact. I don't know where the Senator from Alaska \nhas been traveling, but I suggest he go to Germany where we have \nbasically dismantled our huge defense establishment, which was \nnecessary and no longer is. There are stacks and stacks of information \nthat can be provided about the costs that have been reduced as a result \nof the base closings that have taken place.\n  Finally, we are now in an Orwellian argument that not closing bases \nsomehow saves money. It is the strangest argument I have been through \non the floor of the Senate. We have to reduce these.\n  I do not intend to move to table the Dorgan amendment. I expect the \nDorgan amendment will win. But I will tell my colleagues right now, \nthis will be a sad day.\n  This will be a sad day in the history of the Senate, because we will \nnot have fulfilled our obligations to the men and women in the military \nbecause we continue to siphon off money to pay for bases that we don't \nneed instead of paying for the troops and the equipment that they need \nto fight and win.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield 1 minute to me?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island, former \nSecretary of the Navy, and then the remaining time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Rhode Island \nis recognized. Mr. President, I support the Levin-McCain amendment, \nwhich will allow the Defense Department to reduce its excess \ninfrastructure and use resulting savings for needed equipment \nmodernization.\n\n  After four rounds of base closings (1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995), the \nU.S. military has eliminated 21 percent of its base structure. Overall \nforce structure, people and weapons starting in 1988 and ending 5 years \nfrom now on the other hand, is being reduced by 36 percent. This gap \nbetween the level of our forces and our infrastructure should not \ncontinue to exist indefinitely. If we do not continue the process of \nreducing excess capacity, the Defense Department will not have the \nfunds to modernize its increasingly outdated weaponry and continue to \nmaintain adequate readiness.\n  Today, we have heard arguments that the savings promised by earlier \nbase closure rounds either have not materialized or have not been fully \naccounted for. Mr. President, I do not believe that we have to document \nexactly how much has been saved to the last nickel from previous BRAC's \nin order to continue this necessary process.\n  The fact of the matter is that previous base closures have resulted \nin substantial savings, currently estimated to be a total of $13.5 \nbillion. The final amount of these savings may not be known for years. \nPerhaps these savings have not been as great as originally thought, but \nthey have been there. You simply cannot reduce 21 percent of your \ninfrastructure and not come up with some significant cost savings. \nSecretary of Defense Cohen--who endured some very painful base closings \nin his State as a Senator--has estimated that two additional rounds \nwould result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion annually.\n  Mr. President, all six members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--who \naccount for some 24 stars--have written Congress to urge two additional \nbase closures. The previous BRAC itself also recommended additional \nreductions. The Joint Chiefs recognize that our troops ought to be \narmed with the very best equipment when called to battle. It was this \ntechnological edge that proved so valuable in the gulf war.\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\n  But these weapons have a cost, and continuing to expend valuable \nresources on unneeded infrastructure will hinder modernization and \ndetract from readiness. I urge support for the Levin-McCain amendment \nand opposition to the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I certainly hope the prediction of the Senator from \nArizona is not accurate, that the Dorgan amendment will prevail. I \nthink it is not a good amendment. We have to reduce the base structure \nin the country as we bring down the forces. I support the efforts of \nSenator McCain vigorously and hope he will prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment and very \nmuch oppose the Dorgan amendment. I hope we will listen to General \nShalikashvili. This is what he said when he testified:\n\n       As difficult as it is politically, we will have to further \n     reduce our infrastructure. We have more excess infrastructure \n     today than we did when the BRAC process started. We need to \n     close more facilities, as painful and as expensive as it is.\n\n  We should listen to the head of our uniformed military. The Secretary \nof Defense has told us we cannot afford this waste of resources in an \nenvironment of tough choices and fiscal constraint. We must shed \nweight. The savings are on this chart. They have been estimated by the \nDepartment of Defense. We have a letter from all of the Joint Chiefs \npleading with us, it is called a 24-star letter, all the Joint Chiefs, \nand the chairman and the vice chairman pleading with us to shed excess \nweight.\n  I hope we will not adopt the Dorgan amendment. If we adopt it, it \nwill destroy the possibility that this year--this year--as we propose \nin the McCain amendment, we will again do what we must do, as painful \nas it is. And those of us who come from States which have had bases \nclosed and which face additional base closings, as I do in my State, \nunderstand that pain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota controls 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Dorgan-Lott substitute and against the McCain amendment. Even if \nthis substitute is not adopted, I urge them to vote against the McCain \namendment, and the reason is, for the first time in the four base \nclosing rounds, this administration played politics. They said, ``Well, \nwe're going to accept all of them except for two.'' That has never \nhappened. It didn't happen in the first round, it didn't happen in the \nsecond round, and it didn't happen in the third round. It happened in \nthe fourth round.\n  I don't think we should give them additional rounds until we have a \nclear understanding that we are not going to play politics. We are \ngoing to close bases on the merits and not on electoral votes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Dorgan-Lott substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 1 \nminute 12 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I have voted for every \nprevious round of base closings and intend to vote again when \nadditional bases are needed to be closed, but if this is, in fact, \nabout saving money, then let us at least pay some heed to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that additional base closing \nrounds ought to follow an interval during which the Department of \nDefense and independent analysts examine the actual impact of what has \nbeen done so far. If this is, in fact, about saving money, let's take \nthe advice of the Congressional Budget Office and figure out what we \nhave done before we decide to do more, what has the cost and the \nbenefit been of what we have done.\n  The majority leader, the minority leader, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nStevens, and so many others have cosponsored this second-degree \namendment, which is very simple. The second-degree amendment asks the \nSecretary of Defense to prepare and submit to Congress a report on the \ncosts and savings on the closure rounds that have already been \noccurring and to give us information that we don't now have before we \nproceed to talk about additional rounds of base closures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague, \nthe Senator from Virginia, who has been standing to make a statement, \nbe granted 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my colleague from Arizona. We have given a great \ndeal of attention to the fact that the tooth-to-tail ratio is \ncompletely out of whack. It used to be 50-50 10 years ago. It is close \nto 70-30 now. The tail being the support of everything else. If we want \nto support force structure, if we want to be capable of carrying out \nour commitments, we have to cut infrastructure. The savings start as \nsoon as we begin to cut infrastructure. We can argue about how many \ndollars later on.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Adopt the Dorgan-Lott second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A rollcall has not been requested on this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, no one did more to bring peace and \nprosperity in our time than our 40th President, Ronald Reagan. \nPresident Reagan's economic and foreign policies gave us the longest \npeacetime expansion in our history and, indeed, did fulfill an ambition \nof this country to make the world safe again for democracy. But more \nthan that, Ronald Reagan called us to our highest and best; we never \nspoke with more certainty or sat taller in the saddle than when Ronald \nReagan was riding point.\n  In his second inaugural address, Reagan spoke of the danger of \nsimple-minded appeasement, of accommodating countries at their lowest \nand least. ``History,'' said President Reagan, ``teaches us that wars \nbegin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.'' \nHaving seen the death and destruction of five wars in his lifetime, \nPresident Reagan's was a lesson learned at some expense. It was a \nlesson which he refused to repeat. And from his experience was borne \nthe policy of peace through strength--a strategy that recognized that \nwishful thinking about our adversaries is a betrayal of our past and a \nsquandering of our freedom.\n  But today, the administration seems to have forgotten this costly \nlesson. It seems driven not by foreign policy so much as by foreign \npolitics, willing to pursue that which sounds historic rather than \nadopting policies that are historically sound.\n  Nowhere is this administration's failed thinking more apparent than \nin United States policy toward China. As I noted on the floor 2 weeks \nago, Beijing has embarked on a military buildup that may soon threaten \nsecurity interests in Asia, including our own. China already has the \nworld's largest military at 2.9 million and is taking steps to enhance \nits force projection capabilities, including the acquisition of a blue \nwater navy and a 21st century air force.\n  China is not an enemy of the United States. I sincerely hope that \nWashington and Beijing can develop a forthright and an enduring \nrelationship. For such a relationship to develop, however, security \nissues must be addressed and fundamental questions about those issues \nmust be answered.\n  What does it mean when China engages in a dramatic military buildup \naimed at achieving superpower status? What does it mean when China \nproliferates technology for weapons of mass destruction and signs a \n$4.5 billion arms deal with the terrorist State of Iran? What does it \nmean when China fires missiles in the Taiwan Strait and seizes small \nislands in the South China Sea? For this belligerence suggests a China \nbent on regional domination.\n  While China's official military budget is roughly $8 billion, Beijing \neffectively conceals military spending through off-budget funding and \nrevenue. Reliable estimates place China's military spending from 4 to \n10 times the official budget. Russia alone, has made over $7 billion in \narm sales to China since 1990, and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \nunderemployed Russian nuclear engineers have been hired by China in the \nlast several years.\n  Mr. President, the People's Liberation Army of China, has 20,000 \ncompanies, business enterprises, that funnel revenue into the \nmilitary's coffers. These PLA companies are not the kind of competitors \nwe want to welcome to the American market. Companies with ties to the \nPLA benefit from their special relationship with Beijing and have been \ninvolved in criminal activities ranging from smuggling assault weapons \nonto the streets of San Francisco to stealing defense-related \ntechnology.\n  So what, then, has this explosion in military spending wrought? \nFirst, a missile program that will soon give China the capacity to \nbuild hundreds of highly accurate ballistic missiles. Second, short- to \nmedium-range ballistic\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\nmissiles that will provide Beijing with versatile nonnuclear weapons to \ntarget U.S. military personnel in a variety of contingencies if they so \ndesire.\n  And, as if this were not enough, China is modernizing its long-range \nnuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles with mobile ICBM systems \nand advance reentry technology. Due to the potential of secret \nunderground construction which is said to be available in China, China \ncould have as many as 130 of such missiles with a range of 8,000 miles. \nChina's missile modernization program is accompanied by the buildup of \nChina's Air Force.\n  By 2010, China could have over 100 SU-27 and SU-30 aircraft. The SU-\n27 is comparable to, and may be more advanced in some areas than, the \nU.S. F-15C Eagle. Russia has been the primary provider of these \naircraft and has signed a $2.2 billion coproduction agreement with \nChina to help Beijing develop the domestic capacity to produce these \nplanes.\n  China's ultimate goal is to acquire an all-weather Air Force within 5 \nyears. Attack aircraft, precision-guided munitions, airborne early \nwarning and control systems [AWACS], and large transport aircraft are \nall items on Beijing's wish list. With the help of Russian arms \nsuppliers, China is putting the pieces of this lethal puzzle in place.\n  Beijing is also working to develop a blue water navy. Their ambitions \nare perhaps summed up best by the words of Admiral Liu Huaqing. ``The \nChinese Navy,'' said Admiral Liu, ``should exert effective control of \nthe seas within the first island chain. Offshore should not be \ninterpreted as coastal as we used to know it. Offshore is a concept \nrelative to the high seas. It means the vast sea waters within the \nsecond island chain.''\n  Mr. President, it just so happens that the first island chain China \nseeks to control encompasses Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and some \nof the most critical shipping lanes in the world. The South China Sea \nalone accommodates 25 percent of the world's maritime trade and 75 \npercent of Japan's oil shipments.\n  To achieve Admiral Liu's objective, Beijing has purchased Kilo-class \nsubmarines and Sovremenny-class missile destroyers from Russia. In \naddition, the United States Office of Naval Intelligence [ONI] cites a \nNational People's Congress report that China is seeking to build two \n48,000-ton aircraft carriers, each with 40 combat aircraft, by the year \n2005.\n  China's arms buildup would be less disturbing if Beijing were acting \nto resist aggression by an enemy power. But China faces no grave \nsecurity threats, leaving us with troubling conclusions about Beijing's \nreal intent. China has historically demonstrated a willingness to \nsettle territorial disputes with force, and greater capacity can only \nincrease the likelihood of belligerence in the future.\n  Since WWII, a catalog of China's regional conflicts covers almost her \nentire periphery. China has invaded Tibet and Vietnam, entered the \nKorean war, ousted Vietnamese forces from several islands in the South \nChina Sea, fought India twice and Russia once over boundary disputes, \nand--not to forget the most consistent aspect of China's military \nadventurism--threatened Taiwan with military exercises and outright \ninvasion of Taiwanese islands close to China's shore.\n  China currently has territorial disputes with India, Russia, Japan, \nVietnam, and has vied with the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, \nand Malaysia for control of the resource-rich and strategically \nimportant South China Sea. To defend its claim, Beijing has already \nconstructed five naval installations in the Paracel Islands and seven \ninstallations in the Spratly Island group.\n  And what has been the Clinton administration's response to the rising \nChinese military threat? Appeasement at every turn. China proliferates \nmissile, nuclear, and chemical weapons technology to rogue regimes like \nIran; in fact, China is identified by the CIA as the world's worst \nproliferator of weapons of mass destruction. And yet, the \nadministration refuses to impose consistently sanctions authorized by \nU.S. law.\n  The China Ocean Shipping Co., better known as COSCO, is implicated in \nweapons smuggling to the United States and missile transfers to \nPakistan, and the President personally assists the city of Long Beach, \nCA, in leasing the local United States naval harbor to COSCO.\n  The China National Nuclear Corp. orchestrates most of the nuclear \ntechnology transfers to Pakistan and Iran, and the administration \nresponds by approving Export-Import Bank loans to help this Chinese \ncompany complete a nuclear reactor in China.\n  These examples reveal an underlying laxity also clearly seen in \nPresident Clinton's dismantling of export controls for sensitive \ntechnology. President Reagan's formation of the Combat Command [COCOM] \nhelped enforce an international embargo of sensitive technology exports \nto the Soviet Union and effectively expanded America's technological \nlead. Unfortunately, having confused short-term profits with long-term \nsecurity, this administration has undermined our export control \nframework.\n  For example, advanced U.S. aircraft engines have historically been a \nprotected item on the munitions list of goods and services. Sales of \nMunitions List items are illegal to any country without formal approval \nfrom the State Department. In addition, sales of Munitions List items \nto China were prohibited after the Tiananmen Square crackdown and could \nonly be permitted with a Presidential waiver.\n  Instead of openly issuing a waiver for the sale of aircraft engines \nto China, the Clinton administration quietly took airplane engines off \nthe Munitions List and shifted their control from the Department of \nState to the Department of Commerce. Licenses for the sale of aircraft \nengines were quickly issued by then-Secretary Brown, and they continue \nto this day.\n  In addition to aircraft technology, export controls for \nsupercomputers have also been relaxed. As Senator Cochran has argued so \ncompellingly on the floor this week, supercomputers are not extra large \nversions of a Macintosh or an IBM, but advanced machines that can \nsimulate warfare contingencies and model sophisticated weapons.\n  The Bush administration defined supercomputers as machines that could \nperform 195 MTOPS--million theoretical operations per second. The \nClinton administration relaxed export controls by changing this \ndefinition to 2,000 MTOPS, a tenfold increase in the capability of \nnoncontrolled supercomputers within 2 years. Shortly thereafter, the \nClinton administration raised the threshold to 7,000 MTOPS for export \nof supercomputers for civilian use.\n  In the euphoria of the post-cold war world, the Clinton \nadministration seems to have forgotten that civilian and military \ndistinctions have little use in a Communist State like China where \nGovernment control of industry ensures that civilian technology is \napplied to military ends and where thousands of so-called businesses \nare literally owned by the military.\n  Again, as Senator Cochran has noted, United States companies have \nused these relaxed regulations to sell 47 supercomputers to China. \nDozens more have been indirectly shipped to China via Europe, the \nPersian Gulf, and East Asia. The Clinton administration cannot account \nfor where many of these computers are located or how they are being \nused.\n\n  As Stephen Bryan, former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, writes:\n\n       Thanks to * * * the Clinton administration, the Chinese can \n     now conduct tests of nuclear weapons, conventional \n     explosives, and chemical and biological weapons by simulating \n     them on supercomputers. Not only can they now make better \n     weapons of mass destruction, but they can do a lot of the \n     work secretly, thus threatening us with an additional element \n     of surprise.\n\n  For too long we have heard the argument that if the United States \ndoes not sell technology to Beijing, China will simply acquire the \nproducts from other sources. This contention is as familiar as it is \nflawed. United States military and dual-use technology is often a \ngeneration ahead of its Russian and European counterparts. How can the \nUnited States call on other nations to stop transferring dangerous \ntechnology when America is giving China some of the most advanced \ntechnology in the world?\n  A final thought. This week the Government Affairs Committee began \ninvestigating an ominous and startling facet of our national security--\nthe security of this Nation's democratic elections. Every American has \nan interest\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nin investigating the alleged plot of the Beijing government to \ninfluence the election of our President and Members of this Congress. \nTrying to corrupt American elections is shocking, outrageous, and \nwrong. And, if true, it must be dealt with in a forthright and forceful \nfashion.\n  In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what Ronald \nReagan gave us throughout the 1980's, and that is what this country is \nlooking for now. Leaders are willing to call this Nation--and nations \naround the world--to their highest and best, not accommodate them at \ntheir lowest and least.\n  Continued appeasement can only lead to further belligerence from \nBeijing. We must not let China slam shut the gate of freedom. We must \nshow the quiet courage and common sense that have marked our foreign \npolicy since America's first days.\n  It is time for America to place restrictions on high-technology \nexports to Beijing by supporting the Cochran-Durbin amendment; time to \nimpose consistently sanctions on China for proliferating weapons of \nmass destruction; time to restrict United States market access to PLA-\nfront companies; and time to let Beijing know that American security \ninterests in East Asia will not be compromised. So, that 1 day, the \nlong tug of memory might look favorably upon us as we look approvingly \non those who fought for freedom in decades passed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 670.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 670, as modified.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just as a courtesy to my colleagues, \nlet me say that I am not offering a new amendment. This is an amendment \nthat I introduced yesterday morning. I wanted to take advantage of this \ntime to speak about this amendment.\n  This amendment would authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer \n$5 million out of the $265 billion Pentagon budget--some $2.6 billion \nmore than the President himself asked for--to the Secretary of \nAgriculture, to be used for outreach and startup grants for the school \nbreakfast program.\n  Mr. President, this amendment involves a very small amount of money. \nWhile it involves a small amount of money--at least given the kind of \nmoney we are dealing with here--it actually speaks to a very large \nquestion. I think the question has to do with what our priorities are.\n  I think it is a distorted priority to provide the Pentagon with $2.6 \nbillion more than it originally asked for. For the third year in a \nrow--these are one of the few times I can remember in my adult life \nthat the Congress actually wants to provide the Pentagon with more \nmoney than the Pentagon has actually asked for. At the same time, when \nit comes to some really vitally important programs that dramatically \naffect children's lives, we don't make the investment.\n  By way of background: In the welfare bill that passed last Congress, \n$5 million was eliminated from a critically important program, which \nwas a program that on the one hand provided States and school districts \nwith the information they needed--call it an outreach program--about \nhow they could set up a breakfast program, and on the other hand, it \nprovided some badly needed funding for some of the poorer school \ndistricts to actually, for example, purchase refrigerators in order to \nhave milk.\n  It is difficult to understand how this could have been cut, \nespecially given the heralded success of the school breakfast program. \nSome things I guess we do not know enough about, but we do know that a \nnutritious breakfast really is important in enabling a child to learn. \nWe also know that if a child is not able to learn, as I said yesterday, \nwhen he or she becomes an adult they may very well not be able to earn. \nThis is a small amount of money that makes a huge difference.\n  So this amendment says that out of a $265 billion Pentagon budget, \nsome $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, can't we authorize \nthe Secretary of Defense to be able to transfer $5 million--$5 \nmillion--for school breakfasts? For what I would call catalyst money \nthat gets necessary information out to the States and school districts \nand some needed assistance by way of refrigerators and resources to \nenable them to expand the school breakfast program.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out by way of context that there are \nstill some 27,000 schools that do not have school breakfast programs \navailable. There are some 8 million vulnerable, low-income children, \ntherefore, who are not able to participate. Too many of those children \ngo to school without having had a nutritious breakfast.\n  This may seem abstract to many of us in the Senate, but it is a very \nconcrete and a very important issue.\n  This amendment has the support of FRAC, the Food Research Action \nCenter, which has a longstanding history of working on childhood hunger \nand nutrition issues. It has the support of the Elementary School \nPrincipals Association, the American School Food Services, and Bread \nfor the World.\n\n  Mr. President, I might point out that these organizations have a \ntremendous amount of credibility for all of us who care about hunger \nand malnutrition. These are organizations that have been down in the \ntrenches for years working on these issues. I don't think anybody can \nquarrel with the values and ethics of Bread for the World and the work \nthat they have done, much of it very rooted in the religious community, \nand the American School Food Services. These are food service workers. \nThese are the people who know what it means when they can't provide a \nnutritious breakfast to low-income students.\n  This is a special endorsement for me because my mother was a food \nservice worker.\n  What the Elementary School Principals Association is saying by \nendorsing this amendment is simply this: If a child hasn't had a \nnutritious breakfast, how is that child going to be able to learn?\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about the extent of hunger \nand the scope of the problem. This is from the Food Research Action \nCommittee.\n  Approximately 4 million American children under the age of 12 go \nhungry, and approximately 9.6 million are in risk of hunger. According \nto estimates based on the results of the most comprehensive study ever \ndone on childhood hunger in the United States--this was the community \nchildhood hunger education project--based on the results of over 5,000 \nsurveys of families with incomes below 185 percent of poverty, applied \nto the best available national data, FRAC estimates that of the \napproximately 13.6 million children under age 12 in the United States, \n29 percent live in families that must cope with hunger or the risk of \nhunger during some part of one or more months in the previous year.\n  Let me just raise a question with colleagues before we have this \nvote. I just think that this goes to the heart of what we are about. \nThis goes to the heart of priorities.\n  I, as a Senator from Minnesota, tire of the symbolic politics. We \nhave had the conferences on early childhood development. The books and \nthe reports, the magazines, the TV documentaries have come out.\n  We know--let me repeat this--we know that in order for children to do \nwell, it is important that they have a nutritious breakfast. We know \nthat when children are hungry, they don't do well in school. We know, \nas parents and grandparents, that we want to make sure that our \nchildren and our grandchildren start school after having a nutritious \nbreakfast. And we also know, based on clear evidence, that sometimes we \ndon't know what we don't want to know--that there is a significant \namount of children who still go to bed hungry or still wake up in the \nmorning hungry and go to school hungry.\n  Why can't the U.S. Senate make this small investment in this program \nwhich was so important in enabling States and school districts to \nexpand the school breakfast program?\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to bring this amendment to the floor of the \nSenate over and over and over again starting with this defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Let me just read. I am assuming that my colleagues are interested in \nthis information, and I am assuming that we want to address the \nproblem. Let me just talk a little bit about this relationship between \nhunger and nutrition and learning.\n       Undernutrition increases the risk of illness and its \n     severity.\n       Undernutrition has a negative effect on a child's ability \n     to learn . . .\n       Iron deficiency anemia is a specific kind of undernutrition \n     and is one of the most prevalent undernutritional problems in \n     the United States especially among children. Even mild cases \n     lead to shortened attention span, irritability, fatigue and \n     decreased ability to concentrate . . .\n       Hunger leads to nervousness, irritability, disinterest in \n     the learning situation, and an inability to concentrate . . .\n       Hunger . . . disrupt(s) the learning process--one \n     developmental step is lost, and it is difficult to move on to \n     the next one.\n       A United States Department of Agriculture study of the \n     lunch and breakfast programs demonstrated that these programs \n     make nutritional improvements in children's diets.\n\n  I could go on and on, but--I see my colleague from Arizona in the \nChamber--I will try to summarize. Let me just make it clear that the \ndata is out there. And over and over again, in report after report \nafter report, we see clearly that malnourished children are not going \nto do well in school, and we know that 8 million low-income children \nare not able to participate because there is no School Breakfast \nProgram.\n  We had a $5 million USDA outreach program that enabled school \ndistricts to get started, provided them with badly needed information, \nprovided them with refrigerators if they needed that, and we eliminated \nit. And at the same time we have a Pentagon budget that is $2.6 billion \nmore than the Pentagon asked.\n  We all say we care about children. We are all referring to these \nstudies that say children have to do well in school, we are talking \nabout the importance of good nutrition, and here we have an opportunity \nto make a difference.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to over and over again come to the floor \nwith amendments that speak to this question. One more time, just in \nterms of looking at the endorsements for this amendment, we have \nendorsements from FRAC, which is Food Research and Action Center--FRAC \nhas been as involved in children's nutritional issues as any \norganization I know--the Elementary School Principals Association--they \nare saying to us, colleagues, at least make sure that children are able \nto have a nutritious breakfast. I think the elementary school \nprincipals know something about learning and something about children \nat this young age--American School Food Services and Bread for the \nWorld.\n  I hope we will have strong support for this amendment.\n  I point out by way of conclusion that if you look at participation in \nthe School Breakfast Program from 1976 to 1996 --and remember, once \nupon a time, I say to my colleagues, we used to think this program was \nonly for rural areas, for students with long bus rides, students who \nwere not going to be able to eat at home. Now what we find is the \nreality that in many of these families there are split shifts, \ndifferent shifts, both parents working, and all too often these kids in \nurban areas and suburbs come to school and they really have not had a \nnutritious breakfast.\n  We saw a good increase in participation in the School Breakfast \nProgram from 1976 to 1996, but now what has happened as a result of \neliminating this small $5 million outreach program is there is \ntremendous concern from USDA all the way to the different child \nadvocacy organizations that the participation is going to begin to \ndecline.\n  So here is an opportunity, colleagues, to invest a small amount of \nmoney in the basic idea that each child ought to have the same \nopportunity to reach his or her full potential. This is an opportunity \nfor all of us to come through for these vulnerable children, \nunderstanding full well--and I know my colleague from Arizona is out \nhere, but I say to him and this really is my conclusion--understanding \nfull well that, indeed, there is a linkage to reform and to the work \nthat he and others are doing on trying to get the money out of \npolitics. There are a number of us who are absolutely convinced we have \nto act on this agenda. That is to say these children and these families \nare not the heavy hitters; they are not the big players; they are not \nthe givers; they do not have the big lobbyists; they all too often are \nfaceless and voiceless, and that it is profoundly wrong. I hope to get \n100 votes for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before I call up my amendment, I wish to respond to my \nfriend from Minnesota for just a moment on his amendment. I preface my \nremarks by saying I know of no more passionate or compassionate Member \nof this body than the Senator from Minnesota, nor do I believe that \nthere is anyone in this body who articulates as well as he the plight \nof those who, as he pointed out, may be underrepresented here in this \nbody in our deliberations. I have grown and developed over the years a \ngreat respect and even affection for the Senator from Minnesota because \nof my admiration for his incredible commitment to serving those who may \nnot always have a voice.\n  But I say to the Senator from Minnesota that this amendment, like \nmany others, is what I call the Willie Sutton syndrome. When the famous \nbank robber was once asked why he robbed banks, he said, ``Because \nthat's where the money is.'' And time after time I see amendments that \nare worthwhile and at times, as the Senator from Minnesota just \narticulated, compelling, but they come out of funds that are earmarked \nfor national defense. In my view, that is not an appropriate way to \nspend defense money.\n  I would also quickly point out that this is not the first time it has \nhappened. There are literally billions of dollars now that we spend out \nof defense appropriations and authorization that have absolutely \nnothing to do with defending this Nation's vital national security \ninterests, again because of the Willie Sutton syndrome. Although I \nadmire and appreciate the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, I \nwould oppose it, not because of its urgency but because of its \ninappropriate placement on a defense appropriations bill. And I would \nalso like to work with the Senator from Minnesota when the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill comes to the floor to see if we cannot provide that \nfunding, which the Senator from Minnesota appropriately points out is \nnot a great deal of money given the large amounts of money we deal with \nand also considering the importance and urgency of the issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield at this moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Minnesota \nfor a comment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from Minnesota for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. The respect is mutual.\n  I just wanted to say--it was going to be a question, but I can just \nmake a comment instead--as a matter of history, the School Lunch \nProgram was created by the Congress 50 years ago, and I quote, ``As a \nmeasure of national security to safeguard the health and well-being of \nthe Nation's children.'' It was a direct response to the fact that many \nof the young men who were drafted in World War II were rejected due to \nconditions arising from nutritional deficiencies. So there is, in fact, \na direct linkage to national defense.\n  It is, in fact, very much a national security issue to make sure that \nchildren have full nutrition and that we do not end up with men and \nwomen later on who have not been able to learn, not been able to earn \nand may, in fact, not even be healthy enough to qualify to serve our \nNation.\n  So it is an interesting history, and I just wanted my colleague to \nknow that this program is very much connected to national security.\n  My second point is I too look forward to working with my colleague in \nthe future. But I hope to win on this amendment now. This is simply a \nmatter of saying, look, we have a budget\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\nthat is $2.6 billion over what the Pentagon asked. There have been \nplenty of studies which have pointed out excesses in the defense \nbudget. Can we not at least authorize the Secretary of Defense to \ntransfer this $5 million.\n  And then, finally, I say to all my colleagues that I think there is \ngoing to come a point in time where people cannot--and I know the \nSenator from Arizona is not trying to do this--but people cannot say, \nwell, we shouldn't vote for this now; we can't vote for this now; we \nwon't vote for this now; there will be a more appropriate place; there \nwill be a more appropriate time. And I find that when it comes to all \nthese issues that have to do with how can we refurbish and renew and \nrestore our national vow of equal opportunity for every child, the vote \nalways gets put off. It always gets put in parenthesis. So I absolutely \ntake what my friend from Arizona said in good faith. I look forward to \nworking with him. But I do think that on this bill, on this amendment, \nthis is the time to vote for such a small step for a good many very \nvulnerable children in our country.\n  I thank my colleague for his graciousness.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 705\n\n      (Purpose: To authorize base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendments and ask that the clerk call up amendment No. 705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Coats, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 705.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize two \nadditional base closure rounds in 1999 and the year 2001 consistent \nwith the recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review, known as \nthe QDR. The amendment authorizes a process which is identical to the \nprocess established in 1990 for the last three BRAC rounds. The \namendment also contains language which addresses the politicization in \nthe last BRAC process which permitted the President to implement \nprivatization in place at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases.\n  I might point out that I am working with the Senator from Texas [Mr \nGramm], in trying to frame language to modify the amendment at the \nappropriate time which would allow the Secretary of Defense to \nprivatize where it can be proven to be of benefit to the taxpayer. We \nare still working on that legislation.\n  Mr. President, we need to authorize additional base closure rounds to \ncorrect a current imbalance in force structure and \ninfrastructure. After four base closing rounds, only 21 percent of the \nmilitary installations in the continental United States have been \nreduced. Our force structure, however, will have been reduced by over \n36 percent by the time that quarterly defense review recommendations \nare complete. Obviously, retaining excess base infrastructure is \nunnecessary with a smaller military force and wastes scarce defense \nresources that are essential to future military modernization.\n\n  I think it is important to frame the debate about this amendment in \nthe terms of the realistic approach we have to take to future defense \nbudgets. I do not believe there is any of us here, barring a national \nsecurity emergency, who believes we are going to see increases in \ndefense spending, certainly not increases in defense spending which \nwould justify the size of our infrastructure as it exists today. It \njust is not possible, in a period, in real terms, of declining defense \nbudgets, to maintain this infrastructure and, at the same time, \nmodernize our force and provide the men and women in the military with \nthe necessary tools to fight and to win any future conflict with a \nminimization of casualties.\n  I am very confident that the United States has emerged at the end of \nthe cold war as the world's No. 1 superpower. I don't think there is \nany doubt about that. But I also think it is important to point out \nthat we are seeing problems within the military that some of us, with \nthe benefit of experience and old age, recognize as having happened \nbefore. We are now seeing a failure to meet our recruitment goals for \nour All Volunteer Force. We are now seeing a derogation of our \nreadiness capabilities in parts of the military establishment. We \nclearly are not modernizing the force in a way that will give us the \nability to maintain our technological edge, which has made us the \nworld's No. 1 superpower and won the magnificent victory of the Persian \nGulf war.\n  So, if you accept the premise that there will be at best a leveling \nof defense spending, and certainly realistically speaking a decline, at \nleast in terms of inflation if not worse, then there really is no \nargument against closing more bases. I have heard some very interesting \narguments and we will hear on the floor some interesting arguments \nagainst base closure. One that has some legitimacy is that, either in \nreality or by perception, the last base closing round was politicized \nby the President of the United States by privatizing in place two major \nbases, both of them with very large electoral votes. I wish that had \nnot happened. It has caused an enormous amount of acrimony and division \nwithin this body, within America, within the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. And this particular reauthorization of further BRAC rounds \nwill not allow a privatization in place to take place. So it will be \nwell, I am sure, by some, to lament the politicization of the process \nas took place--or the perception that it took place, depending on which \nside you are on in the argument--of the last BRAC process.\n  But it does not change the reality. It does not change the reality \nthat we have a significant imbalance between operating forces and \ninfrastructure. In other words, we don't need the number of bases that \nwe have in our defense establishment in order to match up to the \nfighting forces that we must maintain. If we maintain that base \nstructure, it will siphon more and more funds unnecessarily into a base \nstructure and away from the much needed funding, such as pay raises, \nsuch as operations and maintenance, such as training funds, such as \nmodernization of force, such as recruitment, such as, for example, \naddressing the problem we are seeing right now in aviation in the \nmilitary, an exodus of pilots from the military to go with the \nairlines. One of the reasons is pilots are putting pen to paper and \nfiguring out that after a short period of time financially they will be \nbetter off as airline pilots than as military pilots.\n  If you couple that with ever-increasing deployments and separation \nfrom family and home, this is causing a hemorrhaging from our most \nhighly skilled and highly trained branches of our military.\n  Another argument you are going to hear is that we are spending too \nmuch money on other functions, such as peacekeeping. All of us regret \nthat we have had to spend--I believe the estimates are now up to \nsomewhere around $7.5 billion or $8 billion on peacekeeping in Bosnia. \nI regret that, too. I hope that by next June 30 the United States will \nnot only be out of Bosnia militarily but also financially. I will bend \nevery effort that I can, short of jeopardizing the lives of those young \nmen and women and short of provoking another conflict in the region \nwhich may cost the United States more in the long run, but I will do \neverything in my power to see that we stop spending that money on \npeacekeeping.\n  But what in the world is the connection between the money we are \nspending on peacekeeping and the base infrastructure? What is the \npoint? There is none, because whether we had a large or small \nestablishment, we would still be spending too much money on \npeacekeeping.\n  So, I respect the arguments that will come in opposition to this \namendment. Those are the two primary arguments. But I fail to see the \nrelation between those arguments and what we have to do in the national \ninterest.\n\n  One of the interesting things that has happened since the end of the \ncold war is that we see very little, if any, interest in national \nsecurity issues and national defense on the part of the American \npublic. I think in some ways that\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nis good news, because the American people feel content. They do not see \na threat to our security out on the horizon. And, although that \nsentiment does not prevail when Americans are killed in places like \nSomalia and others, generally speaking there is no urgent feeling on \nthe part of the American people that we need to spend, not only not \nmore, but even as much as we are spending on national defense.\n  It is also true, however, that we do have to maintain a certain \nlevel, otherwise we will not maintain our position in the world. It is \nalso true in my view that, if we don't wish to be the world's No. 1 \nsuperpower, then it is a very valid question as to who, then, do we \nexpect to be the world's No. 1 superpower? Because other nations, I \nthink, would be perfectly willing to do so.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter to Chairman Strom Thurmond, and I \nquote from it:\n\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live. We ask your assistance in addressing this \n     difficult issue.\n       Sincerely, John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff; Joseph W. Ralston, Vice Chairman; Dennis \n     Reimer, General, United States Army, Chief of Staff; Jay L. \n     Johnson, Admiral, U.S. Navy, Chief of operations; Ronald R. \n     Fogleman, General, United States Air Force; Charles Krulak, \n     General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter and a letter \nI will read in a few minutes from the Secretary of Defense be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) \n     appropriately notes, achieving the type of force this country \n     will need in the 21st century requires significant increases \n     in our investment accounts. Given other pressures on the \n     federal budget, we must make every effort to find the funds \n     within the Department of Defense budget.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure \n     has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR \n     reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the \n     department will have been reduced by over 36 percent.\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live.\n       We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph W. Ralston,\n       Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Dennis J. Reimer,\n       General, U.S. Army Chief of Staff.\n     Ronald R. Fogleman,\n       General, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff.\n     John M. Shalikashvili,\n       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Jay L. Johnson,\n       Admiral, United States Navy Chief of Naval Operations.\n     Charles C. Krulak,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: As you consider the Fiscal Year 1998 National \n     Defense Authorization Bill, I urge you to add a provision \n     that would permit the Department to conduct two additional \n     base closure and realignment rounds, in FY99 and FY01. \n     Reducing excess infrastructure was an essential element of \n     the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The Department has \n     already reduced its overseas base structure by almost 60 \n     percent and must now bring its domestic base structure into \n     balance with its force structure.\n       With the expiration of the previous BRAC legislation, the \n     Department needs a process to close or realign excess \n     military installations. Even after four rounds of base \n     closures, we have eliminated only 21 percent of our U.S. base \n     structure while force structure will drop by 36 percent by \n     FY03. The QDR concluded that additional infrastructure \n     savings were required to close this gap and begin to reduce \n     the share of the defense budget devoted to infrastructure. \n     Base closings are an integral part of this plan. The QDR \n     found that the Department has enough excess base structure to \n     warrant two additional rounds of BRAC, similar in scale to \n     1993 and 1995.\n       The Department estimates two additional base closure rounds \n     would result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion \n     annually. These savings are critical to the Department's \n     modernization plans. We must modernize our force structure \n     over the long term, laying the groundwork now for the \n     platforms and technologies our forces need in the future. \n     Without the ability to modernize, we would face future \n     threats with obsolete forces. Additionally, the Department \n     will continue to waste resources by maintaining excess \n     military installations, impacting readiness.\n       As you may know, when I was in the Senate, a base in my \n     state was closed as a result of the 1991 BRAC. Therefore, \n     making a recommendation for further BRAC rounds is not \n     something I take lightly. However, the Service Chiefs all \n     believe that additional BRAC rounds are necessary. Further, \n     there have been many communities which have been successful \n     in their base reuse efforts. I am enclosing, for your \n     consideration, additional information on BRAC, the views of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff and community success stories \n     including a New York Times piece on how Charleston survived \n     the closing of the Charleston Naval Base.\n       I would greatly appreciate your support for an amendment to \n     authorize additional base closures and would be pleased to \n     answer any questions or to discuss this matter with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n       Enclosure\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not think we can lightly ignore--or \nnot seriously consider, I guess is a better way of saying it--this \nletter from the individuals that we have asked to lead our military. \nEvery one of these individuals knows the pain and hardship that comes \nabout when a base is closed. But each of these individuals has been \ncharged by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to \nrun our military establishment. And all of those individuals feel, not \njust supportive of what Secretary Cohen is saying, but obviously that \nthis is a very important issue if they are going to be able to carry \nout their responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Bill Cohen, former Senator Bill Cohen, whom we all know quite \nwell. Secretary of Defense Cohen says:\n\n       Reducing excess infrastructure was an essential element of \n     the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Department has already \n     reduced its overseas base structure by almost 60 percent and \n     must now bring its domestic base structure into balance with \n     its force structure.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Base closings are an integral part of this plan. The QDR \n     found the Department has enough excess base structure to \n     warrant two additional rounds of BRAC, similar in scale to \n     1993 and 1995.\n       The Department estimates two additional base closure rounds \n     would result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion \n     annually. These savings are critical to the Department's \n     modernization plans.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       These savings are critical to the Department's \n     modernization plans.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       As you may know, when I was in the Senate, a base in my \n     State was closed as a result of the 1991 BRAC. Therefore, \n     making a recommendation for further BRAC rounds is not \n     something I take lightly. However, the Service Chiefs all \n     believe that additional BRAC rounds are necessary.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it might be appropriate to point out at this \ntime, in light of what I just read from Secretary Cohen's letter, that \nthere are bases in my State that I know will be vulnerable in light of \ntwo additional rounds of base closing. And I know that I will have to \ngo back to my home State, if one of them is closed, and say: Yes, I'm \nthe guy who proposed the amendment for two more rounds of base \nclosings.\n  But I will also tell the people of my State that I did it because I \ntold them, when I sought to serve in this body, that I would act in the \nnational interest first. I would also add that we went through a base \nclosing in my State, in the case of Williams Air Force Base, and I am \nhappy to say, by the way, as has been the case in many bases in many \nareas of the country, that the community has ended up by generating \nmore economic benefit than less. That certainly has not been in all \ncases, but it certainly has been in many.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that there are several urban \nsuccess stories: Charleston Naval Base, Charleston, SC, where currently \nthere are 32 agencies reusing this former naval base; Pease Air Force \nBase, Portsmouth, NH, the establishment of\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\nPease International Tradeport created more than 1,161 new jobs; \nSacramento Army Depot, Sacramento, Packard Bell NEC, the country's \nlargest manufacturer of personal computers, has created more than 5,000 \njobs at this former depot; Williams Air Force Base, now known as the \nWilliams Gateway Airport, quickly emerged as an international aviation \nand aerospace center where more than 20 companies engage in aircraft \nmaintenance; Mather Air Force Base; Gentile Air Force Station, \nKettering, OH; Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino; Fort Benjamin \nHarrison, Indianapolis; Griffiss Air Force Base; Cameron Station, \nAlexandria; Naval Air Station/Naval Aviation Depot Alameda, Alameda--\nthe list goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, there are a large number of success stories. That does \nnot diminish the fact that in some rural areas there will be \nsignificant economic impact. There is no doubt about that. But it also \nis part of the BRAC process that economic impact is a factor in the \ndetermination of a base closing.\n  Mr. President, I have talked too long a time, probably, on this \nissue, because the issue is well known to my colleagues. I am grateful \nto my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, who, along with me in the \nArmed Services Committee deliberations, tried to--we were cosponsors of \nan amendment; had it put in the authorization bill. We were defeated on \na tie vote. I appreciate the efforts of Senator Levin very much on this \nissue.\n  This is a nonpartisan issue. It is an issue that has to do with the \nfuture military capabilities of this country and our ability, over \ntime, if called upon, to defend our vital national security interests. \nIt is not possible to modernize the force, maintain the level of \ntraining and readiness and recruit the qualified men and women in an \nall-volunteer force if we refuse to put back into balance the base \nsupport structure with the fighting forces and operational forces that \nare necessary to do the fighting.\n  My friend from Virginia, Senator Robb, former Marine Corps officer, \ncarries around with him from time to time a chart that is very simple. \nIt shows what he calls the tooth to tail--tooth being the fighting \nforces, the tail being those in support--and how those two lines have \ndiverged steadily over the intervening years. With this BRAC closure we \nmay not cause that trend to reverse, but at least we can level it off. \nI believe we must do so.\n  I know there will be a lot of debate on this amendment, and I hope we \ncan agree to this and move forward.\n  I feel so strongly about this particular issue that unless we do \ninclude a base closing round and unless we do something about the depot \nissue, if I were the President of the United States, I would be very \ntempted to veto this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from California yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Greg Renden, \nSenator Wellstone's intern, be allowed the privilege of the floor for \nthe duration of the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, in my 4\\1/2\\ years in this body, I have not seen an \neffort as egregious, as badly flawed, as unfair as the base closure \nprocess. I happen to have great respect for the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from Michigan, but I think to adopt this amendment at \nthis time is really only to continue this kind of egregious pursuit. I \nhope, in the course of my remarks, to at least point out some of the \nareas where I find the base closure process very wanting.\n  The Senator from Arizona spoke of States with big electoral clout, \nand I would have to plead guilty. No State has bigger electoral clout \nthan California. I also hasten to point out that no State has suffered \nmore base closures than California--29 bases cited for closure to date, \nand the largest number of jobs lost all across this Nation. In net jobs \nlost to date, California has lost 123,000 net jobs. The next State in \nnet jobs lost is Pennsylvania at 35,000. So we are more than four times \nPennsylvania's job loss. The next highest State in total number of \nbases closed to California is Texas, then Pennsylvania, then New York, \nthen Illinois.\n  If I really believed that this was going to end up being an important \ncost saving for the U.S. military, I would say, ``All right, Dianne, \nyou may represent this State, but, by and large, this is for the best \ninterest of the military.'' I don't believe it, and I have seen no \nevidence to date to corroborate that. I believe strongly that it is \nmuch too soon to begin another round without having some of this \ninformation.\n  We don't know how much the four rounds cost. We don't know how much \nthe four rounds have saved. And we haven't met our commitments to local \ncommunities impacted by these closures, despite the letter of the \ndistinguished Secretary of Defense to the contrary.\n  The CBO--even the CBO--the 1995 BRAC Commission, they both say wait. \nCBO recommends waiting until at least 2001 for another round. They say:\n\n       The Congress should consider authorizing an additional \n     round of base closures if the Department of Defense believes \n     that there is a surplus of military capacity after--\n\n  And I stress the word ``after''--\n\n     all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, \n     however, should follow an interval during which DOD and \n     independent analysts examine the actual impact of the \n     measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like this distinguished body to know that we \ncannot get a single figure from the U.S. Navy as to what the cost \nsavings actually will be from the closures of the Navy bases in the \nState of California. Not a single figure. They will not give us \nestimates. And yet we are going to run ahead, pass another round and \nbegin this same procedure again. It doesn't make any sense.\n\n  Let me quote what the BRAC 1995 commission itself recommended:\n\n       . . . the Commission recommends that the Congress authorize \n     another Base Closure Commission for the year 2001 . . . \n     [giving] military services time to complete the current \n     closures in an orderly fashion--\n\n  Which has not happened, I might allude to--\n\n     while ensuring that the Defense Department has the \n     opportunity in the future to make further reductions . . .\n\n  In addition to these new BRAC rounds beginning too quickly, and \ncontrary to what DOD and supporters of this amendment claim, the base \nreuse process has been cumbersome and has been fraught with \nbureaucratic nightmares.\n  Secretary Cohen's letter of June 24 says that the DOD has assigned \n``transition coordinators'' to each base to solve closure problems and \nto speed the process. Well, let me say, as one Senator from California, \nthis approach has not worked well. I have had to intervene with DOD for \ncommunities in my State numerous times to fight for a community's needs \nin just this past year alone.\n  Let me speak for a moment about environmental costs. I think every \nMember of this body knows that the costs of environmental remediation \nare grossly underestimated, grossly underbudgeted. DOD claims it is \n``empowering communities'' by speeding base cleanup, and I would like \nto give you the results in California of what is termed ``speedy base \ncleanup.''\n  Environmental remediation--that is just remediation--is in place at \nonly 29 percent of the Army BRAC sites; 14 percent of the Navy BRAC \nsites; and 18 percent of the Air Force BRAC sites in my State. \nEnvironmental remediation has not been completed at a single base \nclosed in any of the four rounds in the State of California.\n  This issue is important, because without clean property, transfers by \ndeed cannot occur and individuals cannot get financing. Therefore, if \nthey don't have the bases cleaned up, they can't be effectively and \nfully put to use.\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\n  Let me take the four California instances that the Secretary of \nDefense raises in his letter. First, Castle Air Force Base. That is in \nCalifornia's Central Valley. It was closed by BRAC in 1991. To date, \nthere have been 262 separate sites at this base identified for cleanup; \n65 of these sites have not yet even been evaluated to determine what \ncontaminants are in the soil or water; and none of the sites--none of \nthe sites--on this base, held out as a model, have remediation efforts \ncurrently in place.\n  Second base: Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento was closed by BRAC \nin 1988. To date, there have been 87 sites identified for cleanup; 15 \nhave not yet been evaluated to determine what contaminants are in the \nsoil or the water; and only 39 of the sites, or 44 percent, have \nremediation efforts in place. So 55 percent of the sites haven't even \nbegun to be worked on yet.\n  Another of these sterling examples, Norton Air Force Base in southern \nCalifornia, closed by BRAC in 1988. To date, 25 sites have been \nidentified for cleanup; 6 have not yet been evaluated to determine what \ncontaminants are in the soil or water; and only 10 of the sites, or 40 \npercent, have remediation efforts in place.\n  None of the environmental cleanup has been completed at any of the \nbases anywhere in California. These were bases, Mather and Norton, that \nwere closed nearly 10 years ago, and yet they are not close to being \nclean. No transfer by deed have yet occurred at Norton and a very \nlimited number of these transfers by deed have occurred at Mather.\n  Alameda Naval Air Station and Naval Aviation Depot was closed by BRAC \nin 1993. One of the real problems I had when this was closed was that \nAlameda had 7,600 units of housing that were going to be vacated. The \nfleet, the nuclear carriers were to be moved to Everett and San Diego. \nEverett had no housing for the wings. Housing had to be built. MilCon \nwas not included in the cost of closing that base.\n\n  To date at Alameda, there have been 30 sites identified for cleanup. \nOnly one of these sites has not yet been evaluated to determine what \ncontaminants are in the soil or water. But none of the sites have \nremediation in place. So at Alameda, they have done some \nidentification; they have done no remediation.\n  Sacramento Army Depot was closed by BRAC in 1991, and this is \nprobably California's most successful reuse site to date. They have 16 \nsites identified for cleanup. All cleanup sites have been evaluated, \nand 12 sites, or 75 percent, have remediation efforts in place.\n  It should also be pointed out, there is no deadline for the \ncompletion of environmental cleanup at BRAC sites. Let me, once again, \nmake this point clear. Communities can't reuse a base when they don't \nknow when it is going to be clean. The law has been liberalized to \nallow long-term, interim leases to be granted for dirty property, but \nthese leases are limited in scope, and the potential buyer cannot \nobtain financing under these circumstances, and this has further \ndelayed and deterred base reuse.\n  DOD has given communities estimates as to when their bases will be \nclean, but DOD will not guarantee these completion dates, and every \nyear, environmental cleanup is underfunded and every year it is delayed \neven more.\n  The Air Force estimates that Castle Air Force Base should have \nenvironmental remediation in place by the year 2000 and that it should \nbe complete by 2018. So the total base cannot be transferred into \nprivate reuse at Castle Air Force Base until the year 2018.\n  The Air Force estimates that Mather should have environmental \nremediation in place by 1999 and that this should be complete by the \nyear 2027. So it will take to 2027 for the process to be completed and \nthe base to be transferred.\n  The Air Force estimates that Norton Air Force Base should have \nenvironmental remediation in place by 1999, and that this should be \ncomplete by 2012. So, again, one has to wait for the base to be \ntransferred.\n  DOD is also far behind on the transfer of base closure property, due \nin large part to environmental contamination. In my State, and this is \nthe largest State, only 4 percent of the acreage--4 percent of 79,618 \nacres--have been transferred by deed to new owners.\n  So we are contemplating here a new BRAC closure round when only 4 \npercent of the land covered in California has been deeded to new \nowners. It does not make sense. If one is thinking about the \ncommunities and really means that reuse should work, how can you go \nahead with a new round where you have 80,000 acres of land and only 4 \npercent of them at this stage have been deeded to a local entity?\n  Only 19 percent of these acres have been transferred by long-term \nlease, and a whopping 49 percent are still sitting there with no action \non any kind of transfer having taken place.\n  So one-half of the acreage that has been closed in California has no \nplan for a transfer at this stage, and we are still contemplating a new \nround.\n  Many of these base closure communities are working hard to make the \nbest of their misfortune and many are optimistic about the prospects of \nbase reuse. But before we pile on these additional rounds, let us look \ncandidly at some of the difficulties they are facing.\n  In Tustin, CA, the community is trying to reuse the Tustin Marine \nCorps Air Station. After 14 months of negotiations for an interim lease \nfor one of the large blimp hangars and the loss of nine potential film \ntenants, a lease was approved by the city of Tustin and the Navy's \nSouthwest Engineering Division. When the Pentagon subsequently rejected \nthis lease, the prospective tenant, Walt Disney Productions, simply got \nfed up and left to lease space elsewhere.\n  So here you had a base with a prime potential tenant, and the \nbureaucratic nightmare that has ensued caused it to be rejected, and \nDisney walked off and went somewhere else. So that was the 10th one \nthey lost.\n  At Norton Air Force Base, the Worldpointe Trade Center project that \nSecretary Cohen lauds in his June 24 letter will not happen due to a \nlack of financing. The community has regrouped, though, and now this \nproject will be replaced by an industrial park that will take 5 years \nto build and yield only 40 percent of the jobs hoped for with the trade \ncenter development.\n  At Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento, the Air Force and Sacramento \nCounty have finally reached agreement on the sale of 1,200 housing \nunits. It took four separate appraisals and 5 years of negotiations to \nfinally reach the price of $4.25 million--the same price as the \ncounty's 1993 appraisal.\n  At George Air Force Base in southern California, it took 20 months to \nget a signed economic development conveyance. It was submitted by the \ncommunity in February 1995 and finally signed in 1996.\n  Another EDC at Mare Island Naval Shipyard was submitted in January of \n1996--of 1996--and a year and a half later is still pending. They are \nstill waiting for a decision.\n  The city of Long Beach just completed a negotiated sale with the \nformer Long Beach Naval Hospital. After 18 months of negotiations, the \ncity will have to pay the Navy $8.6 million to buy back this 30-acre \nsite that the city sold to the Navy in 1964 for 10 dollars. So they \nsold it to the Navy for 10 dollars and now they buy it back at $8.6 \nmillion. To make matters worse, the Navy required that the city provide \nthe Navy with a letter of credit to secure two promissory notes to buy \nback the property. This cost the city of Long Beach an additional \n$50,000.\n  Finally, the goal of base closures was to save DOD money so that we \ncould modernize our force. If anybody could come in here and say, look, \nthe Navy has saved x dollars in California by closing bases, I would \nsay, OK, now we know either it was cost efficient or it was not cost \nefficient and we have a sound basis on which to make another judgment.\n  But as I said before, the Navy will not give my office a single \nfigure as to what cost savings can be anticipated from closure of major \nNavy bases in the State of California. Yet, we are going to go about \nanother round today.\n  The GAO and the CBO both say that DOD's estimated savings cannot be \nquantified. GAO and CBO cannot quantify what the military says the \nsavings estimates are.\n\n  DOD has not included the total cost of environmental cleanup in its \nnet savings figures. By 2001, DOD claims\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\nthat it will have saved nearly $14 billion from BRAC. To their credit, \nthey did include the cost of environmental cleanup through 2001. That \nwas $7.3 billion. But they did not include the cost of BRAC cleanup for \nthese sites after 2001. In California alone this will cost another \n$1.56 billion.\n  So, in the costs that have been provided by the military to this \nbody, with California alone it is $1.56 billion shy, short, lacking, \nnot defined, not there; and yet we would go ahead with another round \nregardless of knowing what the true costs and true savings actually \nare.\n  Let us look at how much additional cleanup funding four of five \nCalifornia success stories will need past the year 2001.\n  Castle will require an additional $53.1 million.\n  Mather will require an additional $73.8 million.\n  Norton will require an additional $1.25 million.\n  Alameda Naval Air Station and Naval Aviation Depot will require an \nadditional $73.4 million.\n  None of this is counted before we make the decision. And I am just \ngiving you four bases here--not 29.\n  The true costs of BRAC should include all of these costs related to \nclosure, not just those funded directly by the BRAC account. Until they \ndo, frankly, I will not vote ever for another round. Just because these \ncosts are funded from other Federal accounts does not mean that they \nare any less real.\n  So what is happening, Mr. President, is that they fund some of this \nfrom other accounts and they do not cost them in. So that way the \nmilitary costs look less, but the Federal costs--it is all the same, it \nall comes from the same taxpayer, all goes into the same budget, but it \nis not counted here.\n  DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment grants to base closure \ncommunities for base reuse planning, $125 million. It is not counted \nhere, not counted as a cost. It is a cost? Of course it is a cost.\n  The Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration \ngrants to base closure communities, $371 million. It is not counted \nhere as a cost.\n  FAA grants to establish airports at closed bases, $182 million. It is \nnot counted here.\n  It is like MilCon, except MilCon is in the defense budget. These are \nnot in the defense budget. They are necessary, but not counted.\n  Department of Labor job retraining grants, $103 million. It is not \ncounted in the cost of base closure.\n  So without at least a firm accounting of how much the first four \nrounds of BRAC cost and how much was saved, I cannot and I do not \nbelieve any Member of this body should support a new round.\n  We have moved too fast in closing these bases. We need to look at the \nbottom line. What are these closures costing, not only the Defense \nDepartment, but the FAA, the Department of Commerce, the Department of \nLabor in retraining grants, the Office of Economic Adjustment? What are \nthe costs? And factor those costs in. What are the costs of MilCon for \nall of the rounds? Factor those costs in as well.\n  Later this afternoon it is my understanding that Senator Dorgan will \nbe offering an amendment to propose a study to come up with just this \nvery information. I think to proceed with another round until the study \nis done and until we have the specific information would really be a \nmajor, major mistake.\n  We need to look at operations and maintenance. We need to look at \nmilitary construction, environmental cleanup costs, base reuse costs \nand economic redevelopment costs also funded by the Federal Government, \nunemployment compensation costs, military health care costs and force \nstructure costs. All of this should be looked at, I believe, by an \nindependent agency, figures ascertained on which responsible people can \ndepend, and then another decision can be made on another day about \nanother round.\n  I think this is ill-advised. It is too fast. And it will simply \ncomplicate one flawed procedure with another flawed round.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment which has \nbeen offered by Senator McCain to have an additional two rounds of base \nclosings. I do so for many, many reasons. But let me just cite first \nthat we have a recommendation which is as strong a one as I have ever \nseen from the uniformed military of this country, pleading with us to \nreduce excess baggage, the infrastructure that they no longer need \nbecause it is costing money which is desperately needed elsewhere.\n\n  We cannot successfully do what we need to do for the defense of this \nNation, they are telling us--and I will quote that letter in a moment--\nif we continue to carry excess infrastructure which we simply no longer \nneeded. Now, we are going to hear lots of reasons why it is tough to do \nit and lots of reasons why we should not do it. We will address those \none by one.\n  But when you get a letter, which we have received, signed by the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, every single member, a so-called 24-star letter, \nit does not happen very often around here. But when we get a letter \nfrom General Shalikashvili and the Vice Chairman Joe Ralston, and each \nof the Chiefs signing a letter as succinct and to the point as this one \nis, I think we ought to give it the most serious consideration. We \ncannot just shed this and say, base closing is tough or we cannot prove \nprecisely how much money it saves. We have a pretty good idea, by the \nway, and I will get to that in a moment. But we just cannot simply say, \nbase closings are tough. And they are. Let me tell you, my State knows \nit. Percentagewise, it is one of the 10 hardest hit States with base \nclosings, and we still have facilities where people feel they are at \nrisk.\n  But this is what the letter from the Joint Chiefs says. It is \naddressed to our chairman, Senator Thurmond. I am going to read it all. \nIt is a short letter, but it is very much to the point.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman.\n       As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) appropriately \n     notes, achieving the type of force this country will need in \n     the 21st century requires significant increases in our \n     investment accounts. Given other pressures on the federal \n     budget, we must make every effort to find the funds within \n     the Department of Defense budget.\n       Now that is point one. We have to make every effort we can \n     to find the funds necessary for future investments in the \n     defense of this country inside the defense budget. That is a \n     statement based on reality. It is a statement based on the \n     desire of all of us to get down to a zero deficit and to \n     begin to pay off the national debt. It is a statement based \n     on the reality that the defense budget is not going to grow \n     faster or in a different way than what we have projected in \n     our 5-year defense budget, unless, of course, world \n     circumstances change.\n\n  Then the letter goes on:\n\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure \n     has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR \n     reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the \n     department will have been reduced by over 36 percent.\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live.\n       We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue.\n\n  Now, they are asking our assistance to do something which is \ndifficult, and it is difficult politically, and every one of us knows \nthat. I don't think there is any one of us who has a facility in our \nState that we have not been worried about it, that we have not gone to \nbat for, that we have not been an advocate for and, in some cases, have \nwon a battle for a base and, in other cases, lost a battle for a base.\n  That is one of the reasons we are here, to be advocates for our \nStates, and we do that proudly. I have done that for bases in my State. \nI have won some and I have lost some. We have lost every Strategic Air \nCommand base in my State--all three, gone--and it has been painful. \nThey have been in rural communities. In one case, most recently, up in \nthe Upper Peninsula of Michigan, it was the largest single employer in \nthe Upper Peninsula, Sawyer Air Force.\n  Has the environmental cleanup gone as predicted? It has not gone as \nfast.\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\nHave we struggled to make sure the leases are available to people who \nwant to lease that property? We have; we work with them every day. Is \nit working out OK? It is. Is it tough? It is. Have there been \ndislocations? Yes. But is there any alternative if we are going to do \nour job to come up with the necessary resources to defend this country? \nIs there any alternative but to shed the excess baggage which our Joint \nChiefs are asking us to shed? This is not easy for them, either. Those \nare communities that they have their hearts and souls in. But what they \nare telling us is we must bite this political bullet again if we are \ngoing to save the funds necessary for modernization, for investment \naccounts, for readiness, for the other things which we need to do in \nour defense budget.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review reached the same conclusion. The \nSecretary of Defense has reached the same conclusion. So the amendment \nis simple. It authorizes the same process that we used in 1991, 1993, \nand 1995 for two new rounds in 1999 and 2001. We have changed this \nprocess over the years. We have tried to make the environmental cleanup \nfaster. We worked on the leases to make sure that they be available to \nlease land, even before it was finally cleaned up. We tried to improve \nthe notice requirements, the fairness requirements. We made lots of \nchanges over the years. But to say we are going to not continue to do \nwhat our uniformed military says we must do to avoid wasting billions \nof dollars each year because it is politically difficult or because we \ncannot determine the precise amount, in an audited fashion, of the \nsavings, it seems to me, is inconsistent with the desire of this body \nto protect the Nation's defense.\n  This process has the Secretary of Defense, again, making \nrecommendations to a commission, nominated by the President, confirmed \nby the Senate. During those confirmation hearings, we got into all of \nthe kinds of issues and concerns which each of us has relative to base \nclosing. The commission, after being confirmed by the Senate, reviews \nthese recommendations and makes their own recommendations to the \nPresident. The President then reviews the recommendation, either sends \nthose back to the commission for additional work or forwards them, \nwithout changes, to the Congress, and then the recommendations of the \ncommission go into effect unless disapproved by a joint resolution of \nthe Congress. That is the process.\n  Has it been perfect? It has not. There have been many changes made in \nthis process over the years. This amendment is open to other changes in \nterms of how do we approve the process. But to say that the process is \nnot perfect means we should perfect it. It does not mean that we should \nditch it when it has led to significant savings already and when it is \nessential to lead to additional savings in the future.\n  The case for closing more military bases is simply clear, and it is \ncompelling. From 1989 to 1997, the Department of Defense reduced total \nactive duty military end strength by 32 percent, and that figure will \ngrow to 36 percent by 2003 as a result of the recently completed \nQuadrennial Defense Review, known as the QDR. So we are going to be \nreducing the active end strength, the number of people in our military, \nby 36 percent. But even after the four base closure rounds that are now \ncompleted, the reduction in domestic base structure will be 21 percent. \nSo we have a gap. We have excess. We have surplus. We have baggage we \nmust shed. We have facilities that are no longer being fully used, \nfacilities that are not being run in a way which makes economic sense. \nThese are facilities which we can no longer justify keeping.\n\n  Which are those facilities? Does anyone really believe that we on the \nSenate floor could decide which facilities need to be closed? It was \nthe inability of the Congress to make those kinds of decisions which \nbrought the Base Closure Commission into effect to begin with. We \nrealized a few years back that we could not close bases ourselves. It \nis too difficult politically. There are too many pressures on us. There \nare too many tradeoffs that are possible. So we created a BRAC \ncommission, giving ourselves a final right to veto, but basically \nsaying that this is the only realistic way we are going to downsize the \nunneeded structure.\n  Now, this year, General Shalikashvili, who is our Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, testified before our committee as follows: ``As difficult \nas it is politically, we will have to further reduce our \ninfrastructure. We, perhaps, have more excess infrastructure today than \nwe did when the BRAC process started. In the short run, we need to \nclose more facilities, as painful and as expensive as it is.'' That is \nhis quote.\n  One line in that quote, I hope, if nothing else, will remain with us: \n``We, perhaps, have more excess infrastructure today than we did when \nthe BRAC process started.''\n  Now, both the QDR and the independent National Defense Panel--and \nthis is the group of citizens outside the Defense Department that have \nbeen appointed by the President--both the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, inside the Defense Department, and the independent National \nDefense Panel have concluded that further reductions in DOD \ninfrastructure--that is the base structure of the Department of \nDefense--are essential to free up the money that we need to modernize \nour forces.\n  On May 23, Secretary Cohen wrote to the chairman, Senator Thurmond, \nand to me, asking the Congress to act this year on his request to \nauthorize two additional base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001. Though \nwe will not get the final report of the National Defense Panel until \nlater this year, they do have an interim report dated May 15 which \naccompanies the Quadrennial Defense Review. This is what the outside \ncitizens panel said about base closures:\n\n       We endorse the Secretary's plan to request authority for \n     two additional rounds of base closure and realignment. We \n     strongly urge the administration to support legislation that \n     will start this process in 1999 and encourage Congress to \n     approve the request despite constituency challenges.\n\n  Several weeks ago, the Armed Services Committee received a letter, as \nI indicated, which all six members of the Joint Chiefs signed. We do \nnot get these 24-star letters every day or every week or even every \nyear. I am not sure I can even remember the last 24-star letter that we \nhave received. But now the Chiefs, every one of them, say that the \ncommittee should reduce base structure supported by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  While I have read this letter, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. \nPresident, that a copy of the letter from the Chiefs be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman. As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) \n     appropriately notes, achieving the type of force this country \n     will need in the 21st century requires significant increases \n     in our investment accounts. Given other pressures on the \n     federal budget, we must make every effort to find the funds \n     within the Department of Defense budget.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure \n     has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR \n     reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the \n     department will have been reduced by over 26 percent.\n       We strongly support further reductions in base structure \n     proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be \n     based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such \n     reductions will have on the Service communities in which our \n     people live.\n       We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph W. Ralston,\n       Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Dennis J. Reimer,\n       General, United States Army, Chief of Staff.\n     Ronald R. Fogleman,\n       General, United States Air Force, Chief of Staff.\n     John M. Shalikashvili,\n       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n     Jay L. Johnson,\n       Admiral, United States Navy, Chief of Naval Operations.\n     Charles C. Krulak,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The service chiefs have also made the case for shrinking \nour base structure. In testimony before the committee, General Reimer \nsaid:\n\n       We cut 36 percent out of the force structure and 21 percent \n     of the infrastructure in\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\n     the Army. I think we need to balance those two out or we are \n     going to pay a heavy price that we should not have to pay.\n\n  The testimony of the service chiefs makes this point very clear. The \nissue is not base closures or no base closures. The issue is either we \nshrink the base structure or we are going to have to cut modernization. \nIf we make the wrong choice and do not close any more bases, this \nproblem is not going to go away. If we keep excess bases open and try \nto protect modernization by cutting the size of our forces instead, \nthat will further increase the amount of excess base structure, which \nwill, in turn, increase the pressure to close bases.\n  This problem is not going to go away. This problem will get worse if \nwe delay it. If we cut forces instead of closing bases, that will \ninevitably lead to increased operating costs and increases days away \nfrom home for the smaller number of personnel who will be left. This \nissue is not going to go away. It will fester and get worse unless we \naddress it. It will not be easier to determine and make this decision a \nyear from now or 2 years from now than it is now.\n  The reason there is so much pressure coming from our defense \nestablishment to authorize more base closures is because the Defense \nDepartment understands that reductions in the base structure are \nessential to the modernization of our forces. Every dollar we spend to \nkeep bases open that we do not need--excess bases--is a dollar we \ncannot spend on modernization programs that our military forces do \nneed.\n  As Secretary Cohen said in his preface to the QDR report:\n\n       In essence, our combat forces are headed toward the 21st \n     century, but our infrastructure is stuck in the past. We \n     cannot afford this waste of resources in an environment of \n     tough choices and fiscal constraint. We must shed weight.\n\n  This is not just a choice which the Defense Department faces. This is \nnot just Secretary Cohen's problem. This is our problem, and it is a \nproblem which will get worse unless we make this decision earlier \nrather than later.\n  We cannot just tell the Department of Defense, ``Reform yourself.'' \nThe Department of Defense can reform if they want to, which they do, \nbut they can't reform if we can't let them. It requires legislative \naction. As General Fogleman, who is Chief of Staff of the Air Force, \nsaid to our committee, ``Getting lean and mean is no easy feat. We can \nbe mean if we have to, but we need your help to get lean.''\n  Make no mistake, if we don't act this year to approve and to \nauthorize additional base closure rounds, there will not be any \nadditional base closures before the turn of the century. No bases have \nbeen or will be closed outside of the Base Closure Commission process \ncontained in this amendment, and every year we delay facing this issue, \nwe delay achieving the potential savings that we need to modernize our \nforces.\n  Now, the argument has been made that we can't prove exactly how much \nprevious base closures have saved. I agree that we don't know exactly \nhow much base closures have saved. We can't audit it; it is not that \nprecise. But I don't know of any disagreement over the fact that \nclosing bases has saved, and will save, substantial amounts of money. \nThe savings don't always come as quickly as the Department of Defense \noriginally forecasts, for a number of reasons. But the savings have \nbeen there, and they are documented.\n  The CBO concluded in that same report, which was read before, that \n``BRAC actions will result in significant long-term savings.'' Now, the \nDepartment of Defense makes an estimate on savings. These estimates are \navailable for Members of the Senate. They are based on 100 or so \nreports of base closings. Their estimate is that implementing the BRAC \nactions in the first four rounds will result in $23 billion in one-time \nimplementation costs--that is the cost--and this is offset by savings \nof $36.5 billion--that's the savings--for a total net savings of $13.5 \nbillion. So that is between 1990 and 2001 when the implementation of \nthe first four rounds is supposed to be concluded. That is a net \nsavings--deducting the investment from the gross savings--of $13.5 \nbillion. That's what Secretary Cohen has written us. That is what he \nhas testified to. That is the best information that is available.\n  Secretary Cohen estimates that each of the additional BRAC rounds \nthat he is asking the Congress to approve will save $1.4 billion a year \nonce they are fully implemented. That is comparable to the savings that \nwill be achieved from the 1991 and 1995 rounds.\n  Maybe 5 years from now we are going to find that the actual savings \nfrom the first four rounds of base closures will be slightly smaller or \nslightly larger than the $5.6 billion I have referred to. But there is \nno question that there are large, ongoing savings from shrinking our \nbase structure. Before the first base closure round, we had \napproximately 500 domestic military bases. When all of the bases from \nthe first four BRAC rounds are closed, we will have about 400 bases. So \n80 percent of the bases will remain after all four BRAC rounds are \nimplemented, even though we will have seen a reduction of one-third of \nour force structure.\n  Now, the exact amount that we are saving is impossible to prove--\nthese are approximations and estimates--for lots of reasons, including \nthe fact that these savings represent money we would have spent to pay \ncivilians we no longer have and to operate bases that we no longer \nhave. So they are, by definition, estimates; we can't audit them. But I \ncannot imagine someone trying to argue that we are not going to save \nlarge sums of money by operating 400 bases instead of 500 bases. That \nis 100 fewer bases at which we have to pay for electricity, heat, \nwater, telephone service, maintenance, and security.\n  These BRAC savings, Mr. President, are an important part of the funds \nthat are going to finance the future modernization of the armed \nservices that will keep our military the most technologically advanced \nand lethal fighting force in the world.\n  Some people have expressed concern that funds from base closures may \nnot go toward modernization. But this amendment includes a provision \nthat would require the Department to ensure that all savings that come \nfrom future base closings go toward modernization programs.\n  Now, over the last few months, another issue has been raised, an \nissue relative to the question of privatization in place. Some of our \ncolleagues complain about the implementation of the 1995 Base Closure \nCommission recommendation with respect to the closing of two Air Force \ndepots, at Kelly and Sacramento. There are clearly very strong feelings \non this issue, and understandably so. I don't agree with those who say \nthat what happened, however, in 1995, whatever one's view of those \nevents are, somehow justifies refusing to ever close any more bases.\n  My own view is that we should let the market decide the most \nefficient way to redistribute the workload of these two closing depots \nand that the way to let the market decide that is through a fair and \nopen competition.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense John White testified before our Readiness \nSubcommittee in May that the Department's policy is no longer to \nprivatize the work of these two closing depots in place, but to compete \ntheir workload between the public depots and the private sector. \nSecretary Cohen wrote a letter to the majority and minority leaders \nreaffirming the Department's policy of competing this work. He also \ntestified before our committee that, ``If you disagree with giving the \ncommission this kind of discretion''--he was referring to privatization \nin place-- ``then you can always restrict it in the future.''\n  That is what the amendment does. To address the problem of \nprivatization in place for future BRAC rounds, this amendment includes \nlanguage that would allow the Secretary of Defense to privatize in \nplace the workload of a closing military installation only when it is \nexplicitly recommended by the Base Closure Commission as either the \ncorrect way to close the base or as one option.\n  But whatever our view is of privatization in place at the two air \nlogistic centers that were closed by the 1995 Base Closure Commission, \nthat is no reason to cut off our nose to spite our face and keep excess \nbase structures open at a huge, unjustifiable cost in the future.\n\n  As I said a moment ago, I know personally how painful the base \nclosing process is. Michigan never had a very large military presence, \nbut we rank seventh among all States in the percentage of total BRAC \njob losses. So we\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\nknow in our State, and we know that we have a few additional facilities \nthat some people think could be at risk.\n  If we are serious about modernizing our military forces and if we are \nserious about maintaining the qualitative technological edge that we \nhave, then we have no choice but to reduce our infrastructure costs so \nthat they are in line with our foresight.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs are right. We need to \nclose more bases if we are going to modernize our forces, and we are \nnot going to be able to do that unless this amendment is adopted.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nbehalf of the overall defense bill and to give credit where credit is \ndue in regard to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nThurmond, and the distinguished ranking member from Michigan, Senator \nLevin. I want to pay tribute to their leadership. I think the committee \ndid great work, and there was much bipartisan agreement. I think we had \na very difficult task in this regard.\n  I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to a study called \n``America's National Interests'' by the Commission on America's \nNational Interest. It was about a year ago, and I served on the \ncommission with some very qualified people who have a great deal of \nexpertise in regard to defense matters. The cochairs were Robert \nEllsworth, Andrew Goodpaster, and Rita Hauser. The study was done by \nthe Center for Science and International Affairs of Harvard University \nand also by the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom and the Rand Corp.\n  Basically, they had an executive summary that pretty well said this: \nNo. 1, American foreign policy and American national interests don't \nreally represent a very high blip on the national attention radar \nscreen. They said America was adrift. ``In the wake of the Cold War, \nthe American public's interest in foreign policy has declined sharply \nand political leaders have been pressed to attend to immediate domestic \nconcerns.'' Certainly that is true. ``After four decades of unusual \nsingle-mindedness in containing Soviet expansion, we have seen five \nyears of ad hoc fits and starts.'' This was last year, remember. ``If \nit continues, this drift will threaten our values, our fortunes, and \nindeed our lives.''\n  I think the committee took an important first step in trying to end \nthis drift. They mentioned confusion and the lack of a national \nstrategy as we try to determine how much money to spend on defense, \nwhich, after all, is the first obligation of the Federal Government.\n  So having said that, I want to again thank Senator Levin and Senator \nThurmond for their leadership. However, I must rise in opposition to \nthe amendment as argued for by Senator Levin and as proposed by Senator \nMcCain. I am talking about BRAC. I am talking about the effort to, \nobviously, reduce the excess infrastructure that we have in regard to \nour national defense system.\n  I want to make it very clear and I want to really emphasize that I do \nnot support--and I don't know of anybody in the Senate or, for that \nmatter, in the House of Representatives who supports--carrying excess \nor unproductive capacity in our military infrastructure. After all, how \ncould anybody stand up here and say that they were supporting that? \nHaving said that, I don't think we should sign onto another BRAC \nprocess until we are confident that the process will be done without \nmaking it a political football or without receiving an answer to \nseveral very fundamental questions, which I would like to go into.\n  No. 1, we need to certify what is meant by overcapacity. Everybody \nseems to agree that there is excess capacity in the structure of the \nmilitary. I think that is obvious. Senator Levin just went over that. \nBut if you ask different people where exactly that excess \ninfrastructure exists, a variety of answers will certainly be given. \nMany argue that there is a great disparity between the reduction of \nmilitary end-strength, down 36 percent--Senator McCain mentioned that. \nEvery proponent of the BRAC process and of this amendment will tell you \nthat the military end-strength is down 36 percent and reduction of \nmilitary base structure is down 21 percent. Now, there is a \nrelationship between these two. I know that. But there is no numerical \ncorrelation that would define what percentage of base closure we should \nstrive for. That is extremely important. If there were such a numerical \ncorrelation, closing any of our bases would help bring the percentage \nin line.\n\n  I think common sense tells us that it is a lot more complex than \nsimple percentages. If we all agree that excess capacity exists--and I \nthink we do--I think that the Department of Defense, before we approve \nsomething like this amendment, should develop a certified list defining \nthat excess capacity. What's wrong with that? I might add, I think we \nprobably have that list already prepared. Why not really delineate the \namount of excess and the priority of eliminating that excess and the \ndifficulty of restoring the capability if required by a military \noperation? Let me repeat that. Let us try to delineate the amount of \nexcess and the priority of eliminating that excess and, most important, \nthe difficulty of restoring the capability if required by a military \noperation.\n  Once you lose the base, once you lose that infrastructure, like \nHumpty-Dumpty, it is off the wall, gone; you can't regain it. It is not \nreasonable to agree to a BRAC if we don't fully understand the nature \nand location and the amount of the reported excess.\n  I have the same letter from Secretary Cohen and the letter \nillustrated on the minority side from the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nexpressing their support for a BRAC. Secretary Cohen, a good friend, a \nformer colleague, said this: ``With the expiration of the previous BRAC \nlegislation, the Department needs a process to close or realign excess \nmilitary installations. Even after four rounds of base closures, we \nhave eliminated only 21 percent''--here we go again--``of our U.S. base \nstructure while force structure will drop by 36 percent by fiscal year \n2003.''\n  Let me repeat again what I think is a fallacy. Secretary Cohen's \nletter--I know it is not his intent, but his letter suggests the direct \ncorrelation, again in percentage points, between base closures of 21 \npercent and force structure reductions of 36 percent. There is no \ndirect correlation between the reduction of troops and how many bases \nshould be cut. There is, of course, a connection, but to suggest there \nis some kind of a mathematical correlation is false. It is misleading. \nExactly how we could get into indiscriminate cutting of facilities--the \nassumption of such a simple-minded statement is that all bases are \nequal.\n  Senator Levin has just indicated that of 100 bases remaining, and \nthere is a need to reduce base structure by perhaps 15 percent, that \nany 15 bases would do the trick. Unfortunately, this is the exact \nargument--down 36 percent in troops but only 21 percent in bases--which \nwas made in behalf of this whole argument. It is the very reason we \nneed to understand which bases are in excess and which bases support \nthe strategy. If it is 15 percent and you cut 15 bases out of 100, if \nthat doesn't have anything to do with what kind of a base it is, what \nkind of force is there, or what the mission of the base is, I don't \nthink that correlation really makes any sense.\n  Let's talk about the type of facilities to be considered once the DOD \ndevelops a certified list of excess capacity, and then what specific \ntypes of facilities to be considered for closure should be provided. If \nthe Department of Defense demonstrates that certain types of facilities \ndo not represent excess capacity, it doesn't make any sense to include \nthem in the process. Why would we want to do that?\n  The effect of this action would shorten and focus the BRAC process. \nWe would have successful BRAC, we would eliminate a lot of the \nheadaches, pain and suffering, and the politics that the proponents of \nthis amendment always talk about. Just as important, it would let those \ncommunities with military facilities as neighbors know whether they \nneed to be concerned or not and prevent them from spending large sums \nof money to help save their bases. That is what happens.\n  As soon as this amendment is passed--I hope it does not; the \ncommittee did not pass it and the House of\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\nRepresentatives did not pass it--every community next to a base in \nAmerica will hire a consultant, spending large sums of money, and will \nend up in BRAC purgatory. It is not necessary. We could shorten the \nprocess and get this job done with a better process.\n  Let's talk about the criteria to be used for closure recommendations.\n  There needs to be a full discussion of the criteria used for the BRAC \nprocess. I have the old criteria here somewhere, but, obviously, this \nisn't the criteria that is going to be used. This is the former base \nrealignment and closure criteria. I thought the new criteria were going \nto be judged on the Bottom-Up Review and the QDR and the National \nDefense Panel. The National Defense Panel hasn't made a comment on \nwhere we are headed in terms of national defense strategy. We don't \nhave the criteria yet. I think we are putting the cart before the \nhorse.\n  So, at any rate, I think we need a full discussion of the criteria \nused for the BRAC process to ensure the results of the process are \nconsistent with the strategy, as I have indicated, of the Bottom-Up \nReview and the QDR. For example, it makes little sense to me to use the \nsame criteria of the last BRAC since we have substantially altered the \nmilitary since then and our strategy has been changed. That is why we \nare going through this. A critical analysis of the criteria and their \nweight in the process is required. We should not inadvertently cut meat \nfrom our capacity if fat exists somewhere else simply because the \ncriteria we used is flawed.\n  I want to talk about cost for just a moment. It seems to me, despite \nthe claims of, I think, $2.7 billion that the letter indicated that we \nare going to save--and I think Senators Levin, McCain, and others \nlisted $13.5 billion by the year 2001--I question that either in \nmagnitude or when those savings will be seen. The whole purpose of this \nprocess, as proposed by the authors of this amendment, is to save the \nprecious defense dollars.\n  Let me point out that we are supposed to be talking about national \nstrategy here. The committee did its best, but in terms of trying to \ndetermine how much we spend on defense in the post-cold-war period, we \nsaid, ``OK, you can have all the strategy you want, but don't spend \nmore than $250 billion.''\n  So it is budget driven and numbers driven, and the whole key argument \nin behalf of this is to save the precious defense dollars and use them \nfor procurement and modernization and quality of life. So you close the \nbases. You save the money. And, as the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nSecretary, and the proponents of the amendment said, we are going to \nimprove the quality of life, modernization, and procurement.\n  Well, I am not sure that those savings will be there. And, second, I \nwill tell you where the money will go. If we could earmark this money, \nmaybe put it in a lockbox and give the key to Senator Thurmond--I sure \ntrust him as to where the money should go--I might support this. But do \nyou know where the money is going to go? Peacekeeping missions. For \npeacekeeping missions since President Clinton took office: 1993, $2.441 \nbillion; 1994, $1.9 billion; 1995, $2.16 billion; 1996, $3.3 billion; \n1997, projected $3.27 billion. I am not sure that even accounts for \nBosnia.\n\n  We are talking about savings that are going to occur in the outyears. \nAnd, yet, we have been using the peacekeeping fund for modernization \nand readiness and quality of life? That is what has been happening. If \nwe could earmark these savings for all of the very good purposes that \nproponents of this amendment are talking about, it might be one thing. \nBut we are not.\n  So what will happen is that we will go through this whole process \nonly to find out that we are putting a lot of people into what I call \nBRAC purgatory only to find out that we don't have the separation by \nthe people who really do that right now between those bases that are \nneeded and not, and also the problem with cost savings only to find out \nthat it will be spent for peacekeeping.\n  I am not opposed to peacekeeping in every instance. But it seems to \nme in terms of our national strategy and in America's national \ninterest, I am not sure that that has been simply well spent.\n  I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator \nFeinstein of California, and I would like to say that I know that it is \nthe right thing to do in regard to base closures. Nobody in this \nSenate--nobody anywhere--is for saving excess infrastructure. That is \njust not a possible position, and we shouldn't do that.\n  I might add in closing, Mr. President, that I am one who is concerned \nabout some of my colleagues who with some degree of condescending \nunderstanding look at me and say, ``Well, now, you know, we all have \npolitics, and we all have the pain of politics.'' I know it is going to \nbe hard. This is not premised on any base in Kansas. This is based on a \nfirm belief that this may be the right thing to do. But we are going at \nit the wrong way, and it is very premature.\n  So for the reasons that I have listed--and I would only add that \nthere is no reason why we can't wait on the QDR, the review, and the \nNational Defense Panel, have the new criteria, certify the excess, \nearmark the savings, and, yes, then go ahead with some kind of a BRAC. \nThere is no reason why we can't do that. But it seems to me that we are \nrushing to judgment here, and I think it would be very \ncounterproductive. I think we should watch out for the law of \nunintended affects.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona and as agreed to by the Senator from Michigan and urge my \ncolleagues to take another look at this. Let's take a little time. \nLet's do this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to two of my staff members, Tom \nVecchiolla and Peggy Kline, during the pending consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, thank you.\n  First of all, I would like to commend the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking member, \nSenator Levin, for their tremendous efforts in bringing the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill to the floor. I certainly think they have \ntaken a great deal of initiative and leadership in putting this \nlegislation together. I appreciate their efforts in that regard.\n  I certainly want to associate myself with the remarks made by the \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, on the amendment that has been \noffered by our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. It is an \namendment that I certainly will oppose in proposing more rounds of \nmilitary base closures and realignment.\n  I am certain the committee rejected the call for new base closings, \nand the Senate should follow suit.\n  As we all know, the administration has asked for two more rounds of \nbase closings with the intent of realizing $2.8 billion per year in \nsavings from these new BRAC rounds. The administration further stated \nthat these estimated savings are to be used to meet the well-\nestablished requirements for $60 billion in procurement funding which \nis necessary to modernize our forces to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n  I have consistently asked the question as to exactly what has \nhappened to the savings in the past four BRAC rounds that started in \n1988. The Pentagon estimated the savings to occur from those four \nrounds to be in the area of $57 billion over the next 20 years with the \nannualized savings of upwards of $5.6 billion per year starting in the \nyear 2001. In its April 1995 report, the GAO estimated that such \nsavings projects their estimates at less than $17 billion over the next \n20 years, past the number that had been projected by the Department of \nDefense, with annual recurring savings possibly being in the area of \n$1.8 billion in the year 2001.\n\n  Mr. President, GAO conducted a further analysis and issued a \nfollowing report in April 1996. In this report GAO found that the total \namount of actual savings that may be estimated from the four previous \nBRAC rounds is uncertain, for a number of reasons, the primary of \nwhich, according to the\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\nGAO, is that the DOD accounting systems do not provide adequate \ninformation or isolate their impact from that of other DOD initiatives.\n  Despite the fact that the DOD has complied with legislative \nrequirements for submitting annual costs and savings estimates, the GAO \nfurther stated that the estimates' usefulness is limited because the \nestimates are not budget quality and that the inclusion of these \nestimates of reduced personnel costs by all of the services are not \nuniform and, further, the GAO determined that certain community \nassistance costs were excluded. In fact, in one example, GAO identified \nthe fact that DOD BRAC cost estimates included more than $781 million \nin economic assistance to local communities as well as other costs.\n  In December 1996, the Congressional Budget Office, in its report, \nstated that it was unable to confirm or accept DOD's estimates of cost \nsavings because the DOD is unable to report actual spending and savings \nfrom BRAC action.\n  So now we have the Pentagon, the GAO, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice with differing estimates on what has actually been saved and \nwhat is supposed to happen as a result of these four BRAC rounds since \n1988. There is no consensus on the numbers. That, indeed, in my \nopinion, is a significant problem, if we are to predicate future \nclosings on these savings and estimated savings for the future.\n  The fact is we are chasing an elusive infrastructure savings because \nthere is no straight-line corollary between the size of our forces and \nthe infrastructure required to meet two nearly simultaneous major \nregional conflicts. The Department of Defense has even admitted to the \nGAO investigators that they do not have accounting systems in place to \nisolate the impact of specific initiatives such as BRAC.\n  So, in fact, we have no comprehensive adjustment of the reduction of \nthe infrastructure that has occurred as a result of the four previous \nrounds of base closings and the impact on munitions as well as our \nforces. In fact, when these base closing rounds were first initiated, \none of the greatest concerns that I had was that they would \nunderestimate the cost of savings and overestimate the savings to \naccomplish the base closings.\n  Mr. President, the projections for national defense outlays decrease \n34 percent over the period from 1990 to the year 2002. We have all seen \nthe downward pressure in defense spending. In fact, we have seen a \nreduction of more than 40-percent in the defense budget since 1985. \nFuture years' defense plans call for a 40 percent increase in the \ndefense modernization budget within the confines of an overall defense \nbudget that essentially will remain flat over the next few years. But \nyet, we have seen a procurement budget that has plummeted from $54 \nbillion in 1990 to today's level of just over $42 billion.\n  It is interesting, because in the same time that we are seeing a \nreduction in procurement, we have had four previous rounds of base \nclosings. You might have thought that money would have been invested in \nthe procurement budget, but, in fact, the contrary has happened because \nagain the Department of Defense underestimated the cost that is \nrequired to close these bases and overestimated the savings.\n  As of May 1997, the DOD has invested $14 billion in base closings. \nThe total implementation costs of the four previous BRAC actions \nthrough 2001 are estimated at $23 billion. Through fiscal year 1996, \nthe DOD estimates that it may have saved through cost avoidance \napproximately $10 billion.\n  So, in simple terms, to date we have spent $14 billion to avoid costs \nof $10 billion. Yet, we are promised by the DOD that the savings is in \nthe outyear savings--savings that even DOD's own budget analysts say \nthey are not equipped to track.\n  The promise for the outyears has been a recurring theme for the \nPentagon over the last 4 years. How many times have each of us heard \nthat the fix for the procurement account is in the outyears? And each \nyear we see the administration's request for procurement steadily \ndecline. In fact, in each of these 4 years since the Pentagon completed \nthe Bottom-Up Review an investment in the procurement accounts has \nactually been postponed.\n  The procurement request for 1998 is $42 billion, whereas the fiscal \nyear 1995 program had projected reaching $54 billion by now. So we have \nnot seen the funding promised, and the DOD cannot show it to us in its \nown budgets, and the reasons are obvious. The funding has migrated \nelsewhere.\n  In its own Quadrennial Defense Review, the DOD said the $18 billion \nmeant for procurement under the 1995 plan has disappeared. The QDR \nreport tells us that the funding migrated to three places. First, it \nwent to unprogrammed operating expenses such as contingency operations \nlike Bosnia. The second place was unrealized savings from initiatives \nlike outsourcing or business process reengineering which failed to \nachieve the objectives and expectations, similar to the failure to \nachieve the levels of savings expected in the previous four BRAC \nrounds. And the third, of course, was new program demands.\n  The QDR stated national defense policy of shape-respond-prepare \nreinforces the fact that U.S. forces will conduct smaller scale \ncontingency operations for peacetime engagement. These operations \ninclude, according to the report, intervention, limited strike, no-fly \nzone enforcement, peace enforcement, peacekeeping, humanitarian \nassistance, and disaster relief. The QDR further projects that U.S. \ninvolvement in the smaller scale contingency operations will increase \nover the next 20 years.\n  So we can expect more and more peacekeeping operations, far beyond \nthe traditional missions of peacekeeping operations, that are going to \nrequire more robust military requirements. The QDR cites the obvious \nproblem that DOD has had with the constant migration of funds which \nwere planned for procurement ending up in operation and support \nactivities. This certainly has been the case in the last few years to \npay for operations like Bosnia and other areas where we have developed \npeacekeeping operations.\n  Since 1991, in over 39 separate contingency operations in Southwest \nAsia, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, et cetera, it is estimated that the \ntaxpayers will pay over $17 billion for these operations. And as I \nillustrate in this chart here today, I think we can get an example of \nthe multiple operations that the United States has been engaged in just \nin the decade of the 1990's. We know that in 1989 we spent less than \n$100 million in peacekeeping operations. In the decade of the 1990's \nalone we have spent the grand total of $17.2 billion and counting.\n  We all know the administration has underestimated the costs of our \nparticipation in the forces in Bosnia, not to mention the length of \ntime. It is estimated that we will spend upward of $6.8 to $7 billion \nuntil June 1998. My expectation is that we will have underestimated \nthose costs as well. But we have spent a total of $17.2 billion in \npeacekeeping operations. That is an exorbitant price that we are now \npaying for unbudgeted, for the most part, operations and missions \nelsewhere--unanticipated and in most cases unbudgeted. The cost for \nBosnia, as I said, has been over $7.2 billion, assuming we withdraw in \nJune 1998. The cost for these operations have quadrupled--quadrupled--\nsince 1991. The fact is the Department of Defense has been heavily \ntaxed to meet these deployments.\n  We know that of the $17.2 billion that will have been spent in \ncontingency operations through June 1998, about $8 billion of this \namount was reimbursed to the Department of Defense by Congress through \nsupplementals. The Department of Defense, however, has also told us \nthat $2.3 of the $17.2 billion total were service absorbed costs, \nfunding that was taken directly out of procurement and other accounts \nto pay for these operations.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that the remaining difference of almost $7 \nbillion was siphoned from procurement accounts as well as the \noperations and readiness accounts to pay for these contingency \noperations. We have asked the Department of Defense for these figures \nand they cannot provide them. As of 1997, we readily know that we were \nfacing over 2.5 billion dollars' worth of unfunded contingency \noperations and that required, as we know, a supplemental appropriation \nwhich we passed a couple of weeks ago. But we must ask the question, \nbecause it has been asked but it has not been answered, how many \nmodernization programs got impacted as procurement\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\ndollars were siphoned from the modernization programs by the DOD \ncomptroller to pay for these unprogrammed operations? It is obvious \nthat this is a persistent problem. We know that we can expect more of \nthe same. In fact, the QDR report that was issued by the \nadministration, as I said previously, expects that small scale \ncontingency operations will be high over the next 20 years, so that we \nliterally cannot anticipate the numerous unbudgeted operations in which \nthe United States will participate.\n  The State Department did a compilation in 1995 of the voluntary \ncontributions of the United States in 13 other countries to support \nU.N. peacekeeping operations. The United States provided for 54 percent \nof those costs--54 percent--11 other countries, NATO countries and \nAustralia, 45 percent, and Japan less than 1 percent.\n  So it is obvious and clearly apparent that the United States is \nassuming an enormous cost and burden for these peacekeeping operations. \nAnd as I also said earlier, these peacekeeping operations are not \nwithin the traditional operations as we have known them in the past \nwhere we are upholding and enforcing a cease-fire agreement that has \nbeen reached by two or more parties. These operations have gone beyond \nthat to peace enforcement where we are imposing a peace on recalcitrant \nparties. That requires more military expertise, weaponry, and \nrequirements on the part of our own military as we have seen not only \nin Somalia but, of course, as we have seen in Bosnia.\n\n  The point of all of this is that what we are seeing happening in the \nDefense Department's budget is that more and more of the funds are \nbeing drawn from operations and the readiness account, indeed, from \nmodernization, because even the administration has not been able to \nmeet its own procurements modernization goal of $60 billion. The fact \nis a $17 billion gap in the modernization goal because that money is \nbeing drawn away into these operations.\n  I believe that the pressure to come up with more base closing rounds \nis premised on the need to finance these operations; that we will see \nwhatever savings we can achieve from base closings will not be realized \nin the modernization accounts. The fact is we have no guidance from the \nadministration in terms of what the administration is apt to spend on \nbase closings because we know there are enormous up-front costs just in \nthe environmental cleanup arena alone, not to mention all the other \ncosts associated with base closings that require up-front expenditures. \nSo we do not have the costs nor the real savings realized in the \nfuture. And yet at the same time we are spending more and more of the \nDefense Department's immediate funds on these peacekeeping operations \nfor which we have not been able to precisely project what the costs \nwill be in the future.\n  These missions have quadrupled since 1991. We can expect more of the \nsame. And yet we do not have a comprehensive analysis of the impact of \nthe four previous rounds. They have not been completed. They have not \ncome through yet. And so the administration is now asking for two more \nrounds without even knowing what the previous rounds have exacted in \nterms of the impact on our forces, our mission, as well as our \ninfrastructure.\n  We know that once a base is closed, it is lost forever; it is \nirreplaceable, and yet we have had no thorough analysis done on what \nthe impact will be for the future. I believe that the pressure for more \nbase closing rounds from the administration is due to the fact that \nmore of these dollars are being siphoned away from modernization and \ninto peacekeeping operations. So we could have two more rounds, but we \ndo not know what the savings will be, we do not know whether or not it \nis going to go into modernization, and we do not know what the impact \nwill be on our forces as well as our mission.\n  I believe we are relying on a flawed approach to achieve the savings \nfrom infrastructure reductions that have yet to be realized, and we are \nfinding that the Defense Department is spending billions of dollars on \ncontingency operations which have little or no relevance to our vital \nnational interests, and yet we are willing to cut the heart out of our \nmilitary infrastructure within our sovereign borders without fully \nevaluating the impact to our national defense.\n  The fact is I believe that we are on a collision course with less \nthan expected savings from base closings and an increased number of \ncontingency operations that will result in a further degradation of our \nforce readiness and it will delay much needed procurement.\n  I realize that we are facing limited resources within the Defense \nDepartment's budget and within our own overall Federal budget, but we \nmust also be concerned for our troops and our resources, that they are \nnot overtaxed in support of these numerous contingency operations over \nwhich we obviously have had little control. We have to take a more \njudicious approach to the deployment of our forces in view of our \nconstrained resources as well as protecting our vital national \ninterests, not only for today but also for tomorrow.\n  So I ask the Senate to reject the amendment that has been offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona because I believe clearly that we have to \nbegin a thorough examination of what has already transpired before we \ntake any future actions that we will regret, and at the same time I \nhope that it will put some pressure on this administration to begin a \nthorough reexamination of the necessity of constantly deploying troops \nin areas that perhaps they should not be engaged.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman and ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee for their handling of this bill and for \ntheir help in bringing it to this particular position. I particularly \nwant to commend my friend, the ranking member, the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, for his advocacy of this particular amendment. I \nam pleased to join as a cosponsor with the Senator from Michigan and \nthe Senator from Arizona and others. But I recognize it is a very \ndifficult amendment for all concerned, as the Senator from Michigan so \neloquently explained a few minutes ago on this floor. I know his \nparticular State was more impacted in terms of strategic air base \nclosures.\n  My own State is more dependent on defense spending on a per capita \nbasis than any other State in the Union. Year after year more defense \ndollars, per capita, are spent in Virginia than in any other State. So \nthis is not a popular or easy issue in my own State. But I have tried \nto analyze the reasons why most of those who do oppose this particular \namendment are opposed. It seems to me, Members are opposing another \nBRAC round for three principal reasons: No. 1, unwillingness to endure \nthe pain of another closure round; No. 2, concerns about the accuracy \nof estimated savings; and, No. 3, concerns over the integrity of the \nprocess.\n  Regarding the pain of closures, I can only say that I see the choice \nas a simple one. We can either preserve jobs and facilities in our own \nStates or we can provide desperately needed funding to ensure that our \ntroops can fight and win in future wars, which, of course, is the \nreason that we have a national defense capability in the first place. \nBy virtually every expert estimate, early in the new century we will \nsimply be unable to fund a force necessary to support a very prudent \nand measured national military strategy.\n  During the cold war, our massive base infrastructure had substantial \nduplication built in because of enormous uncertainties about the scale \nand consequences of a strategic war with the Soviet Union. Much of that \nduplication we probably could have done without, but I would certainly \nconcede that military construction in Members' home States or districts \nhas undeniable appeal politically. But we no longer have the luxury of \nduplicating infrastructure just to keep the folks back home happy.\n  As many have noted, every dollar we keep spending on bases we don't \nreally need is a dollar we cannot spend on maintaining end strength, \nreplacing aging weapons systems, advancing our military technology to \nensure dominance of the future battlefield, and keeping quality of life \nat a level that will ensure strong recruiting and retention.\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\n  The second rationale for opposing a new BRAC round stems from the \nassertion that because we don't know exactly how much we saved from \nprevious BRAC rounds, that we should not go forward until we do. If we \naccept this rationale, however, we would never have another round of \nbase closures, which I suspect would be just fine with many who cite \nthis reason for opposing the effort. But if our net savings from \nanother BRAC round are significant, although indefinite, it seems to me \nwe ought to move forward now. Why should we postpone doing what we know \nwe are going to have to do anyway, just because our estimate of savings \nare imprecise, as long as we know they are significant?\n  The reality is that the long-term savings from the first four-base \nclosure rounds will exceed $5 billion a year when they are completed. \nIt just so happens the Secretary of Defense is still seeking \napproximately that much money to meet the modernization objectives that \nhe set forth in the Quadrennial Defense Review. New base closure \ncommissions, if they are courageous enough to close the bulk of the \nremaining excess bases, should add billions in additional savings. If \nMembers want to conduct more studies on exactly how much has been and \nwill be saved by BRAC rounds, that's fine, but let's not hold up this \nprocess for a study that we know will tell us that billions will be \nsaved.\n  The third reason Members are opposing a new BRAC round is their \nconcern about the integrity of the BRAC process in light of the attempt \nto privatize-in-place the work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force depots, \nor ALC's. To avoid any future ambiguities about this matter, a \nprovision here clarifies that privatization in place will be allowed \nonly if the BRAC explicitly permits this at a military installation.\n  None of these reasons for opposing another base closure round, in my \njudgment, is compelling. The responsible thing to do, I believe, for \nour Nation's security is to cut excess infrastructure as soon as \npossible. Waiting will only delay the inevitable and cost our military \nbillions in funds that are badly needed for maintaining force \nstructure, supporting training and day-to-day operations, and \nadequately funding modernization.\n  I urge my colleagues, in this case, to make the responsible choice, \nthe choice that the Secretary of Defense, that all of the service \nSecretaries, that all of the service chiefs and that all of the CINC's \nagree is the only responsible choice, and that is to begin another \nround of BRAC closures as soon as possible.\n\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 771 to Amendment No. 705\n\n     (Purpose: To require a report on the actual costs and savings \n attributable to previous base closure rounds and on the need, if any, \n                  for additional base closure rounds)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a second-degree \namendment to the amendment that has been offered by Senators McCain and \nLevin, an amendment that was just supported by my colleague and friend \nfrom Virginia. I do this with great respect for the views of those who \nhave offered the amendment on base closing. But I come to a different \nconclusion than they do on this subject, and represent that conclusion \nwith a second-degree amendment. When I conclude my remarks, I will send \nmy second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  I would tell my colleagues I offer the amendment on my behalf, on \nbehalf of Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Conrad, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Boxer, Senator Burns, Senator Landrieu, Senator \nRoberts, and Senator Ford.\n  I am offering this second-degree amendment to the amendment now \npending, which would authorize two additional rounds of base closures, \none in 1999 and the other in the year 2001.\n  For those unfamiliar with the issue of base closures, they should \nknow that we have established in this country previously, on several \noccasions--actually, through four rounds, but three of them really full \nrounds--something called the Defense Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission. And the Commission then begins to study what kind of \nmilitary installations do we have in this country, where are they, what \nis their capability, and how many of them might now be surplus and \nmight be closed in order to save money for the future. That is what the \nbase closure process was about.\n  I have supported the base closure process on those occasions. I have \nvoted for it and believed it was appropriate, as we downsized the \nmilitary after the cold war, that we also then needed to get rid of the \nsurplus in our facilities and save the money that we can save that is \nnecessary for other areas, such as training and readiness and weapons \nprograms and other priorities. So I have supported that in the past, \nbelieving that as you downsize force structure, you also are going to \nhave surplus military installations that must, in fact, be closed.\n  In the process of doing that, we have ordered the closures in the \nrounds of 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. That resulted in the decisions to \nclose 97 military installations in this country. The military is \nslightly over halfway through the process of closure of these 97 \ninstallations; slightly more than one-half of those bases have, in \nfact, been closed. In fact, the second base closure round is scheduled \nto finish this month, and those are the bases that the 1991 Base \nClosure Commission decided to close. The 1993 and 1995 closures, the \nthird round and the fourth round, they will be shut down completely--\nand they are in the process now--but they will be shut down completely \nperhaps in the year 2001. So we have been involved in the substantial \nshutdown of military facilities under the Base Closure Commission \nprocess, have done it now for a number of years--9 years this process \nhas been in effect--and now the proposal in this defense authorization \namendment is to say, let's have two additional rounds of base closures.\n  What is the problem with that and why do I offer an amendment? Let me \ndescribe my amendment first and then describe the problem. I say in my \namendment that the Secretary of Defense shall prepare and submit to \nCongress, to the defense committees of Congress, a report on the costs \nand the savings attributable to the base closure rounds before 1996, \nand on the need, if any, for additional base closure rounds. The rest \nof the second-degree amendment describes what we would like the \nSecretary to report to us on. The amendment also would prohibit the \nfunding of further base closure commissions until the Congress has \nreceived that report.\n\n  But I would like to go through a series of charts, to tell you why I \nthink there are significant questions that must be answered before this \nCongress should authorize one additional or two additional rounds of \nbase closures.\n  The General Accounting Office, the GAO, which is the congressional \naccounting watchdog agency, says that ``Congressional auditors can't \nverify the estimates of base closure savings''; the Department of \nDefense ``cannot provide information on actual savings'' from the \nprevious rounds; the DOD's savings estimates, according to the GAO, are \n``inconsistent . . . unreliable . . . incomplete.'' That is the GAO.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, says: ``The Congressional Budget Office was unable to confirm \nor assess the Department of Defense's estimates of costs and savings \nbecause the Defense Department is unable to report actual spending and \nsavings for BRAC actions''--in other words, the base closures.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also says:\n\n       CBO cannot evaluate the accuracy of DOD's estimates without \n     empirical data.\n       The DOD does not track . . . actual savings that have \n     accrued.\n\n  And on the specific subject of the McCain-Levin amendment, the \nCongressional Budget Office says this about additional rounds of base \nclosing:\n\n       The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round \n     of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out.\n\n  And then it says, and this is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand:\n\n       That consideration, however, should follow an interval \n     during which the Department of\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\n     Defense and independent analysts examine the actual impact of \n     the measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  Finally, CBO says:\n\n       Such a pause [or an interval] would allow the Department of \n     Defense to collect the data necessary to evaluate the \n     effectiveness of initiatives and to determine the actual \n     costs incurred and the actual savings achieved.\n\n  That is not me. It is not a conservative or liberal or Democrat or \nRepublican; that is the General Accounting Office, the GAO, the \ninvestigative watchdog, and the Congressional Budget Office, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, saying that after all of these \nrounds of base closures, they can't get information about what have the \ncosts and the savings been.\n  What has been the experience? What is the impact for the American \ntaxpayer on all of this? How much do you save when you close them down? \nAnd what have been the costs of closing them down?\n  The Congressional Budget Office says it would be a reasonable thing \nto do to have an interval to really evaluate what are you doing, what \nare you achieving, how much are you saving. That is why I think it \nmakes no sense for us in this authorization bill to proceed immediately \nnow, before nearly one-half of the bases that have been previously \nordered closed are closed, and say, ``Well, now, let's do two \nadditional rounds. We don't know what the costs and benefits are of the \nprevious rounds, we don't know what the savings to the taxpayers have \nbeen, we don't know what the costs have been, but let's order two more \nrounds.''\n  So I offer a second-degree amendment that says the Secretary of \nDefense shall prepare and submit to the congressional defense \ncommittees a report on the costs attributable to base closure rounds. \nLet's get a full accounting before we move for two additional base \nclosure rounds.\n  Let me respond to some of the other statements that have been made on \nthis issue. Proponents of more base closures suggest more closures are \nneeded to match the base infrastructure to our force structure. They \nsay as the force structure comes down, clearly we should be able to \nclose some bases, and that is true. But let's look at the figures.\n  According to Congressman Hefley, the chairman of the House National \nSecurity Committee's Subcommittee on Military Installation and \nFacilities, if you measure by plant replacement the value of bases in \nthe United States and around the world, base infrastructure has fallen \nby 27 percent, very close to the one-third or 33 percent reduction in \nforce structure. Other estimates of reduction in base structure are \neither not calculating the plant replacement value or they are \ncalculating values of only bases in the Continental United States, \nwhich ignores the 43 percent reduction in U.S. bases overseas.\n  In addition to that, the military's operational bases--that is, the \nbases that host the combat units--are already closing down in \nproportion to the defense drawdown. For example, when all the BRAC \nrounds are done, the Air Force will have closed 22 of 74 major air \nbases, 30 percent; the Navy will have closed 10 of 17 naval stations, \nnearly 60 percent, and 12 of 29 naval air stations, 40 percent; the \nArmy will have closed 10 major combat and training facilities, about \none-third of those Army bases. So with respect to the operational \nbases, there has already been an appropriate amount of base closing \ndone.\n  Proponents of the amendment to authorize two additional rounds of \nbase closings say we need more base closing rounds in order to be able \nto afford new weapons. We will achieve savings from base closings and, \ntherefore, be able to afford the new weapons programs. Let's examine \njust a bit what these arguments mean by asking what the savings from \nbase closures are or will be or have been with what sketchy information \nwe have.\n  There are various estimates of savings from the BRAC implementation \nperiod from 1988 to the year 2001. The Congressional Budget Office in \nDecember said they were not able to get very much information. They \nestimated, with what information they had, that we would save $5.3 \nbillion in that period, this despite four base closing rounds in \nclosures that began 9 years ago.\n  So, if this number is accurate, with sketchy information, yes, base \nclosures save some money but very slowly, and if future base closing \ncommissions decide to close bases in 2001, the savings would be \navailable, again, very slowly perhaps by the year 2010. And the savings \nhere are only estimates from sketchy information that both the GAO and \nthe Congressional Budget Office indicate is unreliable and incomplete. \nThey say the information on this is simply not available from the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The Government Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office \nalso say in closing military installations that the Department of \nDefense has not taken into account the full cost of environmental \ncleanup when a base is closed, the accurate proceeds from the sale of \nland in closing bases, the economic transition costs, especially those \nnot funded by the Department's base closing program, the higher costs \nof operation at bases that gain missions from the bases that are closed \nand higher construction costs at the bases that gain missions.\n\n  In summary, Mr. President, my amendment is important because it would \nrequire the Pentagon to report to Congress on what have been the actual \ncosts and savings in four base closing rounds over nearly a 10-year \nperiod. Until and unless we get information about what are the costs \nand benefits, I don't think we ought to legislate in the dark, and that \nis what we would be doing if we were to decide now to rush off and \nauthorize two additional rounds of base closures without knowing the \nimpact of, the costs of, or the benefits of the closures in the \nprevious four rounds.\n  I am pleased to offer the amendment with some very strong support \nfrom some very influential Members of the Senate. The majority leader, \nSenator Lott, is a cosponsor; the minority leader, Senator Daschle; the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nThurmond; and many others.\n  I think all of us feel the same way. There may be at some future date \na need to reconcile further base capacity with troop strength. We \nunderstand that, we have understood that through four rounds of base \nclosings. However, there will also be, and is now, a requirement that \nwe understand exactly what we are doing, what are the costs and what \nare the benefits, and this would not be the time to authorize \nadditional rounds of base closures prior to our having the information \navailable on what we have done in the past.\n  One final point. All of us perhaps have some parochial interests, and \nI would certainly understand if someone said, ``Well, but you have some \nmilitary installations in your State.'' Yes, we do, and I have \nsupported previous base closing rounds despite the fact that we have \nmilitary installations, and it would probably not be in my best \ninterest to do that, but I supported that because I understand we must \nreduce capacity in these installations.\n  But, I also understand that every time you go through a base closing \nround, there are additional costs imposed on nearly every community \nthat has a military installation that is not calculated anywhere on \nthese papers, and that is the cost of the economic investment that \ndoesn't happen and the stunted economic growth in a community because a \npotential investor says, ``That, community, I don't want to invest \nthere at the moment. I want to wait a couple years to see if that \nmilitary installation, that community is going to be there for the \nlong-term future. If not, that region is going to have 20 percent \nunemployment, and the last thing I want to do is lose my investment.''\n  So community after community after community has imposed on it a \nstunted cost of economic development whenever we begin this process.\n  I am not here today to say I will never support another BRAC round, \nbut this is the wrong time to initiate two additional rounds. If we \nlook in the future at what the overcapacity might be, if there is, in \nfact, an overcapacity, then we should respond to that. But I do not \nwant, in this circumstance, to authorize two rounds before we know the \nfull cost, the full value and the full benefit of previous base closure \nrounds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ford from the \nState of Kentucky be added as a cosponsor.\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin-McCain \namendment and in support of the Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment. Before I \nspeak on the substance, I want to, again, take note of the tremendous \nleadership we are receiving from the Armed Services Committee chairman, \nthe Senator from South Carolina, and the cooperation we are getting \nfrom the Senator from Michigan as they try to move this legislation \nthrough. They are doing an outstanding job. I know we will start a \nseries of votes later on this afternoon, and we continue to look \nforward to completing this very important legislation before the week \nis out.\n  Mr. President, I have followed these base closure recommendations, \nso-called BRAC issues, now for many years. I was in the House when it \nwas first proposed by a young Congressman from Texas, Dick Armey. I was \na member of the Rules Committee, and he came to me and asked about how \nto get this procedure to be considered, to get it through the Rules \nCommittee, to get it to the floor of the House of Representatives. I \nremember specifically telling him how the procedure would work, but \nassuring him from the beginning I would oppose it.\n  I have always been opposed to this approach. It is one more example \nof Congress not being able to deal with the tough issues of what we \nneed in terms of facilities in this country and passing the decisions \noff--the tough decisions off--to others, in this case the Commission. I \ndon't think that is the way it should be done, and that is not the way \nit was done until recent years.\n  In the past, the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, would make \nrecommendations to Congress. Congress, through the appropriate \ncommittees--Armed Services and the Appropriations Committee--would \nconsider those recommendations and, in some instances, base closures \nwere approved, including facilities in my own State and probably most \nStates in the Nation, and in others, it was rejected. But somehow over \nthe years, it became more and more difficult to close these bases or to \nmake decisions, to make changes in the bases, and so these so-called \nBRAC rounds gained some currency and were pushed and, in fact, passed \nthrough the Congress.\n  We have been down this old BRAC road before, three-and-a-half or four \ntimes, if you will. I maintain it has not worked well. First of all, we \nfound that it is a very difficult process. There is always concern \nabout the fairness of how it is done. There are always some \nimplications or indications that some political considerations came \ninto play, and there always will be. But also I think it is important \nthat we remember what it does to the communities and to the people who \nare involved.\n  These are just not nameless, faceless people. These are bases in \ncommunities, communities that are disrupted by these proceedings, \ncommunities and States spending millions of dollars trying to prove the \nworth of their bases. So we know that it has had an impact on the \ncommunities where these bases have existed.\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\n  We know it has created problems for the Defense Department among the \nvarious branches. We know that it is almost totally impossible to \nassess the real damages or the benefits or the savings from these \nclosings. We have seen this in instance after instance. For instance, \nwe have made decisions that certain bases would be closed and there \nwould be certain savings. Yet, we have found that it has been very \ndifficult to move toward closing those bases and getting the savings \nfor no other reason than we have found, in many instances, that there \nare environmental problems in cleaning up those bases before they can \nbe turned over to the private sector or the local communities.\n  To this day, the recommendations of previous BRAC's have not been \ncompleted. We have bases or facilities, depots that supposedly were \ngoing to be closed. They are not closed. So without having had an \nopportunity to really assess the damage that has been done to our \ncapabilities and our facilities for the military of this country, \nwithout having an opportunity to really get these bases closed and, \ntherefore, the savings achieved, we have now the recommendation that we \nhave not one but two more of these base closure rounds.\n  I think that it has been a very dubious process that has caused lots \nof problems, and it should not go forward again with two more rounds \nuntil we fully understand the ramifications and the implications of \nwhat we have already done.\n  So that is why I think that the Dorgan amendment is a better \napproach. It doesn't say that we will never have another base closure \nround, although I can't envision myself voting for one in the future \nanymore than I have in the past, but it does set up a legitimate, \nlogical process to assess what has already happened, what has been \nachieved in terms of savings as a result of those decisions, what it \nhas done to our capabilities militarily, before we go forward with \nanother round.\n  The amendment that has been offered by Senator Dorgan and others \nallows already authorized base closures and realignments to go forward, \nand that is important, I emphasize again, because what has already been \nagreed to has, in fact, not been completed. This would include the 97 \nbase closures and the 55 realignments that have already been agreed to.\n\n  Economic and fiscal ramifications of closing and realigning bases \nCongress has already authorized will stretch well into the 21st \ncentury. The Pentagon estimates on the savings cannot be supported. \nGAO, for instance, recently concluded that the ``Department of Defense \ncannot provide [accurate] information on actual savings.'' The \nCongressional Budget Office has stated that it ``was unable to confirm \nor assess DOD's estimates of cost and savings because the Department is \nunable to report actual spending and savings for [these] actions.'' As \na result of all these factors, CBO observed that additional base \nclosures ``should follow an interval during which DOD and independent \nanalysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken \n* * * ''\n  The Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment sets up a logical process to review \nwhat we have already done before we go forward with recommended rounds \nin the future. The last Base Closure Commission concurred in the \nassessment and stated that another round of base closures should not \noccur until the year 2001--not 1999, as proposed in the Levin-McCain \namendment. That is an important point. The last Base Closure Commission \nspecifically recommended that there not be another one until the year \n2001, if then, so that we could get our work done, see what happened, \nand then make an informed judgment about whether to go forward with it \nagain in the future.\n  This amendment provides the Pentagon with the time to develop \naccounting techniques so they can fully and accurately reflect the \ncosts and savings from previous and future rounds of base closures, and \nit requires the Pentagon to prepare a report on the financial \nramifications of past and future base closures and to have the report \nreviewed by GAO and CBO.\n  In short, Mr. President, this sets up a process to take a look at \nwhat we have already done, evaluate it, make sure we understand the \ncost savings or the costs that have been expended to try to achieve \nwhat has already been agreed to before we go forward, and then and only \nthen after that review should we make an informed decision about \nwhether or not to have another round.\n  I am going to hand out to my colleagues when we start having votes a \nlist that I had prepared of facilities and activities that were \nconsidered by the Base Closure Commissions in the years 1991 to 1994, \nbut not closed. There is a long list. And I just want to ask my \ncolleagues, whether they be from California or Connecticut or Georgia \nor Minnesota or my own State or any other State, take a look at what is \non this list.\n  Think of what you have already been through, and think of the impact \nit would have on the military if some of these facilities, which are \nvery fine facilities that are important for our training for the Air \nForce, for the Navy, if they should be threatened once again with being \nclosed. Do you want that? So I will have this list, and I invite my \ncolleagues from all over the United States to take a look at this list.\n  This should not be done. We should not be closing down needed \nfacilities and needed bases in the United States while we are sending \nour military men and women on humanitarian missions around the world. \nWe are looking after the needs and problems around the world. That is \nfine. But what about the impact and the needs in our own communities of \nour own constituencies and most importantly of the military itself?\n  I vigorously oppose the Levin-McCain amendment and I will go along \nwith the Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment because I think it is a better \nalternative and that it sets up a logical process to evaluate whether \nor not we should ever have another Base Closure Commission.\n\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague from \nMississippi in urging our colleagues to vote no on the McCain \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the entire process dealing with base closure is a \nprocess that Congress entered into with the administration, a joint \nprocess where we said we would work together, set up a commission, a \ncommission of experts, we call it BRAC, the Base Closing Commission, \nand they would make recommendations and send those to the President. \nThe President would either accept it or reject it. He could not modify \nit. If the President did not agree with those recommendations, he could \nsend it back to the Base Closing Commission and they could change it. \nBut he has two options: He accepts it or rejects it.\n  Same thing with Congress. Under the procedure that was set up--I \nmight mention, it worked quite well the first three rounds. The \nPresident took the recommendations; then he would forward those on to \nCongress, and then Congress accepted them. We could not amend it. We \ncould not say that it included a base from the Senator from Montana's \nhome State, the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, so \nwe will send that specific recommendation back, or maybe a \nrecommendation to close a base in the home State of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina or Mississippi, those are powerful Senators, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the majority leader \nrespectively.\n  We did not touch those. We did not set it up that way. We set it up \nso an independent commission of experts, appointed and I might mention \nconfirmed by the Senate, would work and work very hard. One of the \ntoughest jobs around was for this commission to travel to all the bases \non the so-called suspect list or the possibility list. They would visit \nthese bases, and then they would make their recommendations.\n  I might mention in the process, they would probably terrify the \nindividual communities and all the individuals associated with those \nbases. They would terrify them because they were afraid they might lose \ntheir job, they were afraid they might be on the final base closure \nlist, they were afraid they might lose a job they think is a pretty \ngood job--in all likelihood it is a good job, and they do not want to \nlose it.\n  So Congress had to--I don't know if it should be called collective \nwisdom,\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\nbut we said, ``Let's put it on this group, these real experts, a lot of \nretired military people, people that are going to spend the time and \nreally investigate and analyze which bases should be closed.'' We have \ntoo much base infrastructure, so we had to close them. So that was the \nprocess. And it worked quite well the first three rounds.\n  Then in the fourth round President Clinton changed it. We had the \nsame Base Closure Commission, a good commission. They made their \nrecommendations, sent it to the President, and said accept it or reject \nit. President Clinton did neither. He said: Well, we're going to accept \nall the recommendations except for two, except for ones in California \nand Texas. There are a lot of electoral votes. We have an election \ncoming up. So he did not accept the base closure recommendation.\n  He tried to modify it. He said: ``Well, we won't close two bases. \nWe'll privatize them and keep them in existence.'' That was not what \nthe Base Closure Commission had said. Congress did not have that \noption. We were not able to say, ``Wait a minute, we want to close all \nthese on the list except \nfor--'' We did not do that.\n  So the President, in my opinion, violated the law. And I think the \nlaw is very clear. Other people debated, ``Wait a minute. Does he have \nthe flexibility? Does the Base Closing Commission give him the option \nto privatize in place or is this something he created?'' I think it is \nsomething he created. That was not the intent of the Base Closing \nCommission.\n\n  Could he fudge? Could he interpret it that way? Well, he did. So far \nhe has gotten away with it. But that was not what the base closing law \ncalled for. That was not the intent of the Base Closing Commission. And \ncertainly the President circumvented the will of the BRAC, and of the \nbase closing process. I think he destroyed a lot of good will in the \nprocess.\n  A lot of people might have been willing to say, well, we might comply \nwith another round, but I will tell you, you cannot comply with another \nround if you think the executive branch might violate that trust or \npoliticize this process. And that is exactly what President Clinton \ndid.\n  I might even read for my colleagues an op-ed article from the \nWashington Post at that time, July 14, 1995. I will just read this part \nof it.\n\n       Over the past couple of weeks [President] Clinton has been \n     engaged in a highly publicized effort to ensure that many of \n     the jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento will be \n     privatized. That is rather disingenuous. If the privatization \n     is real, it will merely perpetuate the expensive overcapacity \n     that the base closing is supposed to reduce. If the private-\n     sector jobs rapidly fade away after another election or two, \n     the people who held them will rightly consider the whole \n     effort a sham.\n\n  What he had was an effort to win votes, and again violate the \nprocess. And so should we have another couple of base closing rounds? I \ndo not think so. No, not as long as there is not an understanding that \nwe are all going to be in this boat together, the President is going to \nabide by the law and Congress is going to abide by the law. The \nPresident certainly did circumvent the law in this case.\n  I will read to you a quote from a speech President Clinton made in \nTexas. He said:\n\n       On July 1st, you were dealt a serious blow when the \n     Independent Base Closing Commission said that we ought to \n     shut Kelly down. At my insistence and my refusal to go along \n     with that specific recommendation, the Air Force developed \n     the Privatization In Place Plan that will keep thousands of \n     jobs here at this depot.\n\n  That was made October 17, 1995.\n  President Clinton is exactly right, he refused to go along with the \nspecific recommendation of the Base Closing Commission. The point is, \nif he wanted to disavow the Base Closing Commission decision, he could \nhave sent it back to the Commission. He said, ``I will agree with all \nthese, but not these two.'' And that would have been the process to \nfollow; he could have sent it back to the Base Closing Commission.\n  Maybe they would have reconsidered; maybe they would not have. But he \ndid not do that. He said: I am going to accept and amend. And the law \ndid not give him that right. So he violated the process, and created a \nnew process, and one, in my opinion, where he undermined the \ncredibility that we have under this law that worked in the first three \nrounds and did not work in the fourth round. He politicized the \nprocess.\n  Should we just have another two rounds? I do not think so. I just \ncannot see that Congress would allow another round or another two \nrounds and terrorize all these communities if they think, and the \nindividual Members of Congress think, ``Well, wait a minute. Maybe \nwe're not going to do this on military value. Maybe we're going to do \nit on politics. Because politics entered the last round, maybe politics \nwill be in the next round.''\n  The President found a clever way of doing it. We do not have to close \nany base. We will just privatize in place. We do not have to lose any \njobs. He promised in California--there were 8,700 jobs the day the base \nclosures were announced, and he said, we will have 8,700 jobs in the \nyear 2001. We will have 5,000 jobs a few years later than that. We will \npromise you jobs forever. That is not privatization in place. That is \nelectoral politics.\n  And it is a real shame he introduced election politics into the base \nclosing process, some real violation of trust for every single Member \nthat had a base closed in any round--any round. If you were willing to \nsay, OK, we will put our bases at risk since we are all doing it \ntogether for the good of the country, for the good of national defense, \nI am willing to leave my rights alone as a Senator to participate in \nthis process for the good of national defense and the good of our \ncountry because we know we have to do it, we know we have to reduce \nexcess base capacity, if we are not going to play politics a lot of \npeople said they are willing to do that. Then President Clinton plays \npolitics.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the \nMcCain amendment. We should not have additional base closing rounds in \nthis Senator's opinion until and unless we comply and until or unless \nwe make absolutely, totally, completely, sure that politics will not be \ninvolved in any future round.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the Dorgan-Daschle \namendment. I think that is the logical step to take at this time. I \nwish to commend the majority leader, Senator Lott, the assistant \nmajority leader, Senator Nickles, for their excellent talks that they \nmade on this subject. I wish to commend all others who took that \nposition or the opposite position for participating in this debate. \nThis is a very important subject. I am very pleased that so many \nSenators have taken part in this debate, which is very helpful to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to make a long talk. We have had a lot \nof talk the other day. I expect to speak less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, and that of many of my colleagues, the \nSecretary of Defense has not made a sufficient case for additional base \nclosures. The one point that has been a common theme throughout the \ndebate on additional base closures rounds has been the extent of actual \novercapacity in the existing infrastructure. I am not satisfied that we \nhave accurate data on this matter and should not vote for any \nadditional rounds until we have an independent assessment of the \novercapacity.\n  As a second concern is that I believe that the desire for supposed \nsavings is becoming the sole driving force for additional base closure, \nwithout consideration of continuing requirements. The Department has \nnot identified the up-front cost of doing another closure round and I \nam worried that, based on experience, most of the claimed savings will \nnot materialize, or be used for modernization.\n  Mr. President, it is also important that the Congress understands on \nhow the Department plans to proceed with the next BRAC and whether it \nwill focus on facilities where excess capacity truly exists. I do not \nneed to remind my colleagues that we have had four rounds of base \nclosures, and that many of our communities have endured tremendous \nturmoil and great losses because of them. These communities were under \nthe impression that the closures they endured would resolve the \novercapacity problem. I recall the Department's claiming that BRAC 95\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\nwould be ``The Mother of all BRACs.'' In facts, this was a gross \noverstatement. I suggest that the Presidential campaign had a role in \nlimiting the scope of BRAC 95, and the communities and the Nation are \nnow bearing the consequences of that action.\n  Despite the stated good intentions of my colleagues, I oppose taking \naction at this time. We must have a better understanding of the excess \ncapacity, what the future military requirements will be and how the \nDepartment will pay for this expensive undertaking. Until we have that \ninformation, I urge the Senate to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just briefly, a few comments on the BRAC \namendment of Senator McCain, myself, Senator Robb and others.\n  First, on the cost question. The Defense Department has testified on \nthe savings. Their testimony is part of the record. The Under Secretary \nfor Defense, John Goodman, before the Readiness Subcommittee of the \nArmed Services Committee, testified that their estimate of net cost in \nsavings are as follows: 98 major installations closed through BRAC, \ncosts through 2001, when they would be fully implemented, $23 billion; \nsavings through 2001, in billions, $36.5 billion. That is a $13 billion \nsavings during that period, and then after 2001, recurring savings, \nevery year, because we had the courage to pass four BRAC rounds, of \n$5.6 billion.\n  Now, that is our modernization shortfall. That is why the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, every single one of them, plead with us, in a very \ndirect letter, plead with us to support the Secretary of Defense in his \nrequest for two more BRAC rounds.\n  Now, there is no use coming to this floor and talking about the need \nto modernize or to make sure we have the most advanced forces in the \nworld, the most ready forces in the world, with the highest moral in \nthe world, when we are not willing to take the steps that are necessary \nto make those things possible. We know we are not going to get \nincreases in the defense budget. We know we have a 5-year budget that \nwe have to live within.\n  So the question, then, is, are we going to keep excess baggage, \ninfrastructure, which the Defense Department says is no longer \nnecessary? It is a tough choice. I could not agree more with my friends \nfrom Oklahoma and Mississippi and others who have spoken about the \ndifficulty that communities go through. My communities in Michigan have \ngone through it and will again if we pass this BRAC round. Three Air \nForce base communities, all three SAC bases, gone. We know something \nabout that. We know about the pleas that we made to the BRAC commission \nand the Defense Department. We know about that. We know the urgencies \nof those pleas. But there is no alternative.\n  History has proven over and over again that if you are going to get \nrid of excess infrastructure--and we know we have excess, and the \nexperts are telling us that--it seems to me we have no reason to \ndisbelieve the Joint Chiefs when they tell us we have this major \nsurplus of capacity. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, says we have more excess capacity now than we did when \nwe started the BRAC process because we have reduced the size of our \nforce. Are we listening? When we get these kind of pleas from the \nuniformed military not to waste money on bases that they cannot afford \nto maintain, are we listening to them, or are we going to take an easy \nway out, which is to say give us a report.\n  We have a report: the Defense Department. That is the report. That \nchart is the report for the Defense Department. Now, can they prove \nthose figures so that they can be audited? No, these are estimates of \nthe Defense Department. That same Congressional Budget Office which \npoints out that the estimates cannot be confirmed with precision, also \nsays this, which is not reported. I didn't hear the opponents of this \namendment quote this part of the CBO report, although I may have missed \nit, in fairness to them. I didn't hear it. CBO believes that BRAC \nactions will result in significant long-term savings.\n  Now, we can delay it. They will be longer term. We heard the \nargument, ``Look how long it has taken for the environmental cleanup,'' \nand that is true. It will take longer if we don't close a base, to \nclean up that base environmentally, than if we do. We know that, by the \nway, historically. We have money to clean up bases we are closing where \nwe don't have money to clean up bases that are staying open. If we are \nworried about the speed with which a base is cleaned up, they are \ncleaned up more quickly, I say, ironically and sadly, when they are \nclosed than when they are kept open. That is a pretty sad comment, but \nthat is a fact. That is the reality.\n  So if we want to speed up the environmental cleanup, you don't keep a \nbase open to that purpose, and you surely don't delay closing bases \nwhich need to be closed if the environmental cleanup has taken too \nlong. It will take longer if you delay the closing. Delaying closing of \nneedless infrastructure does not speed up the environmental cleanup of \nthat infrastructure; it delays the environmental cleanup of that \ninfrastructure.\n  Now, we are talking here about a significant sum of money in this \ndefense budget. I want to just repeat these estimates: $5.6 billion is \nthe estimate. People say, ``Well, we don't have the dollars.'' Yes, we \ndo. Here is the report from the Defense Department. There is the chart \nfrom the Defense Department. These documents here are the basis of that \nreport. I am not so sure how many of us want to go through each one of \nthese to see if those figures add up to the $5.6 billion, but here they \nare. The savings are real. Even the CBO, which says they can't confirm \nthe precision, the accuracy of these estimates, says, again, CBO \nbelieves that BRAC actions will result in significant long-term \nsavings.\n\n  We just got a report from Secretary Cohen addressed to Senator \nThurmond, a letter that reads as follows: ``As the Senate moves to \nfinal consideration of its version of the FY 98 defense authorization \nbill, I urge you to support the McCain-Levin amendment authorizing BRAC \nrounds in 1999 and 2001.''\n  Now, he is giving the estimate of the two additional rounds in terms \nof the recurring savings. I am sure this is what the next sentence \nmeans, because we had this testimony, in effect.\n\n       We estimate two additional rounds would result in savings \n     of approximately $2.7 billion annually.\n\n  I know from previous testimony he is referring to the recurring \nsavings. That is a significant hunk of change, even in the defense \nbudget.\n  And then he says something we ought to listen to.\n\n       These savings are absolutely critical to the department's \n     modernization plan.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       There have been some questions regarding the savings \n     actually realized from previous base closures. We have taken \n     these questions seriously and asked the Department of Defense \n     Inspector General to take an independent look at this issue. \n     The Inspector General's preliminary results indicate that \n     there is no basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly \n     cost effective.\n\n  I am going to repeat that before I continue because that is sort of \nthe bottom line here.\n\n       The Inspector General's preliminary results indicate that \n     there is no basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly \n     cost effective.\n\n  And then Secretary Cohen goes on to say:\n\n       The preliminary audit examined BRAC 1993 actions, including \n     the largest Navy closure, Mare Island, and eight Air Force \n     Bases closed or realigned. For these bases, the IG found that \n     DOD overestimated costs by $148 million and underestimated \n     savings by $614 million.\n\n  The IG's report is attached to his letter. This report goes through \nsome of the reasons why they actually underestimated here the savings.\n  So, instead of, at least on this study by the IG, the bases actually \nsaving us less than predicted, the closing of those bases that were \nstudied by the IG turned out to save us more than was projected by a \nsignificant amount, and the reasons for it, again, were set forth in \nthe IG's report.\n  There is another argument that we have heard, and that argument is \nthat this action has been politicized. There will be arguments back and \nforth as to whether or not the privatization in place that occurred at \ntwo facilities was consistent or not with the Base Closing Commission. \nYou can argue that either way. Obviously, the State that is affected \npositively by the President's or the Defense Department's decision \nfeels it was perfectly within the\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nscope of the Base Closing Commission's report. The States which were \nnegatively affected, in their view, by that decision argue it was not \ncontemplated by the Base Closing Commission.\n  The Base Closing Commission report, however, says that these \nfacilities ``consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots \nor''--and that is the critical word for those who argue one side of \nthis issue, ``or''--``or to private-sector commercial activities as \ndetermined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.''\n  Well, the Defense Depot Maintenance Council determined those two \nactions should be taken so that they could be privatized in place. I \nthink that, at least, is reasonably, arguably, provided for by the Base \nClosing Commission report. It says ``or''--``to consolidate the \nremaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private-sector commercial \nactivities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council,'' as \nthe alternative to consolidating the remaining workloads to other DOD \ndepots.\n\n  Two options were laid out by the Base Closing Commission. The DOD \nfollowed one option. They privatized in place. But whichever side of \nthat argument one takes--and we have heard both arguments--that is no \nexcuse, even if one follows the view that that was politicized, that \nthey should not have been privatized in place. They should have gone to \nother DOD facilities, and that was a political decision.\n  If one accepts that argument and concludes that is right, what reason \nwould that be not to have future rounds of base closings? What we \nsimply would do, as we have done in this bill, is to make sure that \nthere will be no privatization in place in the future without the \nspecific recommendation of the Base Closing Commission, which is \ncreated in this amendment. Why would we want to cut off our nose to \nspite our face, even if one believes that it was politicized? Why would \nwe want to say we don't want to save $2 billion in the future because \nDOD or the President politicized the last round? We will cure the \nproblem and disallow privatization in place, unless it is explicitly \nprovided for by the Base Closing Commission--more explicit than the \nlanguage that I even read.\n  Now, our amendment does that. We are not going to cure the perceived \nproblem of this privatization in place action by denying future base \nclosings and denying savings of $2.3 billion a year, which Secretary \nCohen says is the estimated savings from the next two rounds of base \nclosures. We are not going to cure that problem. We are going to make \nour problem worse, not better.\n  Now, we can address that problem, and some may want to do that with \namendments on this floor. If they wish, they are free to try to offer \namendments to reverse that decision. My own view is that we ought to \nmake sure that that action is competitive and is certified by the \ninspector general of the Department of Defense as being a fair and open \ncompetition as between the various alternatives that are sought here.\n  Let the marketplace decide--that is my view--in a fair and open \ncompetition. But there have been some proposals that maybe there ought \nto be amendments to cure what is perceived to be that political \nproblem. That at least addresses the problem. Denying future rounds of \nbase closings, which will deny us savings of billions of dollars, \ndoesn't cure the perceived inequity or unfairness that resulted, many \nfeel, from the privatization in place decision of the Defense \nDepartment. We are not curing the problem. We are just denying \nourselves savings.\n  So there is not a logical connection between those two actions. Now, \nI understand. If I were representing one of those three States, I know \nI would feel the same way they do. At least I think I would. I can \nunderstand that. We all represent States and feel passion for the \nStates we represent. We all represent our States as advocates. We \nbelieve in them and we believe they ought to get a fair shake. When we \ndon't think they got a fair shake, we are on the Senate floor pleading \nfor our State. So I understand.\n  As I said, I understand the pain of base closing. We have been \nthrough it, and we might face more. But I also understand what the \nJoint Chiefs are telling us when they say we have excess, surplus \nbaggage, that the infrastructure exceeds the number of personnel that \nwe now have. ``The tail is too big for the tooth,'' as they say in the \nmilitary. We have to slim down. When General Shalikashvili, who is a \ndistinguished soldier, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, says we have more \nsurplus capacity now than we did when the BRAC closing process began, \nwe should listen.\n  We are listening. We have offered this amendment to give us a chance \nto proceed to shed the excess weight that Secretary Cohen has asked us \nto shed, to save the billions that we need and cannot afford to waste \nif we are going to fully protect and defend the security of this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Michigan for a very lucid and, I \nthink, fact-filled discussion of this issue, which I believe has become \nmore Orwellian in nature, if I might characterize it as that.\n  We are now debating whether closing a base will save money or not. If \nthat were not the case, Mr. President, we made a terrible mistake at \nthe end of World War II. We should have kept all the bases open that we \nbuilt all over America during World War II and should not have closed \nany of them. I am, frankly, astonished.\n  Now, I think there have been valid arguments made over the process. \nThere have been arguments made as to whether the process was \npoliticized in the last round of BRAC. I think that there have been \nsome valid points here. But, Mr. President, anyone in the world, I \nthink, can understand that if you have to reduce a business, a \ncorporation, or whatever it is, because the in-flow of money has been \nreduced, then you have to close a number of facilities because you \ndon't have the business.\n\n  Mr. President, the military, in many ways, is a business. They are \nassigned a mission. They receive money to carry out that mission, and \nthey build the facilities and equipment and hire the men and women to \ncarry out that mission. Then, as that mission is reduced and the amount \nof money to support that mission is reduced, you shrink the size of the \nsupport establishment.\n  It is not really very complicated. To make an argument that a base \nclosing does not save money over time, really, to me, defies all logic. \nYes, there have been costs associated with base closings that were not \nanticipated. I will certainly agree with that. A lot of it had to do \nwith environmental cleanup. But the fact is, Mr. President, that those \ncosts would have been incurred anyway and probably would have been \nhigher as years went by and the pollution and the environmental \npoisoning would have become greater. So to somehow say that because we \nhad to clean up bases that were closing does not justify the bases \nbeing closed, that ignores the fact that sooner or later the \nenvironmental cleanup would have had to take place.\n  Now, Mr. President, if you have three bases and you only need two, \nthen you need to keep paying the electric bill at the third base, keep \nthe runways paved and the housing up and the grass cut. All of those \nare costs that are associated with excess inventory. So when you don't \nhave the requirement for that inventory because the mission has been \nreduced--the funding in this case--then you reduce the support \nestablishment. I don't know how it could be much less complex than \nthat.\n  When we talk about CBO estimates, DOD savings estimates are \ninconsistent, unreliable, and incomplete, maybe they are. Maybe they \nare all those things. But you can't deny the fundamental fact that \nunless you believe we are going to increase defense spending, we have \nto have a better match-up between the support establishment and the \noperating forces, and that because our reduction in overall funding and \nour failure to implement the reductions in the support establishment is \nnot matched up, we therefore are losing in this ``tooth to tail'' \nratio, which the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb, has talked about \non occasion.\n  One of the opponents of this amendment said that Congress should be \ndoing this. I totally agree that Congress should be making these \ndecisions. It is a lack of courage on the part of Congress that we have \nto turn to a\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\ncommission. But, Mr. President, it is perfectly clear that for 17 years \nnot a base was closed, even though there was a requirement, in the view \nof one and all, to do so. It was because Congress didn't have the \npolitical will to do it. That is why we resorted to the Base Closing \nCommission.\n  Now, if I had the confidence that Congress would act in a responsible \nfashion and we would close bases as necessary, then I would not support \nthe commission. But the record is perfectly clear that, for all those \nyears, we were unable to close a base because Congress was politically \nparalyzed, so we had to give the responsibility and the blame to a Base \nClosing Commission.\n  The Senator from Michigan has already referred to the letter of the \nSecretary of Defense. I am told that a letter from the President is \ncoming over. The inspector general of DOD found that, in some cases, \nthey overestimated cost by $148 million, and they underestimated \nsavings by $614 million. The inspector general is a well-respected \nindividual, and her memorandum, which is contained in the cover letter \nby Secretary Cohen, I think is abundantly clear.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't like to drag out this debate too long. I think \nthat some arguments have been made that I think are important to be \nmade by the opponents of this amendment. I want to make it clear that \nif the Dorgan second-degree amendment is not tabled, the Senator from \nMichigan and I intend to have a vote on our amendment up or down. So we \nwill raise that amendment again until there is a final adjudication by \nthis body on the McCain-Levin amendment. I hope that the Dorgan second-\ndegree amendment is tabled and we can have an up-or-down vote on the \nother.\n  The Senator from Michigan pointed out and showed the stacks of \ninformation that have been sent over to the Senate. The Senator from \nMichigan and others have pointed out the abundance of information that \nhas been sent over by the Department of Defense and the forms and \nreports as to how much money has been saved and where and under what \ncircumstances. Yes, we underestimated the environmental cleanup costs, \nbut we have underestimated the environmental cleanup costs in every \ntoxic waste site in America, not just on military bases. Those toxic \nwaste sites are not going to go away just because the base remains \nopen. Sooner or later, that problem is going to have to be addressed. \nSo I hope that we will act in agreement.\n  One other thing. The letter from the chiefs of the services that came \nover, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--many of the \nallegations I have heard quite often are that members of the military \nare empire builders, they never want to give up a base or a weapons \nsystem, and they never met a weapon system they didn't love. These \nindividuals are calling for these tough decisions to be made because \nthey know what will happen if we don't close these bases. It will not \nfree up the money, which is absolutely vital, in their view, to \nmodernizing the force and retaining the men and women we need in the \nAll Volunteer Force, to provide sufficient funds for training and \noperations in order to keep our military the best in the world, because \nyou can't siphon off all this money into support functions and expect \nus then to have enough money left over to carry out the operations that \nare necessary.\n  So, Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will move to table the \nDorgan second-degree amendment. I hope we can dispense with this issue \nas soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to talk \nabout this process. I have to say that having gone through the three \nBRAC processes we have had in the past, having traveled from city to \ncity to make the cases that we made, having fought very hard to try and \nmake sure the process was honest and decent, having lived through it, \nwhere the defense depot in Ogden was shut down--we felt, for very poor \nreasons. The only reason was that it was more interior, it seems to me, \nthan the bases on the various coasts. But it seems to me that that was \none of its great advantages. It would be much more difficult to attack \nif we got into difficulty.\n  But we lived with that. We lived with the shutdown of the Tooele Army \nBase, which literally had the greatest heavy-duty vehicle repair \nfacility in the world, just completed at a cost of almost $200 million \nto the taxpayers. And they shut down. Now they wish they had not \nbecause they now don't have the facilities or quite the same capability \nto take care of Army heavy-duty vehicles. It was a stupid thing to do. \nBut that is what they did, in spite of the fact that Utahans have the \nchemical weapons destruction facility there. And we put up with all of \nthe hazardous problems of storing chemical weapons in Utah and even \ntransporting them around with various aspects in and out of Utah and \nwith the chemical weapons demilling that we do there.\n  Utahans have always been very patriotic. They have supported the \nmilitary as much, if not more so, than any other State in the Union, \nand I think the attitude is still that way in spite of some of these \nglaring inequities that have occurred. We lived with those. We can \naccept them.\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Arizona. We should shut \ndown bases that do not deserve to compete, or really aren't \ncompetitive, or really are dealing with old, worn-out, less modernized \nfacilities and also equipment, and work done on various less modernized \npieces of equipment. But what we are getting very upset about lately is \nthat we went all through this BRAC process, and we worked our tails off \ntrying to make a case for the Hill Air Force Base and Ogden Air \nLogistics Command. We did. It came out No. 1 without question. It was \nthe best Air Logistics Command in all of the Air Force--in all of the \nmilitary. The work force was one of the best in the history of the \ncountry. And we won. So did Tinker Air Force Base. So did Warner \nRobins.\n  Mr. President, they won because they were more competitive. These \nthree bases won because they could do a better job. They won because \nthey literally made sense as far as keeping our Air Force modernized \nand working well with the best equipment possible. Three work forces \nappeared to be the best, and certainly Hill was No. 1. Since that has \nhappened, Hill has gone down to about a 54 or 55 percent utilization of \ncapacity.\n  I have to say this. With that low utilization of capacity, which \nshould be up around 85 percent had the transition work been given to \nHill, and which we hope will be given to Hill, if we could get it up \nover 70 percent of capacity, as high as 85 percent of capacity, Hill \nAir Force Base would be so competitive that nobody could compete with \nthem in the world today. But at 54 or 55 percent, it means that the \ncosts are much higher than literally they would be if we were utilizing \nthe capacity in a fair and decent manner.\n  I have to say that we have had many Air Force people tell us they \ndon't want to ever see Hill hurt because it is the best Air Logistics \nCommand in the armed services today. But their hands are somewhat tied \nby the administration that is playing politics with the BRAC process.\n  The administration has indicated because there are two Presidential \nStates involved that even though the full BRAC process said that \nMcClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento had to be shut down and that \nKelly Air Force Base in San Antonio had to be shut down, the \nadministration has indicated they don't want them shut down. As a \nmatter of fact, they are now talking about privatization in place. It \nis nice to talk about that if all things were equal--if literally good \nbusiness principles were practiced; if literally there was not any \nstacking of the deck in either case; if literally the regulations that \nwould be written would be fair. Maybe there could be an argument for \nthat.\n  But the only argument that should be made for privatization in place \nis after the consolidation of the three Air Logistic Commands that won \nthe competition. Once they are consolidated, then I have no problem \nwith trying to place some privatization and have private companies bid \non some of the work.\n  Keep in mind that one reason why we don't go straight to \nprivatization is because during time of war, we want to be able, above \nall things, to be functional, and we don't want to have to\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nworry about whether prices are going to be jacked up by private \ncompanies, or whether or not we have the capacity to take care of the \nneeds of our fighting men and women overseas, or for any other number \nof reasons.\n  Mr. President, the President's politicization of the BRAC95 process \nhas become a common theme on this floor. I admire the willingness of so \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to explicitly state \nthat privatization-in-place was not intended by BRAC, and that this \ndeliberate evasion of the BRAC recommendations can only portend defeat \nfor those seeking future BRAC rounds.\n\n\n           utah does not deserve to lose three bracs in a row\n\n  My State, Utah, does not deserve to lose in three successive BRAC \nrounds. We lost 5,000 jobs from the closure of two installations, the \nTooele Army Depot in BRAC91 and the Defense Depot at Ogden in BRAC93. \nBut Hill Air Force Base, and the Ogden Air Logistics Center, is a \ndifferent case.\n  Hill is the best of the best among maintenance depots, rated as a \ntier I installation. That means the highest military value. By \ncontrast, Kelly and McClellan were rated tier III--meaning the lowest \nmilitary value. To privatize at the worst depots is to demean the \nmerits of the Air Force and BRAC decisions to preserve the best, and \nthe best is the work force at Hill.\n  I can make the case that BRAC91 was wrong. The Army put $250 million \ninto the finest consolidated maintenance depot for wheeled combat \nvehicles in the world. A couple of years later, it shut it down and \nmoved the work to the Red River Army Depot at Texarkana. Then what do \nyou think happened? Red River was designated for closure! But it gets \nworse--DOD virtually abandoned Tooele until the Tooele County \nCommission, to its everlasting credit, aggressively beat the bushes for \nusers, successfully bringing Detroit Diesel onto the former base.\n  The point is that Utahns can and do turn bad situations into \nsuccesses. We can deal with adversity, but we do not have to deal with \nthe type of unfairness and outrageous discrimination that is being \ndealt to my State by the President.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Hill met the best of the BRAC95 \nparameters, which included military value and return on investment.\n  Utah is a terrific investment for the Air Force and the Nation:\n  DOD is mindful of Utah's value for the same reasons that domestic and \nforeign businesses flock to the State. And they certainly don't come \nbecause of our political clout alone--after all, we have only five \nelectoral votes.\n  Utah's attraction lies with its people, its business climate, its \nyouthful and well-educated work force.\n  The State has the highest educational level in the United States, \naccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  Money Magazine and Business Week, among other sources, repeatedly \ncite it as the best place to do business, the best place to live, and \nthe so-called Software Valley of the World.\n  And its workforce is the youngest in the country and teeming with \nskilled college graduates who work. Ask any business in Utah about the \nUtah work ethic; in fact, ask the BRAC commissioners! Ask the Air \nForce!\n  In a few words: Utahns are the real return on investment, and it is \nwhy the Air Force and BRAC have heavily endorsed the retention of Hill.\n  Utah's military value is unmatched. The BRAC commissioners didn't \nmiss a thing in assessing Hill's military value. It hosts the gateway \nto the Nation's largest exercise site, the Utah Test & Training Range, \ncovering 2,675 square miles. This is the only range in the world on \nwhich every active Air Force aircraft can exercise--keep that point in \nmind. If Hill is not properly used, or if the President's privatization \ndeception causes an underutilized Hill to suffer in a future BRAC \nround, I will tell you now that this range will not longer be available \nto DOD. It is just that simple. People in Utah are going to turn \nagainst them.\n  Even though we have been the most patriotic State, or equal to any \nother patriotic State in the Union.\n  I will not allow the citizens of my State to become a DOD trash can--\ndumping bombs on our fragile terrain, using our remote regions for \ndeveloping chemical defenses or demilitarizing dangerous chemical \nmunitions, for example. We tolerate as day-to-day sacrifices certain \nactivities that we see other States revolting against.\n  We want Hill's military value appreciated and developed precisely the \nway that BRAC intended, and that means consolidating core workload at \nHill. We want this work at the best depot. Like most other Americans, \nwe do not want privatization of the workload at the site of the worst \ndepot. We want the ICBM depot at Hill to flourish, the F-16 \nlogistics management program, and the C-130 depot programs to be \nexpanded as intended. We deserve--because we have earned--the F-22 and \nJoint Strike Fighter depot programs over the next decade.\n\n  Hill does not work well at the current 50-percent capacity usage \nlevel, nor at the 66-percent level which it would have in the outyears \nif privatization in place occurs. We work best when we are at full \ncapacity, and that is why BRAC directed a consolidation package that \nwould put Hill at 86-percent utilization in the year 2001. It was done, \nto repeat myself, because Hill is the best of the best.\n\n\n                hill reflects the utah ``can-do'' spirit\n\n  Mr. President, Utah is a State populated initially by pioneers who \nlived and overcame adversity--even in the face of outrageous unfairness \nand persecution. Today, the Old Mormon Trail is alive with men and \nwomen of all ages, and of all faiths, who are re-re-creating that \nspirit as they trek toward Utah.\n  We overcame the unfairness of Tooele Army Depot loss, as I mentioned.\n  Despite our remote location, we are a literate, sophisticated State \nwith 17 percent of the Utah adult speaking a foreign language, most \nfluently.\n  Our small State with just over 1 million persons in the work force, \nhas over 1,800 information technology and computer software companies.\n  Our unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, while our job creation rate is \ntwice that of the United States at 7.3 percent.\n  And, we are the fifth fastest growing State.\n  Mr. President, I could go on--but my point has been made, I believe. \nIt is that, like many other Members of both the House and Senate, we \ndemand fairness. When we appoint an independent commission, we expect \nits recommendations to be honored by a Chief Executive who is President \nof all the people, not just those with the greatest number of potential \nvotes.\n\n\n                         privatization in place\n\n  Mr. President, the Base Realignment Commission--BRAC--issue that \naffects us most deeply is the evasion of the BRAC recommendation to \nconsolidate workload at a public depot or at a commercial private \nsector facility. This BRAC recommendation has been distorted by the \nClinton administration to allow what has now become known as \nprivatization in place.\n  In the next few minutes, I will present eight reasons why \nprivatization in place will not work. It is not economically feasible, \nand it is inherently unfair to the public depot competitor:\n  First, it will worsen already deteriorated efficiency in the depot \nsystem;\n  Second, GAO has identified current wasteful depot practices that beg \nreform, something that privatization in place can't provide;\n  Third, past depot reforms have not succeeded;\n  Fourth, the problem of excess capacity is not solved;\n  Fifth, it will not produce promised cost savings;\n  Sixth, the best depots are being sacrificed on a shaky political \nalter;\n  Seventh, the case for privatization in place has yet to be made; and\n  Eighth, the privatization-in-place competition lacks the elements of \nfairness expected in Government solicitations.\n\n\n  privatization-in-place will compound identified depot inefficiencies\n\n  Mr. President, the Depot Caucus is an informal group of Members of \nCongress with strong interests in averting the problems of depot waste \nand inefficiency. Our goal is to ensure the availability of high-\nreadiness equipment to our Armed Forces.\n  Depot operations are part of service logistics, which is probably the \nmost difficult of all military specialties.\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nEven some of history's top military strategists, Napoleon and von \nClausewitz, to name two of the greatest, failed to insert military \nlogistics into their battle plans and strategies. Yet, military \nlogistics has long been one of the great strengths of our military \nservices. It has also been an undeniable cause of our success on the \nbattlefield.\n\n  My point here is that we cannot afford the inefficiencies and waste \nthat privatization in place will bring to an already cumbersome depot \nsystem in DOD.\n\n\n        gao has found depot operations wasteful and inefficient\n\n  GAO has identified $2.5 billion of losses over 4 years directly \nrelated to an Air Force depot system that is already encumbered with 40 \npercent excess capacity. In its May 1997 report on defense depot \noperations, the GAO said ``DOD consistently experienced losses [in \ndepot operations] * * *, and has had to request additional funding to \nsupport their operations.''\n  Why do I raise this specific point? Because depot operations are \nexpected to at least break even. That has always been one of the Air \nForce depot system's ever-elusive goals. But, instead, the system will \nsustain operating losses for fiscal year 1997, which the Air Force \nestimates at $1.7 billion. This exceeds even the GAO forecasted losses.\n  Let me add that operating losses is an auditor's term of art. GAO's \nmandate is to audit organizational and operational procedures to \nevaluate efficiency and effectiveness, predictors of program quality.\n\n\n     depot financial management reforms have helped only marginally\n\n  This is not to say that DOD hasn't been working the problem; it's \njust not getting any better. Let me give you an example.\n  In 1995, DOD streamlined the financial management of its depot \noperations by devolving control over depot financing from the office of \nthe Secretary of Defense to the military services. This reform shifted \naccountability for the Defense Business Operating Fund [DBOF], placing \nit at the service level. I share GAO's demand for better \naccountability. But the problems plaguing DBOF just followed the so-\ncalled reforms.\n  First, the Air Force, not unlike the Navy, advance billed its \ncustomers, which are the military units sending equipment to the depots \nand which pay for the services of the depots. The advance billing came \nto $2.9 billion, which was to ensure that sufficient cash balances were \navailable to pay for the goods, services, and other stock items \nrequired by the depots to service the assets. Still, the Air Force will \noperate this year at the $1.7 billion deficit that I mentioned earlier.\n  The second point regarding this reform is that there is simply too \nlittle demand for depot service. It's a classic supply-demand problem \nthat every undergraduate encounters in textbooks. I suggest to my \ncolleagues that if they owned a chain of auto repair facilities--let's \nsay 5--and there was significant excess capacity, the logical thing \nwould be to close two garages and consolidate the work in the remaining \nthree. Unlike a lot of what the Air Force does, this is not rocket \nscience.\n  But, I can't place too much blame on the Air Force. They have four \nbig problems, the last of which is beyond their control:\n  First, they're faced with 40 percent overcapacity;\n  Second, they have a resulting $1.7 billion deficit this year;\n  Third, there are gross inefficiencies and distortions that always \naccrue to business planning when you have to advance bill your \ncustomers; and\n  Fourth, they now have some members of their board of directors, \nincluding Congress, telling them to throw caution to the wind and \nsustain these inefficiencies anyway!\n  Many Members of this body have run businesses. Is there anyone here \nwho could keep afloat under these conditions?\n  My last point on current inefficiencies is that these problems were \nnot unknown before we compiled the Defense depot provisions in the bill \nbefore us today.\n  You'll recall that during the BRAC process we used a sophisticated \nanalytical modeling technique called COBRA [Cost of Base Realignment \nActivities]. The parameters and formulas applied by the COBRA model \nlong ago uncovered the same problems. Academicians say that a model's \nstrength is related to its ability to predict and explain. The accuracy \nwith which BRAC uncovered, explained, and predicted the problems that \nwe are discussing today suggests COBRA's efficacy. Perhaps some other \nagencies of government ought to try it.\n\n\n                     the problem of excess capacity\n\n  Mr. President, the GAO testified before the Senate Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee hearing last month. In his testimony before \nthat panel, the Assistant Comptroller General made the following \nobservation on excess capacity. DOD's 40 percent excess capacity, he \nsaid, ``is a significant contribution toward inefficiency and high cost \nof DOD's maintenance program and in generating significant losses in \nthe depot maintenance activity group of the services' working capital \nfunds.'' This was in further reference to the annual $1.7 billion \nannual Air Force depot system loss referred to earlier.\n\n  Still more importantly, the GAO testimony continued--and I want to \nemphasize the following remarks:\n\n       The Air Force's plans for implementing BRAC recommendations \n     will do little to reduce excess capacity and will likely \n     result in increased depot maintenance prices.\n\n  Here, of course, the GAO witness was referring to Air Force proposals \nto implement privatization in place to avoid the BRAC recommendation \nfor the consolidation of workload to depots or other commercial private \nactivities. In the case of San Antonio and Sacramento, this expressly \nexcludes privatization in place as an alternative to closure.\n  Mr. President, as a customer of the depot system, you don't have real \nmarket choice if you cannot utilize alternatives to suppliers who lock \nyou into higher prices. My point is that depots are forced to be \ninefficient, both as competitors as well as business operators, where \nwe deny them the opportunity to rid themselves of excess capacity to \nbring down costs.\n  The problem of waste gets worse. GAO found a $689 million loss from \ncontinued excess capacity related to the DOD privatization in place \nplan. If you multiply this amount over 6 years, which is the statutory \nperiod for the phase-out of BRAC closures, the loss to the taxpayers is \na staggering $4.1 billion. Imagine what it would be if an 8-year \ncontract, as proposed in the McClellan competition, were to be awarded!\n  Again, I plead with my colleagues who have been in business to stop \nand think about this--could you keep your customers if you just kept \nraising prices, while requiring them to disperse badly needed operating \nfunds to pay for services in advance?\n  It may be great theater, but it's a lousy business practice. And it \nis even worse as public policy. We are gouging the taxpayers to \nsubsidize such outrageous waste. We need to put a stop to it by \npreventing privatization in place.\n\n\n          privatization in place does not produce cost savings\n\n  Mr. President, GAO has also criticized the overly optimistic \nassumptions about cost savings that were anticipated from privatization \nin place where it had been authorized. I repeat: where authorized, to \ndistinguish from the plain language of the BRAC recommendation \nregarding Sacramento and San Antonio, which stated ``consolidation . . \n. to commercial private sector activities,'' which in no way allows the \ninference of privatization in place. Privatization in place was not \nintended. This is a point clearly made by the ranking minority member \nof the Readiness Subcommittee and junior Senator from Virginia on this \nfloor last Thursday evening.\n  But, let me turn to a case study where privatization in place was \ndirectly recommended by BRAC. Let's look at the results. I refer to the \nBRAC 1993 decision regarding the Air Force Aerospace Guidance and \nMetrological Center located at Newark AFB, Ohio. GAO performed an audit \nof facility operations under privatization in place and found that the \nAir Force itself estimated costs to be $9 to $32 million higher than \nthose before the operation went private. In fact, I was told by the Air \nForce over the weekend that there remain nearly 150 government \nemployees at the site.\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\n  Despite this history, the solicitation for privatization at McClellan \nis actually forecasting a 25 percent cost savings! Every sensible \ngovernment accountant that I've spoken to claims this figure is at best \nvastly inflated.\n\n\nthe president is sacrificing the best depots on a shaky political alter\n\n  Politicization of the BRAC process is risky both economically and \nmilitarily. The consequences are already quite clear:\n  Both the House an Senate will deny the President future BRAC rounds. \nWho among us can support continuation of a process that has become \nblatantly political? Who is willing to roll the dice with the \nlivelihoods of workers in their States, let alone the lives of our \nservicemen and women?\n  We are denying DOD critically needed modernization moneys that were \nto come from the BRAC savings.\n  Worse, still, we are courting the serious deterioration of combat \nefficiency and safety if our armed services do not get technologies--\ntechnologies which are already in the hands of our adversaries, some of \nthem Third World countries.\n  There is not the least likelihood that demand will rise to meet the \nsustained levels of excess capacity perpetuated by the President's \nactions. For example, modern weapon systems have reduced programmed \ndepot maintenance. The F-16, for one, has no routine depot-maintenance \nrequirements. And that aircraft is to be replaced by the Joint Strike \nFighter, which has even a longer mean-time-between-failures \nrequirement--MTBF means the average that a system can operate without \nmajor replacement or overhaul. The F-22, which will replace the F-15, \nalso has no programmed depot maintenance.\n\n  But the problems of excess capacity get worse. GAO has calculated \nthat the 5 depots left in place will have 57 million direct work hours \nto perform 32 million direct work hours of labor, and, the requirement \nwill fall by over 37 percent to 20 million direct work hours by 1999. \nThis means that the depot system will have over 2\\1/2\\ times the amount \nof labor it needs.\n  Mr. President, the President's politicization of BRAC is costing our \ndefense structure the best of the best.\n  The BRAC decision could not have been more clear. Hill AFB was a Tier \nI depot, meaning that it had the highest military value. San Antonio \nand Sacramento, by contrast, were Tier III--or installations which had \nthe lowest military value. The ratings were made by the Air Force and \nused extensively in the BRAC rounds. Yet, the Air Force is now being \nbrow-beaten by its political masters in the Clinton administration into \nrenouncing its own objective rankings.\n  At the same time, these Tier III installations are being extended the \nsame rewards that were fairly won by the hard work of the Utah, \nGeorgia, and Oklahoma bases. Mr. President, what does this say for \nmerit? Or, will the Senate merely go on record with the message that \nlots of electoral votes carry the day?\n  What statement are we making to motivate government employees to \nprovide their best effort? How much political distortion and corruption \nof good performance are we willing to tolerate?\n  Let me put a more positive face on some of these problems. Let's \nconsider the value to the taxpayer of pursuing the BRAC \nrecommendations, that is, keeping the best, while eliminating the \npoorer performers. According to GAO, the elimination of the San Antonio \nand Sacramento depots, as proposed by BRAC, would produce the following \ngains:\n  Excess capacity, by 1999, would fall from 65 percent to 27 percent. \nOn the other hand, if the bases are not closed, San Antonio will have \n89 percent of its maximum capacity idled, while Sacramento will be at \n90 percent;\n  Average hourly rates would be reduced by $6 per hour; and\n  That $182 million would be saved annually from these types of \neconomies of scale and efficiencies.\n  Regrettably, I have to say that the President's attitude toward the \nnoncoastal Western States, and especially my own State of Utah, cannot \nescape our attention. It should be foremost in the thoughts of every \nSenator from this region.\n  The President has repeatedly interfered with, tried to disrupt, and \ntried to knock off course the most economically vibrant regional \neconomy in the Nation.\n  Need another example? Among other punitive land use regulations, he \nhas usurped without prior consultation 1.7 million acres of land in my \nState, arbitrarily removing them from economic development and other \ngenerally beneficial uses. I refer here to the grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument.\n  It troubles me substantially that the President, even though he is in \nhis second term, is simply not acting as the President of all the \npeople and all the States. He is acting as the President for the large, \nelectorally rich States. If this were not true, the decision to \nimplement the BRAC recommendation would be a no-brainer.\n\n\n      The privatization in place competition is inherently unfair\n\n  Mr. President, I have done a thorough assessment of the proposal for \nprivatization in place at McClellan. I find two major flaws that \nstarkly stack the deck against the public depot and favor private \nbidders.\n  First, the public depot bidders are forced to bear an unfair share of \nthe costs of transitioning the Sacramento depot from active Air Force \nstatus.\n  The DOD Cost of Competition Handbook stipulates that both public and \nprivate bidders must cite the transition costs in their bids. However, \nthe private bidder doesn't include the costs of early retirement, \nseparation, or relocation for workers at Sacramento who lose their \njobs. But the public depot shows it as an accounting charge because \nit's paid by the taxpayer.\n  This becomes a form of double accounting. In fact, BRAC intended, and \nCongress provided the moneys, to fund personnel transition costs \nregardless of who wins. Yet, the impression is left that this is a cost \nthat will be integrated into the depot's cost to its customers.\n  Second, the private bidders get substantial financial and performance \nadvantages from the use of the excess capacity intended to be closed by \nBRAC.\n  The local redevelopment authority can determine its own cost of \nleasing the facility to the private bidder. What an incentive. There is \nnothing to keep the leasing agreement from covering just about \nanything, such as depreciation writeoffs, improvements, and even \nequipment and facility maintenance. All of this allows the private \nbidder to be artificially low.\n  Yet another inequity denies the public depot from beginning military \nconstruction related to the workload transfer until the contract is \nawarded. This means the work must be performed at the Sacramento \nlocation for an indeterminate period of time, adding to the public \nbidder's cost. And, of course, reducing the fairness of the \ncompetition.\n  The McClellan bid consists of a 5-year contract with three 1-year \noptions, for a possible total award of 8 years. The options are \nperformance based. This means that the LRA is certain to expend moneys \non facilities maintenance in order to allow the private contractor to \nachieve better productivity, and through that level of performance, \nensure the option awards. The public depot, on the other hand, must \ninvest in facilities modernization and reflect this investment in its \ncost.\n\n\n         the case for privatization in place just can't be made\n\n   Mr. President, on the basis of all available evidence, we should \nconclude that privatization in place cannot fairly or reasonably \nproduce cost savings. More likely, it will contribute to waste and \ninefficiency. In support of this proposition, I want to make the \nfollowing closing arguments:\n  First, depots are already among the most critical or so-called high-\nrisk areas of the Federal Government.\n  High risk is a special designation used by GAO to alert Congress to \nareas that are highly vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and \nmismanagement.\n  Second, GAO has already forecast that, by the end of fiscal year \n1999, San Antonio will have 89 percent of its maximum productive \ncapacity as excess, while Sacramento's excess capacity will be at 90 \npercent. Both of these levels are more than twice the current 40 \npercent excess capacity that we are arguing about today. In other \nwords, the problem is going to be doubly bad by the end of the next \nfiscal year if we don't solve it now by ending privatization in place.\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\n  Again, these problems are caused in great part by diminished workload \nrequirements related to force downsizing. Yet, as I said earlier, it is \nthe savings generated by reducing infrastructure that are fueling our \nability to modernize our equipment, something that almost every Member \nof this body knows is necessary.\n  Third, GAO told the Appropriations Committee panel that: ``the Air \nForce has the most serious excess capacity problem.'' The combined \nlosses could reach about $500 million if the Sacramento and San Antonio \nfacilities are kept in the inventory.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the value of the BRAC findings that I \nmentioned earlier. I need to repeat this: in making its determinations \nregarding both these depots, BRAC leaned heavily on the Air Force's own \ndesignation of the Sacramento and San Antonio ALC's as so-called Tier \nIII installations. This means, as most of us involved in the BRAC \nprocess will recall, that the installations had the lowest military \nvalue. I challenge anyone to argue that there is some redemptive value \nthat could follow from the revival of installations that the Air Force \nitself realized should be closed.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that Utah has been on the low end of the \nBRAC process in other areas. My State has lost two installations. I \nmust admit that I fought hard to prevent those losses. I do not deny \nthe trauma that the closure of such a large military facility causes \nStates and communities. And, I admit that if the situation were \nreversed, I might be making the same weak arguments my colleagues from \nCalifornia and Texas are making today. I am well aware of what is at \nstake for my colleagues from Texas and California.\n  But, this does not excuse the Clinton administration from its \nresponsibilities either to the defense of our country, to the ensuring \nthe safest possible equipment for our servicemen and women, or to the \ntaxpayers who are footing the bills. The President needs to take the \nbroad view. And, by rejecting the BRAC recommendations--and \ncompromising the entire BRAC process for unsupportable political \nreasons--he clearly has not.\n  We should not tolerate diversions from, or the politicization of, the \nBRAC recommendations. The very nature of downsizing means that there \nwill be losers and survivors. We must make every effort to protect the \nintegrity that the process itself demands.\n  But, more importantly, one of our essential duties under the \nConstitution is to provide for the common defense. Congress and the \nPresident have the ultimate responsibility for the support of our Armed \nForces. It is a duty we cannot delegate. I simply ask each of my \ncolleagues these questions:\n  Do we fulfill that duty when we knowingly allow diversions that \nproduce gross inefficiencies in the operation of military services from \nthe recommendations of an independent commission?\n  And do we honor our obligations by denying funds produced by these \nrecommendations for the provision of technologically superior equipment \nand training for our fighting men and women?\n  We need to affirm our duties and obligations. Only then will we take \na major step toward giving our citizens and our fighting men and women \nthe type of defense the country expects.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, in conclusion, that I want this \nprocess to work. It is very difficult for me to support a future BRAC \nprocess if this is going to be politicized the way we see it being \npoliticized right now. After all, the pain, suffering, inconvenience, \nand difficulties in traveling around the country and meeting time after \ntime with the military, with the various administrations, and so forth, \nto have to put up with what is going on right now is just unacceptable.\n  Frankly, I can't support a future BRAC process if that is the best we \ncan do with this one, which I thought was fair and which came out with \nvery tough decisions. They weren't easy. I feel sorry for anybody who \nhas lost anything. But we have lost plenty, too.\n  All I can say is, if we lose this, then I am never going to get over \nit. I don't think the people of Utah are going to get over it, and I \nthink, frankly, the country will be poorer for it, and I think our \nnational security interests will be poorer for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions and Senator Inhofe be added as cosponsors to amendment 420 \noffered by Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. today, there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided between \nSenator Wellstone and Senator Thurmond, or his designee, and 15 minutes \nof debate between Senator Gorton and Senator Inouye; and, immediately \nfollowing that debate, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to \nthe Wellstone amendment 670, to be followed by a vote on or in relation \nto the Gorton amendment 424, to be followed by a vote on or in relation \nto the Dodd amendment 765; and, finally there be 2 minutes for debate \nequally divided before the second and third vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that no \nother amendments be in order to the above-listed amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Dorgan \namendment with reference to base closures pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to speak for a few moments on the subject. \nI will not take long.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan-Domenici amendment to \nrequire the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress \ndetailing the costs and savings of previously authorized base closure \nrounds and on the need, if any, for further base closure rounds prior \nto the Congress authorizing the Department to move forward with \nadditional closures. This amendment stands for a simple proposition. It \nsays that as Members of Congress we will take our oversight \nresponsibilities seriously when major decisions that affect the lives \nof all Americans are on the table. It says that we will take a long \nhard look at where we have been before we chart a course for where we \nare going. We owe the people we represent a commitment to carefully \nanalyze what the last four rounds of base closure dating back to 1989 \nhave accomplished before we decide to give the authority to the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct two more base closure rounds. This \namendment does not say that additional base closure rounds are not \nnecessary, or that they will not be needed in the future. This \namendment simply requires that the Congress be able to have essential \nfactual data about the costs and savings associated with previous \nrounds before we authorize legislation that would give the Department \nof Defense the authority to conduct new rounds. This amendment is \nreasonable, it is fair, and it offers a common sense approach to the \nserious modernization problems we face.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear before I begin that I understand \nthe argument of those who say that BRAC savings are an important part \nof the funds that will finance the future modernization of our Armed \nForces and keep our military the most technologically advanced and \nlethal fighting force in the world. I understand that the Quadrennial \nDefense Review and the National Defense Panel established by the \nCongress concluded that further reductions in the DOD base structure \nare essential to free up money we need to modernize our forces. I am \naware that in a recent letter, all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nurged the Congress to ``strongly support further reductions in base \nstructure proposed by the Secretary of Defense.'' Nevertheless, Mr. \nPresident, the question is not whether the savings are needed, the\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\nquestion is will the necessary savings for force modernization be \npresent if we conduct two more rounds of closure? In that regard, no \none can guarantee that the savings will be present after two more \nrounds. No one can guarantee the projected savings from previous rounds \nwill be what they are currently estimated. The QDR did not guarantee \nthe savings will be present, the National Defense Review Panel has not \nassured the Congress that the savings will be present, and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff has not assured the Congress that the savings will be \npresent if we close more bases.\n  There have been four rounds of base closure--1988, 1991, 1993, 1995. \nThey have resulted in decisions to close 97 of 495 major bases in the \nUnited States. Between 1990 and 2001 the DOD estimates that BRAC \nactions will produce a total of $13.5 billion in net savings. After \n2001, when all of the previous BRAC actions must be completed, steady \nState savings are estimated by the DOD to be $5.6 billion per year. CBO \nestimates that it will cost $23.4 billion to close all 97 bases. These \ncosts are mostly due to environmental cleanup at closing bases, 30 \npercent, additional operations and maintenance at receiving bases, 35 \npercent, and additional construction and renovations and receiving \nbases, 30 percent.\n\n  CBO projects at total of $57 billion in savings by the year 2020. CBO \nestimates that DOD will save about $28.7 billion during the BRAC \nimplementation process, 1988-2001, which means a net savings of only \n$5.3 billion during those years. Half of the $57 billion in savings are \nprojected to come from lower operations and maintenance costs; a \nquarter from less spending on personnel, including civilians whose jobs \nare eliminated; the remainder comes from projected land sales.\n  Mr. President, the main question we must ask ourselves is how \nreliable is this cost savings information? The answer, unfortunately, \nis that no one really knows. Not the Department of Defense, not the \nCongress, not the President.\n  We in New Mexico have had a fair amount of experience with the base \nclosure process and one fact that we have learned is that what the \nDepartment of Defense estimates in savings cannot, and should not be \ntaken for granted. We need to examine carefully whether the savings \npromised have some basis in reality. The responsible choice is to see \nwhere we have been before we set a course of where we are going.\n  For example, during the 1995 BRAC process the Secretary of Defense \nrecommended that Kirtland Air Force Base undergo a major realignment. \nBefore we took a long hard look at their numbers for costs and savings, \nthe Department of the Air Force estimated that it would spend $277.5 \nmillion to realign the base while projecting a $464.5 million in \nsavings over 20 years.\n  Mr. President, what would you say if I told you that not only did we \nfind that the Air Force's costs and savings were wholly inaccurate, but \nthat after careful analysis by my staff, knowledgeable members of the \ncommunity, and others in the congressional Delegation, the Secretary of \nDefense for the first time in the history of the BRAC process wrote to \nthe BRAC Commission and told them that ``* * * the recommendation for \nthe realignment of Kirtland Air Force Base no longer represents a \nfinancially or operationally sound scenario.''\n  Specifically, we found that if the Air Force major realignment of \nKirtland Air Force Base passed that the Department of Energy would have \nto assume $64 million in conversion costs and that it would cost an \nadditional $30.6 million per year to maintain the safety, security, and \nviability of the critical base operations that remained.\n  Mr. President, the New Mexico experience with BRAC may be unique, but \nit serves to make the essential point that we are making with this \namendment. The driving factor behind base closure decisions should \ncontinue to be the overall cost to the taxpayer. In our case, the \noriginal half-billion cost savings turned out to be a half-billion new \ncost to the taxpayer. The message of the New Mexico experience is that \nwe need to carefully examine the Department's projected costs and \nsavings in order to thoughtfully determine whether it is a wise \ndecision to give the Department of Defense the legislative authority \nthey need to conduct additional base closure rounds. The Dorgan-\nDomenici amendment will give the Congress the necessary data to make \nthis decision in a thoughtful and precise manner.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senators from New Mexico and North Dakota are not \nthe only people who think that the Department of Defense's current \ncosts and savings projections may not be reliable. The Congressional \nBudget Office says it ``cannot evaluate the accuracy of DOD's estimates \nwithout empirical data.'' In even stronger words the CBO states that \nthe ``Department is unable to report actual spending and savings for \nBRAC actions.'' CBO recommends that, ``Congress could consider asking \nDOD to establish an information system that would track the actual \ncosts and savings of closing military bases. The system could apply to \nBRAC IV bases because DOD is just beginning to shut down those bases \nand virtually all the work remains to be done.''\n  In addition to the CBO's analysis, the Government Accounting Office \nhad this to say, ``DOD cannot provide accurate information on actual \nsavings because (1) information on base support costs was not retained \nfor some closing bases and (2) the services' accounting systems cannot \nisolate the effect on support costs at gaining bases.''\n  Mr. President, the task we have before us is clear. My advice to \nSenators is to make the responsible choice and let us take a careful \nlook before we leap into two new rounds of base closure. There will be \nenough time for the Department of Defense to close additional bases if \nthe costs and savings of the first four rounds prove to be accurate. \nEven those who argue for additional base closure rounds today will not \ntell you that the future of our military's capability rests on deciding \nat this moment in time to give the DOD the authority to conduct \nadditional rounds of base closure. By making the responsible choice \ntoday and voting for the Dorgan-Domenici amendment Senators will show \nthat they are concerned about the modernization of our forces by \nrequiring the data that shows the savings required to finance that \nmodernization will be present at the end of the closure process.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Dorgan-Domenici amendment will \nprovide the information necessary for the Congress to make decision of \nwhether to authorize additional rounds of base closure sound, well \nreasoned, and based on fact. I ask my colleagues for their support, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to speak briefly in favor of the Dorgan-\nLott second-degree amendment and associate myself with that amendment. \nI do think it is important before we go forward with additional BRAC's \nthat we know and can certify the amount of money that has been saved by \nprior BRAC rounds. I do not think we have taken that into \nconsideration. There is a lot that is also associated with closure \ncosts.\n  But more to the point on this particular issue, it seems to me that \nwe have been through this BRAC process here now for several rounds, and \nsome of that may have been very healthy to do, but that we ought to \nstop and appraise just what was good about that, and, more importantly, \nI think we need to go through a BRAC on domestic discretionary \nspending. Let us look at some of the programs that are discretionary \nprograms, not entitlement programs but discretionary programs, say, \nwithin the Department of Commerce or, say, within the Department of \nEnergy. Let us go through a BRAC there. Let us take a look at those and \nhave a vote up or down. We ought to be focusing our effort there where \nwe know we have some wasteful programs. We know there is money that is \nbeing wasted and spent not for a good reason or cause.\n  We have gone through that on some of the military bases as far as \nlooking at some bases that may not be necessary to have, but would it \nnot be so much wiser now to focus on some of these discretionary \nprograms? They are in the media virtually every day--the Advanced \nTechnology Program being a corporate welfare program, for one instance. \nWe have other programs that have been identified. We have a fleet of \nships under the Commerce Department that we have been saying for\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\na long time ought to be privatized rather than being run there. That is \na wasteful spending program. I have a list of those that I think we \nought to go through far before we start up some other BRAC round in the \nmilitary when we do not even know what sort of cost or what sort of \nsavings we have had associated within it.\n  So, Mr. President, I just think we have a lot better things that we \ncould be doing with our time and focus on rather than going back \nthrough a BRAC round. I do think it is constructive, through the \nDorgan-Lott approach, to get a sense of where we are costwise, get a \nsense of what cost we have with closing a military base, get a strategy \ngoing here which guarantees that further base closures will not \njeopardize national security. We need to look at all those things \nbefore we go forward with another BRAC round.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The floor is available. Any Senator who now wishes to \nexpress himself on the other side of this issue has the opportunity. We \nare going to be voting here in just a little bit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose efforts to \nauthorize additional rounds of base closings. I believe that it is bad \npolicy to close more bases without accurately knowing the ramifications \nof previous cuts.\n  Congress has already approved four rounds of base closings, the \nlatest round occurring in 1995. My State of California has suffered \nunfairly during this process, losing 27 major installations. Job losses \nfrom these closings are estimated to exceed 250,000, and the total \neconomic loss will top $8 billion.\n  Although the California economy is experiencing an economic upturn, \nunemployment in my State continues to run two percentage points above \nthe national average. It is clear that communities in California are \ndisproportionately being hurt by the BRAC process.\n  It is unfair to ask my State to bear the brunt of yet another round \nof base closings. It is even more egregious to ask Californians to go \nthrough another round of closings when they are still suffering from \nprevious rounds. Past BRAC rounds will continue to weigh heavily on my \nState because many bases from the 1995 closure round will not close \nuntil 1999 or after. Furthermore, some of these closures have not \nproven to be cost-efficient, and that is one reason why we are not \nseeing the savings that had been previously promised.\n  I believe that we should not even consider future base closings until \nwe have had the time to properly analyze the ramifications of the \nprevious four rounds. We need to have solid data about the long-term \ncosts and benefits of base closures. More importantly, we need to make \nsure that we understand the effect these closures have had on the real \npeople whose lives drastically change when a base in their community is \nclosed.\n  That is why we should pass the Dorgan Amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor. This amendment would require the Department of Defense to \nissue a report on the long-term costs and savings incurred from the \nprevious rounds of base closings before future BRAC's could go forward. \nI simply can not see how we can entertain the idea of additional rounds \nof base closures without first having the benefit of solid data and \nhard numbers from previous BRAC's.\n  Mr. President, Californians are amazingly resilient. They have \novercome devastating floods, disastrous earthquakes and terrorizing \nfloods. Our state has gone through a lot. But I promise that California \nwill not suffer further economic damage from another round of base \nclosings until I have exhausted every tool available to me as a \nSenator. I urge my colleagues to oppose a new round of base closures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say just a \ncouple of more words about the amendment that is now pending. It is a \nsecond-degree amendment offered to the first-degree amendment that had \nbeen previously offered by Senator McCain and Senator Levin.\n  I indicated when I started out I have great respect for both of them. \nWe reach a different conclusion and come to a different judgment on \nthis question, and I do want to say in response to some of the \ndiscussion that has been held in this Chamber that this is not a \nquestion about whether closing bases saves money. I accept the notion \nthat closing military installations saves money.\n  That is why I have been involved in supporting four previous base \nclosing rounds. It clearly will save money. We do not know how much. I \ndo not think anyone here knows how much. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has reviewed it, the Government Accounting Office has reviewed \nit, and they are trying to understand how much money is saved and what \nare the costs. Are we saving a little bit of money and having very \nsubstantial costs? Are we saving a lot of money? We do not know. There \nhas not been a decent accounting.\n  I am not standing here quibbling about whether closing additional \nbases will save money. It likely will save money. The question is \nshould we in this authorization bill launch two additional rounds of \nbase closures when the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office \nindicate--especially CBO indicates --it would be wise for us to have an \ninterval at this point during which we fully understand what we have \ndone in the previous four rounds by which we have said let us close 100 \nmilitary installations only about 50 of which are now closed.\n  Let us finish the job we have done in the previous four rounds before \nwe decide whether and when we initiate two additional rounds of base \nclosing. We might discover that the basis for the previous closures and \nthe conditions under which those closures were ordered and the \nexperience of those closures might persuade us to do something \ndifferent, maybe closing other installations in a different way. I do \nnot know. But we ought to have the benefit of that experience and that \nknowledge before we proceed.\n  That is the issue. I know the Senate Democratic leader is in the \nChamber and wishes to speak on this subject, and I shall not go \nfurther. I may have something to say later. But this is an interesting \nand, I think, a useful discussion for us to have, and I appreciate the \ncosponsorship of both the majority leader and the minority leader to my \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his extraordinary work on this particular amendment \nand appreciate very much his advocacy and the effort he has made \nthroughout the day to make the case. He and others have spoken \neloquently and very persuasively. There is little else I can add. \nNevertheless, I do want to touch on a number of issues largely for the \npurpose of emphasis. I think it is very critical that we have an \nopportunity to talk through this matter as carefully as we can.\n  Let me also give great credit to our distinguished ranking member. I \nhave had the good fortune to work with him on so many issues, and it is \nextraordinarily rare that I find myself in disagreement with him on \nanything. So for me to be in this position, in fact standing at his \ndesk, is a very uncomfortable situation, to say the least.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Democratic leader will reciprocate just for a \nmoment and yield, I am also standing at his desk, so we are even.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank Senator Thurmond, the distinguished chairman, \nwho is standing at another desk, for his leadership and the effort he \nhas made in moving this bill.\n  Past Congresses have approved four rounds of base closures --1988, \n1991, 1993 and 1995. We have already agreed to close 97 out of the 495 \nmilitary bases and realign an additional 55 bases. I have joined with \nmany others in voting yes every step of the way. Yes on authorizing \nfour rounds of base closures. Yes on closing 97 bases. And yes on \naligning 55 others. So, let no one doubt this Senator's willingness to \ncast a difficult vote in support of our national defense. I have done \nso in the past and am prepared to do so in the future.\n  However, voting to close more bases at this time makes no sense--for \nour military, for our budget and, perhaps most importantly, for local \ncommunities. This is the position not only of the Senators from the \nDakotas and\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\nSenators from across the country, it is also the position, as the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota noted, of the Congressional \nBudget Office, of the General Accounting Office, and even the Base \nClosure Commission.\n  I will get back to that in just a minute. The principal argument \nadvanced by supporters of this particular amendment is a fiscal one. \nThe Pentagon needs to achieve savings to stay within its $1.4 trillion \nbudget.\n  Setting aside the issue for the amount of whether the Pentagon really \nneeds $1.4 trillion--and given the current international circumstances \nand the sacrifices we are asking of important domestic problems--we \nneed to look at the proponents' claims about future significant \nsavings.\n  According to Pentagon's figures, we did not break even on base \nclosures until 1996, nearly a decade after we began the current phase \nof base closings. In other words, the Pentagon's figures indicate we \ndid not save one dime during the first eight years of base closures; \ninstead we spent billions and billions of additional dollars. It is \nonly after nearly a decade of economic dislocation and hardship that \nthe Pentagon's own analysis begins to demonstrate any net savings.\n  In fact it takes up to 6 years to close a base once Congress has \nauthorized its closure, and of the 97 bases Congress voted to close \nsince 1988, we have actually closed just over half this number. Since \nthe last round of base closures was passed in 1995, it will take the \nPentagon until the year 2001 just to complete action on the bases we \nhave already voted to close.\n  So, Mr. President, the question is, since we have not even closed \nabout one-half the bases that were scheduled for closure, why is it \nthat we are now making the effort to move to close still more before we \nhave completed our work on the last ones?\n  CBO and the General Accounting Office do not trust Pentagon figures. \nIn fact, CBO's analysis shows that the Pentagon has consistently \noverestimated the savings that will accrue from a given round of base \nclosures. In the first round, the Pentagon estimated that we would \nachieve $844 million in savings for the period 1990 to 1995. \nSubsequently, it turned out that instead of saving money, the round \nactually lost $517 million. For the second round of base closures, the \nPentagon initially estimated that we would save $2.916 billion from \n1992 to 1997. What happened? We did not save $2.9 billion. We will be \nfortunate to save about one-third of that amount, roughly $972 million. \nFor the third round, the Pentagon estimated that we would lose $715 \nmillion for the period 1994 to 1999. It now estimates we will not lose \nquite as much, about $553 million. Clearly less than a stellar record \nfor the Pentagon's forecasters.\n\n  So the estimates according to the Department of Defense itself, which \nhas generated this kind of skepticism from the General Accounting \nOffice and the Congressional Budget Office, is that we are not doing as \nwell as we had originally anticipated; we are not making the savings in \nbase closings that we expected.\n  The sharp fall in Pentagon savings estimates are really represented \nby this graph. The Pentagon's forecast for savings from the first round \nof base closure was reduced by 161 percent for the period 1990 to 1995. \nIn the second of base closures, the Pentagon savings estimate has been \nrevised downward by 67 percent. And in the third round, the Pentagon \nhas already acknowledged that it miscalculated by about 23 percent.\n  This chart proves as clearly, I think, as anyone can that on the \nbasis of savings there is real reason to question whether or not we \nhave achieved the stated goals of the Base Closure Commission--\n161 percent off the mark in the first one, 67 percent off the mark in \nthe second one and 23 percent off the mark in the third one.\n\n  GAO and CBO, two independent congressional advisory organizations, \nhave each conducted thorough examinations of the costs and savings \ninherent in the base closure process. And they concur in their \nfindings: They can reach no conclusions on savings from base closures, \ngiven the Pentagon's current accounting system. As expressed by GAO in \na recent report, ``[the Defense Department] cannot provide accurate \ninformation on actual savings''. As stated by CBO in a December 1996 \nreport, ``CBO was unable to confirm or assess DOD's estimates of cost \nand savings because the [Defense] Department is unable to report actual \nspending and savings for [base closure] actions.''\n  What we do know so far is that there has been a gross overestimation \nof what will have achieved in savings to date. So, before we decide to \ngo to yet another round, the question presents itself, is this the \nright time? Not knowing how much we are going to achieve, not knowing \nwhether or not we are going to save or actually spend more money, is \nthis the time to commit to yet another base closing round?\n  As I said, there are a lot of different policy questions involved \nhere. One is savings. Another is the tremendous ripple effect through \nthe local economies that will be felt well into the next century with \nyet another base closing round. We are going to be living with severe \ndislocations and economic loss, we know that. We are also going to be \nliving with short-term degradation in military capability as individual \nmilitary units pick up their operations and move from one base to the \nother.\n  And we really have not looked at alternative approaches to achieve \nsavings within the $1.4 trillion defense budget. And there are \nalternative cost saving approaches. For example, the bill before us \ncontains an additional $5 billion additional commitment for weapons \nsystems that were either not requested by the Pentagon or not requested \nin the quantities proposed in this bill. Let me say this again. This \nbill contains over $5 billion for weapons systems that the Pentagon \njudged unnecessary for national security. By my calculation if we were \nto attempt to save this same $5 billion through base closures alone, it \nwould take until nearly the end of the first decade of the 21st \ncentury. In other words, by paring back weapons systems that even the \nPentagon did not request, we could save today what would take roughly a \ndecade to accomplish through base closures--even if we accept the \nPentagon's rosy and highly questionable assumptions regarding potential \nsavings.\n  So, instead of focusing exclusively on surplus bases, perhaps we need \nto be discussing other ways with which to achieve any necessary \nsavings. Looking at surplus weapons systems may be one way to do it. I \nam prepared to look at any and all options. However, before we commit \nto an approach that may not generate savings and that may not give us \nthe framework within which a very thoughtful consideration of \ninfrastructure can take place, we should do what this second-degree \namendment sets forth.\n  The second-degree amendment is based on two major assumptions. First, \nCongress should allow already authorized base closures to go forward \nbefore we cause still more dislocation and hardship. Second, Congress \nshould be fully informed about the implications of past and future \nclosings before we commit ourselves to still more closings.\n  Therefore, rather than launch another round immediately, the second-\ndegree provides the Pentagon with time to develop accounting techniques \nso that they and we can fully and accurately understand the costs and \nsavings from previous and future rounds of base closures. This \namendment requires the Pentagon to prepare a report on these financial \nchanges and to have that report reviewed by the GAO and CBO. Finally, \nour amendment requires the Pentagon to do all of this in a timely \nmanner.\n  Just as important is what this amendment does not do. The amendment \ndoes not preclude future base closures that may reveal themselves to be \njustified once we fully understand the ramifications. If there are to \nbe future base closures, we simply want to be able to ensure that we \nunderstand where we are today in terms of infrastructure changes we \nhave already approved and to be able to accurately assess the long-term \nimpact of any proposed future changes. That is the concept that I think \nthe CBO itself has articulated.\n\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, consideration of \nadditional base closures ``should follow an interval during which DOD \nand independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that \nhave been taken thus far. Such a pause [they add] would allow the \nDepartment of Defense to\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\ncollect data necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives and \nto determine the actual costs incurred and savings achieved. Additional \ntime would also allow more informed assessment of the local impacts of \nthe bases already closed.''\n  Finally Mr. President, after hearing the views of GAO and CBO, I ask \nthe Senate to consider the perspective of the last Base Closure \nCommission. Largely as a result of the continued turbulence and the \nlack of hard information, the Commission itself recommended that \nCongress not authorize another round of closures until the year 2001. \nOnly our amendment is consistent with the findings of the Base Closure \nCommission.\n  So based upon the analysis presented to us by CBO, by the GAO, by the \nBase Closure Commission, I think to move yet another round at this time \nis just premature.\n  My record on base closures is clear. I have supported then when I \nthought they were needed and would produce the desired outcome--a \nleaner, more effective military that minimizes disruptions to our \ncommunities. GAO and CBO indicate that the Pentagon cannot tell us \ntoday what we have saved from past rounds, let alone yet-to-be \ndetermined future rounds. The only statement that can be made with any \nconfidence is that our communities will suffer dislocations and \ndisruptions well into the 21st century from actions that we have \nalready taken.\n  The case for inflicting additional suffering on them is far from \ncompelling, especially when there are many other ways to achieve the \nnecessary efficiencies within our defense budget. What we need to do is \nto find them. GAO, CBO, and the Base Closure Commission all acknowledge \nas much.\n  Let's work together to see that happens. Only one base closure \namendment protects the interests of our military and our communities, \nthat is the second-degree amendment pending. I urge its support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter we \njust received from the Secretary of Defense about the savings which \nhave resulted from BRAC 1993 actions, a letter dated July 9, 1997, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate moves to final \n     consideration of its version of the FY 98 Defense \n     Authorization Bill, I urge you to support the McCain-Levin \n     amendment authorizing BRAC rounds in 1999 and 2001. We \n     estimate two additional rounds would result in savings of \n     approximately $2.7 billion annually. These savings are \n     absolutely critical to the Department's modernization plans.\n       There have been some questions regarding the savings \n     actually realized from previous base closures. We have taken \n     these questions seriously and asked the Department of Defense \n     Inspector General (DoDIG) to take an independent look at this \n     issue. The IG's preliminary results indicate that there is no \n     basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly cost \n     effective. The preliminary audit examined BRAC 93 actions, \n     including the largest Navy closure (Mare Island) and eight \n     Air Force bases closed or realigned. For these bases, the IG \n     found that DoD overestimated costs by $148 million and \n     underestimated savings by $614 million. I have attached a \n     copy of the IG's preliminary report for your review.\n       I would greatly appreciate your support for two additional \n     BRAC rounds and hope you find this information useful in your \n     consideration of the McCain-Levin amendment.\n       Enclosure.\n     Bill Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Inspector General,\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, June 23, 1997.\n     Memorandum for Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense \n       (Acquisition and Technology)\n     Subject: Review of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Costs \n       and Savings\n\n       This is to provide the interim results of the audit being \n     conducted by this office in response to the Under Secretary \n     of Defense for Acquisition and Technology memorandum of \n     February 7, 1997. The audit objectives are to compare the \n     BRAC costs and savings estimates in previous budgets with \n     actual experience and to identify lessons learned regarding \n     management controls for estimating and tracking BRAC costs \n     and savings.\n       The lack of records makes retroactive reconstruction of \n     actual costs and savings from pre-1993 BRAC impossible at \n     this point. Likewise, it is too soon to assess BRAC 95 costs \n     and savings. We have focused our review, therefore, on the \n     BRAC 93 round. The audit universe for BRAC 93 is comprised of \n     cost estimates totalling $7.3 billion and savings estimates \n     of $7.5 billion through FY 1999. The bulk of both the BRAC 93 \n     budgeted costs and savings, $5.2 billion and $4.6 billion \n     respectively, was related to Navy installations. During the \n     first portion of the audit, we reviewed the experience at the \n     largest BRAC 93 site, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and all \n     eight Air Force BRAC 93 sites. In addition, we started \n     identifying construction project cancellations at all Navy \n     sites. The nine fully audited installations had BRAC cost \n     estimates of $1.1 billion and savings estimates of $1.8 \n     billion.\n       The initial audit results indicate that the Navy and Air \n     Force erred on the side of conservative estimating, over-\n     estimating costs at the sites reviewed by up to $148 million \n     and underestimating savings by $614 million. The reasons for \n     the variances included:\n       Some cost estimates were related to block obligations for \n     one-time implementation costs, which were never adjusted to \n     reflect actual disbursements. Researching these largely \n     invalid obligations could free up significant funding for \n     current BRAC requirements.\n       Canceled military construction projects valued at $8 \n     million at Mare Island were not counted in savings estimates.\n       An additional $58 million of canceled construction projects \n     at other Navy BRAC 93 sites was not counted because \n     incomplete projects funded in prior year programs were not \n     counted, even if they were curtailed.\n       The Navy assumed that 40 percent of the indirect civilian \n     labor costs at Mare Island would transfer to other shipyards, \n     but the audit indicated minimal related increases in other \n     shipyards indirect costs.\n       Reductions for base operation support costs at Mare Island \n     were underestimated after the first year of closure.\n       Documentation did not exist to explain differences between \n     the Air Force biennial budget and reductions reflected in the \n     Air Force Future Years Defense Plan.\n       The results of the audit to date, while not fully staffed \n     nor statistically projectable across either BRAC 93 or all \n     BRAC rounds, appear to corroborate the DoD position that \n     concerns that BRAC has not been highly cost effective are \n     unfounded. As a result of consultation with the Deputy Under \n     Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs and Installations), \n     we plan to continue auditing the BRAC 93 costs and savings. \n     In our audit report this fall, we will provide \n     recommendations for management controls on estimating and \n     tracking costs and savings for any future BRAC rounds.\n       We hope that this update is helpful. If there are \n     questions, please feel free to contact me or Mr. Robert J. \n     Lieberman, Assistant Inspector General for Auditing, at (703) \n     604-8901.\n                                                     Eleanor Hill,\n                                                Inspector General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I indicated before, Mr. President, since we are talking \nabout estimated savings, the IG that was requested by the Department of \nDefense to make these estimates found that the costs were overestimated \nby $148 million and savings underestimated by $614 million, which means \nin this study by the DOD IG, there were significantly greater savings \nthan had been predicted by the BRAC commission. That, of course, is \nsomewhat different--very different--in terms of the evidence of that \npresented by the distinguished Democratic leader. We are not sure \nwhether the leader's numbers came from the original Department of \nDefense estimates before they went to BRAC, and that is something we \nwill check out, because in all but one case, the commission produced \nsavings significantly less than had been requested by the Department of \nDefense.\n  Finally, relative to the argument that the cost of previous base \nclosures have been underestimated, one of the reasons the original \nDepartment of Defense estimates were high was that they estimated the \nsavings from the sale of land. We changed the rules in the middle on \nthat one. The revenue never materialized because we changed the rules, \nvery consciously, to provide that most base property would be given \naway when the base was closed rather than sold. We did that to make \neconomic redevelopment more feasible. That has benefited all of our \nStates just about where these closings have taken place. So that is \nanother possible\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\nexplanation for the difference in these numbers.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Minnesota, there will now be 15 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from South Carolina. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, which is an amendment \nthat I have offered with Senator Harkin, from Iowa, is very simple and \nstraightforward. It authorizes, so it is not subject to a point of \norder, it just authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the \nSecretary of Agriculture $5 million over the next 5 years, $25 million \naltogether. That is $5 million out of a $265 billion Pentagon budget, a \nbudget that is some $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon itself has \nrequested.\n  So out of that $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon has requested, \nthis is an amendment that says take $5 million and transfer it to the \nSecretary of Agriculture; that is to say, authorize the Secretary of \nDefense to transfer this to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  This $5 million program per year was eliminated. We should never have \ndone that. This is to correct an egregious mistake that we made. This \nhas everything in the world to do with malnutrition and hunger among \nchildren. This $5 million has been used effectively nationwide--a small \namount of money--as a catalyst, as an outreach program, to enable \nStates and school districts to set up and expand the School Breakfast \nProgram. As a matter of fact, I think one of the reasons it was \neliminated was that it had been so successful, in fact, in enabling \nschool districts to expand the School Breakfast Program, the argument \nthen being we would have to invest more resources in the School \nBreakfast Program.\n  I read from a letter received from the Food Research & Action Center \nthat points out that only ``seven of ten, 71.4 percent, of the schools \nthat offer school lunch participate in the School Breakfast Program. \nThis represents only 65,000 of the almost 92,000 schools that'' \nparticipate. ``Additionally, just 39.6 percent of low-income children \nparticipating in the National School Lunch Program also participate in \nthe School Breakfast Program. While more than 14 million low-income \nchildren participate in the National School Lunch Program, only 5.6 \nmillion participate in the School Breakfast Program.''\n  Is it too much to ask, as we keep talking about our children being \nour most precious resource, given the fact that all these children are \nGod's children, is it too much to ask for $5 million to be put back \ninto this program that has been so successful? That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, there are 8 million children who don't participate, \nand if these children had a chance to get a good breakfast and these \nchildren, therefore, were not hungry, they would be in a much better \nposition to learn. When children are hungry and children do not have a \ngood breakfast and can't start out the day, they are not going to be \nable to learn, and when they are not able to learn, as adults, they are \nnot able to earn. This amendment should be adopted with 100 votes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by \nSenator Wellstone in regard to the School Breakfast Program.\n  I remind my colleagues that the President proposed the repeal of \nthese startup grants during last year's welfare debate. In addition, \nthe Democratic substitute welfare reform bill contained a provision to \nrepeal these grants. Obviously, people across the political spectrum \nbelieve this grant program to be unnecessary.\n  I also remind my colleagues that this requirement was not identified \nin the budget request, and presently, about four in every five low-\nincome children already attend a school with a school breakfast \nprogram. The breakfast program has expanded to the extent that it is \nnot clear additional funds are necessary or would have the effect of \nbringing more schools into the program.\n  The last point I want to make is that transferring funds from the \nDepartment of Defense, even making the authority discretionary, is bad \nprecedent. We shouldn't make this a precedent. We, in the Congress, \nshould make these decisions and not delegate them to the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Mr. President, we have a budget agreement. We should not void this \nagreement and our responsibilities to make these decisions. I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 4 minutes, 18 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am waiting for my colleague, Senator Harkin. I ask \nunanimous consent to add Senator Harkin as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that a variety of letters of \nendorsement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Food Research &\n\n\n                                                Action Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Senator Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We are writing to enthusiastically \n     support your amendment to the DOD Reauthorization Bill which \n     would authorize the transfer of funds from DOD to the school \n     breakfast and summer food start up and expansion programs.\n       Both the school breakfast and summer food programs remain \n     under-utilized and many public and private sponsors require \n     special initial funding to get programs off the ground. \n     Funding is necessary to inform potential sponsors of the \n     availability of these programs and how to qualify.\n       Only approximately seven of ten (71.4%) of the schools that \n     offer school lunch participate in the School Breakfast \n     Program. This represents only 65,000 of the almost 92,000 \n     schools that offer school lunch also offer school breakfast. \n     Additionally, just 39.6% of the low-income children \n     participating in the National School Lunch Program also \n     participate in the School Breakfast Program. While more than \n     14 million low-income children participate in the National \n     School Lunch Program, only 5.6 million participate in the \n     School Breakfast program. Participation rates for the Summer \n     Food Program are even lower.\n       Your amendment and your efforts on behalf of low-income \n     children will not only serve the immediate need to get food \n     into children's bellies, but will also serve the long-term \n     goal of feeding their brains, and getting them ready to \n     learn!\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward Cooney,\n       Deputy Director.\n     Ellen Teller,\n       Senior Attorney for Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Bread for the World,\n\n                                  Silver Spring, MD, July 9, 1997.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: Bread for the World, a grassroots \n     Christian citizens' movement against hunger, heartily \n     supports your efforts to strengthen the School Breakfast \n     Program. We hereby endorse your amendment to require the \n     Secretary of Defense to transfer $5 million to the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to provide funds for outreach and startup for \n     the School Breakfast Program.\n       We agree with you that a hungry child can not learn the way \n     they should and we know that in the end, this hurts not only \n     the child, but our society as a whole. A nation as blessed as \n     ours should not allow children to go hungry.\n       Thank you for your continued commitment to hungry children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lynette Engelhardt,\n     Domestic Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       AFSCME,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the 1.3 million \n     members of the American Federation of State, County and \n     Municipal Employees (AFSCME), we strongly support your \n     amendment to transfer $5 million from the Department of \n     Defense to the School Breakfast Program to fund the outreach \n     and startup grant program.\n       The School Breakfast Program has proven successful in \n     improving the health and educational achievement of children \n     who have been able to participate. Unfortunately, about \n     27,000 schools do not offer the School Breakfast Program \n     because they lack the\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\n     capital funds needed to meet the startup costs. This deprives \n     eight million low-income children of the opportunity to eat a \n     nutritious and healthy meal in school. In prior years, the $5 \n     million grant program was critical in enabling schools to \n     establish a breakfast program.\n       We support your amendment to continue the outreach and \n     startup School Breakfast grant program with $5 million for \n     fiscal year 1998 by transferring the funds from the \n     Department of Defense's budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to transfer $5 million to the Secretary of \nAgriculture for school breakfasts\n  The purpose of the nondefense program that Senator Wellstone wants to \nsupport with defense funds may be laudatory; however, the amendment is \nill-considered and very problematic.\n  First the amendment would, in principle, violate the bipartisan \nbudget agreement that Congress has completed with the President and \nthat we are working hard to enforce: the amendment would reduce the \namount of defense spending the agreement specifies and would increase \nnondefense discretionary spending above the levels of the agreement.\n  Second, the amendment would violate the intent of firewalls that \nCongress has adopted over the years--and as recently as the 1998 budget \nresolution that we just passed last month. As all Senators know, these \nfirewalls are designed to prevent transfers between defense \ndiscretionary spending and nondefense discretionary spending, and they \nestablish a 60-vote point of order against such transfers. However, the \namendment has been modified to go to great lengths to circumvent a \nBudget Act point of order and has confused the issue of whether it \nactually constitutes a Budget Act violation.\n  Third, the amendment imposes an unfair obligation on the \nAppropriations Committee. If the amendment is passed, the \nAppropriations Committee is given the Hobson's choice of having to \nrepeal the Wellstone amendment or to seek a directed scoring of the \ntransferred money so that it would count as nondefense discretionary \nspending--as it should. This would, in turn, require the relevant \nappropriations subcommittees to find offsets for this additional \nnondefense discretionary spending. If the Appropriations Committee \nreports a Defense appropriation bill consistent with the letter and \nintent of the Wellstone amendment, it will immediately be subject to a \n60-vote point of order.\n  For all of these reasons, the Wellstone amendment is bad legislation, \nand I urge all Senators to reject it, whether or not they favor the \nprogram that would benefit from this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this should be an easy vote for \nSenators: $5 million out of over $2 billion more than the Pentagon \nasked for to have an outreach program and enable local school districts \nto buy refrigerators so they can have a school breakfast program so \nthat we can make sure that all of our children go to school and are \nable to learn.\n  It is that simple. I mean, where are our priorities? We can't even \ncome up with $5 million? This is not a mandate. This just simply \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer this. This is a way \nthat we as a Senate can, in fact, commit a little bit more by way of \nresources to make sure that there is an adequate nutritious breakfast \nfor more children who go to school in America. How in the world can you \nvote against it?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, thirty-nine seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask whether or not the other side intends to \nrespond at all? If not, I will finish up. I am trying to wait for \nSenator Harkin, but I will go ahead and conclude. Might I ask whether \nthe other side has yielded back its time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina wishes to keep \nhis time reserved.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, a report from Tufts University Center \non Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition on the link between nutrition and \ncognitive development in children states that even before results are \ndetectable, inadequate food intake limits the ability of children to \nlearn, affecting their social interactions, intuitiveness, and overall \ncognitive functions.\n  Come on, we have to stop having all of these conferences on early \nchildhood development and talking about children, and now we know that \nwe have some 8 million children who don't get a chance to participate \nin this program, we know there are many children who are malnourished, \nand we know for $5 million a year out of this budget, which is $265 \nbillion, $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, we can't even \nmake this kind of small commitment to children in America? That is what \nthis vote is about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is reserved. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as he may require to Senator \nCoverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for the \n5 minutes, 40 seconds remaining of the time of the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from South Carolina and compliment \nhim on his fine work as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 771\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as \na cosponsor of the Dorgan-Lott-Daschle second-degree amendment to the \nMcCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the McCain amendment purports to create \nanother series of base realignment closure commissions. I am opposed to \nthat and have so stated and have so advised the Secretary of Defense. I \ndo not believe there should be another Base Realignment Closure \nCommission until the administration can certify to the Congress that \nall the work of the previous Base Realignment Closure Commissions has \noccurred and properly.\n  Many of us, particularly in the States affected by Air Force depots, \nbelieve the President and the administration undermined BRAC and \nundermined the confidence in the people and the Congress with regard to \nits integrity, because essentially the President overrode the 1995 BRAC \nrecommendations, in our judgment, particularly as they relate to Kelly \nAir Force Base in Texas and McClellan Air Force Base in California. \nThat is in dispute. I certainly acknowledge the comments and \ncharacterizations that have been made by the good Senators from Texas \nand California.\n  But this issue must be resolved and it must restore the confidence of \nthe Congress and it must reassert an integrity into the process for the \npeople who undergo this horrendous process, that the legislation has to \napply to the President, the administration and the Department of \nDefense, not just to the people in Congress.\n  I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment and in support of the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by Senators Dorgan, Lott and Daschle.\n  I yield any remaining time back to the managing Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table Wellstone amendment 670.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has not been yielded back on both \nsides.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield back any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina yields back \nthe remainder of his time. The Senator from Minnesota has 52 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Wellstone \namendment. This School Breakfast Program has been one of the best in \nthis country. Already we have kids getting school\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\nlunches, but they don't get the school breakfast.\n  I say that if you ever want to see a clean plate, you go to a school \nbreakfast program. These kids come in, they are hungry, there is not a \ndrop of food left when they put those trays back into the hopper. The \nschool lunch may be a little different.\n  If you really want to have an impact on early childhood education and \ngetting these kids to learn, this is the place to put the money. It was \nwrong to take it out of welfare reform. I tried at that time to put the \nmoney in, and we could not do it. It was wrong for this to be taken out \nin the welfare reform to save that kind of money. It does not save \nmoney. It ruins lives because we are not providing the money for the \noutreach program for the school breakfast startups and for the summer \nfeeding program.\n  This is a small amount of money. I think out of this whole defense \nthing we could at least authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer \na measly $5 million to get this job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is now yielded back. Time has expired \non this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 424\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on amendment No. 424 \noffered by the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton]. Debate on this \namendment is limited to 15 minutes equally divided between Senator \nGorton and Senator Inouye.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to speak on amendment \nNo. 424 to the defense authorization legislation that was proposed \nyesterday by my colleague, Senator Gorton. I am a cosponsor of this \namendment to require the Navy to reopen the selection process for the \ndonation of the USS Missouri.\n  From the beginning, I have followed closely the Navy's handling of \nthe Missouri, working with Senator Gorton, Congressman Norm Dicks, the \nWashington congressional delegation, and my constituents. The ``Mighty \nMo'' is a relic of immense importance and historical significance. It \nwas on the decks of this great battleship that World War II came to a \nwelcome end.\n  The Missouri is particularly valued by the residents of my home State \nwhere she has been berthed for most of the last 40 years in Bremerton. \nShe is a source of great pride to the veterans in my State, many of \nwhom served in World War II, including in the Pacific theater and \naboard the Missouri.\n  I have reviewed yesterday's debate over the amendment, and I want to \ntake this opportunity to make several additional remarks for the \nRecord.\n  I first want to commend both Senator Gorton and Senator Inouye. The \ndebate was indicative of the immense interest in the Missouri and all \nof the States that competed for the honor of displaying this important \npiece of our history.\n  While I cannot speak for the other applicants, I know of the care, \nthe time, and the commitment demonstrated by the Bremerton, WA, \ncommunity in preparing its proposal to the Navy. Bremerton, Kitsap \nCounty and Washington State have developed a kinship with the ``Mighty \nMo.'' It is because of this kinship with the battleship, and our 40-\nyear record of paying tribute to the Missouri each and every day, that \nI continue to believe that Bremerton is the ideal home for the \nMissouri.\n  Last August, the Secretary of the Navy announced the decision to \naward the Missouri to Honolulu, HI. Following the Navy's decision, \nsignificant questions were raised regarding the Navy's process in \nawarding the battleship. It is those questions, including a General \nAccounting Office report, that brings me here today to seek the \nSenate's support for our amendment to reopen the Missouri donee \nselection process.\n  I want to reiterate what our amendment seeks to accomplish. We simply \nseek only the Senate's support to instruct the Navy to conduct a new \ndonee selection process. We do not seek to influence or prejudge that \nselection process. We only want a fair competition administered by the \nNavy in a manner worthy of this great battleship.\n  I recognize that the Navy is under no obligation to conduct a \ncompetition for important relics like the Missouri, but the fact is the \nNavy did conduct a competition for the Missouri. Having conducted this \ncompetition, I think it is only fair to the competing communities to \nexpect the Navy to conduct itself in an aboveboard and a forthright \nmanner.\n  Clearly, significant mistakes were made by the Navy in the Missouri \ncompetition. The GAO report clearly identifies the Navy's numerous \nshortcomings in this competition. Proponents and opponents can and do \ndiffer over whether the Navy's handling of the competition influenced \nthe outcome. But I find it very difficult to conclude that all \ncommunities were treated fairly by the Navy. And that is what we are \nasking for today. It really is just a simple matter of fairness for all \nof the competing communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton-Murray-Feinstein \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the matter before us goes much deeper than \nthe gallant lady, the U.S.S. Missouri. It involves the process of \ncompetition in the U.S. Government. Every day there is some \ncompetition. There is a competition between two great manufacturing \nplants to see whether this plant should build a tank or that plant. \nThere are competitions going on as to what company should build the \njoint strike fighter or the C-17 or the B-2. Should it be Boeing? \nShould it be McDonnell Douglas?\n  These competitions are part of the life of the U.S. Government. And \nif we look upon this measure before us as a simple Missouri amendment, \nthen we have not seen the deeper picture; we will be setting a very, \nvery dangerous precedent, Mr. President.\n  This competition was won fairly and impartially. If the Congress of \nthe United States is to take a step to overturn this decision, then \nwhat will happen to all the other competitions that we have been faced \nwith? Whenever there is a contest on who would build that submarine--\nshould it be Norfolk or should it be Connecticut?--if Connecticut wins, \nshould Norfolk come to the Congress and appeal the case, or vice versa?\n  Mr. President, let me just read once again from the letter from the \nSecretary of the Navy. The Secretary says--and this is from a letter \ndated June 10; and it is part of the Record at this moment:\n\n       I have reviewed the General Accounting Office report .  .  \n     . and I find that it contains nothing that would warrant \n     reopening the process. The General Accounting Office stated \n     that the Navy ``impartially applied'' the donation selection \n     process, and that all applicants received the same \n     information at the same time .  .  . I remain confident that \n     my selection of Pearl Harbor was in the best interest of the \n     Navy and our Nation, based on the impartial review of the \n     relative merits of the four acceptable applications. .  .  . \n     The General Accounting Office also noted, however, that none \n     of the applicants requested clarification on any aspect of \n     these two criteria [that the proponents speak of].\n\n  No one complained about the process when it was ongoing. The \ncomplaints come at the end of the process.\n  It may interest you, Mr. President, to know that the State of \nMissouri--and this ship is named after the State of Missouri--by \nresolution that was passed unanimously by the Missouri Senate, the \ngeneral assembly, the House of Representatives concurring:\n\n       . . . memorialize the Congress of the United States, the \n     President of the United States, the Chief of Naval \n     Operations, and the Secretary of the Navy to take any \n     appropriate action necessary to permanently locate the U.S.S. \n     Missouri at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Hawaii, next to the \n     U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, for the purpose of serving as a \n     Naval Memorial and Museum. . . .\n\n  There is another organization, Mr. President. It is the Iowa Class \nPreservation Association. The U.S.S. Missouri is an Iowa class \nbattleship. I will not read the whole letter, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\n                  Iowa Class Preservation Association\n\n     To: Mr. Jerry Kremkow, USS Missouri Memorial Association, \n         2610 Kilihau St., Honolulu, HI.\n       Dear Mr. Kremkow, The Iowa Class Preservation Association \n     is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to acquiring \n     the museum rights to one of the Iowa Class Battleships \n     currently in storage.\n       All four ships were recently released by the US Navy and of \n     these only the USS Missouri, which looks like she's heading \n     to Pearl Harbor, seems safe from the scrap yard. Our \n     organization plans on acquiring and establishing one of the \n     three other ships as a museum in the city of San Diego, CA. \n     We believe that the combination of port facilities, tourism \n     base and the lack of capital ship museums on the west coast \n     would make San Diego an ideal location for a ship exhibit.\n       Our major concern is that the East Coast already has \n     several battleship and aircraft carrier museums and has \n     reached it saturation point. There is no way all three \n     battleships will be able to survive on the East Coast. \n     Therefore unless we can bring one of the three to the West \n     Coast, it is highly likely that at least one of these fine \n     ships will be scrapped.\n       As stated the purpose of our group is to save one of the \n     ships that is in danger of being lost due to lack of support. \n     As long as your organization is diligently seeking to acquire \n     the USS Missouri we will support you and not seek to obtain \n     the Missouri. We personally feel that a berth near the USS \n     Arizona Memorial would be an appropriate place for such an \n     historic ship. We look forward to working with your \n     organization in saving two of the magnificent battleships.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Daniels,\n       President.\n     Steven Rupp,\n       Vice President.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. It says that:\n\n       The Iowa Class Preservation Association  .  .  .  is \n     dedicated to acquiring the museum rights to one of the Iowa \n     Class Battleships currently in storage.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We personally feel that a berth near the USS Arizona \n     Memorial would be an appropriate place for [the Missouri].\n\n  Here we have a letter from the Navy League of the United States. And \nI ask unanimous consent that this letter, as well as another, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Navy League of the United States,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. John H. Dalton,\n     Secretary of the Navy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Dalton: I am writing on behalf of The USS \n     Missouri (BB63) Memorial Association and its efforts to have \n     the Battleship enshrined at Pearl Harbor.\n       As you are probably aware, the Navy League of the United \n     States is quite strong in the Pacific Area and particularly \n     in Honolulu which has the largest Navy League Council in the \n     world. This project has the complete support of the Pacific \n     Area Navy League, which has supplied much of manpower and \n     motivation to move this effort along for the past two years.\n       Our Hawaii Navy League councils, led by the Honolulu \n     Council have a proven record of ``getting the job done'' with \n     projects such as The Pearl Harbor Memorial, The Bowfin \n     Memorial, commissioning of USS Lake Erie and provisions of \n     MARS equipment for vessels deploying out of or thru Pearl \n     Harbor. We feel that this tribute to peace and victory \n     belongs along side of the revered USS Arizona Memorial in \n     Pearl Harbor. We urge you to look favorably on this project \n     and award USS Missouri to the Memorial Association for its \n     purposes.\n           Yours very truly,\n     J. Walsh Hanley.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Navy League of the United States,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, July 9, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: In Executive Session this afternoon the Board \n     of Directors of the Mid-Missouri Council of the Navy League \n     of the United States voted in favor of the transfer of the \n     battleship U.S.S. Missouri to Pearl Harbor. We feel this is \n     the most appropriate location for the Missouri.\n       We are opposed to the Gorton Amendment and urge you to vote \n     against it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Herman Smith,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. In part it states:\n\n       This project has the complete support of the Pacific Area \n     Navy League, which has supplied much of [the] manpower and \n     motivation to move this effort along for the past two years.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from the American Legion of the \nDepartment of Missouri, Inc. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                 Department of Missouri, Inc.,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: I am writing on behalf of The American \n     Legion State of Missouri to express our stronger possible \n     disagreement with the proposed Gorton Amendment (S. Admt. \n     424) to the Defense Authorization Bill (S. 936).\n       If adopted, this amendment will stop the transfer of the \n     battleship Missouri to Pearl Harbor and force the Secretary \n     of the Navy to reopen the competition. The American Legion \n     State of Missouri in convention voted unanimously to transfer \n     the battleship to Pearl Harbor. The 1996 General Assembly \n     State of Missouri unanimously passed a concurrent resolution \n     supporting the transfer to Pearl Harbor.\n       Pearl Harbor was chosen by the Secretary of the Navy after \n     rigorous evaluation as the site most suitable for \n     memorializing the Missouri. The process was fair and honest, \n     and the results should be carried out. We agree with this \n     decision.\n       USS Missouri belongs in Pearl Harbor, within sight of USS \n     Arizona, where future generations can come and understand \n     American's involvement in World War II, from beginning to \n     end.\n       I urge you and the honorable members of the United States \n     Senate to vote against the Gorton Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         James S. (Jim) Whitfield,\n                       Chairman, Legislative Assistance Committee.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. This letter makes it very clear that:\n\n       [The] USS Missouri belongs in Pearl Harbor, within site of \n     the USS Arizona, where future generations can come and \n     understand America's involvement in World War II, from \n     beginning to end.\n\n  Mr. President, the GAO report has been cited. The GAO report makes it \nvery clear that Pearl Harbor won the competition without question. And, \nmore importantly, Hawaii did not lose the competition even if it is \nbased solely on financial and technical issues.\n  Mr. President, I realize that no one relishes the thought of losing. \nWe all want to win. But the human affairs of this Nation would tell us \nthat at times one wins and another loses. And if we are to set a \nprecedent that whenever someone loses that he will come to Congress to \nappeal his case, the process that we have established for the past \ndecades to determine decisions that are very necessary to our Defense \nDepartment, if such be subject to appeal at each turn by the Congress, \nwe will get nowhere.\n  I just hope that those of us here will recognize from this report and \nfrom all other reports that this competition was won fairly and \nimpartially and that it is in the public interest and the interests of \nthe Navy and our Nation that this ship be based in Pearl Harbor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  There are approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds remaining for the \nproponents of the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 670, as Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I had previously moved to table the \nWellstone amendment. It seems there is some misunderstanding, but I so \nmove to table the Wellstone amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table the Wellstone amendment numbered 670, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Gorton amendment No. 424.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask the Chair to bring the Senate to \norder, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nWashington is entitled to be heard.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is still not in order. The \nPresiding Officer would appreciate it if the Senate would be in order. \nThe Presiding Officer hopes not to break the gavel.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have two congressional fellows, and I \nask unanimous consent that they be allowed floor privileges during the \npendency of this action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that King \nGillespie of my staff be allowed floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, a few years ago, when the battleship \nMissouri was decommissioned for the second time, after more than 30 \nyears, the Navy began a process to determine where it could become a \npermanent historic monument. The Navy carried on that process over an \nextended period of time under the rules that had been applicable to all \nprevious donations.\n  Two weeks before it made its final decision, the Navy informed the \napplicants of two additional and quite separate considerations. It did \nnot tell any of the applicants the weight those considerations would be \ngiven. It did not inform them of the fact that they could submit \nadditional items. They were really quite separate from the first set of \nconsiderations. At the end of that first round, Bremerton and Honolulu \nwere essentially tied. At end of the second and unfair round, the Navy \nawarded the Missouri to Honolulu.\n  The General Accounting Office--our General Accounting Office--has \nreported these changes, has reported that this was the wrong thing to \ndo, and has reported that the Navy should change its processes in the \nfuture.\n  My amendment does not seek to change the location of the Missouri. It \njust asks the Navy to start the process over again, to treat all \napplicants fairly, to set the rules in advance, and not to change the \nrules just before the game is over without telling people what the \nweight of the new rules will be.\n  I ask for your votes on it as a matter of simple fairness to all of \nthe applicants--both in California and Washington and in Hawaii--in a \nprocess which is very important to each one of these communities and \nwhich the Navy, very regrettably, has carried on in a totally unfair \nfashion to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, this proposal is very important both to \nthe opponents and proponents. I am still unable to hear because of the \nnoise in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask that Janice Nielsen, a \nlegislative fellow working in Senator Craig's office, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the duration of the debate on S. 936, the \ndefense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the GAO report makes it very clear that \nthe competition was impartial and fair and that, when all the numbers \nwere counted, Pearl Harbor was the winner because, as the Secretary of \nthe Navy has indicated, it will serve our Nation's interests and the \ninterests of the U.S. Navy to have the Missouri memorialized and made \ninto a monument next to the Arizona so that all Americans from this day \non will be able to see in one place the beginning and the end of World \nWar II.\n  But, more importantly, Madam President, this amendment does not \ninvolve just the Missouri. It involves the process of competition. If \nthe Congress is to be called upon at each time whenever someone loses, \nwhere do we end? Whenever there is a competition for the building of a \nsubmarine, should the losing State come forward to the Congress and ask \nfor reconsideration? If they lose a carrier, should the losing State \ncome here and ask the colleagues here for reconsideration? We have \ncompetition going on at every moment of the day.\n  Madam President, let us not set a bad precedent. I think the time has \ncome for decision. The merits are clear. The State of Missouri is in \nfavor of their ship being berthed in Hawaii. The American Legion is in \nfavor of that. The Navy League of the Pacific is in favor of that. I \nthink the Nation would prefer to have the U.S.S. Missouri have its \nfinal resting place in Pearl Harbor where it belongs.\n  Thank you, very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question occurs on amendment No. 424 offered by the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton].\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous-consent that the \nremaining rollcall votes in this series be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I was unavoidably delayed by the weather \ncoming in and just missed that last vote. I wonder if it would be all \nright with my colleagues if I ask unanimous consent to be recorded in \nfavor of the tabling on the last vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian informs the Presiding \nOfficer that unfortunately that unanimous-consent request is not \npermissible under the Senate rules.\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. That is acceptable to me, if the Record will indicate that \nI made the request.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I hope that the Record will show nothing \nwith reference to the Parliamentarian. The rule clearly states that \nonce the Chair has announced the results of a vote no Senator may be \nallowed to vote. Moreover, the Chair cannot even entertain such a \nrequest under the rule.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I withdraw that request. I wouldn't want \nto do anything to offend the rules. I have been flying in from Nairobi, \nAfrica, for the last 32 hours on British Airways, which has been on \nstrike, and had to change. And I can't tell you what I have gone \nthrough in the last 32 hours to try to get here for these votes. But I \nwouldn't want to offend the rules.\n  So I will leave it at that.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 424 offered by the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton]. On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I understand from the distinguished \nchairman of the committee there is no objection to this amendment. My \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and I offered this amendment. \nWe are asking for a recorded vote here because in so many instances \nover the past 5 years when we have had votes on Mexico, every one of \nthem has been over a negative issue. This resolution merely commends \nthe people of Mexico and the Government of Mexico for the very fine \nelection that they had last Sunday. I thought it would be worthwhile \nfor this body to say to Mexico how much we appreciate and admire their \nprocess last week and hope it portends great news for the coming years.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe 10 minutes equally divided, prior to a vote on the Dorgan second-\ndegree amendment to the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I yield my 10 minutes to Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2 \nminutes. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, could we have order? We are limited to \nthe time we have, and I think it is important everybody be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have cut defense since 1985 by 34 \npercent. We have closed 18 percent of the military bases. We have more \nnurses in Europe than we have combat infantry officers in Europe. We \nhave a huge\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\noverhang of bureaucracy, a huge overhang of bases that we have to shear \ndown to the size that is required for the force that we are now willing \nto fund in the House and Senate. In short, with this huge overhang of \nbureaucracy and bases, we have a tiger but increasingly the tooth is \ntoo small and the tail is too long.\n  Nobody wants base closings. We have closed five bases in my State. \nBut we all know it is something that needs to happen. So I intend to \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I intend to oppose \nthe Dorgan amendment, which for all practical purposes kills the \nunderlying amendment.\n  I think basically we have to recognize defense has been cut by 34 \npercent. We have closed only 18 percent of the military bases. If we \nare going to preserve modernization, if we are going to keep the pay \nand benefits to maintain the finest people in uniform we have ever had, \nwe are going to have to close more military bases.\n  So, I hate it, as I am sure many of our colleagues do, but there is \nno alternative, given the amount of money that the House and Senate are \nwilling to appropriate. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Dorgan \namendment and to support the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could we clarify the unanimous consent agreement we are \noperating under? I understand there is 10 minutes equally divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents of the Dorgan amendment, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas has just used information that is \nnot accurate. He is referring only, when he talks about 18 percent, to \nthe bases in this country. We have also closed bases overseas. When you \nadd that to it, the total bases closed represent about 27 percent of \nthe infrastructure.\n  But the point of my second-degree amendment is to say this: Let us at \nthis point not authorize two additional rounds of base closures until \nwe figure out what we have done, what the consequences of what we have \ndone are in the last four rounds. We do not have all the facts about \nwhat the last four rounds have given us in terms of costs and benefits.\n  Let me not speak for myself. Let me have the Congressional Budget \nOffice do it, and the GAO has done something similar. It says:\n\n       The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round \n     of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out.\n\n  That is what CBO says. Then CBO says:\n\n       That consideration, however, should follow an interval \n     during which the DOD and independent analysts examine the \n     actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  Why does CBO say that we ought to wait and take a measure of what we \nhave done? Because they cannot get the facts. No one knows what are the \ncosts and what are the savings. What CBO is saying is let's figure out \nwhat we have done. We have ordered the closure of nearly 100 military \ninstallations and only about half of them have been fully closed. At \nthis point, let us finish that closure, assess the costs and the \nbenefits, and then proceed, if necessary, to authorize additional base \nclosures.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield a minute-and-a-half to me?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield a minute-and-a-half to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I join the majority leader in \nsupporting the Dorgan amendment. I do so because, in our recent trips \noverseas, we have found a new military base, a U.S. military base in \nKuwait; we have a new one at Prince Sultan in Saudi Arabia; we have \nbeen expanding a new one at Aviano, in Italy. The Hungarians believe we \nare going to continue to maintain their base once they join NATO.\n  It will take no Base Closure Commission for the administration to \nstart closing bases overseas. I would rather see them stop building new \nbases overseas. But, certainly we need a report like this to try and \nget some idea about what is going on.\n  Last, I would say this, almost 40 percent of our military personnel \ntoday who are combat personnel are overseas. I do not believe we should \nhave a Base Closure Commission to decide how many bases to close here \nat home until they return. It is not time to have a new base closure \ncommission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona will yield me 1 \nminute?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 60 percent of the bases overseas have been \nclosed, and that is a fact. I don't know where the Senator from Alaska \nhas been traveling, but I suggest he go to Germany where we have \nbasically dismantled our huge defense establishment, which was \nnecessary and no longer is. There are stacks and stacks of information \nthat can be provided about the costs that have been reduced as a result \nof the base closings that have taken place.\n  Finally, we are now in an Orwellian argument that not closing bases \nsomehow saves money. It is the strangest argument I have been through \non the floor of the Senate. We have to reduce these.\n  I do not intend to move to table the Dorgan amendment. I expect the \nDorgan amendment will win. But I will tell my colleagues right now, \nthis will be a sad day.\n  This will be a sad day in the history of the Senate, because we will \nnot have fulfilled our obligations to the men and women in the military \nbecause we continue to siphon off money to pay for bases that we don't \nneed instead of paying for the troops and the equipment that they need \nto fight and win.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield 1 minute to me?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island, former \nSecretary of the Navy, and then the remaining time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Rhode Island \nis recognized. Mr. President, I support the Levin-McCain amendment, \nwhich will allow the Defense Department to reduce its excess \ninfrastructure and use resulting savings for needed equipment \nmodernization.\n\n  After four rounds of base closings (1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995), the \nU.S. military has eliminated 21 percent of its base structure. Overall \nforce structure, people and weapons starting in 1988 and ending 5 years \nfrom now on the other hand, is being reduced by 36 percent. This gap \nbetween the level of our forces and our infrastructure should not \ncontinue to exist indefinitely. If we do not continue the process of \nreducing excess capacity, the Defense Department will not have the \nfunds to modernize its increasingly outdated weaponry and continue to \nmaintain adequate readiness.\n  Today, we have heard arguments that the savings promised by earlier \nbase closure rounds either have not materialized or have not been fully \naccounted for. Mr. President, I do not believe that we have to document \nexactly how much has been saved to the last nickel from previous BRAC's \nin order to continue this necessary process.\n  The fact of the matter is that previous base closures have resulted \nin substantial savings, currently estimated to be a total of $13.5 \nbillion. The final amount of these savings may not be known for years. \nPerhaps these savings have not been as great as originally thought, but \nthey have been there. You simply cannot reduce 21 percent of your \ninfrastructure and not come up with some significant cost savings. \nSecretary of Defense Cohen--who endured some very painful base closings \nin his State as a Senator--has estimated that two additional rounds \nwould result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion annually.\n  Mr. President, all six members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--who \naccount for some 24 stars--have written Congress to urge two additional \nbase closures. The previous BRAC itself also recommended additional \nreductions. The Joint Chiefs recognize that our troops ought to be \narmed with the very best equipment when called to battle. It was this \ntechnological edge that proved so valuable in the gulf war.\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\n  But these weapons have a cost, and continuing to expend valuable \nresources on unneeded infrastructure will hinder modernization and \ndetract from readiness. I urge support for the Levin-McCain amendment \nand opposition to the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I certainly hope the prediction of the Senator from \nArizona is not accurate, that the Dorgan amendment will prevail. I \nthink it is not a good amendment. We have to reduce the base structure \nin the country as we bring down the forces. I support the efforts of \nSenator McCain vigorously and hope he will prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment and very \nmuch oppose the Dorgan amendment. I hope we will listen to General \nShalikashvili. This is what he said when he testified:\n\n       As difficult as it is politically, we will have to further \n     reduce our infrastructure. We have more excess infrastructure \n     today than we did when the BRAC process started. We need to \n     close more facilities, as painful and as expensive as it is.\n\n  We should listen to the head of our uniformed military. The Secretary \nof Defense has told us we cannot afford this waste of resources in an \nenvironment of tough choices and fiscal constraint. We must shed \nweight. The savings are on this chart. They have been estimated by the \nDepartment of Defense. We have a letter from all of the Joint Chiefs \npleading with us, it is called a 24-star letter, all the Joint Chiefs, \nand the chairman and the vice chairman pleading with us to shed excess \nweight.\n  I hope we will not adopt the Dorgan amendment. If we adopt it, it \nwill destroy the possibility that this year--this year--as we propose \nin the McCain amendment, we will again do what we must do, as painful \nas it is. And those of us who come from States which have had bases \nclosed and which face additional base closings, as I do in my State, \nunderstand that pain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota controls 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield a minute to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Dorgan-Lott substitute and against the McCain amendment. Even if \nthis substitute is not adopted, I urge them to vote against the McCain \namendment, and the reason is, for the first time in the four base \nclosing rounds, this administration played politics. They said, ``Well, \nwe're going to accept all of them except for two.'' That has never \nhappened. It didn't happen in the first round, it didn't happen in the \nsecond round, and it didn't happen in the third round. It happened in \nthe fourth round.\n  I don't think we should give them additional rounds until we have a \nclear understanding that we are not going to play politics. We are \ngoing to close bases on the merits and not on electoral votes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Dorgan-Lott substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 1 \nminute 12 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I have voted for every \nprevious round of base closings and intend to vote again when \nadditional bases are needed to be closed, but if this is, in fact, \nabout saving money, then let us at least pay some heed to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that additional base closing \nrounds ought to follow an interval during which the Department of \nDefense and independent analysts examine the actual impact of what has \nbeen done so far. If this is, in fact, about saving money, let's take \nthe advice of the Congressional Budget Office and figure out what we \nhave done before we decide to do more, what has the cost and the \nbenefit been of what we have done.\n  The majority leader, the minority leader, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nStevens, and so many others have cosponsored this second-degree \namendment, which is very simple. The second-degree amendment asks the \nSecretary of Defense to prepare and submit to Congress a report on the \ncosts and savings on the closure rounds that have already been \noccurring and to give us information that we don't now have before we \nproceed to talk about additional rounds of base closures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague, \nthe Senator from Virginia, who has been standing to make a statement, \nbe granted 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my colleague from Arizona. We have given a great \ndeal of attention to the fact that the tooth-to-tail ratio is \ncompletely out of whack. It used to be 50-50 10 years ago. It is close \nto 70-30 now. The tail being the support of everything else. If we want \nto support force structure, if we want to be capable of carrying out \nour commitments, we have to cut infrastructure. The savings start as \nsoon as we begin to cut infrastructure. We can argue about how many \ndollars later on.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Adopt the Dorgan-Lott second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A rollcall has not been requested on this \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

About 10 to 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Several years ago, I and a number of my colleagues took a \ntrip. One of the places we went to was Angola. It was a beautiful \ncountry. It is a country that has been devastated by war. We did not \nsee the wild animals roaming the plains as they did at one time. We did \nnot see the oil fields pumping as well as they should have. What we did \nsee were hundreds of people who had been injured by landmines. Their \nlegs were gone, their arms were gone. We, of course, did not see the \npeople who were killed on a daily basis in Angola from landmines.\n  If Angola were the only place in the world that had been devastated \nby landmines, perhaps we should not take the time of this body by \nlooking at it. But Angola is important, and where the antipersonnel \nlandmines have ravaged the countryside, we in this body must be \nconcerned.\n  I rise today, having introduced an amendment to accelerate the \nremoval of millions of abandoned antipersonnel landmines. This is just \none more important step in the long and difficult job of stopping \nforever the killing and maiming of innocent men, women and children, by \nthese useless relics of warfare and terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I am appreciative of the work that has been done by \nSenator Pat Leahy on bringing to our attention the devastating problem \nof abandoned landmines. He has fought long and hard and spoken out on \nthis issue, and I appreciate that. He has a long-time commitment to \nterminating this threat to innocent noncombatants. The whole world, and \nespecially the developing world, owes Senator Leahy thanks for his \nleadership in forever banning these instruments of war.\n  These landmines have limited military utility, with primary value \nfound in the terror and timidity they incite in the enemy infantry. \nModern military battles, though, are not won by the infantry. Victory \nmay very well be sealed by the infantry, but the battle is won by the \nair, by the artillery and by the armored mechanized forces.\n  My amendment responds to a terribly tragic situation in which an \nunnecessary weapon remains long after battle, and wreaks its terror and \nits death and destruction on innocent civilians.\n  Mr. President, I am going to recite some statistics that are \nunbelievable, for lack of a better description.\n  It is estimated that there are more than 100 million of these \nlandmines buried and abandoned in 64 different countries. That is one \nlandmine for every 50 people on this Earth. I have talked about Angola. \nThe Angolan war lasted for much more than a decade. The country of \nAngola has 10 million people in it, but buried in the dirt in Angola \nare more than 20 million landmines, 2 landmines for every person in \nAngola.\n  They are buried, they are unexploded, they are unrecovered, and they \nare waiting for women and children, principally, to step on them. Why \nwomen and children? Because the women are often the ones to work the \nfields and the children are the ones that often unknowingly stray into \nthe abandoned minefields.\n  In Angola, 120 people die every month from landmines. Four people a \nday in Angola are killed. This does not take into consideration the \nscores, the hundreds of people that I saw in Angola missing legs and \narms.\n  Every month in Cambodia, 300 Cambodians are casualties--10 casualties \neach and every day.\n  Afghanistan, Mozambique, Croatia, Bosnia, Vietnam--in all these \ncountries, and more, the toll mounts.\n  We were in Bosnia a year or so ago. While we were there a call came \nover the commander's radio, a call reporting a landmine casualty. It \nwas a Russian who had had a leg blown off by a landmine. These are \noccurrences that happen all the time.\n  In the world, we have about 70 casualties a day, 500 each week, \n30,000 a year. These casualties are unnecessary, and without action on \nour part--we cannot leave it to anyone else--they\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\nare going to continue to be unavoidable.\n  Most of those killed and injured have not done anything but try to \nfarm, walk to school, walk to the market, walk to a hospital, take a \nshortcut home. Some of the children are just playing in the fields \naround their homes. But, on this day, playing around their homes, their \nfarms or their schools, a landmine goes off, killing or maiming the \nchild.\n  Think of it, Mr. President, every day not knowing whether any \nparticular step you take is going to wind up in death or losing a limb \nor limbs. People should not have to live that way.\n  We, as the most powerful Nation in the world, have an obligation, I \nbelieve, with the great scientific minds we have in this country, to \nfigure out a way to better detect those mines and to remove them.\n  Estimates from a year ago projected that about 100,000 landmines were \nbeing removed each year while about 2.5 million mines were being placed \nin the Earth each year. So what does this mean? Humanity, zero; \nlandmines, 2.4 million every year. That is no contest.\n  Like most problems, the abandoned landmine problem is rooted in \neconomics. How much does it cost to remove a landmine? Lots of money, \nup to $1,000 a landmine. How much does it cost to place a landmine in \nthe ground? A couple bucks. That is all.\n  The recovery costs go up dramatically when the mine field maps are \nlost or purposely destroyed or become so old as to engender no \nconfidence in the minds of the recovery crews.\n  If we do not outlaw antipersonnel landmines, the economics guarantees \nproliferation of this barbaric practice. The economics of mine warfare \nguarantee more death and maiming and destruction unless these devices \nare forever outlawed and stockpiles around the world are quickly \ndestroyed.\n  But the world community might not outlaw antipersonnel landmines \nbecause they are so cheap and easy to use. I say that antipersonnel \nlandmines have no place in a civilized world. We must stop the \ndistribution of these implements of terror that spread permanent \ndisability, disfigurement, and death wherever they have been used.\n  There is pending in the Senate a bill to permanently ban the use of \nantipersonnel landmines. I support that legislation, as do 58 other \nSenators. This is the legislation that has been led by Senator Leahy.\n\n  But even if the Senate supports this ban, others in the world \ncommunity may not. The best and most effective way of banning landmines \nis to make them useless by making their discovery cheap and easy and by \ndeveloping faster and cheaper ways of clearing landmines. This would be \nboth a humanitarian advance and a lifesaving action for our troops on \ncombat missions.\n  To do this successfully we must better develop capabilities to locate \nburied landmines, and then we need to develop new and more effective \nways to clear them.\n  A few months ago, Mr. President, I made a tour of the lab at \nLivermore in California, one of our national laboratories. I said to \nthem, how much money are we spending to find a way to remove these \nlandmines? They said about $100,000 a year.\n  We can do better than that.\n  The magnitude of this task is significant. If one man could locate \nand recover one landmine every hour, that would be eight devices per 8-\nhour day per man in the field. Today's technology, of course, does not \nallow us to do it anywhere near as quickly as that. But even at that \nrate, which we cannot achieve today, it would take 1,000 men working 7 \ndays a week, 24 hours a day, 34 years to remove the landmines that are \nnow buried. But remember, we are putting in about 2.4 million extra \nones each year.\n  There are a lot of ideas out there of what we can do. We need to \nfocus on developing and deploying landmine remediation systems while \ncontinuing the research that promises better capability in the future.\n  An area of the Nevada test site has been equipped and used by our \nnational laboratories for testing new ways of landmine detection and \nlocation. For example, at the Nevada test site, which was used for \nunderground nuclear explosions and aboveground nuclear explosions, we \ncan test these in many different ways. Systems were tested that \npermitted remote locations of buried landmines under favorable \nconditions. But much improvement is needed because conditions are \nalmost never favorable.\n  We will shortly begin testing a new concept that promises a better \nperformance, and has the added value of detecting nonmetallic \nlandmines, because the people who develop these weapons of destruction \nhave gone a step further. They are no longer metal, they are plastic. \nThis new concept allows detection and discrimination of buried objects \nat much greater depths. But we need to do something to develop the \ntechnique.\n  As progress is made in landmine detection and location, we need to \ndevelop and test better ways of landmine recovery and destruction. We \ncan do that. That is what this amendment is all about. There is plenty \nof talent, scientifically, to do it. We just need the support for \ninfrastructure, personnel, equipment, and field work to do something \nabout it.\n  I say, again, antipersonnel landmines have no place in the future of \ncivilized nations. We need to get on with developing better capability \nto remove these devices that are already deployed. Cheaper and faster \nlandmine clearing will protect both innocent civilians and our combat \ntroops and it will remove much of the incentive to spread more of these \nterrible instruments of terror, injury, death, and destruction.\n  The amendment I have submitted today will permit our national \nlaboratories to use their superb talents for accelerated development of \nlandmine detection and clearing technologies. The report language for \nthe National Defense Authorization Act includes direction to the \nDepartment of Defense to establish more effective collaboration with \nthe weapons laboratories of the Department of Energy.\n  This amendment is consistent with that direction. It will apply an \nexisting national resource to this important mission and it will \nfacilitate the development and testing of a new technology that \npromises mine detection performance well beyond that of any existing \ncapability. This amendment will make antipersonnel landmines useless by \ncheap and easy detection, localization, and removal.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I had pointed \nout during the course of the debate that in the 22\\1/2\\ years I have \nbeen here, probably the most important goal I had hoped to see achieved \nduring my tenure in the Senate was a balanced budget.\n  I had, on several occasions, voted against a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget simply because of my reverence for the \nConstitution and for my belief that economic policy has no place in the \nConstitution. I had always argued and will argue until my dying day \nthat balancing the budget is a matter of will by the Members of the \nU.S. Congress, and to suggest that the only way we can screw up the \nnerve and stiffen our spines to balance the budget is to put it in the \nConstitution is demeaning in the extreme.\n  So that is why in 1993 I voted for the reconciliation bill that \nraised taxes and cut spending. It raised taxes on 1\\1/2\\ percent of the \nwealthiest people in America and cut spending by $250 billion over a 5-\nyear period, all of which\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\ncombined was supposed to reduce the deficit from what it would \notherwise be by $500 billion over the ensuing 5 years. Mr. President, \nthat 5-year period is not yet up, but in 1998 on the fifth anniversary \nof the passage of that bill, it will not have saved $500 billion, it \nwill have saved $1 trillion and more. That bill is responsible for the \ndeficit going from almost $300 billion in 1992 to what we thought was \n$67 billion until today.\n  It has been a source of unbelievable satisfaction to me to see the \ndeficit in 1993 go from $290 billion anticipated to $254; in 1994, to \n$205 billion; in 1995, $154 billion; in 1996, $107 billion; in 1997, \nanticipated to be $67 billion, and this morning's front page of the \nWashington Post says that because the economy is so good and people are \npaying taxes that the deficit this year will be $45 billion or less. \nThat will be the smallest deficit we have had, as we lawyers like to \nsay, since the memory of man runneth not.\n  The reason I rise to speak, Mr. President, is not just to catalog \nthat history with which all the Senators are all too familiar, but to \npoint out another item that was included in that Washington Post story. \nIt said if we can just get the House and Senate conferees to keep \nbickering for another year and not pass this tax cut, we could easily \nbalance the budget in 1998.\n  Two weeks ago when I offered my amendment to forgo tax cuts, I said \nwe should forgo tax cuts, honor what I consider to be a nonnegotiable \ndemand by the American people to balance the budget and balance the \nbudget in 2001, maybe even 2000. And now this morning's paper says you \ndo not have to postpone taxes to do it in 2001. If you postpone taxes, \nyou can do it in 1998. Never, never in modern times have we been so \nclose to actually doing what most of us say we want to do, and that is \nbalance the budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, I got a whopping 18 votes for my amendment 2 \nweeks ago. I am not going to call the names of the Senators that voted \nwith me, but I hope people will look at the Record and see who had the \ncourage, who had the vision and the spine to stand up on the floor of \nthe Senate and vote for an eminently sensible proposal to balance the \nbudget earlier, much earlier, than the bill we were debating. And 4 of \nthose courageous 18 people were up for reelection next year. They \ncertainly have my praise and my respect because they believe in the \nAmerican people and they were willing to stand up and vote for a \nreduction of the deficit as opposed to a tax cut.\n\n  If you ask the American people, would you favor this $135 billion tax \ncut over the next 5 years, or would you prefer a balanced budget over \nthe next 2 years, I can tell you the answer would be 70 percent to 80 \npercent of the people would opt for a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, the 18 votes I got to postpone the tax cuts in order \nto bring about a balanced budget much sooner is the smallest number of \nvotes I have ever received on an amendment since I have been in the \nSenate. And it was probably as good, as authentic and courageous an \namendment as I have ever offered since I have been in the Senate. It \ncould have changed the economic course of the country.\n  Mr. President, the article in the paper this morning got one thing \ntotally wrong. The article stated that neither the Democrats nor the \nRepublicans are going to be able to take credit for the balanced \nbudget.\n  I take strong exception to that as a Democrat. Two of the finest \nSenators we ever had in the U.S. Senate lost their seats in 1994 \nbecause they stood up and voted for the 1993 budget which raised \ncertain people's taxes. The House of Representatives fell to the \nRepublicans in 1994 when Newt Gingrich became speaker and the U.S. \nSenate went to the Republicans and there was not one Republican in the \nHouse or the Senate that voted for that bill which has brought about \nthis exhilarating chance to actually balance the budget.\n  So to say that President Clinton has not been courageous in proposing \nthe 1993 budget package is a terrible injustice and it is wrong. It is \nhis legacy. It is the legacy of this President that he stood firm on \ndeficit reduction in offering that bill, which cost the Democrats \ndearly at the polls the following year. So far as I am concerned, the \nstock market has been soaring ever since that bill was passed in 1993, \ndespite the promises of some of the most distinguished Senators on the \nother side, who said that this is going to end the world as we know it, \nand you are going to see people out of work and more homeless people, \nand you are going to see a depression if we pass this bill.\n\n  We passed the bill. The stock market took off because people were \nencouraged and finally believed that the people down here knew what \nthey were doing and were finally going to screw up their nerve and give \nthem a sound fiscal Government. It has been going on ever since, and \nthat is precisely the reason we are within striking distance of \nbalancing the budget right now. To say nobody can claim credit for that \nis a real stretch. It was President Clinton. It was not easy. Most of \nyou will recall that the Vice President had to come over and sit in the \nchair and break a tie in order to pass that bill. Today, the American \npeople are the beneficiaries.\n  I hope that the conferees are unable to reach an agreement on this, \nbecause if they don't reach an agreement, we can balance the budget. If \nthey do reach an agreement, Lord only knows what the results are going \nto be. All we know is that the wealthiest people in America are going \nto get a handsome tax cut and the budget is not going to be balanced.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise tonight to set the record straight on what \nI think is an extremely important event. I was absolutely euphoric this \nmorning to read that the deficit that was anticipated to be $127 \nbillion this year was then calculated to be about $104 billion, and \nthen calculated about 3 months ago to be $67 billion, and this morning \ncalculated to be $45 billion. It is beyond our wildest dreams. Why \nwould we not seize the moment to forego this tax cut and do precisely \nwhat the American people want us to do? It isn't too late.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7092-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7093-S7113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 778\n\n    (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to revise the \n requirements for procurement of products of Federal prison industries \n                   to meet needs of Federal agencies)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nAbraham, Robb, Helms, Kempthorne, Daschle, and Burns. This is to \nimplement the recommendation of the National Performance Review that we \nshould require Federal prison industries to compete commercially for \nFederal agencies' business instead of having a legally protected \nmonopoly.\n  Mr. President, our amendment will eliminate the requirement for \nFederal agencies to purchase prisoner-made goods even when they cost \nmore and are of lesser quality. This amendment will ensure that the \ntaxpayers get the best possible value for their Federal procurement \ndollars. If a Federal agency can get a better product at a lower price \nfrom the private sector, it should be permitted to do so. The taxpayers \nwill get the savings.\n  Many in Government and in industry point out that the Federal Prison \nIndustries' products are often more expensive than commercial products, \ninferior in quality, or both. For example, the Deputy Commander of the \nDefense Logistics Agency wrote in a May 3, 1996, letter to the House \nthat Federal Prison Industries had a 42-percent delinquency rate in its \nclothing and textile deliveries, compared to a 6-percent rate for the \ncommercial industry. For this record of poor performance, the Federal \nPrison Industries charged prices that were an average of 13-percent \nhigher than commercial prices. Five years earlier, the DOD inspector \ngeneral reached the same conclusion, reporting that the Federal Prison \nIndustries' contracts were more expensive than contracts for comparable \ncommercial products by an average of 15 percent. Now, the Department of \nDefense made roughly $150 million in purchases from Federal Prison \nIndustries last year, and so this is currently costing the Department \nof Defense, alone, $25 million.\n  Mr. President, it just makes no sense that, with all of the \nadvantages in terms of labor price, which is nominal in prison, that \nthey can assert a monopoly which gives them the right to sell to the \nDefense Department products at a greater cost than the Defense \nDepartment could buy them in the commercial market, and this amendment \nwould correct that.\n  At this point, I want to yield to my good friend and colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, for his statement. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be immediately recognized thereafter to complete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The junior Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend who \nbrings us, I think, a wise amendment tonight, which I am happy to \ncosponsor. This is a pretty simple amendment, really. It does not say \nthat anybody should get a preference over the Prison Industries, but \nsimply that those who are in the private sector, who create jobs for \npeople, who play by the rules and work hard, ought to have the same \nopportunity to bid on Federal contracts that the Federal Prison \nIndustries themselves enjoy.\n  As my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has indicated, we have \nnumerous examples that suggest that, right now, the Federal taxpayers \nare not getting their money's worth when Federal agencies purchase \noffice equipment, because the Prison Industries' costs are greater than \nwould be the case if the private sector were involved. Moreover, of \ncourse, it is our view that if competition was injected into the \nsystem, the cost would go down, even though it is conceivable that the \nPrison Industries would continue to be the contractor chosen for the \nproduction and provision of such furnishings.\n  In my State, Mr. President, we have a lot of people in this industry. \nI have spoken with them in the plants in which they work--not just the \npeople who run the plants, but the people working on the floor making \nthe finest furniture in the world. They have an interesting take on the \nway we do business. They say: Doesn't it seem unusual that we should \nwork hard, 40 hours a week, and sometimes more, to produce a high-\nquality piece of furniture, and that we should have a certain amount of \nthe money we earn for that hard work sent to Washington to pay taxes, \nor sent to Lansing, or wherever, and then that we should see those tax \ndollars go to the Federal Government to be used, at least in part, to \nsupport the development of an industry that competes with us and \nprevents us from having the opportunity to create better paying jobs \nand more jobs?\n  That doesn't make sense to them, Mr. President, and it doesn't make \nsense to me. It seems that we ought to pride ourselves here on \nproviding our taxpayers the most efficient Government possible. That \nought to mean that when we purchase equipment and furniture for the \nFederal departments and agencies, we get the best bargain possible and \nthat we at least make sure that folks who work hard and play by the \nrules in the furniture industry, or any other industry, have the \nopportunity to benefit from the Federal contracts that are let to \npurchase furniture and other sorts of items that help us in the Federal \nagencies and departments. To me, this is just pure common sense. So for \nthat reason I support this amendment.\n  I think all we are asking for here is a level playing field--no \nspecial preference, no exclusion of the private sector from the bidding \nprocess. If the furniture made by the Federal Prison Industries is the \nbest deal, then that is who ought to be doing the work. But if it is \nnot, then the taxpayers deserve the best deal.\n\n  As to a broader point, I just want to say this. I believe that people \nin prisons should work. This is in no way, or should it be in any way, \ninterpreted as an amendment designed to suggest that those who are \ndoing hard time should stop doing hard time or that those who are \nlearning trades and skills ought to be in any way prevented from doing \nso. But it seems to me that what makes sense is for the Prison \nIndustries to focus primarily on providing services, and so on, in \nareas where they aren't competing with American workers and American \njobs in the private sector. I think, at a minimum, we should level the \nplaying field so that that can occur.\n  For those reasons, I am happy to support this amendment as a \ncosponsor. I look forward to the continuation of this debate tomorrow \non the floor as well.\n  Under the previous order, I yield the floor back to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield to the chairman of the committee who, I \nunderstand, wants to make a statement at this time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Senator Levin, would seriously damage the functioning of \nthe Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated known as FPI.\n  FPI is the Bureau of Prisons' most important inmate program. It keeps \ninmates productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the \nviolence\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nand disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus it is essential to the \nsecurity of Federal correctional institutions, the communities in which \nthey are located, and the safety of Federal correctional staff and \ninmates. Eliminating FPI's mandatory source status in law would \ndramatically reduce the number of inmates FPI would be able to employ. \nThe inmate idleness this would create would seriously undermine the \nsafety and security of America's Federal prisons.\n  In addition to the general benefit of keeping our prison population \nemployed, the Federal Prison Industries Program has the added benefit \nthat 50 percent of the wages paid to prisoners employed under the \nprogram are used to pay off fines and provide restitution to the \nvictims of their crimes. This is an important benefit that must not be \nimpeded.\n  FPI has no other outlet for its products than Federal agencies. The \nconstraints within which FPI operates cause it to be less efficient \nthan its private sector counterparts. While private sector companies \nspecialize and become highly efficient in certain product areas, FPI, \nin an attempt to limit its market share in any one area, has \ndiversified its product line. Private sector companies strive to obtain \nthe most modern, efficient equipment to minimize the labor component of \ntheir manufacturing costs. FPI, on the other hand must keep its \nmanufacturing process as labor intensive as possible in order to employ \nthe maximum number of inmates.\n  Since FPI operates its factories in secure correctional environments, \nit faces additional constraints that limit its efficiency. For example, \nevery tool must be checked out at the beginning of the day, checked in \nbefore lunch, checked out again in the afternoon, and checked in at the \nend of the day. In addition, Federal Prison Industries factories are \noccasionally forced to shut down because of inmate unrest or \ninstitutional disturbances. The costs associated with civilian \nsupervision and numerous measures necessary to maintain the security of \nthe prison add substantially to the cost of production.\n  It should be noted that the average Federal inmate has an 8th grade \neducation, is 37 years old, is serving a 10-year sentence for a drug \nrelated offense, and has never held a steady job. According to a recent \nstudy by an independent firm, the overall productivity rate of an \ninmate with a background like this is approximately \\1/4\\ that of a \ncivilian worker.\n  FPI must have some method of offsetting these inefficiencies if it is \nexpected to acquire a reasonable share of Government contracts and \nremain self financing. The offsetting advantage that Congress has \nprovided is the mandatory sourcing requirements in section 4124 of \ntitle 18, United States Code. This section requires that Federal \nagencies purchase products made by FPI as long as those products meet \ncustomer needs for quality, price, and timeliness of delivery. If the \nproduct is not currently manufactured by FPI, or if the FPI is not \ncompetitive in quality, price or timeliness, Federal Prison Industries \nwill grant a waiver to allow the Federal agency to purchase the product \nfrom private sector suppliers.\n  The amendment proposed by Senator Levin would force the Attorney \nGeneral to require that Federal agencies purchase FPI products on a \ncase-by-case basis, increasing paperwork and administrative expense \nunnecessarily. The current FPI mandatory source requirement provides a \nsteady flow of work to the inmate population and reduces the \nrequirement for FPI to expend large amounts of money on advertising and \nmarketing. If such expenses had to be incurred, sales levels and market \nshare would have to be expanded to cover them. This would have an \nadverse impact on private sector companies in the same businesses as \nFPI.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Levin amendment. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that a letter from the Council of Prison Locals \nof the AFL-CIO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Federal Prison Council 33,\n\n\n                                                     (AFL-CIO)\n\n                                                    June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator. I am writing to express the strong opinion of \n     the Council of Prison Locals, American Federation of \n     Government Employees, against Senator Levin's proposed \n     amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill. The Levin \n     Amendment would eliminate mandatory source status for Federal \n     Prison Industries (FPI), a wholly-owned corporation of the \n     Federal Government.\n       The Council of Prison Locals is the exclusive \n     representative of 22,000 bargaining unit employees nationwide \n     working in the nation's Federal Prisons. Our members feel \n     that this is the Bureau of Prisons most important \n     correctional program.\n       We have several concerns with the Levin Amendment. The \n     first concern is that FPI should be looked at as part of the \n     overall Bureau of Prisons program. This should include \n     hearings on the Judiciary Committee. We feel the safety of \n     thousands of Correctional Workers is in jeopardy because of \n     the ``perception'' that FPI is somehow controlling the \n     Federal market. This could not be further from the truth. We \n     believe that FPI is part of safe prison management of our \n     facilities and should not be an amendment to some unrelated \n     legislation.\n       We urge you to oppose the Levin Amendment and keep the \n     Federal Prison System safe for its workers.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Phil Glover,\n\n                                Northeast Regional Vice President,\n                                   Council of Prison Locals, AFGE.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, last July, a master chief petty officer of the Navy \ntestified before the House National Security Committee that the FPI \nmonopoly on the Government furniture contract has undermined the Navy's \nability to improve living conditions for its sailors. This was his \ntestimony.\n\n       Speaking frankly, the FPI product is inferior, costs more, \n     takes longer to procure. FPI has, in my opinion, exploited \n     their special status, instead of making changes that would \n     make them more efficient and competitive. The Navy and other \n     services need your support to change the law and have Federal \n     Prison Industries compete with private sector furniture \n     manufacturers under GSA contract. Without this change, we \n     will not be serving sailors or taxpayers in the most \n     effective and efficient way.\n\n  There was a coalition that joined together to try to provide for \ncompetition. All we are asking for is the private sector to be allowed \nto compete when its product costs less and when its product is a better \nquality. The competition in contracting at coalition is made up of 28 \norganizations and 204 businesses. Their letter, in part, reads as \nfollows, that this amendment would implement a recommendation of the \nNational Performance Review which stated that our Government should \n``take away Federal Prison Industries' status as a mandatory source of \nFederal supplies and be required to compete commercially for Federal \nagencies' business.'' This solution would help manufacturers by \neliminating the barriers to competition and allowing the bid process to \ntake place.\n  We received a letter from Access Products of Colorado Springs, CO. \nThey were denied an opportunity to bid on an Air Force contract for \ntoner cartridges because Federal Prison Industries exercised its right \nto take the contract on a sole-source basis.\n  This is a small business in Colorado trying to sell to the \nGovernment. They have to compete with incredibly cheap labor in the \nprisons, which ranges between 23 cents an hour and $1.15 an hour. That \nis labor paid in the prison. This small business in Colorado makes this \nproduct, and they want to sell it to the Government. Here is what they \nwrite.\n\n       My company bid $22 a unit. The Federal Prison Industries' \n     bid was $45 a unit.\n\n  The Government ended up paying $45. So here you have a small business \nstruggling to survive against Federal Prison Industries paying \nincredibly cheap prices for its labor, comes in with a bid of half of \nwhat that product is bid by the FPI and loses the bid.\n  We are not trying to get a monopoly for the private sector. We are \ntrying to eliminate this monopoly which is assumed by FPI, which allows \nit to say, this product, since it is produced by FPI, must be used by \nthe Federal agencies, even though it costs the taxpayers more and, in \nmany cases, is nowhere near as good in quality.\n  This is what the Access Products folks in Colorado Springs went on to \nsay:\n\n       The way I see it, the government just overspent my tax \n     dollars to the tune of $1,978.\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\n      The total amount of my bid was less than that. Do you \n     seriously believe this type of product is cost effective? I \n     lost business. My tax dollars were misused because of unfair \n     procurement practices mandated by Federal regulation. This is \n     a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, of how \n     the procurement system is being misused and small businesses \n     in this country are being excluded from competition with the \n     full support of Federal regulations and the seeming approval \n     of Congress. It's far past time to curtail this company known \n     as Federal Prison Industries and require them to be \n     competitive for the benefit of all taxpayers.\n\n  The Veterans' Administration sought repeal of this mandatory \npreference on several occasions on the ground that FPI prices for \ntextiles, furniture, and other products are routinely higher than \nidentical items purchased from commercial sources. Most recently, \nVeterans Administration officials estimated that repeal of this \npreference would save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency \nalone, making that money available for veterans services.\n  We all want to do what we can do reasonably to make sure that work is \navailable for Federal prisons. But the way that we are doing it is all \nwrong.\n  As one small businessman in the furniture industry put it in very \nemotional testimony at a House hearing last year:\n\n       Is it justice? Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries \n     would step in and take business away from a disabled Vietnam \n     veteran who was twice wounded fighting for our country and \n     give that work to criminals who have trampled on honest \n     citizens' rights, therefore effectively destroying and \n     bankrupting that hero's business which the Veterans \n     Administration suggested he enter?\n\n  Here you have a veteran of Vietnam who has entered into the business \nat the suggestion of the Veterans Administration, and he is not allowed \nto compete on a level playing field with Federal Prison Industries.\n\n  Our amendment is supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the National \nFederation of Independent Business, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Business and Industry Industrial Furniture \nManufacturers Association, the American Apparel Manufacturers \nAssociation, the Industrial Fabrics Association International, the \nCompetition in Contracting Act Coalition, and hundreds of small \nbusinesses from Michigan and around the country.\n  Mr. President, there is something fundamentally wrong with the \nprocurement system which says that a small businessperson cannot \ncompete even though his price is lower than a Federal Prison \nIndustries' price, which has the cheapest labor in the country, 23 \ncents an hour to $1.15 an hour, and when we tell the veterans who open \nup small businesses and want to supply the Veterans Administration with \na product, that they can't compete because the Federal Prison \nIndustries has a monopoly on a product. We are not dealing fairly with \neither that veteran or that small businessperson.\n  There are many products which this Government buys that are imported \nwhich are not produced with American labor of small business, and \ninstead of diversifying to produce those products currently imported \nand made with non-American labor, we have Federal Prison Industries \ncontinuing to focus on textiles, furniture, on items which displace \nAmerican workers and American small businesses because they have a \nmonopoly.\n  We are not seeking a preference. I want to drive home that point. We \nare not saying Federal Prison Industries should not be allowed to \ncompete. It is the opposite. We are saying American small businesses \nshould be allowed to compete where their price is cheaper and when \ntheir quality is better. For Heaven's sake, they ought to be allowed to \nsell to their Government and not be faced with a monopoly which charges \nmore for even a less quality product frequently, as these letters \nexplain, and nonetheless, sells to the Government at a greater expense \nto the taxpayers.\n  That is why the NFIB, the Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, all of these small businesses in all of \nour States are pleading with us to end this monopoly situation.\n  Let me read from some of their letters. The National Federation of \nIndependent Business says, in a letter dated June 19, 1997:\n\n       Today, federal agencies are forced to buy prison-made \n     products through Federal Prison Industries (FPI) . . . This \n     is yet another example of avoidable government waste as \n     virtually all such items are available from the private \n     sector, which provides them more efficiently and at lower \n     prices. In addition, such mandatory purchases from the FPI \n     costs America jobs. Firms that can't enter an industry or \n     expand production, can't hire new employees.\n\n  The Chamber of Commerce says, in a letter dated June 19, 1997:\n\n       The Chamber has long-standing policy that the government \n     should not perform the production of goods or services for \n     itself or others if acceptable privately owned and operated \n     services are or can be made available for such purposes. We \n     recognize the importance of the productive training and \n     employment of our nation's inmate population. However, we \n     believe that our federal prison system should not be given \n     preferential treatment at the cost of our nation's small \n     business owners. We believe that there are other substantial \n     sources of work available to inmates that would not infringe \n     upon the private sector's opportunities to compete for \n     government contracts.\n\n  The National Association of Manufacturers says, in a letter dated \nJune 25, 1997:\n\n       The present system that gives FPI a virtual lock on federal \n     government contracts has hurt thousands of businesses, \n     resulted in higher cost(s) for goods and services bought by \n     the government and in many cases has resulted in loss of jobs \n     and business opportunities for our members. Removal of the \n     ``FPI mandatory source status is an idea [whose] time has \n     come . . .\n\n  Mr. President, our amendment would not require FPI to close any of \nits facilities, or force FPI to eliminate any jobs for federal \nprisoners, or undermine FPI's ability to ensure that inmates are \nproductively occupied. It would simply require FPI--which currently \nranks as one of the sixty largest federal contractors--to compete for \nfederal contracts on the same terms as all other federal contractors. \nThat is simply justice to the hard-working citizens in the private \nsector, with whom FPI would be required to compete.\n  The obvious fact is that FPI already has built-in competitive \nadvantages, even if it is forced to compete for its contracts. First \nand foremost, FPI pays inmates a fraction of the wages paid to private \nsector working in competing industries. FPI's pay scales, as of March \n27, 1995, were as follows:\n\n                                                      Compensation rate\nGrade:\n    1........................................................$1.15/hour\n    2.........................................................0.92/hour\n    3.........................................................0.69/hour\n    4.........................................................0.46/hour\n    5.........................................................0.23/hour\n\nSecond, the Federal government provides land to FPI for the \nconstruction of its manufacturing facilities. Third, FPI pays no \ncorporate income taxes and has no need to provide health or retirement \nbenefits to its workers.\n  On top of these advantages, the taxpayers provide a direct subsidy to \nFederal Prison Industries products by picking up the cost of feeding, \nclothing, and housing the inmates who provide the labor. There is \nsimply no reason why the taxpayers should be required to provide an \nindirect subsidy as well, by requiring federal agencies to purchase \nproducts from FPI even when they are more expensive and of a lower \nquality than competing commercial items.\n  Mr. President, I am a supporter of the idea of putting federal \ninmates to work. A strong prison work program not only reduces inmates \nidleness and prison disruption, but can also help build a work ethic, \nprovide job skills, and enable prisoners to return to productive \nsociety upon their release.\n  However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a \nmanner that does not unfairly eliminate the jobs of hard-working \ncitizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be able to achieve \nthis result only if it diversifies its product lines and avoids the \ntemptation to build its workforce by continuing to displace private \nsector jobs in its traditional lines of work.\n\n  That is why I participated in an effort in the early 1990's to help \nFederal Prison Industries identify new markets that it could expand \ninto without displacing private sector jobs. In 1990, the House \nAppropriations Committee requested a study to identify new \nopportunities for FPI to meet its growth requirements, assess FPI's \nimpact on private sector businesses and labor, and evaluate the need \nfor changes to FPI's laws and mandates. That study conducted by \nDeloitte & Touche on behalf of FPI, concluded that FPI should meet its \ngrowth needs by using new approaches and new markets, not by expanding \nits production in traditional\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nindustries. The Deloitte & Touche study concluded:\n\n       FPI needs to maintain sales in industries that produce \n     products such as traditional furniture and furnishings, \n     apparel and textile products, and electronic assemblies to \n     maintain inmate employment during the transition.\n       These industries should not be expanded, and FPI should \n     limit its market shares to current levels.\n\n  I followed up on that report by meeting with FPI officials and \nparticipating in a ``summit'' process, sponsored by the Brookings \nInstitute, designed to develop alternative growth strategies for FPI. \nThe summit process resulted in two suggested areas for growth: entering \npartnerships with private sector companies to replace off-shore labor; \nand entering the recycling business in areas such as mattresses and \nelectrical motors.\n  Unfortunately, FPI has chosen to take the exact opposite course of \naction. Last year, for instance, FPI acted unilaterally to virtually \ndouble its furniture sales from $70 million to $130 million and from 15 \npercent of the federal market to 25 percent of the federal market, over \nthe next five years. This follows a steady growth in FPI's market share \nwhich has already taken place, unannounced, over the last ten years. In \ndirect contravention of the Deloitte & Touche recommendations, FPI has \nannounced its intention to undertake similar market share increases in \nother traditional product lines, such as work clothing and protective \nclothing.\n  This amendment would return FPI to the course prescribed by Deloitte \n& Touche and the Brookings summit by requiring it to concentrate any \nfuture expansion efforts, to the maximum extent practicable, on \nproducts currently sold to federal agencies that would otherwise \nimported. Expansion in existing lines of business would still be \npossible, but only as a last resort, and only as a result of \ncompetition, on a level playing field, with private industry.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is appropriate on this bill, because \nthe Department of Defense is FPI's biggest customer, and pays by far \nthe largest subsidy for FPI's overpriced products. The competition \nrequired by our amendment will save millions of dollars for the \nDepartment of Defense and other federal agencies. It should also \nimprove FPI's performance, forcing it to become more efficient and \nproductive, and advancing FPI's objectives of instilling a strong work \nethic and providing a positive job experience. Working in non-\nproductive and uncompetitive jobs may reduce inmate idleness, but it \ndoes not provide realistic work experience that will translate to the \nprivate sector.\n  We need to have jobs for prisoners, but it is unfair and wasteful to \nallow FPI to designate whose jobs it will take, and when it will take \nthem. Competition will be better for working men and women around the \ncountry, better for the taxpayer, and better for FPI.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my friend, the Senator. He has \nmy support. I will vote with him tomorrow. He is right on.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I understand there will be a period of time tomorrow \nimmediately prior to voting on this amendment for the proponents and \nopponents to summarize arguments. I think that will be part of the \nunanimous consent request which is going to be propounded in a few \nmoments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my good friend from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                  FFTF\n\n  Mr GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from New \nHampshire, [Mr. Smith] in a colloquy to clarify a provision within the \nbill's title on Department of Energy national security programs. \nSection 3134 limits, for a prescribed time period, the funds made \navailable by the National Defense Authorization Act for the purpose of \nevaluating tritium production to two options: use of a commercial light \nwater reactor or building an accelerator. As you know, DOE has decided \nto evaluate, in addition to a commercial reactor and an accelerator, \nthe Fast Flux Test Facility, as known as the ``FFTF,'' as a possible \nback-up production option to provide interim quantities of tritium. The \nFFTF is currently, and in the future proposed to be, funded from \nsources not covered by this bill, specifically, the non-defense \nEnvironmental Management account and the civilian Nuclear Energy \naccount. Accordingly, would the Subcommittee chairman agree that the \nlimitation contained in section 3134 is not applicable to FFTF and \nsimilar options that are funded through programs wholly unrelated to \nthat monies provided by this defense bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If the Senator would yield, that is \ncorrect. The provision being proposed is applicable only to the stated \nplans in the Department's ``dual track'' strategy. This bill would not \naffect the Fast Flux Facility, because that facility is currently \nfunded through a non-defense account. This bill does not have authority \nover these funds, and therefore, this provision would in no way alter \nthe commitment made by former Secretary O'Leary to keep the FFTF in a \nhot stand-by condition.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator for this clarification.\n\n\n                    Air Force Sergeants Association\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate adopted a symbolic, \nyet important amendment which grants a Federal charter to the Air Force \nSergeants Association, a highly respected nonprofit, veterans \nassociation.\n  Over the past 36 years, the Air Force Sergeants Association has been \nstalwart in representing the interests of Air Force enlisted men and \nwomen. The association has served a vital purpose by informing Members \nof Congress of the concerns of enlisted servicemembers and their \nfamilies, and likewise informing enlisted personnel where Members of \nCongress stand on critical personnel issues, such as pay, military \nmedical health care, quality of life and earned retirement benefits for \nactive duty, Reserve component, and military retirees.\n  This Federal Charter is a symbolic gesture that shows Congress \nappreciation to the Air Force Sergeants Association for the outstanding \nservice they provide and to the dedicated men and women whom the \nassociation represents. We pay tribute to the noncommissioned officers \nwho form the backbone of the Air Force.\n  Noncommissioned officers turn the wrenches, prepare the aircraft, \nwalk the perimeters, and train ``new'' junior officers as they report \nto their first assignments directly from their commissioning source. \nThe contribution of our noncommissioned officers cannot be overstated \nwhether as major contributors to dismantling the Iron Curtain, winning \nthe Persian Gulf War, to carrying out vital peacekeeping missions \nthroughout the world or projecting American power wherever and whenever \nit is needed.\n  As the Air Force celebrates its 50th anniversary, Congress honors the \ncommitment and contribution of enlisted servicemembers to our national \nsecurity. Granting this Federal charter demonstrates our gratitude for \ntheir outstanding efforts.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the support of my colleagues for this \namendment. It is with great honor and gratitude that I was asked to \nintroduce this legislation by my friends at the Air Force Sergeants \nAssociation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Air Force Sergeants \nAssociation Federal charter amendment, amendment number 728, be printed \nagain in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the amendment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 728\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a Federal charter for the Air Force Sergeants \n                              Association)\n\n       Insert after title XI, the following new title:\n   TITLE XII--FEDERAL CHARTER FOR THE AIR FORCE SERGEANTS ASSOCIATION\n\n     SEC. 1201.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an amendment \noffered by my colleagues, Messrs. Cochran and Durbin, to correct a \nsignificant deficiency in our export licensing system.\n  I will speak today of the current practice of allowing the export \nfrom the United States of high-powered, dual-use computers--machines \nthat until very recently were called supercomputers--without any prior \nU.S. Government assessment of their end uses or end users. The \namendment takes a significant step to correct this problem--not by \nbanning the export of such machines, but merely by requiring exporters \nto obtain an individual validated export license before exporting them \nfrom the United States or reexporting them from elsewhere.\n  The amendment specifically requires a license for the export of \ncomputers with a composite theoretical performance level equal to or \ngreater than 2,000 million theoretical operations per second [MTOPS], \nwhen such machines are destined to a group of countries that now \nreceive such computers--up to a level of 7,000 MTOPS--without U.S. \nGovernment end use or end user checks.\n  The specific group of controlled countries--the so-called ``Tier 3'' \ncountries--is described as follows in the Bureau of Export \nAdministration's Report to Congress for Calendar Year 1996: ``* * * \ncountries posing proliferation, diversion or other security risks.'' So \nwe are dealing here with certain countries that our government, on the \nbasis of all the information at its disposal, has determined pose risks \nto our security.\n\n\n                          Some Ancient History\n\n  This is not the first time I have spoken about the proliferation \nrisks associated with high-powered computers. On October 31, 1989, I \nspoke of the dangers from supercomputers and super bombs (Congressional \nRecord, 10/31/89, p. S-14382 ff.).\n  On that occasion, I reminded my colleagues of the role computers play \nin designing nuclear weapons, and this particular application will only \ngrow in importance now that the world appears heading for a ban on all \nnuclear explosions. Though it is true indeed that countries do not need \nhigh-powered computers to build the bomb--witness America's 1945-\nvintage Fat Man and Little Boy bombs--it is well recognized today that \nsuch computers are absolutely essential to developing advanced nuclear \nweapon designs, including H-bombs, especially when nuclear test \nexplosions are prohibited. These computers are also useful in designing \nnuclear weapon delivery systems, the full gamut advanced conventional \nweapons systems, and have other national security applications--\ncryptography, for example.\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\n  Over a decade ago, in January 1986, America's three nuclear weapon \nlabs--the Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia National \nLaboratories--issued an unclassified report aptly titled, ``The Need \nfor Supercomputers in Nuclear Weapons Design.'' The following extracts \nclearly identify the utility of supercomputers--as defined back in \n1986--in the design and improvement of our Nation's nuclear weapons:\n\n       Large-scale computers are essential to carrying out the \n     weapons program mission. Computers provide essential \n     understanding and enable us to simulate extremely complicated \n     physical processes . . . Computers enable us to evaluate \n     performance and safety over the decades of a weapon system's \n     lifetime . . . computers enable us to verify weapon designs \n     within testing limits.\n       With large-scale computers, we have been able to improve \n     our designs by optimizing design parameters, while reducing \n     the number of costly experiments in the design process . . . \n     Tests involving high explosives have been reduced from 180 \n     tests for a 1955-vintage weapon to fewer than 5 for today's \n     weapons because of computation.\n       Computers enable us to extrapolate to new capabilities . . \n     . it is this computational capability, driven by the needs of \n     the weapons design, that has made possible new concepts and \n     enhanced safety in weapons.\n       The inability to calculate solutions to complex problems \n     [during the years of the Manhattan Project] hampered \n     development and forced weapons designers to build in large \n     margins against error (e.g., large amounts of high explosive, \n     which increased weight to such an extent that some designers \n     were uncertain the devices could actually be carried by \n     existing aircraft) . . . It has been estimated that a team of \n     scientists using the calculators of the 1940s would take five \n     years to solve what it takes a Cray computer one second to \n     perform.\n       Without supercomputers, the nation's nuclear weapons \n     program would be deprived of much of its vitality . . . \n     supercomputing is essential . . . in providing us with a tool \n     to simulate the complex processes going on during a \n     nuclear explosion . . . computers enable us to infer real-\n     environment weapon performance from underground nuclear \n     tests.\n       The computer becomes absolutely essential in the evolution \n     of a design that will survive the ``fratricide'' threat . . . \n     the computer is essential in designing a system whose \n     vulnerability to an ABM attack is reduced to an acceptable \n     level.\n       [Computers] enable the designer to ``test'' ideas before \n     actually committing to hardware fabrication . . . computing \n     capabilities are absolutely critical to progress in new \n     designs.\n\n  OK, so those were the uses of high-powered computers a decade ago. \nObviously, computer technology has grown rapidly--even exponentially--\nsince that time. This growth has led to much higher computing speeds, \nmore manufacturers, more applications, improved software, and more \ncountries seeking such machines. The growth has been so rapid that many \nboth in and out of Government have come to believe--or appear to have \nconvinced themselves--that this technology is completely \nuncontrollable.\n  The rapid advancement of this technology has been accompanied by an \nequally rapid decontrol of some of the very devices we used to make \nsome of the most powerful weapons the world has ever known. The \nCommerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration, for example, \nreports in its most recent Annual Report to Congress that--``Due to the \n1994 and 1995 liberalization for computers, this commodity group has \nbeen replaced by shotguns as being the most significant commodity group \nfor which export license applications were received in fiscal year \n1996.'' So it now appears that we are giving closer regulatory \nattention to shotguns than to a key technology that our top weapons \nlabs have characterized as essential to performing a variety of \nnuclear-weapons applications.\n  But the supporters of this decontrol effort are not daunted by this \nnews. They have consistently argued that if some other country is \nexporting high-powered computers without rigorous controls--or without \nany controls at all--then by golly, so should we, or else we would face \nthe horrible accusation of ``shooting ourselves in the foot'' by \ndenying U.S. manufactures market opportunities that are available to \ntheir foreign competitors. If there is evidence of foreign \navailability, in short, if there is at least one other country out \nthere--whether it be North Korea, or Iran, or China, or any other \nnation --if just one of these countries decides to cash in on America's \nrestraint, then we should have the same profit-making opportunities.\n  Well, there are a lot of problems with this point of view, some \nlegal, and some political and moral. Let's have a closer look at these \nproblems.\n\n\n            The Legal and Political Foundations of Licensing\n\n  Under our Constitution, treaties are the supreme law of the land. One \nof our treaties, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 [NPT], \nexplicitly requires America not in any way to assist any non-nuclear \nweapon state to acquire the bomb. That treaty does not contain any \nproviso indicating that assistance may be provided if some other \ncountry is providing such assistance. It has no loophole allowing such \nassistance provided though a third party. It contains no codicils \nexempting the computer industry or any other industrial sector from the \nduty not in any way to assist the proliferation of nuclear explosive \ndevices. The taboo on assistance is clear and categorical.\n  As well it should be. Indeed, America is quite fortunate that the \nterm ``not in any way'' does not mean ``except in some ways.'' After \nall, there are 5 nuclear-weapon states today in the NPT and over 175 \nnon-nuclear-weapon states in the world that have ratified or acceded to \nthat treaty. If today we decide that it is fully consistent with this \ntreaty obligation for the United States to decontrol completely \ntechnology that our top weapons designers at our nuclear weapon labs \nhave publicly identified as essential to performing a variety of \nnuclear weapons-related activities, then how can we even pretend to be \ncomplying with this treaty? Is this the kind of approach we wish for \nother members of the treaty to adopt, to interpret that treaty as only \nrequiring the regulation of state-of-the-art technology or goods that \nare only exclusively available at home? Is this what is ahead for \nAmerican leadership in the global nonproliferation regime?\n  If this is the reasoning that is to guide America's technology \ntransfer control policies into the 21st century, then I truly worry not \njust for the future of the NPT but for the future security of our \ncountry. To those who argue that we should only control state-of-the-\nart or sole-national-source technology, I ask: Why limit this logic \nonly to the controls over computers? Why not, after all, also decontrol \nall of the other technologies that go into making bombs, except those \nitems that are the most modern or exclusively sold in the U.S.?\n  The answer of course, is self apparent. Such a step would amount the \ncrudest possible form of technological indexing, where U.S. controls \nwould simply be ratcheted down with every new technological \nadvancement. Such an approach would wreak havoc on any responsible \nnonproliferation policy.\n\n  The hydrogen bombs that America fielded in the 1950's and 1960's are \nno less dangerous in the hands of our adversaries just because they \nwere made with technology that is now a half-century old. To advocate \nthe decontrol of a technology strictly on the bases of so-called \nforeign availability, or the age, or level of sophistication of the \nitem, without regard to either the actual end use or identity of the \nend user, is to turn a blind eye to proliferation. It is a sure-fire \nmethod to bring, as fast as possible, anachronistic weapons of mass \ndestruction back into fashion. Fortunately, the NPT does not only aim \nat preventing the proliferation of state-of-the-art bombs--and we and \nour friends and allies around the world are much better off as a \nresult.\n  Nor does our domestic legislation take such an approach. I am proud, \nfor example, to have been the principal author of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Act of 1978 [NNPA], which requires the President to \ncontrol ``all export items * * * which could be, if used for purposes \nother than those for which the export is intended, of significance for \nnuclear explosive purposes'' (section 309(c)). Now I suppose it might \nhave been possible to have written this law only to control:\n\n       The smallest possible number of choke-point export items . \n     . . which are known beyond even the faintest shadow of a \n     doubt to be exclusively intended for a weapons-related use in \n     a publicly-listed bomb plant in a rogue regime that is known \n     to be pursuing weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  But fortunately that is not how the law was written and our Nation is \nquite a bit safer with the original text. No indeed, the law was quite \nexplicit in requiring the control over ``all'' export items--and all \nmeans all--which ``could be''--not just are--``of significance for'' \nnuclear explosive purposes--not just\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nabsolutely critical to performing such functions.\n  We also have several sanctions laws that punish foreign countries and \nfirms that assist other countries to acquire nuclear weapons. The so-\ncalled ``Glenn/Symington amendments'' in sections 101 and 102 of the \nArms Export Control Act, for example, require sanctions against any \nparty involved in the transfer of unsafeguarded uranium enrichment \ntechnology or nuclear reprocessing technology. These are the types of \ntechnology that produced the nuclear materials used in the Nagasaki and \nHiroshima bombings. I guess you can call that old technology. I guess \nyou could say there is ``foreign availability'' of that technology \nsince many other nations can perform these fuel cycle operations. I \nguess that today's methods of enriching uranium or separating plutonium \nare more sophisticated than they were 20 years ago. But does any of \nthis mean that we should rewrite all of our nuclear sanctions laws to \ncorrespond to this dubious new doctrine of controlling only state-of-\nthe-art goods? Absolutely not, the question answers itself.\n  When China transferred ring magnets to Pakistan's unsafeguarded \nuranium enrichment plant, I did not wonder, ``now gee, were these items \nstate-of-the-art quality or just 1970's-vintage?'' I was not angry that \nthe items did not come from San Francisco, Chicago, New York, or even \nCleveland. I did not care how sophisticated, or how old, or how cheap, \nor how ``available'' such items were. I did care, however, that China \nwas assisting Pakistan to produce nuclear materials for its secret bomb \nproject.\n  Nonproliferation is about not assisting countries to get the bomb--\nnot just a duty to control the most modern gadgets available. When the \nspecial U.N. inspectors found tons of Western dual-use goods in Saddam \nHussein's weapons bunkers, did any of my colleagues recall an avalanche \nof mail from their constituents expressing outrage that more U.S. goods \nwere not found in Saddam's arsenal? Were there pickets in front of the \nCapitol haranguing the Congress further to relax export controls so \nthat we can lower our Nation to that grimy ``level playing field'' \nquite evidently enjoyed by some of our European friends? None that I \ncould find.\n  None indeed. Here is what happened instead. The public was outraged, \nand outraged all the more amid revelations shortly after the gulf war \nin 1991 that United States dual-use goods did, indeed, turn up in Iraq. \nThis outrage, with a little help from the news media, helped to \nstimulated some constructive reforms in America's nonproliferation \npolicy. In 1992, America succeeded in getting 27 nations of the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group to commit themselves not to export dual-use goods to \nunsafeguarded nuclear facilities and to require full-scope \ninternational safeguards for all exports of nuclear reactors and other \nnuclear energy-related technology. Before these sensitive dual-use \ngoods can be exported, under this multilateral understanding, member \ngovernments must review specific license applications and review the \nspecific nonproliferation credentials of the importing parties.\n  In this instance, America did not stoop to adopt the laissez faire \nnuclear trading practices of other countries; instead, we raised the \nlevel of the international playing field to our level by showing that \nour Nation is a leader not a follower when it comes to \nnonproliferation.\n\n  Another positive reform in U.S. nonproliferation controls was \nimplemented just a few months after Iraq invaded Kuwait. President Bush \nunveiled the ``Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative'' [EPCI], \nwhich authorized the U.S. Government to prohibit the export of any \nitem--repeat, any item--that could contribute to the proliferation of \nmissile technology or chemical and biological weapons. A similar \ncontrol had existed for years covering dual-use nuclear technology \nwhere the exporter ``knows or has reason to know'' that the item would \nbe used in a weapons-related application.\n  The EPCI or so-called knows rule was intended, however, to \ncomplement--not to replace--the Nation's export licensing system. Let \nme cite a recent case to illustrate this point.\n  On February 19, 1997, for example, the Washington Post reported that \na California computer firm, Silicon Graphics, Inc., had illegally sold \nfour supercomputers to a Russian nuclear weapons facility. The article \nquoted the chief executive officer of this firm as offering the \nfollowing explanation for the export: ``The Department of Commerce \ndoesn't provide a list of facilities around the world that we shouldn't \nship to. So we tend to rely on the end-user statement on how they will \nbe used.'' In short, the company interpreted the knows rule as applying \nonly to the importer's stated end-use for the specific export. The \ncompany, and it is probably not alone in this respect, evidently did \nnot even consider the possibility that its importer would consider \noffering a bogus end use.\n  Now there are several reasons why the U.S. Government cannot go \naround publishing the names and locations of all the world's secret \nbomb facilities and their suppliers. Here are three of them--First, the \nnames change rapidly in the black business of nuclear proliferation and \na printed list would no doubt be obsolete as soon as its ink was dry; \nsecond, the public identification of such facilities and suppliers \ncould well jeopardize U.S. intelligence collection capabilities; and \nthird, such a listing could be quite useful to a proliferant country or \ngroup, effectively amounting to free market research for the \nproliferators.\n  So there are some significant limitations in the extent to which the \nGovernment can delegate export control responsibilities to the private \nsector. Companies simply do not have the capabilities of U.S. \nintelligence agencies. That is the reason why licensing is such a good \nidea: It is the best known technique for making efficient and effective \nuse of the resources of our Government--for which the U.S. taxpayer has \npaid so dearly over the years--to assess proliferation risks in \nspecific exports.\n  Thus even if some of the goods we control are being sold by foreign \ncompetitors, and even if some goods are not state-of-the-art, it still \nmakes considerable sense for the U.S. Government to require licenses \nfor items that could assist countries to make bombs. Why? For two key \nreasons.\n  First, licensing is the Government's window on the world market for \nU.S. products; export decontrol or devolution of export controls to the \nprivate sector slams that window shut. In other words, licensing \ncreates a paper trail, generates data, and gives our Government's \nnonproliferation analysts something concrete to work with. This \ninformation is valuable in assessing --and subsequently reducing--\nproliferation risks. Thus, even if license applications are rarely \ndenied as is currently the case, it still makes sense to require \nlicenses for goods that, as our treaties and domestic laws specify, \ncould assist other countries to make weapons of mass destruction.\n  Second, our leadership role in international nonproliferation regimes \nrequires not just words but deeds. If we want other nations to \nstrengthen their controls, we should be prepared to do so ourselves. \nAgain, our job must be to use our leadership to raise international \nstandards up to our own level playing field, rather than lower our own \nto some homogenized least-common-denominator standard set by the \nworld's most irresponsible suppliers.\n\n\n                       Some Additional Loose Ends\n\n  Before concluding today, I would like to touch upon a few other \ncharges that have been leveled against the very idea of requiring \nexport licenses for any but state-of-the-art computers. I will address \ntwo of such charges.\n  First, our national economy will allegedly be hurt by the \nestablishment of licensing requirements for computers rated at over \n2,000 MTOPS going to the designated nations.\n  We should keep in mind here that the overwhelming majority of \nAmerica's exports leave the country without requiring export licenses \nat all. In 1995, for example, America exported $969 billion in goods \nand services, while the Government denied export licenses for goods \nvalued at only $30 million. To give my colleagues an idea of the scale \nwe are talking about here, the ratio between the value of those goods \nthat were denied licenses and the total value of U.S. trade in that \nyear is analogous to the difference between the length of a pencil \neraser and the height of the Washington Monument. That is about the \nsame ratio as the size of garden pea on the quarter-inch line of a\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\n100-yard football field, or the amount of calories in a single carrot \nrelative to a year's worth of balanced meals.\n\n  Here is another way to put this problem in its proper context: $99.20 \nout of every $100 in U.S. exports did not require an export license. \nAnd of the few that did require such a license, only one license in a \nhundred was denied. That was in 1995. Since then, computer controls \nhave been substantially liberalized (along with chemical exports going \nto parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention), while overall U.S. \nexports were just over $1 trillion in 1996. Relative to total U.S. \ntrade, therefore, fewer and fewer goods are requiring licenses.\n  Now some might argue that while these figures may be true, certain \nindustries face a greater likelihood of having to face license \nrequirements than other industries. Yes that is undoubtedly true: If \nyou produce something that is likely to assist another country to get \nthe bomb, you can expect Uncle Sam to get a bit nosy and, if the system \nis working right, to be an outright nuisance. No company, however, can \nclaim any right under U.S. law to help another country to make nuclear \nweapons or any other weapons of mass destruction. We have a free \neconomy--but our individual freedom to produce and market goods is not \nunlimited, especially when it comes to goods that can jeopardize our \nnational security.\n  As John Stuart Mill once wrote in his book, ``On Liberty,'' over a \n100 years ago: ``Trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any \ndescription of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of \nother persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in \nprinciple, comes within the jurisdiction of society.'' The writer of \nthose words was one of England's foremost liberal economists. Even Adam \nSmith himself admitted that the Government had a legitimate \nresponsibility to regulate certain forms of trade.\n  And I for one cannot imagine a more legitimate basis for regulating \ntrade than to ensure that America is not assisting other countries to \nmake the bomb. Fortunately, I am not alone in this conviction. As \nPresident Clinton stated on October 18, 1994: ``There is nothing more \nimportant to our security and to the world's stability than preventing \nthe spread of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.'' The key \nlegislative task--a responsibility now before us today--is to ensure \nthat this principle is reflected in the rules and procedures America \nuses to control its own exports. License-free exports of technologies \nthat our weapons labs have repeatedly identified as useful in making \nbombs and reentry vehicles hardly seems to me an appropriate way to \nimplement this Presidential statement of our top national priority.\n  Our national economy will not be hurt, and America's international \neconomic competitiveness will not be crippled, by the establishment of \na licensing requirement on computers rated at 2,000 MTOPS and above \ngoing to certain destinations--though our national economy could well \nbe endangered, and considerable business opportunities lost, if a \nnuclear war should someday break out involving foreign weapons that \ndesigned with computers that were Made in USA.\n  Most computers, moreover, will still leave the country without export \nlicenses. We are talking about today machines that have special \ncapabilities. On June 12 of this year, a senior strategic trade advisor \nat the Department of Defense, Peter Leitner, testified before a hearing \nof the Joint Economic Committee on ``Economic Espionage, Technology \nTransfers and National Security.'' Dr. Leitner included with his \ntestimony a graphic showing some of the functions in our own military \nof computers operating at levels actually less than 2,000 MTOPS. He \npointed out that NORAD had recently upgraded its computers by buying \nHewlett-Packard computers rated between 99 and 300 MTOPS. He testified \nthat machines have been used below 2,000 MTOPS to perform the following \nfunctions: space vehicle design (launch and control); high-speed design \nsimulations; pre-wind tunnel modeling; reentry vehicle design (ICBMs); \nand high-speed cryptography.\n  Perhaps we should require licenses for computers at even lower levels \nthan 2,000 MTOPS, as Dr. Leitner's testimony implies. It seems hard to \njustify the authorization of exports--without even requiring a license \nor an end use or end-user check--of technology that is capable of being \nused in designing nuclear weapons or reentry vehicles as being in any \nway consistent with our national security interests. Until some \ninternational agreement can be reached on an alternative level, \nhowever, the 2,000 MTOPS level is a good place to begin to strengthen \ncontrols over these sensitive dual-use items.\n  Multilateral control over this technology is of course the best \ncourse to pursue, but multilateralism has to begin somewhere. The \nUnited States--with its reputation as the world's leading champion of \nnonproliferation and with its world-class computer industry--has an \nextraordinary opportunity for leadership in encouraging other members \nof the Nuclear Suppliers Group to adopt similar controls. A diplomatic \neffort of this nature would also help to alleviate fears of our \nindustry that the duty of complying with these controls would fall only \non U.S. exporters. Our negotiations with other members of the NSG \nshould begin with one basic question: Why should computers be exempt \nfrom the no-assistance norm that lies at the heart of the global \nnonproliferation regime?\n\n  My colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, has recently suggested that \nperhaps the General Accounting Office might be called upon to examine \nthe national security risks of unregulated exports of computers in this \nrange and, depending on the scope and content of the request, this \nmight be a good idea indeed. But until we see a specific request and a \nfinished study, I think the amendment proposed by Messrs. Cochran and \nDurbin is a prudent course to follow for the immediate future.\n  It is useful to recall that GAO does indeed have some relevant \nbackground in dealing with the proliferation implications of such \ncomputers. At my request back in 1994, the GAO prepared a lengthy \nreport on U.S. export licensing procedures for handling nuclear dual-\nuse items. In testimony before the Committee on Governmental Affairs on \nMay 17, 1994, a senior GAO official, Joseph Kelly, noted that recent \nexport control reforms in recent years ``. . . will almost certainly \nresult in a substantial decline in the number of computer license \napplications and could complicate U.S. efforts to prevent U.S. computer \nexports from supporting nuclear proliferation.'' GAO concluded that \n``many of the computers that will now be free of nuclear proliferation \nlicensing requirements are capable of performing nuclear weapons-\nrelated work.'' (GAO/NSIAD-94-119, 4/26/94 and GAO/T-NSIAD-94-163, 5/\n17/94.) Mr. President, these do not seem to me to be the types of items \nthat should be, in GAO's terms, ``free of nuclear proliferation \nlicensing requirements.''\n  The second charge leveled against the establishment of a licensing \nrequirement is that it would place U.S. exporters at a competitive \ndisadvantage, due to the protracted delays in obtaining the necessary \nlicense approvals. This argument also lacks credibility. The Bureau of \nExport Administration [BXA] in the Department of Commerce is so proud \nof its recent efforts to streamline the export license application \nprocess that it trumpets this achievement in its most recent annual \nreport to Congress. Here is what that report had to say about the \nlicensing process:\n\n       . . . BXA implemented significant improvements in the \n     export license system via Presidential Executive Order 12981 \n     [which] . . . limit the application review time by other U.S. \n     agencies, provide an orderly procedure to resolve interagency \n     disputes, and establish further accountability through the \n     interagency review process.\n       [E.O. 12981] . . . reduces the time permitted to process \n     license applications. No later than 90 calendar days from the \n     time a complete license application is submitted, it will \n     either be finally disposed of or escalated to the President \n     for a decision. Previously, all license applications had to \n     be resolved within 120 days after submission to the \n     Secretary. . . . By providing strict time limits for license \n     review and a ``default to decision'' process, it also ensures \n     rapid decisionmaking and escalation of license applications.\n       In FY 1996, the Bureau introduced a PC-based forms \n     processing and image management system which, along with the \n     new multipurpose application form, enhances BXA's ability to \n     make quick and accurate licensing and commodity \n     classification decisions.\n       BXA ensures that export license applications are analyzed \n     and acted upon accurately, quickly, and consistently, and \n     that exporters have access to the decisionmaking\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\n     process, with current status reports available at all times. \n     Rapid processing is available for the majority of \n     applications BXA receives.\n\n  BXA also notes that it is in the process of upgrading and expanding \nits electronic licensing process to provide prompt customer service.\n  It is also noteworthy that BXA discusses in the same report its \nassistance to Russia and other new republics of the former Soviet Union \nto upgrade their national systems of export control. Obviously, if \nAmerica is decontrolling goods useful in making nuclear weapons and \nother weapons of mass destruction, and the missile systems to deliver \nthem, then we can hardly hope to inspire these other countries to show \nany greater discipline.\n  It would be far better for us to be sticking to a strict \ninterpretation of the ``not in any way to assist'' obligation that the \nUnited States and every other nuclear-weapon state in the NPT has vowed \nto implement. We should lead the way in strengthening international \ncontrols, not in relaxing them under the false flag ``economic \ncompetitiveness.'' We should remember that these other countries have \ntheir own conceptions of ``economic competitiveness'' that, if allowed \nto become a global norm, could lead to a total collapse of the \ninternational nonproliferation regime. We have as much at stake in \nencouraging these countries to place nonproliferation as a high-\nnational priority as we have in ensuring a similar priority here at \nhome.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this constructive \nreform of our export licensing process. We have the people in our \ngovernment who are competent to review these licenses. We have the \ntechnology and procedures in our Government to ensure the prompt and \nefficient handling of license applications. We have both domestic and \ninternational legal obligations that requires the control of technology \nthat could assist other countries to get the bomb. And we have \nlegitimate national security interests to protect. America can be a \nformidable economic competitor in the world without becoming the \nworld's most formidable proliferator of nuclear or dual-uses goods. I \nurge my friends and colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n\n\n                       high-performance computers\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I had the opportunity earlier today to \nmeet with a number of computer manufacturers located in my State. They \nexpressed grave concerns about the amendment which you have proposed. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Mississippi in an effort to get more information on this \nimportant issue into the Record.\n  My constituents allege that, by next year, your amendment will have \nthe effect of restricting the sale of personal computers--similar to \nthose in our Senate offices--to Tier 3 countries. Do you agree with \nthis statement?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, based upon statements made by Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Export Administration William Reinsch, it is \nhighly unlikely that personal computers capable of more than 2,000 \nMTOPS will be available by next year. At a recent hearing Secretary \nReinsch said, ``high-end Pentium-based personal computers sold today at \nretail outlets perform at about 200 to 250 MTOPS,'' and at another \nhearing, this one before my subcommittee on June 11, he also said that \n``computer power doubles every 18 months, and this has been the axiom \nin the industry for I think about 15 years.'' The math is \nstraightforward; if top-end PC's are capable of 250 MTOPS today, 18 \nmonths from now they'll be capable of 1,000 MTOPS; and 54 months from \nnow--in 4\\1/2\\ years--they'll be capable of 2,000 MTOPS. Fifty-four \nmonths from now is not, contrary to the claims of some computer \nmanufacturers, the fourth quarter of next year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, since 1995 \nwhen the new export control standards were established, there have been \nover 1,400 computers sold in this range to Tier 3 countries. Of those \n1,400 sales, a small number have allegedly wound up with military end \nusers in Russia and China. What evidence do we have concerning these \nalleged computer sales to military end users?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, according to the Department of Commerce, \nfrom the period January 25, 1997, through March 1997, 1,436 \nsupercomputers were exported from the United States. Of that number, \n91--or 6.34 percent--went to Tier 3 countries, some of which went with \nan individual validated license. We know, based upon statements by \nRussian and Chinese Government officials, that some of these \nsupercomputers are in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a military \nfacility in Chungsha, China, and in Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70. \nArzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 are both well-known nuclear weapons \ndevelopment facilities in Russia; the suggestion by exporters that \nthese high performance computers would be in either of these locations \nand not be doing nuclear-related work appears to be somewhat self-\nserving and contrary to common sense. According to Russia's Minister of \nAtomic Energy, these supercomputers are '`10 times faster than any \npreviously available in Russia.'' The Chinese Academy of Sciences, \nwhich has worked on everything from the D-5 ICBM to enriching uranium \nfor nuclear weapons, hasn't been shy about its new supercomputing \ncapabilities, saying that its American supercomputer provides the \nAcademy with ``computational power previously unknown'' available to \n``all the major scientific and technological institutes across China.'' \nAmerican high performance computers are now available to help these \ncountries improve their nuclear weapons and improve that which they are \nproliferating.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if your amendment passes, it is my \nunderstanding that this would be the first time that export control \nparameters would be established in statute. I am concerned that with \nadvances in technology, the fixed parameters will quickly become \noutdated. How will we be able to deal with these technological advances \nwhen fixed parameters are included in legislation? Did you consider \nother alternatives to fixed statutory language, such as an annual \nreview of the threshold by a neutral third party or government entity?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the current policy is established in \nregulation, and regulation has the force and effect of law. For \nCongress to participate in the policymaking process it must pass \nlegislation. Furthermore, the pace of technological advancement is such \nthat, at some point in the future, it is entirely possible that the \n2,000 MTOPS level--which is the administration's current floor--will \nhave to be raised. That is why, on July 7 on the Senate floor, I said \nthat if, 4 or 5 years from now, industry's optimism proves to be \ncorrect, I will be pleased to return to the floor and offer legislation \nadjusting the 2,000 MTOPS level.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been told that computers with \nsimilar capabilities and computing power are readily available from \nother nations. Given that, the concern is that your amendment would put \nU.S. computer companies at a competitive disadvantage since these \ncomputers are readily available on the world market. What has your \nsubcommittee's research shown regarding the foreign availability of \ncomputers in this range (2,000-7,000 MTOPS)? What is the market share \nof U.S. manufacturers of computers in this range, and has that market \nshare changed since the administration liberalized its policy in 1995?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment will not in any way reduce \nthe number of American high-performance computers going to Tier 3 \ncountries. It does not change the administration's standards for making \nthe exports; all that is changed is the question of who makes end-use \nand end-user determinations for Tier 3 countries. In fact, at least \neight high-performance computers have been exported to Tier 3 countries \nwith an individual validated license since this policy started. Only \nentities that shouldn't be receiving these supercomputers in the first \nplace won't, because of closer scrutiny by the executive branch, \nreceive them under this amendment. So, the suggestion by some \nmanufacturers that this amendment would somehow reduce their market \nshare is an argument that has no basis in fact.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it has been alleged that the licensing \nrequirement contained in your amendment will put U.S. computer \ncompanies at a commercial disadvantage since it often takes up to 6 \nmonths for the Commerce\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\nDepartment to approve an export license. By contrast, the Japanese \noften approve export licenses in 24 hours. In conjunction with your \nefforts on this amendment, have you explored options for improving the \nexport license approval process at Commerce?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Japan has a more restrictive export \ncontrol policy than does the United States. I support making the \nDepartment of Commerce export licensing process more efficient, though \na more efficient process cannot come at the expense of national \nsecurity concerns, which must be adequately addressed in the process. I \nwould note, as well, that more than 95 percent of export licenses \nconsidered by Commerce are currently approved in 30 days or less.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor an amendment \nto the Department of Defense authorization bill that would restore \nfunding for bioassay testing of atomic veterans. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join in support of this important measure.\n  In my role as the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have heard firsthand of the difficulties experienced by \nveterans exposed to ionizing radiation during their military service \nwhen they have tried to get their radiation-related diseases service \nconnected by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The main reason for \nthis difficulty is the sometimes impossible task of accurately \nreconstructing radiation dosage.\n  The law currently distinguishes between two groups of veterans: those \nwho warrant presumptive service connection for their radiation-related \nconditions because of their participation in an atmospheric nuclear \ntest, the occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or their internment as a \nprisoner of war in Japan during World War II, which resulted in \npossible exposure to ionizing radiation--and those who may have been \nexposed to ionizing radiation in service under other circumstances, \nsuch as service on a nuclear submarine. Those veterans who do not \nreceive presumptive service connection and suffer from radiogenic \ndiseases must prove their exposure to radiation by having the VA and \nDOD attempt to reconstruct their radiation dose through military \nrecords. VA looks to the DOD to perform these dose reconstructions.\n  This amendment is so important because the White House Advisory \nCommittee on Human Radiation Activities has acknowledged that there are \ninadequate records to determine the precise amount of radiation to \nwhich a veteran was exposed, and what the long-term risks associated \nwith that exposure are. As of September 1996, VA had only granted \nservice connection to 1,977 out of 18,896 veterans who had filed claims \nbased on participation in all radiation-risk activities. VA estimates \nthat it has granted fewer than 50 claims of veterans who did not \nreceive presumptive service connection.\n  This amendment would authorize $300,000 for the completion of the \nthird and final phase of Brookhaven National Laboratory's testing of \nradiation-exposed veterans. Brookhaven's fission tracking analysis \ncould provide a more accurate measure of an individual's internal \nradiation dosages. I have contacted VA in support of the Brookhaven \nproject in the past. VA's response indicated that it is the Department \nof Defense, not the VA, who has the responsibilty to provide dose \nestimates for veterans exposed to ionizing radiation. That is why we \nmust restore funding to the Brookhaven project in the DOD authorization \nbill.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have seen \nthe struggles of America's atomic veterans and their survivors. I have \nheard testimony of the veterans who bravely served in our military, and \nwho are now sick and dying and cannot get the compensation they have \nearned by their service to our country. These veterans were placed in \nharm's way, sworn to secrecy, and abandoned by their government for \nmany years. It is critical that we search for a better way to assess \ntheir exposure to radiation. It is vital that we restore funding to a \nprogram that can renew hope to atomic veterans and their families.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a period of \nmorning business not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask my distinguished colleague, \nwe have a few cleared amendments on the bill. Would it be possible to \nclear up these few amendments and then return to his request?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have no objection to doing that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, we are ready to proceed, if the distinguished ranking \nmember is prepared.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 607, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl's \namendment be modified as indicated in the modification, which I now \nsend to the desk, numbered 607.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me ask a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand that this modification, which \nhas been offered by the sponsor of the amendment, would be in order, \nthat he would have the right to modify his own amendment. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona would have the right \nto modify his amendment only if cloture is not invoked tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As of right now, if the Senator from Arizona were here, he \nwould have the right to modify his amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If cloture were invoked tomorrow, the \nparticular modification would be invalid without unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry. Perhaps I did not state it clearly. \nIf the Senator from Arizona were here now and offered to modify his own \npending amendment, which is what I understand is being offered----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be invalidated by the adoption of \ncloture tomorrow in the absence of unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am seeking unanimous consent and \nappearing on behalf of the Senator and offering it on his behalf. And \nthe yeas and nays, to my understanding, have not been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If unanimous consent were granted to the \nmodification, of course.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. And I have sought unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry. I am sorry to press this. But my \nparliamentary inquiry is, that right to modify his own amendment would \nexist if the Senator were here himself at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only with unanimous consent, should cloture be \ninvoked tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I thank the indulgence of the Chair \nwhile the Senator from Michigan and I have resolved such differences as \nwe may have had and once again restate, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arizona, amendment No. 607 be \namended, and I send to the desk the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment (No. 607), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be offering, with my \ncolleague Senator Patrick Leahy, an amendment to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill to provide for the construction of a \ncombined support and maintenance shop [CSMS] at Camp Johnson, VT.\n  This project is to be constructed in Colchester, VT and used by the \nVermont National Guard to meet its support level maintenance mission. \nThe quantity, size and type of equipment now assigned to the Vermont \nArmy National Guard have required them to propose the construction of \nthis CSMS. The new facility will have administrative offices and allied \nshops as well as special bays for maintenance work on all types of \nvehicles. The design money for this project was approved by the \nCongress last year.\n  The Vermont Army National Guard has stretched the limits of the \ncurrent facility which was built over 40 years ago, in 1956. The \ncurrent facility has very significant shortfalls in all office and shop \nareas. The existing work bays cannot accommodate the M-1 tank. In \naddition, essential maintenance and maintenance training is \nconsistently delayed due to the lack of space. Without the construction \nof a new facility readiness of the Vermont Army National Guard will be \nadversely affected.\n  In order to assure that the Vermont Army National Guard is ready at \nall times to meet the needs of our nation's defense, Senator Leahy and \nI have worked together on this project. I am pleased that the Vermont \nArmy National Guard can move forward on this CSMS and hope that my \ncolleagues will support the efforts that Senator Leahy and I have taken \nto insure that the Vermont Army National Guard can meet the military \nneeds of our country in the next century.\n  I commend Chairman Thurmond for his foresight to realize that his new \nfacility is essential in order for the Vermont Army National Guard to \nmeet the anticipated demands on them in the coming years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, again, I am standing in for the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nchairman of the Armed Services Committee this evening in offering these \namendments.\n  On behalf of Senator Bond, I offer an amendment which would authorize \n$3.2 million for the construction of a readiness center for the \nMissouri Army National Guard in Macon, MO.\n  This amendment, it is my understanding, has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization bill to include authorization for funding construction of \na National Guard readiness center. Military construction projects such \nas this will ensure that as we downsize our military, the facilities \nwhich house and service our military will not be left to deteriorate. \nArmories throughout the Nation need to be adequately maintained and \nupgraded to provide decent training facilities for the men and women \nassigned to units based at these armories and to protect the vital \nequipment stored there. In Macon, MO, there is a company of soldiers \nlocated in a facility owned by the city, which was constructed in the \n1890's and is totally inadequate. In order to provide these soldiers \nwith a facility capable of maintaining their proficiency in mission \nessential task training, I have requested funds adequate to complete \nsuch a facility. I also point out that it will be less expensive to \ncreate a new facility than to attempt to refurbish this 19th century \nstructure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Chafee and Baucus, I \noffer an amendment that would authorize the act to promote effective \nplanning, development, maintenance and coordination of wildlife, fish \nand game conservation and rehabilitation on military installations.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] \nbe included as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Chafee, for \n     himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 706.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Sikes Act was enacted by Congress in \n1960 to provide enhanced stewardship of fish and wildlife and other \nnatural resources on military installations. It was named for \nCongressman Bob Sikes of Florida. The act seeks to capitalize on the \nenormous potential for natural resource conservation on military lands. \nThe Department of Defense controls nearly 25 million acres of land and \nwater at approximately 900 military installations in the United States, \nand the National Guard oversees an additional 1 million acres on 80 \nsites. These lands serve as home to approximately 100 endangered or \nthreatened species and countless other fish and wildlife resources.\n  The Sikes Act was last amended in 1986, and authorization expired in \n1993. Since then, several attempts to reauthorize the act have been \nmade, and although Congress has been close several times, all have \nfailed. We now have a golden opportunity to amend and reauthorize the \nSikes Act, in S. 936, the bill to authorize the Department of Defense.\n  Two weeks ago, an agreement was reached among the Department of \nDefense, the Department of the Interior, the International Association \nof State Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and the two House committees with \njurisdiction over the Sikes Act. The White House approved the agreement \nthe following day. The amendment that I am introducing, together with \nSenator Baucus and Senator Kempthorne, is virtually identical to the \nHouse version, which passed in the House as part of H.R. 1119, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. This amendment to the Sikes \nAct will greatly improve the current law.\n  In its current form, the Sikes Act authorizes the Secretary of \nDefense to enter into cooperative plans with the Secretary of the \nInterior and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agency for the \nconservation of fish and wildlife on military lands. Over the 37 years \nof the Sikes Act, cooperation under the act has improved fish and \nwildlife management on military bases.\n  For example, wetlands associated with the North American Waterfowl \nManagement Plan that are on military bases have been restored under a \nrecent initiative by the Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of \nDefense. Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and Elgin Air \nForce base in Florida, have undertaken efforts to protect the \nredcockaded woodpecker. Fisheries assessments are taking place on both \ncoasts, including Brunswick Naval air station in Maine and a submarine \nbase in Washington.\n  While these examples illustrate how cooperation can improve natural \nresource management, more can and should be done. Only 250 agreements \nexist, and many of these are outdated. In addition, many agreements \nprovide only for minimal cooperation among parties, rather than \naffirmative management of the resources. Another 200 agreements are \ncurrently being developed.\n  The amendment that Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and I are \nintroducing would infuse new vigor into implementation of the Sikes \nAct. Specifically, it would require the Secretary of each military \ndepartment to develop a natural resource management plan for each of \nits military installations, unless there is an absence of significant \nnatural resources on the base. The plan would be prepared by the \nSecretary in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nappropriate State fish and wildlife agency. The plan must be consistent \nwith the use of military lands to ensure the preparedness of the \nmilitary, and cannot result in any net loss in the capability of the \nmilitary installation to support the military mission of the \ninstallation. With those caveats, the plan must also provide for the \nmanagement and conservation of natural resources. This language \naccommodates the interests of the State and Federal wildlife agencies \nas well as the needs of the military.\n  While the agreement was negotiated on the House side, I would like to \nmake several observations regarding the differences between the current \nlaw and this agreement. The most important change in the law, of \ncourse, is that development of the natural resources management plans \nwould become mandatory. In practical terms however, this provision \nwould better conform to and encourage the current practice of the \nmilitary, which already has a policy of developing these plans.\n  An equally important change to the law would be that preparation and \nimplementation of the plans would be the responsibility of the \nSecretary of the appropriate military department, rather than the \nSecretary of Defense. Extensive discussions last year revolved around \nattempts to agree on a dispute resolution process in the event that the \nDepartment of Defense, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State \nfish and wildlife agency could not agree on the development of a \nparticular plan. The balance struck in the current agreement between \nthe requirement to prepare the plans, and the discretion afforded the \nSecretary of the individual military department regarding the content \nof each plan, seems to me to be a good one.\n\n  Greater specificity would be provided for the contents of the plans, \nwhich are to provide for, among other things and to the extent \nappropriate, fish and wildlife management and habitat enhancement, \nestablishment of management goals and objectives, and sustainable use \nby the public.\n  The amendment also provides for an opportunity for the public to \ncomment on individual plans, as well as a review of each military \ninstallation by the Secretary of the appropriate military department to \ndetermine whether new plans should be prepared or existing plans should \nbe modified. In addition, the amendment would also require annual \nreports by the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior regarding \nfunding for implementation of the Sikes Act. The Department of Defense \ncurrently spends approximately $5 million for developing plans under \nthe Sikes Act, but there are few cost estimates for State fish and \nwildlife agencies, as well as for the Fish and Wildlife Service. Thus, \nthese annual reports should provide valuable information.\n  The amendment also seeks to encourage cooperative agreements for the \nfunding of management and conservation measures without specifying \nparticular cost sharing or matching requirements.\n  I would note that there is one substantive change between the House \nlanguage and this amendment. This change was negotiated between the \nCommittees on Environment and Public Works and Armed Services, and \napproved by all interested parties, including the Departments of \nDefense and the Interior, and the International Association of State \nFish and Wildlife Agencies. Specifically, the deadline for completing \nthe natural resource management plans is extended from 2 to 3 years \nfrom the date of the initial report to Congress, which itself is \nrequired 1 year from the date of enactment. This change should enable \nthe Department of Defense to complete the plans consistent with its own \ninternal time frames, without unnecessarily missing any statutory \ndeadlines.\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\n  I would note that jurisdiction of the Sikes Act, since its passage in \n1960, has always rested with the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. Bills to amend and reauthorize the act, including one that was \nintroduced in the 103d Congress containing substantive revisions \nsimilar to the revisions in this amendment, have all been referred to \nthat committee. The fact that reauthorization of the Sikes Act is being \ndone through the DOD authorization bill represents the fortuitous \ncircumstance that after more than 1 year of debate, agreement happened \nto be reached by all parties at this particular time in this particular \ncontext. I do not expect that this circumstance would alter \njurisdiction over the Sikes Act in the future. Nevertheless, the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works has always worked \ncooperatively on that portion of the Sikes Act pertaining to military \ninstallations in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I believe that this amendment will improve \nthe Sikes Act significantly, and represents a major achievement in \nenvironmental law in this Congress. The speed with which this \nlegislation has moved in this Congress understates its importance both \nfor the agenda of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and for \nefforts to conserve natural resources nationwide. I would especially \nlike to thank both the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on \nReadiness, Senator Inhofe, and the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Armed Services and manager of the bill, Senator Thurmond, \nfor their cooperation and efforts in facilitating approval of this \namendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee, the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, in supporting \nan amendment to S. 936, the Defense Authorization Act. This amendment \nwill reauthorize and improve a law commonly known as the Sikes Act. The \namendment will reauthorize the law through the year 2003.\n  The Sikes Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to manage fish and \nwildlife and other natural resources on military lands. The Department \nof Defense controls nearly 25 million acres of land at approximately \n900 military installations. These lands encompass all major land types \nin the United States and include habitat for threatened and endangered \nspecies, historic and archaeological sites, and other cultural and \nnatural resources.\n  Senator Chafee and I have been working, in consultation with the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, to reauthorize and amend the Sikes \nAct, a law within our committee's jurisdiction, for a number of years. \nUnfortunately, we were unable during the last Congress to draft \namendments that were acceptable to the Interior Department, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the International Association of Fish and \nWildlife Agencies. I am pleased to say that this amendment has the \nsupport of all three. In addition, a nearly identical version was \nrecently passed by the House on the House Defense Authorization bill.\n  This amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to prepare \nintegrated natural resources management plans for military \ninstallations, unless the Secretary determines that preparation of a \nplan for a particular installation is inappropriate. Plans are to be \nprepared, in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and \nthe State fish and wildlife agency, within 4 years after the date of \nenactment. I urge all three agencies to work closely together, taking \nfull advantage of their respective resources and expertise, to develop \nmutually acceptable plans to conserve fish and wildlife and other \nnatural resources on our Nation's military installations. Finally, the \namendment establishes annual review and reporting requirements to \nensure that required plans are prepared and implemented.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Chafee and his \nstaff for the willingness to work in a cooperative manner with myself \nand the staff of the Subcommittee on Readiness.\n  The Sikes Act Amendment is a significant item of legislation that \nwill directly impact the Department of Defense management of the 25 \nmillion acres of land it controls.\n  While Senator Chafee has highlighted some of the positive \nenvironmental aspects of this legislation, I would like to stress the \nneed to ensure the preservation of the military mission, readiness and \ntraining.\n  The Sikes Act Amendment makes the preparation of integrated natural \nresource management plans mandatory for the military departments.\n  I have reluctantly agreed to the mandatory language of this provision \nbecause the Department of Defense and military departments support it \nand have insisted that this new environmental requirement will not \nundermine the military mission and will not increase funding for such \nplanning activities.\n  It should be made clear that:\n  The Sikes Act Amendment is not intended to enlarge the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service or State fish and wildlife agency authority over the \nmanagement of military lands.\n  Natural resource management plans should be prepared to assist \ninstallation commanders in conservation and rehabilitation efforts that \nare consistent with the use of military lands for the readiness and \ntraining of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  It is understood that many installations, about 80 percent, have \nalready completed integrated natural resource management plans in \ncooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and appropriate \nState fish and game agencies.\n  Given the level of agency cooperation, the time, the personnel, and \nfunds involved in the completion of existing natural resource \nmanagement plans, it is expected that most of these plans will satisfy \nthe requirements of the Sikes Act Amendment and will not have to be \nredone.\n  I want to close with an emphasis on the need to ensure that the \namendment will not result in an increased funding level for natural \nresource management plans and will not undermine military readiness and \ntraining.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, I intend to follow the \nimplementation of this amendment, and its impact on military readiness, \nvery carefully.\n  Senator Chafee, I want to thank you again and express my appreciation \nfor our ability to work together on the Sikes Act Amendment and other \nenvironmental issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 706) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I call up an amendment numbered 624 offered \nby Senator Robb, and I send a modified amendment to the desk.

I believe this \namendment has been cleared by the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The modification follows:\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment change line 12, which currently \n     reads ``$56 million'' to ``40 million dollars''.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak as a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by my colleagues, Messrs. Bingaman, Levin, Lugar, \nDomenici, and others, to restore $60 million to the Cooperative Threat \nReduction (CTR) Program, $25 million to the Department of Energy's \nMaterials Protection Control and Accounting [MPC] Program, and $50 \nmillion to the International Nuclear Safety Program. The administration \nrequested these funds because they are needed to serve our national \nsecurity interests. I have heard or seen nothing to dispute this basic \nconclusion and therefore strongly support the full requested amounts.\n  These funds serve our interests because they work to alleviate one of \nthe gravest national security threats facing our nation. Acknowledged \nby the President and Congress, by liberals and conservatives, by the \nHouse and the Senate, by Republicans and Democrats alike--indeed by all \nthinking Americans--this threat arises from the dangers all of us would \nface from the further erosion of Russia's ability to protect its \nweapons-usable nuclear materials and the technology and dual-use goods \nneeded to produce them. In light of this broad national consensus, I \nfind it hard to understand why we are here today debating a proposal to \nslash the funds for the programs designed to alleviate this very \nthreat.\n  Congress should, of course, give close scrutiny to all Federal \nprograms to see if further economies can be made. No one should look \nupon the Nunn-Lugar program as immune from vigorous congressional \noversight. But when one considers the magnitude of the potential \nthreats our country faces from these deadly materials, and considers \nthese threats in light of the genuine progress that has been made \n(thanks to Nunn-Lugar) in reducing clear and present nuclear dangers in \nthe former Soviet Union, it should be clear to all that Congress has, \nif anything, short-changed this program rather than over-funded it.\n  I find these proposed cuts all the more remarkable given the \ncommittee's apparent determination to shovel hundreds of millions of \nadditional taxpayer dollars at the National Missile Defense Program, \ndespite the disturbing implications of that program for the future of \nthe Antiballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty, and despite any serious \naccounting for precisely how these additional funds will be spent.\n  In 1991, a far-sighted bipartisan coalition gathered to support a \nproposal offered by our colleagues, Messrs. Nunn and Lugar, to curb \npresent and potential future proliferation threats emanating from the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. In 1997, there continues to be a strong \nconsensus both in Congress and across America that it is in our \ncollective national interest to address these threats. Some misinformed \ncommentators have attacked the CTR and MPC programs as a form of \n``subsidy of Russia's nuclear security'' or ``foreign aid.'' Perhaps \nwhat the critics fear most is that the programs might actually succeed \nin achieving their ambitious goals, and thereby reduce the need for our \ngovernment to spend additional billions more to address these grave \nforeign threats.\n  I will leave it for others to speculate further about what must be \nmotivating critics of the Nunn-Lugar program--and some of these \ncriticisms might occasionally even be on target--but I remain convinced \nthat the modest funds our country is allocating to CTR and MPC \nefforts are not only well within our means, but vital to our long-term \nnational security and nonproliferation interests. And these funds are \ntruly modest, compared against the billions we continue to spend on \nsuch programs as the B-2, the ever-expanding National Missile Defense \nprogram, the airborne and space-based laser programs, and other dubious \nprograms that are well funded in the present bill. A $135 million cut \nto these Nunn-Lugar activities is the last thing this program needs. \nWhat, after all, has the program already accomplished?\n  The CTR Program has worked and continues to work to ensure that \nsignificant numbers of strategic Soviet nuclear weapons will not be \navailable for use against the United States and its friends and allies \naround the world. The program has worked to help reduce the risk of \nnuclear materials finding their way into black markets in unstable \nregions around the world. The program has worked to facilitate the \nremoval of all nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan. The \nprogram has worked to help remove over 1,400 nuclear warheads from \nRussia's strategic weapons systems, and to eliminate hundreds of \ndelivery vehicles for such systems, including submarine launched \nballistic missile launchers, ICBM silos, and strategic bombers.\n  The committee has claimed that the CTR Program can be cut because the \nloss could be made up with prior years' funds. Yet, Defense Secretary \nCohen wrote to the chairman of the committee on June 19 that ``All \nunobligated CTR funds have already been earmarked for specific \nprojects''. The CTR Program continues to serve the national interest by \nhelping to eliminate strategic arms programs in Russia and Ukraine--if \nanything, Congress should be debating today measures to accelerate \nthese efforts rather than to chop them back. The committee's proposal \nwould only work to convert the CTR Program into a competitive threat \nrenewal program.\n  A few years before Congress made the mistake of eliminating the \nOffice of Technology Assessment, that organization produced an \nexcellent report entitled, ``Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction: Assessing the Risks'' (OTA-ISC-559, August 1993). On page \n6 of that report, readers will find the following unambiguous finding:\n\n       ``Obtaining fissionable nuclear weapon material (enriched \n     uranium or plutonium) today remains the greatest single \n     obstacle most countries would face in the pursuit of nuclear \n     weapons.''\n\n  Those were OTA's words, ``the greatest single obstacle'' to \nproliferation. Now, what kept Saddam from getting the bomb sooner than \nhe could have? Access to special nuclear material. What is America's \nleading defense against future nuclear terrorism? Limiting access to \nspecial nuclear materials. We should not be cutting programs that help \nRussia to serve our common interest in limiting international \ntrafficking in special nuclear materials. We should instead be \nreaffirming and even expanding such programs. Helping Russia to serve \nour interest in these ways is not foreign aid, it is part and parcel of \nour national defense strategy.\n\n  The MPC programs run by the Department of Energy work specifically\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\non this problem of enhancing controls over these special nuclear \nmaterials, plutonium and highly enriched uranium. I have seen the \nletter that the Energy Secretary sent to the chairman of the committee \non June 19--Secretary Pena wrote that the proposed $25 million cut in \nthe MPC program would lead to a 2-year delay in achieving key program \nobjectives. This program deserves our full support. After all, as \nSecretary Pena says, this program has secured ``tens of tons'' of \nnuclear material at 25 sites, and is working on enhanced controls at a \ntotal of 50 sites where this material is at risk in Russia, the Newly \nIndependent States, and the Baltics. When we consider that we are \ndealing with a problem involving hundreds of tons of such material, it \nhardly seems wise for us now to be cutting back on our efforts to \naddress this formidable threat to our national security.\n  Another program cut by the committee is the International Nuclear \nSafety Program. That program is essentially an investment to reduce the \nrisk that fallout from a future Russian nuclear reactor accident will \nnot once again--only a few years after the disastrous Chernobyl \naccident--be falling down from the sky on United States citizens and \nother people around the world. There is no fallout defense initiative--\nor FDI, so to speak--in this bill that would offer any shield over our \ncountry or the territory of our allies against such radioactive debris \nfrom a future reactor explosion in Russia. The best initiative of this \nnature is the one in this amendment, to restore the funds needed to \nenhance the safety and security of certain old Soviet-designed power \nreactors in the Newly Independent States and Russia.\n  So, in conclusion, I believe that the bipartisan consensus behind \nNunn-Lugar, which is represented in this bipartisan amendment offered \ntoday, is alive and well because it addresses genuine threats to our \nsecurity. I hope all Members will support full funding for these \nprograms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 658), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 778\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I feel constrained to oppose the Levin \namendment provision that is filed on this bill before the Senate, as it \nis a matter that is properly within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee which has not had an opportunity to consider it.\n  More importantly, in my view, this amendment, while well intentioned, \nis unwise policy.\n  This amendment would essentially abolish the Federal Government's \npurchasing preference for products supplied by Federal Prison \nIndustries [FPI], also known by its trade name of UNICOR.\n  FPI is the Federal corporation charged by Congress with the mission \nof training and employing Federal prison inmates.\n  For more than 60 years, this correctional program has provided \ninmates with the opportunity to learn practical work habits and skills, \nand has enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in Congress and from each \nRepublican and Democrat administration.\n  FPI and its training programs at Federal prisons across the Nation \nhave been credited with helping to lower recidivism and ensuring better \njob-related success for prisoners upon their release--a result that all \nof us applaud.\n  This amendment, in its starkest terms, requires of us a choice--\neither we want Federal inmates to work, or we do not. I believe that we \ndo want inmates to work, and therefore I must oppose this amendment. I \nsay to my colleagues, if you believe in maintaining good order and \ndiscipline in prisons, or if you believe in the rehabilitation of \ninmates when possible, you should be opposed to this amendment.\n  Under current law, FPI may sell their products and services only to \nthe Federal Government. The amendment we are debating would not alter \nthis sales restriction.\n  To ensure that FPI has adequate work to keep inmates occupied, \nCongress created a special FPI procurement preference, under which \nFederal agencies are required to make their purchases from FPI over \nother vendors as long as FPI can meet price, quality, and delivery \nrequirements.\n  This amendment would remove this procurement preference. Without the \nFederal Government's procurement preference, FPI probably could not \nexist. Again, FPI is not permitted to compete for sales in the private \nmarket. It may only sell to the Federal Government, and then only if it \ncan meet price, quality, and delivery requirements.\n  Nothing short of the viability of Federal Prison Industries is at \nissue here. Under full competition for Federal contracts, combined with \nmarket restrictions, FPI could not survive.\n\n  My colleagues should remember that the primary mission of FPI is not \nprofit, but rather, the safe and effective incarceration and \nrehabilitation of Federal prisoners. Needless to say, FPI operates \nunder constraints on its efficiency no private sector manufacturer must \noperate under. For example, most private sector companies invest in the \nlatest, most efficient technology and equipment to increase \nproductivity and reduce labor costs. Because of its different mission, \nFPI frequently must make its manufacturing processes as labor-intensive \nas possible--in order to keep as many inmates as possible occupied.\n  The Secure correctional environment FPI in which FPI operates \nrequires additional inefficiencies. Tools must be carefully checked in \nand out before and after each shift, and at every break. Inmate workers \nfrequently must be searched before returning to their cells. And FPI \nfactories must shut down whenever inmate unrest or institutional \ndisturbances occur. No private sector business operates under these \ncompetitive disadvantages.\n  The average Federal inmate is 37 years old, has only an 8th grade \neducation, and has never held a steady legal job. Some studies have \nestimated that the productivity of a worker with this profile is about \none-quarter of that of the average worker in the private sector.\n  My colleague's amendment has not been considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over FPI and, more generally, \nNational penitentiaries under rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate.\n  The Committee has not had the opportunity to consider the full impact \nof this proposal on FPI and prison work.\n  All share the goal of ensuring that FPI does not adversely impact \nprivate business. Indeed, FPI can only enter new lines of business, or \nexpand existing lines, until an exhaustive review has been undertaken \nto the impact on the private sector. Again, this is a restraint that \nmost other businesses do not have imposed on them.\n  FPI has made considerable efforts to minimize any adverse impact on \nthe private sector. Over the past few years, it has transferred factory \noperations for multiple factory locations to new prisons, in order to \ncreate necessary inmate jobs without increasing FPI sales. FPI has also \nbegun operations such as a mattress recycling factory, a laundry, a \ncomputer repair factory, and a mail bag repair factory, among others, \nto diversify its operations and minimize its impact on the private \nsector, while providing essential prison jobs.\n\n  I agree with my colleagues who believe that we must address the \nissues raised by prison industries nationwide. As we continue, \nappropriately, to incarcerate more serious criminals in both Federal \nand State prisons, productive work must be found for them. At the same \ntime, we must ensure that jobs are not taken from law-abiding workers.\n  On jobs there is substantial evidence that FPI actually creates a \nsubstantial number of private sector jobs. In fiscal year 1996, some \n14,000 vendors nationwide registered with FPI, and supplied over $276 \nmillion in sales to FPI.\n  Every dollar FPI receives in revenue is recycled into the private \nsector. Out of each dollar, 56 cents go to the purchase of raw \nmaterials from the private sector; 19 cents go to salaries of FPI \nstaff; 17 cents go to equipment, services, and overhead, all supplied \nby the private sector; 7 cents go to inmate pay, which in turn is \npassed along to\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\npay victim restitution, child support, alimony, and fines. FPI inmates \nare required to apply 50 percent of their earnings to these costs. One \ncent goes to activating new FPI factories--again, with equipment \npurchased from the private sector. Private businesses in every State \nbenefit from these sales.\n  In short, FPI is a proven correctional program. It enhances the \nsecurity of Federal prisons, helps ensure that Federal inmates work, \nand helps in their rehabilitation when possible. The amendment before \nus now would do immense harm to this highly successful program, and I \nurge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I think it is the right thing to do to oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my good friend, Senator Hatch, has made \nreference to the private sector benefiting from Federal Prison \nIndustries. The private sector has spoken loud and clear in letters to \nus. The NFIB says that this amendment is important because:\n\n       Today federal agencies are forced to buy prison-made \n     products. . . . This is another example of avoidable \n     government waste, as virtually all such items are available \n     from the private sector which provides them more efficiently \n     and at lower prices. Mandatory purchases cost America jobs. \n     Firms that can't enter an industry or expand production can't \n     hire new employees.\n\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says:\n\n       We believe that our Federal prison system should not be \n     given preferential treatment at the cost of our Nation's \n     small business owners. We believe that there are other \n     substantial sources of work available to inmates that would \n     not infringe on the private sector's opportunities to compete \n     for government contracts.\n\n  The National Association of Manufacturers says:\n\n       The present system that gives FPI a virtual lock on federal \n     government contracts has hurt thousands of businesses, \n     resulting in higher costs for goods and services bought by \n     the government and in many instances has resulted in loss of \n     jobs and business opportunities for our members.\n       Removal of the ``FPI mandatory source status'' is an idea \n     whose time has come.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletters from the NFIB, the Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers and Access Products Inc. be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I am writing to urge the Congress to take action to \n     ensure that increased competition is encouraged between small \n     business and prisons.\n       It is well known that government agencies sometimes compete \n     against private businesses in providing goods and services. \n     Today, federal agencies are forced to buy prison-made \n     products through Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI). It is \n     considered the mandatory source of some 85 items ranging from \n     general supplies to office furniture. This is yet another \n     example of avoidable government waste as virtually all such \n     items are available from the private sector, which provides \n     them more efficiently and at lower prices. In addition, such \n     mandatory purchases from the FPI costs America jobs. Firms \n     that can't enter an industry or expand production, can't hire \n     new employees.\n       In a survey of our members, 70 percent believe that \n     government agencies should not be allowed to compete against \n     private businesses. In addition, the prohibition of \n     competition between government agencies and small businesses \n     was one of the top recommendations of the 1995 White House \n     Conference on Small Business. Small businesses do not want to \n     prohibit prison industries from entering the market, they \n     just want a fair and level playing field upon which to \n     compete against the FPI.\n       We urge you to take action to ensure that the FPI competes \n     fairly for federal agencies' business. Small businesses \n     should not have to compete with government-supported entities \n     with exclusive contracts that give them an immediate and \n     unfair advantage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Re Prison Industry Mandatory Preference.\n       Members of the United States Senate: I am writing to urge \n     your support for the amendment to be offered by Senators \n     Levin and Abraham to eliminate mandatory preference for \n     prison industry goods for government contracts to S. 936, the \n     fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill.\n       Currently, the federal government is required to purchase \n     needed goods from the U.S. Federal Prison Industries (FPI) if \n     available. This law was enacted in the 1930's and has \n     resulted in a growing encroachment upon private sector \n     enterprise. For example, FPI now accounts for 25% of textiles \n     and furniture purchased by the federal government. The \n     amendment by Senators Levin and Abraham would remove Federal \n     Prison Industries as a``required source of supply'' for \n     federal government purchasing.\n       The FPI produces more than 85 different products and \n     services and in 1994 sold approximately $392 million worth of \n     goods and services to the federal government, causing it to \n     be ranked 54th among the ``Top 100 Federal Contractors.'' \n     Additionally, we understand that in order to accommodate the \n     growth in the prison population, FPI is planning to expand \n     its sales. The Chamber supports the National Performance \n     Review recommendation that the FPI's status as a mandatory \n     source be eliminated and that FPI be required to compete \n     commercially for federal business.\n       The Chamber has long-standing policy that the government \n     should not perform the production of goods or services for \n     itself or others if acceptable privately owned and operated \n     services are or can be made available for such purposes. We \n     recognize the importance of the productive training and \n     employment of our nation's inmate population. However, we \n     believe that our federal prison system should not be given \n     preferential treatment at the cost of our nation's small \n     business owners. We believe that there are other substantial \n     sources of work available to inmates that would not infringe \n     upon the private sector's opportunities to compete for \n     government contracts. Clearly, a balance must be struck \n     between these two competing goals.\n       The U.S. Chamber, the world's largest business federation, \n     represents an underlying membership of more than three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector \n     and region. On behalf of this membership, I strongly urge \n     your support of the amendment to the defense authorization \n     bill to eliminate the FPI mandatory source of supply \n     requirement and to open these government contracts to fair \n     competition from the private sector.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the 10,000 small and \n     medium members of the National Association of Manufacturers, \n     I would like to restate our support for your bill S. 339. \n     This bill would restore competition to federal procurement by \n     ending the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) mandatory source \n     status.\n       The present system that gives FPI a virtual lock on federal \n     government contracts has hurt thousands of businesses, \n     resulted in higher cost for goods and services bought by the \n     Government and in many instances has resulted in loss of jobs \n     and business opportunities for our members.\n       Removal of the ``FPI mandatory source status'' is an idea \n     which time has come and it has received the support of this \n     current administration in its National Performance Review \n     Recommendations.\n       We trust that you will move quickly on gaining passage of \n     S. 339 and restore fairness and equity to thousands of small \n     and medium size manufacturers.\n           Sincerely,\n     James P. Carty.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Access Products, Inc.,\n\n                             Colorado Springs, CO, April 15, 1997.\n     Senator Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Allard: I wrote to you in March of 1997 regarding \n     Federal Prison Industries and the unfair and uncompetitive \n     advantage it has over small companies such as mine who are \n     seeking to do business with the federal government.\n       I have a very specific example which I am quite incensed \n     about, not only as a small business owner but as a taxpayer \n     as well.\n       I recently lost an EDI bid to Unicor. The contractor was \n     Scott AFB and the item solicited was 86 Series 2 \n     remanufactured toner cartridges. For your information, the \n     FRQ# was F1162397T2361. Unicor bid on this item and simply \n     because Unicor did bid, I was told that the award had to be \n     given to Unicor. Unicor won this bid at $45 per unit. My \n     company bid $22 per unit. The way I see it, the government \n     just overspent my tax dollars to the tune of $1978. The total \n     amount of my bid was less than that.\n       Do you seriously believe that this type of procurement is \n     cost-effective? Forget about fairness to small business--that \n     seems to be an issue lost in the halls of Congress.\n       I lost business, and my tax dollars were misused because of \n     unfair procurement practices mandated by federal regulations. \n     This is a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, \n     of how the procurement system is being misused and small \n     businesses in this\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\n     country are being excluded from competition, with the full \n     support of federal regulations and the seeming approval of \n     Congress. It is far past the time to curtail this ``company'' \n     known as Federal Prison Industries and require them to be \n     competitive for the benefit of all taxpayers.\n       What will it take to convince you that this is an issue \n     which deserves your attention and your support? Perhaps a \n     visit to my manufacturing facility in Colorado Springs would \n     help. Meet the people who pay their taxes only to have them \n     misused by overspending as per government regulations. I'm \n     sure they will feel their tax dollars could be more wisely \n     used. Meet the people who could also fail to prosper if my \n     company is rendered unable to do business with the federal \n     government because of uncompetitive procurement practices. \n     This is the tip of the iceberg in my industry and I have no \n     wish to go down like the Titanic.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Sharon Krell,\n                                                    Manager/Owner.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of notes about \nan upcoming event and something that took place today, and then I have \nbusiness to conduct before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7093-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A STRONG ECONOMY AND CULTURAL DECLINE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today there is some excellent news \nregarding the economy. The deficit, because of such a strong economy \nand taxes being paid, may be as low as $45 billion. I am hopeful that \nwe can continue to keep that economy going strong by some of the tax \ncuts that are being proposed and are currently being negotiated. I \nthink the real story here of what is taking place on balancing this \nbudget is the fact that the economy is growing. Growth works, and it \nworks well, and it is working well for us here.\n  I think it would be a mistake if we did not step forward and do \nwhatever we can to continue this economy and this economic expansion \nthat has been one of the longest running expansions we have had in \nhistory to date. That is why some of the tax cuts, particularly the \nprogrowth and profamily tax cuts, the capital gains tax cut and the \n$500 per child tax credit are very, very important for us to continue, \nnot only to balance the budget and not only to do it before the year \n2002, or do it by the year 2000, but to start to pay off the debt. I \nthink it is important we do it.\n  I also note that while the economy is doing well and we are getting \nthe deficit under control--and those are important things--we certainly \nneed some help in our culture overall. We continue to have terribly \nhigh rates of crime taking place in this society. We had in Washington, \nDC three people in a coffee shop murdered. We continue to have story \nafter story, it seems like, on a daily basis of cultural problems that \nwe are having just throughout society. Whether it is the number of \nchildren born out of wedlock, teenage suicide, cultural decline in \ntotal, violent crime rates or disintegration of the family, we really \nhave to step it up in these areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7113-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one thing I want to draw people's \nattention to is that in the third week of October, there is going to be \na ``Character Counts'' week taking place. That may be a while off and \nis not necessary for us to focus on now, but I think it is time that \nwhile we look at economic activity being strong and culturally we are \nhaving all these problems, let's focus on these things.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has been a major \nchampion of character counts, and that is where people step up and say, \n``We need to look at ourselves and our own character.'' Good character \ndoesn't come about by accident, it is a practice of virtue. It is one \nthing that each and every one of us as Americans can step forward with.\n  I would like to, as we close today, give one example of a person who \nstepped up on character, and it is a gentleman in Wichita, KS, in my \nhome State, by the name of Leo Mendoza. Leo is a man who knows that \ncharacter counts, because he hasn't always had it.\n  Leo is a survivor of sexual abuse, alcohol abuse, drug abuse and \ncrime. For 17 years, he was in and out of jail, on and off drugs and in \nand out of marriages.\n  But today, after years of soul-searching and counseling, he is, once \nagain, a solid citizen. He is an elder at his church, and he and his \nwife are trying to adopt a child.\n  What changed Leo? Was it Government rehabilitation programs? Was it a \nGovernment social program? Or was it actually something deeper, \nsomething that the Government could neither teach nor instill?\n  Leo actually never relied on a Government assistance program, partly \nout of pride, partly out of independence. He never even sought help \nfrom others. It was his friends who sought him.\n  In 1987, a friend of his introduced him to Alcoholics Anonymous and a \nlocal church.\n  Slowly, he began to form the rudiments of character, promising \nhimself that he would confront the daily struggles of life with the \nfirmness that a life of true character is built not on one heroic act, \nbut rather is the consequence of a thousand little struggles. Leo, \ntogether with his family, friends, and church, began to rehabilitate. \nHe had the courage to say no, the patience to endure the temptations \nand the humility to ask God for help when weakness was about to \novercome him.\n  By struggling with his past, Leo learned virtue, and by learning \nvirtue, he built character.\n  Those struggles teach us about our own character and about what true \ncharacter is made of.\n  I give that little vignette as we close today because in attacking \nthe cultural decline and difficulties in this society, this is not \nsomething you legislate with massive Government programs or is not \nsomething we can sit in a conference room to decide what we are going \nto do and impose that will upon the country. But rather it is the \nlittle individual struggles that each and every one of us has everyday. \nIt is each and every struggle that 250 million-plus Americans deal \nwith. That is how you make a great Nation, people struggling to build \ncharacter, by building that virtue and struggling to build it one at a \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7113-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I joined my colleague and friend, Senator \nDodd, in introducing a joint resolution calling on the President to \ntake concrete steps to increase the level of international cooperation \nin combating the\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\nflow of narcotics into this country, and to lead America toward coming \nto grips with the domestic demand that is tearing this country apart \nwhile enriching the drug cartels of Latin America and our own organized \ncrime groups.\n  This legislation acknowledges the problems endemic in waging the war \non drugs while domestic demand continues to remain high. It further \nrecognizes the failure of numerous previous efforts at stemming the \nflow of illegal narcotics. It consequently expresses the sense of \nCongress that the President should appoint a high level task force, to \nbe chaired by the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, to \nestablish a framework for improving international cooperation in these \nefforts. Finally, and of particular importance, it suspends for 2 years \nthe process by which countries are certified as cooperating in the war \non drugs.\n  The drug problem in this country dates at least as far back as the \nCivil War, when wounded soldiers were turned into morphine addicts as \nthe only way to deaden the horrific pain caused from battle and \ndisease. The problem grew to such an extent that President Nixon felt \ncompelled to establish the Drug Enforcement Administration in order to \nbetter coordinate the antidrug effort. President Reagan assigned Vice \nPresident Bush to oversee a major escalation in the war on drugs, a war \ncarried on at considerable monetary cost throughout the Bush \nadministration. President Clinton, to his credit, appointed perhaps our \nfinest ``drug czar'' in Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who has waged the drug \nwar as valiantly as he led troops in combat during Desert Storm.\n  And still, the flow of illegal narcotics continues virtually \nunimpeded. Record-breaking seizures serve mainly to remind us of how \nmuch more is getting through our porous borders undetected. Street \nprices alert us to the failure of our best efforts at putting a dent in \nthe problem of drug trafficking. To the extent that one area, for \nexample, cocaine, is tackled with any degree of success, another bigger \nproblem--the resurgence in heroin abuse comes to mind--rises up in its \nplace. Clearly, it is time to step back again and look more critically \nat every facet of the problem.\n  I do not believe ``chicken-and-egg'' debates about which problem, \nsupply or demand, should take higher priority serve any useful purpose. \nThe bill we are offering today addresses both problems. Nor do I \nbelieve the certification process has accomplished its intended goal \nany more than such processes ever really do irrespective of the subject \nmatter. In fact, the decision by the White House to decertify Colombia, \nwhich has waged a valiant and costly--in both lives and treasure--\nstruggle against extremely powerful and ruthless cartels while \nrecertifying Mexico, whose law enforcement agencies are so rife with \ncorruption that that country's equivalent of Gen. McCaffrey was \narrested for drug-related crimes, illuminates all too well the \nimpracticality of the current process.\n  It is easy to argue that the drug problem has been studied to death. \nIt has not, however, been examined from the perspective, and at the \nlevel, recommended in this resolution. If I believed for a second that \nthis resolution represented just another attempt at studying the \nproblem of drugs, I would not have attached my name to it. The \nrecommended steps, however, combined with the suspension of the drug \ncertification process, constitute a real and meaningful effort at \nfocusing the Nation's attention on one of our most serious problems. \nDrugs are, in every sense of the word, a scourge upon our society. We \nmust take a comprehensive, sober look at the scale of the problem and \nwhat realistically can be done about it. We must do this domestically \nand internationally. We must, once and for all, wage the war on drugs \nas though we intend to prevail. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives will support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7113-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING JULY 4\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending July 4, the United States imported 8,960,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 918,000 barrels more than the 8,042,000 \nimported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 58.4 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By \nU.S. producers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United \nStates--now 8,960,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7114-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7114-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7114-S7115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12 noon, a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 748.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 97-1003\n\n       Whereas, The federal ``Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991'' (ISTEA) was designed to be the \n     comprehensive solution to federal surface transportation \n     funding since it replaced the ``Surface Transportation and \n     Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987'', which marked the \n     end of the interstate era; and\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\n       Whereas, The purpose of ISTEA is ``to develop a National \n     Intermodal Transportation System that is economically \n     efficient and environmentally sound, provides the foundation \n     for the Nation to compete in the global economy, and will \n     move people and goods in an energy efficient manner''; and\n       Whereas, When it was proposed, ISTEA was designed to give \n     states and local governments flexibility as to how federal \n     moneys were to be spent in their regions but, in fact and \n     practice, the new federal program specifies how these moneys \n     are distributed as well as how they can be spent by states \n     and local governments; and\n       Whereas, Examples of the types of categories for which \n     specified percentages of ISTEA moneys may be spent include, \n     but are not limited to, safety, enhancements, population \n     centers over 200,000 people, areas with populations under \n     5,000 people, transportation projects in areas that do not \n     meet the Clean Air Act standards, and minimum allocation, \n     reimbursement, and hold harmless programs; and\n       Whereas, For the six-year duration of ISTEA, Colorado will \n     receive an estimated $1.31 billion in federal moneys, \n     compared to $1.43 billion Colorado received in the previous \n     six years; and\n       Whereas, Before the enactment of ISTEA, Colorado was \n     permitted to use a portion of Interstate Maintenance Funds to \n     increase vehicle carrying capacity, but under ISTEA, capacity \n     improvements are limited to High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) \n     lanes or auxiliary lanes in nonattainment areas; and\n       Whereas, Since the six-year duration of ISTEA will end \n     after the 1996 fiscal year, Congress will have to reauthorize \n     ISTEA in order to continue the federal surface transportation \n     funding to states and local governments; now, therefore,\n       Be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the \n     Sixty-first General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the \n     Senate concurring herein:\n       That the Colorado General Assembly respectfully urges the \n     105th Congress of the United States to consider the following \n     proposals as ISTEA comes under scrutiny for reauthorization:\n       (1) Eliminate federal mandates, sanctions, and restrictions \n     that limit the powers of the states and local governments to \n     accomplish their individual transportation needs and reduce \n     federal oversight and reporting requirements;\n       (2) Transfer from the General Fund to the Highway Trust \n     Fund, for distribution to the states, the 4.3 cents per \n     gallon fuel tax added by the United States Congress in 1993; \n     and\n       (3) Allow the 2.5 cents per gallon fuel tax added by the \n     United States Congress in 1990 to be deposited into the \n     Highway Trust Fund and distributed to the states, given the \n     demonstrated need for moneys for transportation systems.\n       Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be \n     sent to the President of the United States, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House and the \n     President of the Senate of each state's legislature of the \n     United States of America, and Colorado's Congressional \n     delegation.\n       POM-164. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 242\n\n       Whereas, one of the most important legislative initiatives \n     in the 105th Congress is the reauthorization of the federal \n     highway and mass transit programs, referred to as the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA); and\n       Whereas, the quality of our highways and mass transit \n     systems directly affect the lives of virtually all Americans; \n     and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation \n     reports that an additional $15 billion in highway investment \n     above current spending is needed annually just to maintain \n     existing highway conditions; and\n       Whereas, highway users pay for construction and maintenance \n     of highways and mass transit through the Highway Trust Fund, \n     which is financed with the revenues from the federal motor \n     fuels tax; and\n       Whereas, in 1993, Congress enacted a 4.3 cent per gallon \n     increase in the motor fuels highway user fee which was \n     directed into the Treasury general fund for deficit reduction \n     rather than into the Highway Trust Fund; and\n       Whereas, the allocation of federal highway user fee \n     revenues among the states will be the single most contentious \n     issue in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n     reauthorization debate; and\n       Whereas, the allocation debate could effectively be \n     eliminated before it becomes contentious by significantly \n     increasing the total amount of federal highway funds \n     available to be allocated among the states; and\n       Whereas, this can be accomplished by swift action on the \n     following two measures:\n       (1) Redirecting the revenue from the 1993, 4.3 cent federal \n     motor fuels tax increase into the Highway Trust Fund; and\n       (2) Removing the Highway Trust Fund from the unified budget \n     to ensure that all revenues into the Highway Trust Fund are \n     spent; and\n       Whereas, failure to act on these two measures before the \n     completion of the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution means \n     this source of additional highway revenues for the State of \n     Hawaii could be lost for the entire six-year duration of the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n     reauthorization measures; now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the Senate of the Nineteenth Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1997, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, that Hawaii's Congressional \n     Delegation is respectfully urged to support and enact \n     measures before the United States House of Representatives \n     and the United States Senate to redirect the revenue from the \n     1993, 4.3 cent federal motor fuels tax increase into the \n     Highway Trust Fund, and to remove the Highway Trust Fund from \n     the unified budget, before Congress completes the fiscal year \n     1998 budget resolution; and\n       Be it further resolved that certified copies of this \n     Concurrent Resolution be transmitted to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, \n     Representative Neil Abercrombie, and Representative Patsy T. \n     Mink.\n       POM-165. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                          House Resolution 203\n\n       Whereas, on November 15, 1990, the President signed the \n     Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101-549, 104 \n     Stat. 2399); and\n       Whereas, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n     demonstrated an inability to effectively promulgate fair and \n     equitable regulations pertaining to vehicle emissions which \n     frustrate the intent of the Congress of the United States to \n     permit the various states to have a range of acceptable \n     options; and\n       Whereas, a number of members of Pennsylvania's \n     Congressional delegation have expressed concern over various \n     aspects to the operational parameters of the emissions \n     program as currently mandated by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency; and\n       Whereas, it is quite likely that the Commonwealth will be \n     threatened with the loss of up to $1 billion in Federal \n     highway funds and possibly fined on a daily basis by a \n     Federal District Court judge; and\n       Whereas, the only remedy for Pennsylvania is Congressional \n     action to relieve these penalties; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize Congress to suspend \n     implementation of the vehicle emissions provisions of the \n     Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and subsequent regulations \n     promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency until \n     October 1, 1998; and be it further,\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7115-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. THURMOND, from the Committee on Armed Services:\n       The following named officer for appointment in the United \n     States Army to the grade indicated while assigned to a \n     position of importance and responsibility under title 10, \n     U.S.C., section 601:\n\n                             To be general\n\n     Gen.

A bill to specify the frequency of screening mammograms \nprovided to women veterans by the Department of Veterans Affairs; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                       WOMEN VETERANS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation which \nwould require the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] to provide \nmammograms to women veterans in accordance with nationally accepted \nstandards.\n  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women and \nthe No. 1 killer of women ages 40 to 49. I am, and will continue to be, \npersonally committed to ensuring that the women of this country receive \nmammography screening in accordance with the highest possible \nstandards. Enactment of this legislation will ensure that our Nation's \nwomen veterans receiving care at Veterans Health Administration [VHA] \ntreatment facilities will have access to mammography screening in \naccordance with accepted national policy.\n  At issue is the question of how often women should receive screening \nmammography examinations and the age at which those examinations should \nbegin. On March 23, 1997, the American Cancer Society [ACS] recommended \nthat women begin annual mammography screening at age 40. On March 27, \n1997, after much deliberation, the National Cancer Advisory Board \nrecommended that all women between 40 and 49 years receive regular \nmammogram screening every 1 to 2 years. The National Cancer Institute \naccepted the same recommendation, both recommendations being very close \nto the new ACS standard of annual screening beginning at age 40. In \naddition, the American College of Radiology Board of Chancellors \napproved revised guidelines in January 1997, affirming its support for \nyearly screening for women after the age of 40.\n  The issue of mammography screening for women between the ages of 40 \nto 49 has been an issue of particular interest to me and one that has \noccupied quite a bit of my time during the first half of 1997. In my \ncapacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education, I have already held four \nhearings this year addressing the importance of mammography screening \nfor women ages 40 to 49; one here in Washington, DC on February 5, in \nPhiladelphia, PA on February 20, in Pittsburgh, PA on February 24, and \nin Hershey, PA on March 3, 1997. I have heard testimony, from \nphysicians and women alike, advocating mammography screening beginning \nat age 40. Currently, 40 States have enacted legislation, and 4 States \nhave legislation pending, which would require either insurance \nreimbursement for, or mandatory provision of, routine mammogram \nscreening of women ages 40 to 49. Obviously, our Nation sees the value \nof screening women early for breast cancer, and the impact that early \ndetection can have on decreasing the mortality of this No. 1 killer of \nwomen between 40 and 49.\n  It is estimated that last year 184,300 women were diagnosed with \nbreast cancer, and this year nearly 44,000 women will die from the \ndisease. Research indicates that regular mammograms for women in their \n40's can cut breast cancer mortality by 17 percent. When Dr. Vogel of \nthe University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and Magee Women's \nHospital testified at the February 24 hearing in Pittsburgh, PA, he \nstated that there are nearly 1 million women in Pennsylvania between \nthe ages of 40 and 49, and that nearly 2,000 will be diagnosed with \nbreast cancer this year. As many as 1,000 of these women will die. He \nstated that if women aged 40 to 49 were screened annually, this death \ntoll could be reduced by 250.\n  I am disappointed that VHA has refused to adopt this higher, now \nnational, standard of mammography screening for our Nation's women \nveterans despite these research findings and national recognition that \nearly mammography screening can save thousands of women's lives each \nyear. In a report issued in April, 1997, VA's Inspector General Office \nof Health Care Inspections [OHI] offered their objective and critical \nassessment of the status of mammography services being provided to our \nNation's women veterans receiving treatment at VA treatment facilities. \nSome of OHI's findings are particularly alarming. For example, only 36 \npercent of women veterans treated in 1995 were even offered a mammogram \nand only 79 percent of the VHA facilities systematically recorded \nreviews of outcome data, including disposition of positive mammograms \nand correlation of surgical biopsy results with radiologic \ninterpretations. Only 72 percent of VHA facilities assessed \neffectiveness using quality improvement or quality assurance monitors, \nand none of the VHA facilities assessed customer satisfaction, quality \nof final diagnostic product, or any other quality of care indicators \nfor contracted providers of mammography services.\n  The OHI recommended that VHA offer mammograms in accordance with ACS \nguidelines--yearly mammography screening, beginning at age 40. VHA, \nmaintaining that mammography screening for women between the ages of 50 \nto 69 is sufficient, rejected this recommendation. For this reason, I \nam compelled to introduce this legislation which will require the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to, at a minimum, offer mammograms in \naccordance with the most prudent guidelines, those of the American \nCancer Society, which call for yearly mammogram screening starting at \nage 40.\n  The women who receive treatment at any of our Nation's VA medical \ncenters deserve mammography screening consistent with the accepted \nnational standard--the highest standard, which is currently the \nrecommendation of the American Cancer Society. As chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

          PRESIDENTIAL MANAGEMENT INTERN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Warner, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Kerry) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 106\n\n       Whereas, the Presidential Management Intern Program was \n     created 20 years ago to attract to federal service men and \n     women of exceptional management potential and special \n     training in public policy;\n       Whereas, more than 3500 persons have been appointed to \n     federal service under the Presidential Management Intern \n     Program;\n       Whereas, these men and women contribute to raising the \n     standards of public service through their hard work and \n     dedication: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognize the skill and \n     dedication of Presidential Management Intern Program \n     participants and commemorate the 20th anniversary of the \n     Presidential Management Intern Program.\n       That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the \n     Presidential Management Alumni Group as an expression of \n     appreciation for their continued support for federal service \n     and the Presidential Management Intern Program.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ncommemorating the 20th anniversary of the Presidential Management \nIntern, or PMI, program. I would request that Senators Mikulski, \nSarbanes, Warner, Kennedy, Torricelli, Rockefeller, Santorum, and Kerry \nbe listed as original cosponsors.\n  President Carter established the PMI program to recruit graduate \nstudents with excellent management potential and public policy \nbackgrounds to the Federal work force. As many of us know, either from \nworking with PMI's in Federal agencies or even having them on our \nstaffs, these men and women have provided valuable services to our \ncountry in a wide variety of areas. Since the program's inception, over \n3,500 men and women have participated as PMI's with over half of those \nremaining in government service today.\n  At a time when many have denigrated Federal employees, I believe we \nshould recognize the outstanding commitment and abilities of these \nindividuals and the program which has worked to ensure that our \nGovernment has civil servants of the highest caliber. For that reason, \nI and my colleagues are introducing this resolution to commemorate the \ntwentieth anniversary of the Presidential Management Intern program and \nrecognize the outstanding men and women who have participated in it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7119-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 107--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate adopted an \namendment to require the Pentagon to study the effectiveness of the \nmilitary's programs aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles among members \nof the Armed Forces. By March 30 of next year, the Secretary of Defense \nmust submit a report which outlines programs aimed at preventing \ntobacco and alcohol dependence, in terms of education, rehabilitation, \nand intervention. I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his \nleadership on this issue. As a cosponsor to this amendment, I am glad \nthat my colleagues view the health of our military personnel an \nimportant factor when considering our Nation's security.\n  Over the past year, the Pentagon has taken important steps to reduce \ntobacco use among its personnel. Despite strong opposition from the \ntobacco industry and its friends in the Congress, policies to remove \nsubsidies from tobacco products sold through military commissaries have \nbeen implemented. Further regulations on tobacco advertising and \nproduct placement are due to take effect in the future. These are \npositive steps that have been long overdue.\n  The need to attack tobacco addiction in the military was crystallized \nin a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense last \nDecember. The DOD IG's analysis concluded that between health care and \nlost productivity attributed to tobacco use, tobacco addiction costs \nthe Defense Department, and American taxpayers, about $930 million a \nyear. Roughly $453 million of this is in hospitalization costs alone. \nIn this Senator's view, that's $930 million too much.\n  The need to address this issue head-on couldn't be clearer. Tobacco \nuse among military personnel has continued at higher levels than that \nof the civilian population. Nearly 36 percent of civilian males aged 18 \nto 25 smoke cigarettes. However, for the same age group in the Army, 41 \npercent smoke tobacco products as do 39 percent in the Navy and 44.7 \npercent in the Marine Corps. In light of the fact that the health of \nour troops, and all members of our military, should be of the utmost \nimportance, this disparity is shameful.\n  I commend those in the Pentagon who have begun to seriously address \nthe problem of tobacco sales and addiction in the military. They are \ndoing a great service for military personnel by removing subsidies from \ncigarettes sold in commissaries in an effort to protect their health. \nThey are taking the bold step of evaluating ways to discourage use, an \neffort which is clearly at odds with the low prices of tobacco products \nsold on military bases compared to prices in retail outfits in the rest \nof the country. While I agree that for their service, members of the \nmilitary should get certain benefits, a line should be drawn at an \naddictive and destructive product such as tobacco.\n  Mr. President, I hope that when this Congress receives the report \nfrom the Secretary of Defense, as directed by this amendment, it will \ninclude bold proposals aimed at curbing addiction. Our fighting forces \nneed to be the best prepared and the healthiest in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7127-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7127-S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JIMMY STEWART\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof one of the most beloved sons of Pennsylvania, Mr. Jimmy Stewart. A \nnative of Indiana County, Mr. Stewart honored all of us by identifying \nhimself, in the fullest sense, as one of us.\n  Throughout his career, he was hailed as the Everyman, the \nquintessential American male, an example of ``inspired averageness,'' \nas one writer put it. And that was his special gift--doing the \nextraordinary in a way that didn't call attention to itself. But what \nhe did with his life, what he accomplished, did, in the end, call \nattention to itself, because Jimmy Stewart was not ordinary.\n  In ``Liberty Valance,'' one of Mr. Stewart's movies in which he plays \na Senator returning to town for a rancher's funeral, a newsman says to \nhim: ``This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the \nlegend.'' I would like to recall today, Mr. President, how the fact of \nJimmy Stewart became the legend. Because with Mr. Stewart, the fact and \nthe legend are one.\n  Jimmy Stewart was born in Indiana, PA in 1908. His father owned the \nlocal hardware store and he always retained ties to his hometown and \nthe traditions that it embodied for him. As he himself said, ``This is \nwhere I made up my mind about certain things--about the importance of \nhard work and community spirit, the value of family, church and God.''\n  He graduated with honors from Princeton University in 1932 with a \ndegree in architecture and even did well enough to earn a scholarship \nto pursue graduate studies in that field. But it was acting he chose to \npursue and he would eventually appear in 71 films, among them some of \nthe best ever produced, such as ``The Philadelphia Story,'' ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington,'' ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' and ``Rear Window.'' \nFor someone with a reputation for uncomplicated wholesomeness, the \nsuccessful portrayal of so many diverse characters in so many films \nsuggests, as others have remarked, the possession of something more--\nsomething deeper and more compelling than simple wholesomeness, \nalthough he had that too.\n  This ``something more'' was seen most clearly, perhaps, in Mr. \nStewart's exemplary service in World War II. When other stars were \ncontent to remain at home and fulfill their patriotic obligation in \nless hazardous ways, Jimmy Stewart willingly left a thriving and \nprosperous film career to enlist in the Army Air Corps. He enlisted as \na private and by 1945 had attained the rank of colonel. He also \naggressively campaigned for combat duty and would eventually fly 20 \ndangerous missions over enemy territory as a command pilot. By war's \nend, he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the French \nCroix-de-Guerre, and the Air Medal. He stayed active in the Air Force \nReserve and retired a brigadier general, the highest rank ever attained \nby a professional entertainer.\n  Just as he had the humility to leave a successful film career to be a \nsoldier\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nlike any other in that war, he also had the modesty to return to acting \nand wonder if he could reclaim a place in Hollywood. And he did, of \ncourse. ``It's a Wonderful Life'' was his first film after the war and \nit not only returned him to American movie audiences, it gave us and \nevery future generation the wonderful character of George Bailey. \nGeorge Bailey, who changed so many lives without even knowing it. And, \nof course for many of us, Jimmy Stewart was George Bailey. Someone who \nsucceeded in so many ways without ever appearing to fully realize how \nextraordinary those achievements were.\n  Jimmy Stewart continued to distinguish himself as a citizen, as an \nactor, and a devoted husband and father for the rest of his life. Once \nhe retired from the movies, he remained active in charitable and \ncommunity work, wrote poetry and became an ardent champion of film \npreservation, often coming to Washington to testify before Congress on \nthe subject of colorizing old black and white films--a practice he \nopposed.\n  With his death, he leaves two twin daughters and a son. He also \nleaves millions of devoted fans who admired him as much for his work as \nfor the exemplary character and intelligence he projected throughout \nhis lifetime.\n  Jimmy Stewart once said that he agreed to do ``It's a Wonderful \nLife'' because of one line in it: ``Nobody is born to be a failure.'' \nHe believed that ordinary Americans, in their everyday life, could, and \ndid, do extraordinary things. Jimmy Stewart may have behaved as if he \nwere just like everyone else. And he may have even believed it himself. \nBut he really wasn't. He wasn't average at all. It was simply a final \nact of skill and generosity that he let us believe he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7127-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ALLOWING MEDICARE ELIGIBLE MILITARY RETIREES TO JOIN THE FEDERAL \n                     EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I recently added my name to the list \nof cosponsors of S. 224, introduced by Senator Warner, which will allow \nMedicare-eligible military retirees to join the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan. After hearing from military retirees in Montana, \nI am convinced that this is a necessary step to help ensure that \nmilitary retirees have access to quality health care.\n  When military retirees turn 65, they no longer have guaranteed access \nto military health care. The lucky ones can get services from military \ntreatment facilities [MTF's] on a space-available basis, but the rest \ndo not have access to MTF's. They must rely on Medicare, which has less \ngenerous benefits, despite the commitment they received for lifetime \nhealth benefits by virtue of their service to this country. They are \nthe only group of Federal employees to have their health benefits cut \noff at age 65. That's just not right.\n  This bill offers a simple solution by allowing military retirees who \nare eligible for Medicare to join the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan. This is a popular program which provides good benefits at a \nreasonable cost. It will serve military retirees well and uphold the \nGovernment's commitment to provide quality health benefits. Our \nmilitary retirees deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7128-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE RETIRED AND SENIOR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM [RSVP] OF WATERLOO, \n                                   IA\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

This program is celebrating 25 years in their community, \nthis year of 1997. In the last 25 years, over two million volunteer \nhours have been donated to the communities it serves. Among the \nrecipients of these hours have been children, teachers, elderly, \nhandicapped and a variety of service and community agencies. Some of \nthe many community needs RSVP is assisting with are mentoring, \nassisting teachers, clerical, carpentry, transportation for the frail \nand elderly, mediation, respite care, tax preparation assistance, bulk \nmailings, money management, etc. The needs are as diverse as the \nvolunteers themselves.\n  This RSVP program started out as a clearinghouse for volunteers and \nnow includes sponsoring several programs of its own: a mediation \nprogram that assists with the small claims courts; a school volunteer \nprogram that provides mentors and other volunteers to assist with \nstudent needs; a money management program that helps individuals remain \nindependent in their own homes; a respite program that provides relief \nto care givers; and a tax assistance program that provides tax \npreparation assistance to the low income and elderly.\n  RSVP provides challenging volunteer opportunities to those 55 and \nolder. At the same time meeting many community needs through the \ndedication of their unselfish volunteers, who have proven to be a \nvaluable asset to the communities they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/09/senate-section/article/S7128-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-13 AND TREATY \n                          DOCUMENT NO. 105-14\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
