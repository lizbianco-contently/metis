Mr. President, I rise today with a tremendous sense of \npride and great pleasure to inform my colleagues that a citizen of the \ngreat State of Maine has been elected national commander of the \nAmerican Legion.\n  As many in this Chamber are aware, the American Legion recently held \nits 79th national convention in Orlando, FL. At the conclusion of that \nconvention, a Maine legionnaire, Anthony Jordan, of Augusta, was \nelected national commander.\n  To be selected by your peers to such a prestigious post is a \nsignificant accomplishment. For his home State, for his family, for his \nAmerican Legion post in Wiscasset, ME, and for the thousands of Maine \nveterans it is a singular honor.\n  Mr. President, the American Legion chose wisely when it selected Mr. \nJordan to lead this organization for the next year. Let me just tell \nyou a bit about Mr. Jordan's background.\n  Tony Jordan served in the U.S. Army from 1963 to 1965. He joined the \nAmerican Legion, our Nation's largest veterans organization, in 1971. \nMr. Jordan demonstrated an unusual level of personal commitment and \nleadership in making his commitment to the work of the American Legion, \nboth at the State and the national level.\n  For example, he served as post commander in Wiscasset and as vice \ncommander of the American Legion Department of Maine. He also served as \nchairman of the Legion's national membership and post activities \ncommittee. He chaired the Foreign Relations Council and the National \nSecurity Commission.\n  In addition, Mr. Jordan also contributed to the Legion as a member of \nthe National Legislative Commission and as liaison to the National \nFinance Commission.\n\n[[Page S9990]]\n\n  Finance, foreign relations, national security--that is an impressive \nand diverse range of committee appointments that make him well \nqualified to head the American Legion. But the Legion also knew that, \nwhen it asked Tony Jordan to take charge, this was an important time \nfor the American Legion and for America's veterans.\n  Tony Jordan has expressed strong personal sentiments in favor of the \nconstitutional amendment to protect the American flag. Our flag is the \nsymbol for everything for which our Nation stands. Mr. Jordan is \nstanding with those who believe in the integrity of the flag and what \nit represents--freedom and justice, ideals for which our Nation's \nveterans risk and, in some cases, gave their lives.\n  Mr. Jordan is also outspoken in his support of a GI bill of health, \nthe American Legion's response to the challenges being faced by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and veterans across this country as they \nseek to fulfill the promise we made to ensure that our veterans have \naccess to quality health care.\n  These are only a few examples, Mr. President, of what Mr. Jordan has \ndone on behalf of his country and its largest veterans organization. I \nknow my colleagues will agree that the American Legion chose wisely and \nwell when it elected Anthony Jordan of Augusta, ME, as its national \ncommander. I wish him well in the challenging year ahead.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S9989-6", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9990-S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to \ncompliment our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, for \nscheduling floor debate on campaign finance reform. I think that this \nis a very important matter to be debated by the U.S. Senate and, \nhopefully, to be voted on as to amendments and, ultimately, final \npassage.\n  I have long believed that campaign finance reform is indispensable in \norder to take out the tremendous amount of money that is present in \nFederal elections. For more than a decade, I have worked on the issue \nto have a constitutional amendment to overrule Buckley versus Valeo \nwith Senator Hollings under the Hollings-Specter amendment. I believe \nthat there is a very important distinction between amending the first \namendment and overruling a specific Supreme Court decision, many of \nwhich are split decisions.\n  There are many besides those on the Court who have an understanding \nof the Constitution. I think the Buckley decision was wrongly decided. \nWhen that decision was handed down, I happened to be in the middle of a \ncontest for the U.S. Senate primary in Pennsylvania running against the \nthen Congressman John Heinz. In the middle of that campaign, the \nSupreme Court ruled that an individual could spend as much of his or \nher money as he or she chose. My brother was limited to $1,000 under \nthe law. He could have helped finance my campaign. With Buckley not \nbeing reversed, that has been a major impediment to dealing with these \ntremendous sums of money, plus the unlimited amount of independent \nexpenditures. We have seen the ravages of soft money. We have seen \nmillions of dollars contributed in Presidential elections, as in 1996, \nin the context where the candidates are pledged not to spend money \nbeyond the Federal contribution. We have seen these ads which have been \nclassified as ``issue ads,'' which are blatant ads urging the election \nof one candidate and the defeat of another, on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have introduced campaign finance reform legislation myself which \nwould deal with the issue of soft money, prohibiting it, and which \nwould define an advocacy ad as one which shows the likeness or name of \nan individual urging his or her election or his or her defeat. With \nrespect to the independent expenditures, they are touted as \nindependent, but in fact they are not independent expenditures.\n  My legislation would require that someone who makes a so-called \nindependent expenditure make an affidavit to that effect, with strict \npenalties for perjury on the affidavit form showing the individual \nmaking it what the consequences are. That would then be filed with the \nFEC, with the requirement that the candidate on whose behalf the \nexpenditure was made, plus the campaign manager, make a tough \naffidavit, so that you do not have the feeling that there is really no \nenforcement or enforcement so much after the fact that it is \nirrelevant.\n  In order to deal with the problem of unlimited expenditures by \nindividuals, my bill provides for a Federal provision analogous to the \nMaine ``standby public financing provision,'' which provides that if \ncandidate A spends $15 million of his or her own money, then candidate \nB will have that matched by the Government. I am against generalized \nFederal funding. However, I do believe that such a provision would be a \ndeterrent so that there would not be the necessity, or at least a very \nlimited amount of governmental money put in the campaigns if they knew \nthere would be no advantage because the Government would match it for \nhis or her opponent.\n  My bill further builds upon what we have seen in the Governmental \nAffairs hearing, to require that there be a limit and reporting on \ncontributions to legal defense funds, which are a first cousin to \ncampaign contributions. We saw in the testimony involving Charlie Trie, \ncoming into the legal defense funds, pouring out hundreds of thousands \nof dollars. My bill further tightens the requirements as to foreign \ncontributions which we saw on the Young development matter, where the \nmoney had a foreign origin and ended up in a political campaign \ncommittee.\n\n  I had been unwilling to cosponsor McCain-Feingold as long as it had \nthe provision calling for lesser expenses or free television time, \nbecause I think that provision is unconstitutional, in violation of the \nfifth amendment as the taking of property without due process of law. I \nknow the arguments that they are public airwaves, but once the \nsituation has been established on a property right, I think that \nconstitutes a taking. I discussed that matter with Senator McCain some \ntime ago, and once he says that provision is going to go, I am prepared \nto cosponsor McCain-Feingold. Last year, when the subject came up, I \nvoted for cloture on McCain-Feingold. Although I didn't agree with all \nof its provisions, I thought the matter should come to the Senate floor \nand be voted upon.\n  Regrettably, we will probably not have campaign finance reform, or we \nwon't have campaign finance reform until there is a demand by the \nAmerican people that we do so. Only that kind of a demand will move the \nCongress. My own sense is that we are far short of the 60 votes for \ncloture for cutting off debate. But I think there may be 8, 10, 12, \nmaybe even more, Senators who would be influenced by a very strong \nconstituent demand. That influences us from a very realistic sense. \nRegrettably, our hearings this week in Governmental Affairs have not \nbeen covered because there is no scandal. The media and the public are \nattracted, regrettably, only to scandal. It is my hope that as we move \nahead in Governmental Affairs, we will have more public attention.\n  Last week, when we had the testimony as to Roger Tamraz and his \n$300,000 contribution and the testimony about John Huang asking for \nmoney in the White House at a coffee, which the President, apparently, \ncondoned, and the testimony about the man in the line giving the \nPresident a card suggesting millions of dollars of contributions and \nlater being contacted by a Presidential aide, had that been on national \ntelevision, I think the public might well be aroused. It is my hope \nthat the debate here will be spirited. I think, realistically, Senate \ndebates are unlikely to lead the American people to catch fire on this \nissue. But perhaps our Governmental Affairs hearings can do that, or \nsupplement it by media attention generally.\n  I think it is a very useful thing to move ahead with these debates on \ncampaign finance reform. Again, I compliment Senator Lott for \nscheduling them, and I look forward to participating in those debates, \naside from this brief comment in morning business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the chair.\n\n[[Page S9991]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         IRS OVERSIGHT HEARINGS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some oversight \nhearings that have been going on here in the Senate. Also, I hope that \nthe American people are seeing some things happen now that should have \nhappened a long time ago. It wasn't very long ago that the suggestion \nwas made to the Senate that we should go to a 2-year appropriation and \na 2-year budget, because it seems like the time is eaten up here in the \nfirst part of the year to deal with budget and budget reconciliation, \nwhich is very, very important, and then the next part is taken up with \nthe appropriations process.\n  I have contended all along that our role here is not only to deal \nwith budgets and appropriations, but to also deal with legislation and \nreform that, in some areas, is needed to stay up with the times, and \nalso in the area of oversight. We have absolutely taken and extended \nthe work day, more or less, to accommodate oversight. I think what the \nAmerican people are seeing now is the result of that, as there are many \nhearings going on not only in Energy, but Governmental Affairs and, of \ncourse, in the Finance Committee. I want to compliment the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee for this oversight hearing on the IRS.\n  It is something that has been ongoing out there, I think, since \nprobably we started this business of tax collection. Maybe there is no \nright way to collect taxes. I don't know that for sure. Even some \nactivities and actions taken by the Congress have made their job a \nlittle more complicated, and maybe in some cases a little bit tough. \nBut it does not give the IRS the right to do this job in the way that \nhas been enlightened for us through these hearings of oversight of the \nIRS. It has shown a lack of compassion--exhibited by IRS employees \nbeyond my comprehension, and I think beyond the comprehension of those \nin this country, and I imagine those people who have been watching \nthose hearings. Yes. It happened to me too. Because we maybe are just \ntalking about the tip of the iceberg.\n  But some abusive IRS employees have expanded their scope of \nenforcement activities to include business men and women who are just \ntrying to make a living; trying to stay in compliance with all Federal, \nState, and local revenue collecting and regulating laws.\n  At the source of this evil we can level our sights in on some \nmismanagement by some IRS employees. IRS management needs to recognize \nthat they have a difficult job promoting customer service as an IRS \nattribute. It is not an easy task considering the historic attitude \ntoward not the IRS, but taxes. The founding of this great Nation and \nhistory tells us that it kind of started with the Boston Tea Party--a \nrevolt against the tyrannical rule of unfair taxation.\n  Taxes are a necessary evil. But if kept in check, it is important at \nall levels of government. It is a must. Taxes have created the world's \ngreatest highway infrastructure, contributed to the protection of our \nborders, and has created the most successful democratic government in \nhistory. But waste and abuse of those dollars have burdened the \nAmerican taxpayer with one of the highest levels of taxation in the \nhistory of this country.\n  Tax collecting needs to reflect its controversial history. The IRS \ndoes not have the right to use harassment, and, yes--as has been \nbrought out in these hearings--even extortion as a method of collecting \ntaxes.\n  Major changes are overdue. The IRS needs to improve its education and \nservices to taxpayers. Taxpayers must have, at least, a comfort level \nwhen they approach the IRS for help so that they feel with some degree \nof reliability that the IRS will be sensitive to their needs and to \ntheir questions.\n  We need to modernize the computers. Let's face it, the IRS can't do \nthat. They spent some $5 billion to buy new computers. They don't work. \nThey have never worked. We tried to simplify things. What do we do? We \nmade them more complicated.\n  So the general public loses its confidence to go to the IRS and ask \nquestions that they will get answers for; so that they will try to do \nthe right thing for the right reason.\n  I think this is a very serious wake-up call to the IRS. Customer \nservice will never be considered as one of their great attributes. But \nthat is what IRS needs to pound into their employees: We work for the \nAmerican public; it does not work for us. We are a service \norganization. We try to accommodate folks trying to get through a very \ndifficult situation, a situation that some do not understand.\n  Perhaps some of that blame lies with Congress. This is not the first \ntime Congress has held oversight hearings. The IRS has a littered \nhistory of abuse, and, yes--I hate to say--even a little corruption.\n  I think these hearings may pave the way for Senator Domenici's 2-year \nbudget appropriations bill. I think that will lend credence to it. And \nCongress could spend more than 1 year on budgetary and spending matters \nand another year on tough-minded oversight of Government agencies, and \nmaybe the future of such abuse can be averted. But it just does not \nhappen in the IRS. We have other agencies in this Government that are \njust as abusive.\n\n  I have contacted numerous of Montana constituents hearing complaints \nabout the IRS. And I will tell my Senators beware. With these hearings \nI think our casework is going to go up a little bit.\n  During the length of the bureaucratic process, debts grow \nfantastically high with interest and penalties.\n  But I have been contacted by a few taxpayers in Montana that have \nsimilar stories as those that we heard about this week during these \nFinance Committee hearings. In one of those cases a Montana constituent \nhad a pending case with the IRS that still today is unresolved. The \nsmall business was audited in the 1980's. And every time there was an \noffer, or attempt to make settlement, the IRS denies the offer, and the \ninterest and the penalties continue to compound. In the meantime, he \nhas been forced to sell all of his assets. He has lost everything that \nhe has worked his whole life for, and is now facing retirement with \nonly his residence and darned little capital. Even if the IRS could \naccept his recent offer he would be left with a mortgage that he will \nnot be able to pay off in his lifetime.\n  So as a result of these hearings we can certainly expect to hear from \nmore constituents who realize that they are not the problem; that this \nproblem goes way beyond them as individuals, and the problem goes way \nbeyond them as a nation.\n  Prior to the August recess Congress passed the Tax Relief Act of \n1997. The 105th Congress has the opportunity not only to reduce the tax \nburden on the American public but also simplify a system that is badly \nin need of reform. A far less complicated tax system may help to clear \nup some of the IRS abuses. But simplifying the tax system, one can only \nthink, would simplify our revenue collection system.\n  I realize that tax collection is a thankless job. There are employees \nof the IRS that try to do a good job. I happen to know a few of those. \nThey do a good job, and they do it with pride. I commend them for not \nletting the arrogance, uncaring attitude that we have seen emerge out \nof the hearings earlier this week pollute their work ethic. I want to \ncompliment those folks who do a good job.\n  Tax collectors have a long history of public persecution. Today my \ncolleagues and I stand here not to tar and feather the tax collector, \nbut to put an end to the abusive culture that has crept into the \nagency--this business of a situation arising and becoming a personal \nthing. So when they personalize things then it becomes ``me against \nyou, and I have the power of the U.S. Government to destroy you.'' When \nthey personalize things, that is when they get out of hand.\n  I ask the American public, if we, who are elected, when we debate \npersonalize everything, nobody would speak to anybody around here. \nNobody. We have to bring that back into our service organizations. \nBasically the IRS is a service organization. They must accommodate. \nThey must feel some compassion. And they must try to help people out of \nthis almost bottomless abyss of trying to do the right thing for the \nright reason. We cannot let this abusive culture spread like a bacteria \nthrough an agency and let it live. We just cannot do that.\n\n[[Page S9992]]\n\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, rethink your position on a 2-year \nbudget and 2-year appropriations because with all the hearings, as \ncontroversial as they may be in an open and free Government, oversight \nis still the best way to put problems on the table and deal with them. \nIt is the only way in a free self-government that people can deal with \nthem.\n  I thank our secretary of the conference for setting this time aside \nto bring this about. And to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee \nfor this oversight because I think he has done a great service for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nhis statement here this morning. I think he is right on target.\n  I yield at this time up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mrs. Hutchison]. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me wish the Presiding Officer a \ngood morning. Let me thank my colleague from Georgia for his leadership \nin this area, and my good friend from Montana for the points he made so \nsuccinctly.\n  Good morning, Madam President. I have an obligation and an \nopportunity as a member of the Finance Committee to address this \nproblem. As a member of the committee of jurisdiction, I had the \nprivilege of participating in an extraordinary set of hearings that \nwere chaired by Senator Bill Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee. \nThese hearings really illuminated for the first time the internal \nworkings of an agency of the Government that really generates fear, \nanger, frustrations and oftentimes public outrage, and that is the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  No matter how scrupulous and honest the citizen is in filling out his \nor her tax return, when that taxpayer opens the mailbox and receives an \nenvelope from the IRS, a shiver of fear shudders through that citizen. \nAnd after this week's hearings, it is clear to all of us why the public \nholds this view of the IRS.\n  A witness--some of those witnesses were hooded, I might add--\ntestified that her 17-year ordeal--let me say that it wasn't just an \nordeal, it was more of a nightmare--involved improper liens and \nunwarranted demands from the IRS for more than $10,000 simply because \nthere was a mixup in the taxpayer's employment identification number--\n17 years, and still the matter is not resolved.\n  Another witness testified about her 14-year ongoing dispute with the \nIRS involving a joint return she had filed with her former husband. \nAlthough this matter could have been easily resolved, the IRS demands \ncaused her to lose her apartment and ultimately forced her second \nhusband to file for divorce to avoid improper IRS liens.\n  Neither of these cases have been finally resolved even though it is \nclear that at every stage the IRS simply acted improperly.\n  A former IRS employee told the committee of a common IRS tactic of \nassessing a tax twice for the same 1040 tax form.\n  A current IRS employee, an employee who did not want his identity \nknown for fear of IRS retaliation, told the committee of situations \nwhere revenue officers with management approval used enforcement to \npunish taxpayers instead of trying to collect the appropriate amount of \nmoney for the Government.\n  Another anonymous current IRS employee told the committee that IRS \nofficials browsed tax data on potential witnesses in Government tax \ncases, and on jurors sitting on these Government tax cases.\n  Madam President, this is a portrait of an agency of Government which \nappears to be out of control.\n  Is there political influence in the IRS? The answer is clearly yes. \nOne witness testified that she had been advised by her senior official \nto be somewhat lenient on union returns or returns from union \nofficials. This, obviously, smacks of political influence in the IRS.\n  Earlier in the week it was reported that 800 Alaskans from my State \nreceived notices from the IRS that their permanent fund dividends--this \nis a payment that comes from the yield of oil revenues distributed to \nour citizens by our State government--were being seized; 800 seized \nwith a tax lien.\n  The reason for the seizures? The IRS claimed these Alaskans owed back \ntaxes. In one case the notice claimed a deficiency of 4 cents. In \nanother, 7 cents. That's right, Madam President, notices to 800 \nAlaskans based on alleged underpayments of 4 to 7 cents. An IRS \nspokesman apologized and, you guessed it, Madam President, blamed the \ncomputer. But who programmed the computer? Who checked the program? Is \nthe programmer still working for the IRS? Who approved sending out 800 \nnotices to Alaskans?\n  From what I know about the IRS, no human being approved that mailing \nor the millions of other mailings that go out from the IRS. It appears \nto me that the managers of the IRS have set up a system that minimizes \nhuman oversight so that whatever and whenever there is a foulup, no \nemployee, no manager can be held accountable. It is easier to blame an \nimpersonal machine for a problem than hold an individual accountable.\n  Madam President, I believe a culture that affixes blame on machines \nand not human beings reflects on an institution that has for far too \nlong not been held to account for its activities. What we learned from \nthe General Accounting Office is that the system the IRS has in place \nis designed to ensure that there is no way for IRS personnel to be held \naccountable for their erroneous actions.\n  I can assure the American taxpayer that I will be working closely \nwith my colleagues on Finance Committee to change the culture of the \nIRS and demand a system be put into place that makes the individuals \nwho work for the IRS accountable to the American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alaska and \nhis colleagues on the Finance Committee for the great work they have \ndone under the chairmanship of Senator Roth.\n  I now yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  Where has our country gone when people appearing before a Senate \ncommittee have to have their voices disguised and have to be behind \npartitions?\n  I commend the Senate Finance Committee for holding the hearings \nexamining the Internal Revenue Service. These hearings have given the \nAmerican people an insight into one of the most powerful and secretive \nof Federal agencies. I applaud Chairman Roth and members of the Finance \nCommittee for their diligence in examining this agency.\n  For any who might have missed the hearings, on my web site, which is \nwww.senate.gov/ enzi/, you can get the full text of the comments made \nbefore the committee. There is also an opportunity there to do an easy \ne-mail to comment on what has gone on in those hearings. It is \nimportant for this body to follow up on those hearings with a complete \nreexamination of the Nation's tax policy and the IRS. If we are ever to \nbe successful in establishing a just tax code, we in Congress must \nfirst come to a consensus about our underlying tax policy.\n  In the past 3 days, we have heard stories from taxpayers who have \nbeen mistreated by an inefficient and confrontational Internal Revenue \nService. Taxpayers testified that they were forced into personal and \nfinancial ruin by an all-too-often faceless agency with little \naccountability to either the American taxpayers or to Congress.\n  We have heard about the enormous power of the IRS, which includes the \npower to take a taxpayer's home on nothing more than the signature of \nthe district director. There is no court hearing. There is no notice. \nThere is no opportunity to litigate the merits of the Service's claim. \nThe IRS has the power to close down a person's business and take away \nhis livelihood by merely filing a few papers in Federal court. The \njudge signs a seizure order without ever giving the taxpayer notice or \nan opportunity to contest the legality of the assessment or the amount \nof the tax owed or the problem with the computer system.\n\n  Madam President, this is precisely the kind of abuse by our \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S9993]]\n\nour Founding Fathers were attempting to avoid when they included the \nfourth and fifth amendments in the Bill of Rights. These actions amount \nto administrative tyranny.\n  As I have traveled around the State of Wyoming, I have heard a great \ndeal of concern about the present state of the IRS. Our Tax Code is so \nfrustratingly complex that even the professional tax preparers are \npleading for simplicity. These folks know that the present Tax Code \nexposes them to a great deal of liability due to the likelihood of \nconflicting interpretations of the code and its myriad of accompanying \nregulations.\n  As an accountant myself, I am sympathetic to the concerns of those \nwho claim that even the experts cannot agree on many of the provisions \nof the current system. It is unfair to expect Americans to operate \nunder a tax system with such a mind-numbing complexity and inherent \ncontradictions.\n  Under the current regime, it is perhaps the moderate-income taxpayer \nand the small businessman who suffer the most. That is not how audits \nare supposed to work. One of the most surprising facts which came out \nof the testimony this week is the significant increase in audits of \nlower income people and very small businesses over the past several \nyears. This increase is not because the IRS believes these people have \nlarge amounts of unreported income. Rather, it is because the Service \nbelieves these people are the least likely to fight them after an audit \nsince they can least afford professional tax preparers and expensive \nlegal counsel.\n  Just this week, I heard from some small business owners in Wyoming \nwho have been battling the IRS for 5 years over $200,000 in taxes they \nare convinced they do not owe. After a 3-year onsite audit, the IRS \ndetermined that they only owed $30,000, including the fines and \npenalties. Even though they disputed this amount, they figured they had \nno choice but to pay it since they could not afford to take the case to \ncourt. Moreover, the agency threatened that if they didn't agree to pay \nthe bill, IRS would reopen the investigation and insinuated that this \nmight result in even more money owed. That is blackmail. This treatment \nof our citizens is unjust. An agency which turns to coercion and \nintimidation to settle unreasonable disputes is in desperate need of \nreform.\n  Madam President, while I realize that many of the IRS agents are \nhard-working, dedicated public servants, I am convinced the problems we \nhave heard about this week are more than isolated occurrences. Instead, \nthey represent a systematic disease which cannot be cured by tinkering \nwith the current Tax Code or modifying a few Internal Revenue Service \nprocedures. I believe these hearings will force us to reexamine the \nspecifics of our current code and our underlying policy as well.\n  I have made the examination of our tax policy one of my top \npriorities for my service in the Senate. I will work with my colleagues \ntoward developing a policy that reflects the legitimate priorities and \ngoals of raising revenue for a Government which should in its every \nfacet serve the people from whom it derives its power, not control the \npeople from whom it derives its power.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Wyoming and yield up to 5 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding.\n  Madam President, I rise this morning to talk with my colleagues about \nthe Internal Revenue Service. This week my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee have been holding hearings to examine the inner workings of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. I appreciate their effort to more closely \nexamine this institution. Not only do I appreciate it, but there are \nmany Americans who appreciate this effort.\n  For too long the Internal Revenue Service has not been accountable as \nan institution. Our Nation was built on a system of checks and \nbalances. However, the Internal Revenue Service seems to have escaped \nthis protection for Americans. For too long the Internal Revenue \nService has used secrecy, intimidation and fear to do battle against \nthose whom it has been called upon to serve, and that is the American \ntaxpayers.\n\n  I found it especially interesting that during those hearings those \nwho know the Internal Revenue Service best--that is its own employees--\nwere the most afraid. Those who know what the Internal Revenue Service \ndoes were the ones who wanted to protect their identities.\n  Although there are many dedicated employees at the Internal Revenue \nService who perform their jobs honestly and responsibly, there are some \nwho do not. Those few have forgotten the mission statement of the \nInternal Revenue Service, which calls on them to perform in a manner \nwarranting the highest degree of public confidence in their integrity, \nefficiency, and fairness. I remind them of this pledge and call on them \nto uphold it.\n  Unfortunately, the abuse of taxpayers is not limited to the testimony \nwe have heard this week. I have held more than 63 town meetings \nthroughout the State of Colorado, and obviously taxes were a big issue. \nBut it was not unusual for me to hear from many people about the \ndifficulties they have had with the Internal Revenue Service. Time and \nagain I have heard stories about how the Internal Revenue Service plays \na waiting game, knowing that they have the time, the money, and \nmanpower to outlast a small taxpayer.\n  One of my constituents was awarded $325,000 in damages by a Federal \ncourt because Internal Revenue Service agents had wrongfully publicized \ninformation about her, after agreeing earlier that they would not make \nthat information public. After auditing this taxpayer's business, the \nInternal Revenue Service seized the business and demanded $325,000 in \nback taxes. After requesting a reaudit, it was found that she did not \nowe anywhere close to $325,000. In fact, all she owed was $3,400. And \ncertainly there was no real intent to avoid the law.\n  The real problem here, however, was that the agents involved in the \ncase wrongfully disclosed information about the taxpayer after agreeing \nto not disclose that information. When awarding damages in the case, \nthe judge harshly criticized the Internal Revenue Service saying:\n\n       The conduct of our Nation's affairs always demands that \n     public servants discharge their duties under the Constitution \n     and laws of this Republic with fairness and a proper spirit \n     of subservience to the people whom they are sworn to serve. \n     Respect for the law can only be fostered if citizens believe \n     that those responsible for implementing and enforcing the law \n     are themselves acting in conformity with the law.\n\n  Once again, though, the Internal Revenue Service is dragging its \nfeet, refusing to pay the money.\n  Other constituents have described situations where they received \nnotices from the Internal Revenue Service for very minor mistakes and \nthen are assessed penalties and interest that far exceed the amount of \ntax owed. It is a frightening experience to get a notice from the \nInternal Revenue Service, particularly when it is so difficult to \ncommunicate back to them and actually get some real answers concerning \na case.\n  I am reminded of a case that came up in interacting with the \nconstituents that I represent in the State of Colorado. Someone came up \nto me and said, ``We sent a certified letter to the Internal Revenue \nService with the check.'' They signed for the envelope and yet the \ncheck apparently had been lost by the Internal Revenue Service. This \nconstituent was fined $200 by the Internal Revenue Service. She felt \npaying the fine was cheaper than getting professional help to fight the \ncase. Constituents tell me of years of meetings, negotiations, and \ndelay by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Madam President, I request 30 seconds just to summarize my remarks, \nif I may.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will yield for just a moment, Madam \nPresident, time allotted for this discussion was to end at 10. I have \nconferred with Senator McCain, and I believe he is agreeable to \nallowing it to run until 10:05 to allow Senator Bond to make his \nremarks. So I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Colorado.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to extend \ntime 5 minutes? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered. The Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  Constituents tell me of years of meetings, negotiations and delays by\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service in order to wear them down, even in cases \nwhere the law is unclear and subject to different interpretations. This \nabuse of taxpayers must stop. The Internal Revenue Service must \nrecommit itself to serving the taxpayers. It must stop making criminals \nout of those whom it is charged with helping.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Colorado and \nnow yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia and I \nthank the Chair.\n  I rise today to address an issue of profound importance, as my \ncolleagues have been addressing, and that is the urgent need for a \ncomplete overhaul of the tax system in this country.\n  Over this past week, we have all watched as the Senate Finance \nCommittee has held important hearings on the administration of our \ncurrent tax system. The testimony has demonstrated many things quite \nclearly, among them the fear of many taxpayers. But it has also been \nquite plain that for many taxpayers the root of their difficulties \nstarts with the enormous complexity of the tax laws as they currently \nstand. Clearly, there is an urgent need to scrap the current tax law \nand start with a new system so that taxpayers can understand and follow \nthe law in the first place.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I have heard \nin hearings from entrepreneurs all across the country that their \nbiggest obstacle to staying in business is complying with the tax laws. \nThe tax bill that we passed last summer did much to ease the tax burden \nfor many small businesses. But at the same time it did nothing to \nreduce the complexity of the law which small enterprises must navigate \nin order to enjoy the lower tax bills. As a result, instead of leveling \nthe playing field for small businesses we have made it more lopsided. \nUnlike their larger competitors, small businesses can rarely afford a \nstaff of full-time professional employees to maintain the tax records \nand fill out the dozens of forms required each year. To put these \nduties in context, it has been estimated that Americans spend more than \n5 billion hours each year complying with the tax laws. That is a \nstaggering amount of time spent on completely unproductive activities.\n  One of the figures that we have heard in the Small Business Committee \nis that the average small business spends 5 percent of its revenues on \nfiguring out how to comply with the tax laws. That is not paying the \ntaxes, that is figuring out how much tax they owe and how to comply \nwith the tax laws. Would it not be better for small businesses to spend \nthat time making products, providing services, providing jobs--\nactivities that they set out to do in the first place?\n  For the vast majorities of small enterprises there is only one person \nwho handles all the tax matters and that is the small businessowner. \nThat is the one person who has to deal with nearly 10,000 pages of tax \nlaws, 20 volumes of tax regulations, and thousands and thousands of \npages of instructions and other guidance, issued by the IRS. Sadly, \nmuch of that burden is more than most small businessowners can do on \ntheir own. Instead, they are forced to spend vast amounts of their \nlimited capital to hire accountants to keep the records and prepare the \ntax returns.\n  For the small business that runs into difficulties on its taxes, the \nsituation becomes even worse. The businessowner must spend additional \nfunds on accountants and lawyers to handle the issue. Resolving these \ncases can take years, and cost tens of thousands of dollars in \nprofessional fees. Not infrequently, the end result is a tax bill that \nis inflated by the large amounts of interest and penalties.\n  Once again, we must keep in mind that every hour the small \nbusinessowner spends trying to resolve tax problems is taken away from \nthe actual productive business of running his or her own company.\n  Madam President, the Small Business Committee will hold a hearing \nnext month to elicit the views of small business on what the optimal \ntax system would look like, if we started from scratch. I look forward \nto constructive suggestions from the small business community. I expect \nthey will say the system should be fair, simple, and easy for the \naverage person to understand. It should apply a low rate to all \nAmericans. It should eliminate taxes for individuals and families who \ncan least afford to pay. It should not penalize marriage or families. \nIt should protect the rights of taxpayers and reduce taxpayer abuse. It \nshould minimize recordkeeping and reporting requirements. It should \neliminate the bias against jobs, and investment. It should protect \nSocial Security and Medicare and help ensure all Americans have access \nto health insurance.\n  The case cannot be clearer that we need a dramatic change in our tax \nlaws, and we need it soon.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the full text of my remarks \nwill be on the web site of the Small Business Committee at \nwww.senate.gov/ sbc.\n   Mr. President, the case cannot be clearer that we need a dramatic \nchange in our tax laws and we need it soon. Too much time, money, and \neffort are now wasted by individuals and businesses in this country \nthat could be spent to improve our economy, our society, and the \nenvironment. I ask my colleagues to join me in raising the alarm and \ncommitting ourselves to do more than just talk about the problem. It's \ntime to act--it's time for a new, fair, and simple tax system for all \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank each of the Senators who this \nmorning commented on the extensive hearings under Chairman Roth. They \nwere very revealing. I believe there can be no doubt but that major \nreforms must be brought to the Nation in short order. Each of these \nSenators made a substantial contribution to further elaborating and \nmaking clear the urging of the Congress for this agency to reform \nitself. Remember that it works for the people, not the other way \naround.\n  I yield the floor. It is exactly 5 minutes after 10. I know the \nSenate is prepared to move to campaign reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S9990-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of S. 25, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A bill (S. 25) to reform the financing of Federal elections.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, may I make a unanimous-consent \nrequest for 10 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that Michael Smith, who is an \nintern in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor during \ndebate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today the Senate begins to formally debate \nwhat is probably the most discussed and least understood issue before \nthe Nation, campaign finance reform. I have made clear, for the last \nseveral months, actually, that the Senate would, in due time, after \nfinishing its work on the budget and the 13 appropriations bills, move \nto this matter. I indicated all along that I knew this issue would come \nup, that it should come up, and it should be debated. And, therefore, I \nhave kept that commitment and we will begin our debate. We will have a \nfull debate, and we will have some votes. Maybe not the votes that \neverybody would like to have, but critical, key votes on assessing \nwhere the Senate is.\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n\n  Are we near a consensus yet? Are we prepared to stop trying to claim \nan advantage here or an advantage there and see if we can come together \nin a consensus in this area? I have my doubts that we have reached that \npoint yet. But we begin the debate, I hope, in a respectful and \nthoughtful way. I trust no Member of this body doubted my intention to \ndo what from the very beginning I said we would do, in terms of calling \nthis legislation up.\n  We are taking up this issue now under a unanimous-consent agreement \nidentical to the one I propounded a few days go and to which the \nminority leader did not at that time agree. So at the outset of this \ndebate, I want to make this clear. President Clinton's standing on this \nsubject of campaign finance reform is a case study of the problem, not \nan exemplar of the solution. Indeed, it would take the Senate, and the \nHouse too, staying in marathon session all the way through Christmas, \njust to trace the appalling campaign finance practices that were so \nlarge a part of President Clinton's reelection effort.\n  Just today I understand from WTOP radio news this morning, the \nPresident is in Houston after last night calling, trying to get \nSenators ginned up to come in here and speak on this subject. But what \nis he going to be doing in Houston? I have his whole schedule, off the \nwire service, as well as the remarks made this morning on WTOP. I will \nput it in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Friday, Sept. 26\n     White House\n       President Clinton:\n       In Little Rock and Houston. All times local.\n       11 a.m. Departs private residence, Little Rock.\n       11:15 a.m. Arrives at Adams Field.\n       11:30 a.m. Air Force I departs en route Houston.\n       12:40 p.m. Air Force I arrives at George Bush \n     Intercontinental Airport, Houston.\n       12:50 p.m. Departs airport en route San Jacinto Community \n     College.\n       1:20 p.m. Arrives at San Jacinto Community College.\n       1:30 p.m. Addresses the college community.\n       2:40 p.m. Departs college en route down-time location.\n       3 p.m. Arrives at downtown location.\n       7:15 p.m. Addresses DNC dinner.

The White House \n     thought it would have several more weeks to plot strategy for \n     passing one version or another of the McCain/Feingold bill.\n       ``So, as Mr. Clinton finished a five-hour round of golf \n     last evening, he quickly placed calls to a handful of \n     Senators to talk strategy for today's debate.\n       ``The President has loudly proclaimed campaign finance \n     reform as one of his top legislative priorities for the fall. \n     And this week, he threatened to call Congress back into \n     session if it adjourned without taking up the issue.\n       ``With his own political fund raising practices the subject \n     of a Justice Department review and the possibility that it \n     could lead to the appointment of an independent counsel, \n     there is a political component to the President being seen as \n     Cheerleader-in-Chief for campaign finance reform.\n       ``But as it turns out, the Senate debate begins on a day \n     that will find the President on a day trip to Houston. His \n     schedule there includes a fund raising dinner for the \n     Democratic National Committee which expects to raise \n     $600,000, some of it from contributions the President wants \n     to outlaw.\n       ``In Houston, the President will also talk about new data \n     showing that his college tuition tax credit plan will help \n     increasing numbers of people attend at least two years of \n     college. With the President in Little Rock, I'm Mark Knoller, \n     CBS News.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Among other things he will be doing in Houston today is \nattending a fundraiser tonight, where it is estimated they will raise \n$600,000, some of which if not much of which is exactly the kind of \nmoney that he has said, ``Oh, we ought to stop.'' What is he saying \nhere, ``Oh, please stop me before I do it again?''\n  So, I think we need to start off making it clear what is going on \nhere. A lot of what is going on is an effort to change the subject. \n``Oh, gee whiz, the Governmental Affairs Committee has come up with \nsome things that are a real problem. Gee, why won't the Attorney \nGeneral appoint independent counsel? We have to have another subject on \nthe griddle here.'' But that's OK. That's fine. Finally we will, maybe, \nshed a little light on what is going on here.\n  It seems that much of what will need to be done with regard to \nviolation of the laws--before you start changing laws to try to see if \nyou can fix problems, wouldn't it help if the laws already on the books \nwere obeyed and enforced? Wouldn't it be better if we found out how \npeople violated the laws last year? Who did it? What do we need to \ntighten it up with regard to illegal foreign contributions, direct and \nindirect?\n  But it seems that much of the task of what really went on will be \nleft to others, unless the Attorney General can discover still more \ningenious reasons for delaying what increasingly seems inevitable, the \nappointment of independent counsel.\n  For us here, we will do what we are going to do anyway, before Mr. \nClinton's unnecessary and irrelevant letter. We will at least have the \nopportunity to lay before the American people the pros and cons of \nvarious proposals for campaign finance reform.\n  In the process, I think it will become clear that in campaign law, as \ntax law, there is no bad idea that cannot be made presentable by taking \non the label of ``reform.'' This is our chance to see more closely some \nof the ideas that have been presented and whether or not they will \nreally work--or not; whether they will be fair; and whether they will \nencourage discourse and expression of views and opportunities for \ncandidates to go directly to the people instead of being filtered by \nthe news media.\n  Let me offer this comparison. On the issue of campaign reform we have \nbeen like a customer in a used-car lot. The salesmen have been talking \nabout this little beauty's wire wheels and leather upholstery, and it \nhas all sounded pretty good. But now we get to look under the hood and \nfind out why this deal looks too good to be true and, in fact, probably \nis.\n  Before we launch into the details, though, I want to pay tribute to \nthose of our colleagues who have worked on this issue at great length \nand in good faith. Some of them I agree with and with others I \ndisagree. And, hopefully, we will disagree without being disagreeable. \nBut all those who have pursued this issue out of personal conviction, \nrather than political expediency, merit our commendation. My \ndisagreements on this matter with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold \nare well known--and may well become more emphatic in the course of this \ndebate. But I recognize the sincerity of their views and I thank them \nfor their cooperation that has enabled us to take up other legislation \nwithout being intercepted or interrupted or heckled. They have been \nresponsible. They deserve the right to talk about their bill and we \ndeserve the right to point out where the problems are. And I think we \nhave set up a way to consider this legislation in an orderly manner.\n  Senator Mitch McConnell more than anyone else has argued against \ntheir position. Entirely apart from the part that I agree with him, he \nstands today as an example of political courage, someone who is willing \nto challenge the prevailing wisdom because it is incorrect and because \nit would violate or restrict the fundamental rights of Americans.\n  Legislation is never considered in a vacuum and this legislation is \nno exception to that rule. The Senate will be debating campaign finance \nreform against a background of lurid exposes about the campaign of \n1996. All summer long the Nation has heard news about people ignoring \nthe law, fleeing the country to avoid the law, explaining away the law, \nrefusing to testify about their actions and the law. From\n\n[[Page S9996]]\n\nall that, some may conclude that we need more laws. Others may wonder \nwhy we don't enforce the laws we already have concerning campaign \nfinance, and let the personal chips fall where they may.\n\n  The fact is, this country already has so many campaign laws and \ncampaign regulations that to avoid breaking the law most congressional \ncampaigns have to hire a battery of legal experts just to avoid fines \nand censure by the Federal Election Commission. No longer do you sit \ndown, like I did in 1972, and fill out my campaign finance reports, you \nknow, in longhand, and try to make sure it adds up, send it in and \nstruggled to get it in on time. Nah. Now you have to have legal advice, \nyou have to have a CPA, you have to have somebody familiar with the FEC \nlaws. It becomes one of the burdens of elections. Why don't we, \ninstead, go with freedom, open it up, have full disclosure and let \neverybody participate to the maximum they wish.\n  But, no, no, no, no; we keep tightening down, tightening down, \ntightening down. Do you know what really is involved here? There are a \nlot of people who don't want the people involved. They want the news \nmedia to dictate, through their editorial columns and their editorials \nin their news articles, who will be elected.\n  Boy, I know how that works. I have had to deal with that in my State. \nIf I hadn't been able to get the money to get my message across, how \ncould a conservative Republican be elected in the State of Mississippi, \nwhere the courthouses were all owned and operated by Democrats almost \nentirely, so I had the so-called court house gang fighting me and the \nbiggest newspaper in the State bashing me regularly in its editorials \nand in its news stories in the form of editorials. You know, I took \nbasic 101 journalism in high school and I know the difference between a \nnews story and an editorial. But my friends in the print media quite \noften get that a little confused. As well as the largest television \nstation in the State, which regularly took my head off any way they \ncould.\n  So, how did I win? Because I had the opportunity to take my case to \nthe people, raise the money to get my message across over the head of \nthe opposition, and the people gave me the opportunity to serve in this \nbody.\n  The fact is, today's political campaigns are forced to operate within \na web of campaign law first devised almost a quarter century ago. No \nmatter how unworkable some of them are, how out of date some of them \nare, instead of pulling back and clearing away, the temptation is \nalways to add on.\n  That is what happened with the IRS. Can you believe it? The U.S. \nSenate Finance Committee, with jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue \nService, this week had its first ever oversight hearing on the \nviolations, abuses, intimidations, and threats from the IRS. We are \npartly to blame. We have been hearing about these problems for years. \nWhat did we do about it? More laws. We kept adding on. We kept putting \non more pressures. Unfortunately, too often we added more taxes.\n  The same is true here. The temptation is to restrict and limit free \nspeech. Add on another restriction, one on top of another, with regard \nto campaign spending or the ability to raise money. Add on another \nreporting requirement. Add on another financial incentive, often from \nthe taxpayer's purse, for campaigns to behave or advertise in a certain \nway.\n  Remember now some of the things that have been advocated along the \nway, I believe, in the campaign finance reform bill proposed originally \nby Senators McCain and Feingold--a form of public financing of \ncampaigns. People don't support that. Great; we are going to have the \nU.S. Treasury dollars go to candidates with a system of incentives and \npunishments and voluntary do this, don't do that; oh, by the way we \nwill give you free broadcasting. The American people know there ain't \nnothing free. Somebody is going to pay. But that is kind of what the \npush has been.\n  I hope the debate we are starting today will break us out of that \nregulatory rut. We now have a chance to go back to square one and to \nreconsider the fundamental principles of what all along has been taken \nfor granted.\n  For example, with today's computer technology--so rapid and so \nrevealing beyond the imagination of the lawmakers of 1974 when the \npresent law was enacted--perhaps the public good would best be served, \nnot by restricting donations to campaigns, but by promoting them, with \nfull disclosure--full, total, and immediate disclosure.\n  I wonder what would happen if every donation to a Federal campaign \nhad to be logged onto the Internet as it was received by the campaign. \nAnyone interested in the integrity of that campaign, the identity of \nits donors, the possibility of undue influence or corruption, would be \nable to track the campaign's revenues dollar by dollar as they come in. \nMaybe we could agree on that.\n  Then let interested Americans donate as they will, for this one \noverriding reason: Because spending money to advance your own political \nviews is as much a part of the right of free speech as running a free \npress.\n  I think the whole problem can be summed up in this one example. \nSuppose a distinguished surgeon feels strongly about a particular \nissue, whether it is Government control of health care or environmental \npolicy or our entanglement in Bosnia. Her work is her life. She is \nsaving lives every day. She has no time to devote to politics. Instead, \nshe donates to candidates who agree with her views.\n  But her college-age son, on the other hand, has plenty of time, and \nhe disagrees with his doctor-mother on just about everything, which \nwouldn't be unusual for a young college student to disagree with his or \nher parents. So he cuts back on his classes and volunteers 40 hours a \nweek for the candidates who oppose her candidates. In the process, he \nsaves those candidates a considerable amount of money doing for free \nwhat they otherwise would have to pay for.\n  Now, which of those two is a good citizen: The wealthy physician who \nwrites checks to campaigns, or the pugnacious young man who gives them \nhis time and labor?\n\n  My answer is both of them. Our campaign laws ought to encourage both \ntheir public spirit and their political involvement.\n  But our laws don't do that. They don't advert at all to the student \nvolunteer or, for that matter, to the Hollywood personality whose \ndonated performance brings in, say, $1 million for a Presidential \ncampaign. For some reason, campaign contribution limits seem to stop \nright outside the gated driveways of some of the richest and most \ninfluential personages of the land.\n  But those laws do apply to the doctor and to everyone else who sits \ndown to write a check, to put their money where their views are. I have \nmade no secret of the fact that we need more such people, not fewer, \nand that our present campaign laws should be reformed so that they \ndon't discourage citizen involvement of any sort.\n  That is especially important with regard to issue advocacy by the \nwhole range of public policy organizations, left or right, liberal to \nconservative. The inclination by Government to regulate speech--or \nexpenditures that are the equivalent of speech--is hard to contain.\n  It starts with the understandable wish to discourage slander and \nlibel in campaigns. It proceeds to various schemes to review and \ncontrol the content of campaign ads, and it ends up in attempts to \nrestrict the essential right of private citizens to expose the records \nof candidates and reveal where they stand on crucial issues of the day.\n  Do I like this? When I am the brunt of some of that, no, I don't like \nit, and we can probably get bipartisan agreement that some of the \nnegative aspects of it are not good. We don't like it. But how do we \ntell a private citizen that he or she can't pick a billboard and say, \nCongressman X or Senator X voted wrong on an issue? I think we need to \nthink long and hard about that.\n  I hasten to add that, in its current form, the legislation before us \ndoes not do all of those things. I have been speaking more generally \nabout various proposals that have won considerable credence in the \nmedia which, come to think of it, is the very last place those \nproposals should be tolerated. After all, once we lower the bar between \nGovernment and free expression of political ideas, we imperil that \nexpression for everyone.\n  I am not suggesting that every aspect of campaign financing is so \nclear\n\n[[Page S9997]]\n\nor so simple that all well-meaning persons will inevitably come to the \nsame conclusion about it. They won't. But there is one campaign finance \nissue about which that is the case, about which all persons of good \nwill should, indeed, reach the same conclusion.\n  That is the principle that no person should be compelled to \nfinancially support a political campaign, especially a campaign with \nwhich he or she does not agree. Surely we can agree on that.\n  Our instinctive reaction is to say, ``Oh, that's out of the question; \nyou can't be compelled to contribute to a candidate or campaign you \ndon't agree with or against your will; it couldn't happen in America.''\n  Well, it does. It happens all the time, and it is happening now. I am \nreferring to the great scandal in American politics, what is to my mind \nthe worst campaign abuse of them all: The forceful collection and \nexpenditure of business fees or union dues for political purposes. This \nis not something that is aimed at businesses or at unions because I am \nunduly critical of them. We want more business. We want jobs. We want \nthem to be involved in the political process. I am the son of a \nshipyard worker, a pipefitter, who was a union steward for a while.\n  I think we should encourage union members to be involved and active \nin politics. My own father was and so were my grandfathers on both \nsides of the family. So I have made the point over the years to go into \nplants and mills and stand at the gates and go into union halls--yes, \nunion halls. I have had some interesting times there, because I quite \noften ask union members, ``Do you agree with these things?'' and run \ndown the list. They don't agree with them; they agree with me. It is \nthe union ratings of who is voting right or wrong. The local union \nmembers in my hometown more often agree with me than they do with the \nunion bosses in Washington.\n\n  Sometimes, by the way, I think businesses do this, too, that somehow \nyou have to contribute fees, or some process is used to get your money \nand put it in campaigns. The individual should have the final say and \ntotal control over how that happens. They should either have to write \nout the check for a specific purpose or give specific approval before \nthose dues or those fees could be used.\n  I have heard complaints from union members about how disgruntled they \nare about the way their dues are mishandled by the national union \nofficers. I have heard their anger and frustration knowing their unions \nare financially supporting a candidate whom they oppose. When they ask \nme why this is permitted, how am I supposed to answer? ``Well, the law \njust allows that.''\n  The courts are saying that shouldn't happen, but, buddy, you are \ngoing to hear a lot of screaming and hollering on the floor of this \nbody about, ``Oh, we can't have that opportunity for members or \nemployees of a business or a union to direct where their contributions \ngo, where their dues go.'' I think that is going to be pretty hard to \ndefend for the average blue collar working man and woman wherever they \nare.\n  Should I tell them those who wrote our earlier campaign laws \ndeliberately slanted those laws to hurt certain interests and advance \nothers? Should I tell them that much of what passes for campaign \nfinance reform today would only worsen those deliberate inequities?\n  As far as I am concerned, righting that wrong is the price of \nadmission to campaign finance reform. If a Senator is willing to free \nemployees and union members from that compulsory contribution of their \nhard-earned wages to political campaigns, then I can accept that \nSenator as a legitimate participant in the campaign reform debate, \nwhether or not I agree with his or her views on the rest of the \nsubjects. At least we know they want fairness, an opportunity for \npeople to have some say where their dues, their fees, will go.\n  But anyone who is not willing to take that essential first step to \nprotect the earnings and consciences of employees and union members \nagainst the political diversion of their fees or expenses or union \ndues, that person, in my mind, has no standing in the debate we are \nbeginning today.\n  Madam President, I never deceive myself into thinking the American \npeople follow every word that is spoken on the floor of the Senate. I \nhope not. They usually are too busy making America better by pursuing \ntheir own individual dreams. But this debate, I think, will catch and \nhold their attention for a while, and I think they are going to be \ninterested in what they hear.\n  They may not have been able to read both sides in some of the news \nmedia, but hopefully they are about to hear it from me and from others \nand from the media that will tell both sides of the story and tell what \nthe options are. At the end of what I think we are going to see this \ndebate deliver will be a sea change in opinion as the public rethinks \nthe role of candidates, of donors, of volunteers, of issue advocacy \ngroups, and of Congress itself, whose track record on legislating on \nthis issue has not been stellar.\n  In the past, the Supreme Court has had to overturn patently \nunconstitutional campaign reform legislation. Let us do nothing now to \nforce a repetition of that rebuke. As a Member of the House and Senate \nover the years, I have heard, ``We can't worry about that; we don't \nknow what they will do. Let's just do what we want to do and then we \nwill see.'' I don't think that is very responsible. You can always \nargue what is constitutional and not constitutional, but free speech is \npretty easy to discern, and it ought to be hard to limit.\n  In the very recent past, there were 38 Members of the Senate who were \nwilling, on the record, to amend the Constitution to give a Federal \nagency, the Federal Election Commission, the power to limit the first \namendment rights of individual Americans. That, I trust, is an idea \nwhose time has come and gone and will never come again.\n\n  In closing, Madam President, I would like to recall a line from what \nwas probably the first drama written and performed in America. It was \ncalled ``The Candidate, or the Humours of a Virginia Election.'' In it, \na seasoned older candidate advises a younger one that when he makes \npromises he knows he cannot deliver, he should say, ``upon my honor,'' \notherwise they won't believe you.\n  Well, thus far, in the national debate about campaign finance reform, \nmuch has been said ``upon my honor.'' Now comes the real test of ideas, \nso the American people can decide for themselves whom to believe and \nwhom to trust about this matter that goes to the heart of their \npersonal rights and their political liberty.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, this Congress has spent many, many \nmonths and millions and millions of dollars to investigate perceived \nabuses in the 1996 election. There have been cries of outrage and \nshock. The American people are deeply cynical about whether Congress \nwill ever pass campaign finance reform because they believe \npoliticians' self-interests will, once again, override public good. If \nafter all the hearings, all the press releases, all the statements, we \ndo absolutely nothing, that cynicism is justified.\n\n  The American people are not dumb. They know the system is broken. \nThey know we now have an opportunity to fix it, but they do not think \nwe will. But we can use this opportunity, the next several days, to \nprove them too pessimistic. We need a sincere bipartisan effort to \nclean up our own house.\n  So, Madam President, this is a defining moment. People who think they \ncan kill this effort with political gamesmanship--without anyone \nnoticing--are wrong. If we squander this opportunity, it will not go \nunnoticed.\n  Today, we begin one of the most important debates that we will have \nin this Congress. We have sought this opportunity for almost a year. I \nappreciate the majority leader has now agreed to this debate. I hope \nhis colleagues will not act to block meaningful reform now that we have \nthe opportunity to deal with it. This is not only an easier way to \nresolve this issue, it is by far a better way. The American people have \na right to hear full and open debate. And we have an opportunity and a \nresponsibility to conduct it.\n  I appreciate, too, President Clinton's determination to see that we \nhave a good debate and his willingness to take the extraordinary step--\nand I hope\n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\nthat it will not be necessary--of calling a special session of Congress \nto make sure that there is sufficient time for a thorough debate.\n  It has been a generation since the last campaign finance reform laws \nwere signed. Today, those laws are practically useless. Some have been \ncircumvented by new loopholes. Senator Lott has noted all of the \nattention to abuse and the fact that we have so many laws on the books \ntoday.\n  The fact is that many of those laws are unenforceable because they \nhave been poorly drafted, because they intentionally, in many cases, \ncreated loopholes, because they are ambiguous, because we do not have \nthe teeth in the Federal Election Commission system to deal with it.\n  Just today in the Wall Street Journal there is an article that the \nformer chairman of the Republican National Committee, Haley Barbour, is \nnow being investigated by a grand jury for fundraising infractions he \nmay or may not have committed as chairman over the last couple of \nyears.\n  So, Madam President, this is not a Republican problem or a Democratic \nproblem. This is an American problem, an American problem evidenced by \ngrand jury investigations, by special counsel investigations, by \ncongressional investigations. The investigations go on and on. And if \nwe do not deal with it, the cynicism will rise, the participation in \ndemocracy will fall, and we will all be the victims.\n  So, Madam President, we have an opportunity today to build on the \nhistory.\n  In 1971 and in 1974, Democratic Congresses enacted major reforms that \nwe thought would address many of these problems. We limited the amount \nof money in politics and required candidates to disclose where they got \ntheir money. But, unfortunately, many of those reforms, as we all well \nknow, were thrown out by the controversial decision of the Supreme \nCourt in 1976, Buckley versus Valeo.\n  For the last 21 years, since that decision, Democrats have tried to \novercome obstacles put in place by that ruling. We have tried to find \nways to address the complexities, the problems, the shortcomings of \nthat decision.\n  It was 10 years ago, at the opening of the 100th Congress, that then-\nmajority leader Robert C. Byrd introduced a bill to limit spending and \nreduce special interest influence. We had to fight through eight \ncloture votes, eight filibusters, in order to get the opportunity to \nfinally vote on the issue. Democratic sponsors modified the bill to \nmeet Republican objections. But in the end, Republicans continued to \noppose the bill, and ultimately it died.\n  It was 8 years ago in the Democratic-led 101st Congress, both the \nHouse and the Senate passed campaign finance reform bills. President \nBush threatened to veto the bill because it contained voluntary \nspending limits, effectively killing the bill.\n\n  Six years ago, in the 102d Congress, also a Democratic-led Congress, \nagain the House and Senate passed campaign finance reform bills. And at \nthat time the President--President Bush --vetoed the bill, with the \nbacking of nearly every congressional Republican.\n  In the 103d Congress, we passed campaign finance reform with 95 \npercent of the Democrats in the Senate and 91 percent of the Democrats \nin the House voting for reform; 95 percent in the Senate, 91 percent in \nthe House, voting for the reform. Yet, Republicans filibustered the \nmove to take the bill to conference.\n  Senator McConnell has boasted of that filibuster that ``My party did \nthe slaying then.''\n  The 104th Congress, supposedly the ``reform Congress,'' also \npresented opportunities for campaign reform. It appeared reform might \nactually happen when President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich shook hands \nin Vermont and pledged to create a commission on campaign financing. \nBut the commission never materialized.\n  Then, Senators McCain and Feingold introduced their bipartisan reform \nplan. Again, reform seemed within reach. And 46 of 47 Senate Democrats \nvoted for McCain-Feingold. Republicans in the Senate filibustered the \nmeasure. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House introduced a bill that \nwould have allowed a family of four to contribute $12.4 million in \nFederal elections--125 times more than the current allowed amount. We \ndid not get anywhere in that Congress either.\n  That brings us to this Congress, the 105th. In his State of the Union \nAddress in January, President Clinton made it very clear the importance \nthat he put on the priority that Democrats have reiterated throughout \nthis year, that we pass campaign finance reform. He called upon us to \ndo it by July 4.\n  During the balanced budget negotiations in February, the President \nand Democrats in Congress asked our Republican colleagues to make \ncampaign finance reform one of the top priority issues on which a \nbipartisan task force could be established. They refused to do so.\n  In the House, Republicans have voted five times in this Congress \nagainst bringing campaign finance reform to the floor. Here in the \nSenate, we actually have had one vote on campaign finance reform. That \nwas a vote this past March to kill a constitutional amendment that \nwould have allowed reasonable limits on campaign spending.\n  The problem is very simple, Madam President. The problem is the \namount of money, the decades of delay. In the two decades since Buckley \nversus Valeo, since the Congress passed the only real campaign reform \nlaws on the books today, the amount of money in politics has \nskyrocketed. It is no accident, no coincidence, that voter turnout and \npublic confidence in this institution has plummeted. Even Nero would \nhave put down his fiddle before now. But we just keep on playing, while \nspending on political campaigns spins out of control.\n  That is the fundamental problem. We all know that. We hear talk in \nthis debate about hard money and soft money, this money and that money. \nThat isn't the core problem. The core problem is that there is too much \nmoney, period. Too much money.\n  Total congressional campaign spending has exploded in the last 20 \nyears. We spent $115 million on Federal campaigns in the 1975-76 \nelection cycle. Ten years later, in the 1985-86, we spent $450 million. \nIn the last cycle, 1995-96, Madam President, we spent $765 million on \nFederal campaigns.\n  Each election cycle shatters another spending record; 1996 was no \nexception. Spending in Federal campaigns increased 73 percent over the \nprevious Presidential cycle; 73 percent in four years. To put that in \nperspective, during the same period, wages rose 13 percent, college \ntuition rose 17 percent, but Federal campaign spending rose 73 percent.\n  The average cost of winning a Senate seat in 1996 was $4.5 million. \nTo raise that much money, a Senator has to raise $14,000 a week, every \nweek, for 6 years.\n  I am currently--I am sure the majority leader is, too--seeking \ncandidates to run for the U.S. Senate. I wish I could give you some \nindication of how difficult it is to tell a candidate, ``I want you to \nrun. I want you to seek one of the highest offices in the land. But to \ndo that, you're going to have to somehow raise $4.5 million between now \nand next November. I know you don't have those kinds of personal \nresources. And I don't know how you'll raise the money. But never mind, \nyou can do it. And I promise that you will never be indebted to any \ncontributor. I promise that, regardless of how much you spend, you'll \nnever have one of those contributors come back and ask you for \nsomething.''\n  Madam President, the system is broken. That experience is repeated \nover and over and over again. How many more times will we have to tell \nsomeone who may consider running for the U.S. Senate, ``You can't \nafford it. This is now a club for millionaires. You either have lots of \nmoney, or you're indebted to somebody for the rest of your life.'' But \nthat is the choice. That should not be the American way. That should \nnot be allowed to happen to the political system we have believed for \nall these years.\n  The average cost of winning a House seat in 1996 was $660,000. To \nraise that much money, Members in the House had to raise $6,000 a week, \nevery week, for 2 years. It is demeaning. It is distracting. It takes \nus away from what we should be doing.\n  It used to be you worked the fundraisers around the Senate schedule. \nNow we work the Senate schedule around the fundraisers.\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\n  What I am describing now, Madam President, is a problem. We have not \neven reached the crisis stage yet. But we projected, given current \nrates of political inflation, what the typical Senate race will cost in \nour lifetime, 28 years from now, the year 2025. In the year 2025, if \nnothing changes, a typical Senate race will cost $145 million per \ncandidate--per candidate. Are you going to tell your son or your \ndaughter you want them to get into political life? Are you going to \ntell your son or your daughter that somehow in their lifetime, if they \nwant to seek higher office, that they have to spend $145 million of \ntheir own money, or raise that much from other people? I do not even \nthink Jay Rockefeller could afford that.\n  The effect of the money, Madam President, is quite clear. Beyond the \nsheer amount of money is the effect the money has. At the very least, \nin the eyes of most Americans, the current system makes Congress appear \nto be for sale to the highest bidder.\n  A recent Harris Poll shows that 85 percent of the people in this \ncountry already think that special interests have more influence than \nthe voters. Eighty-five percent think if you are going to come up \nagainst a special interest, Congress is going to listen to the special \ninterest first.\n  Three-quarters of Congress think that we are largely owned by special \ninterests today. Democracy cannot survive long in such a deeply cynical \natmosphere, Madam President. We cannot survive that. It is no secret \nwhy voters are not going to the polls anymore. They do not think it \nmakes any difference. ``What difference does it make as long as the \nspecial interests have the power, between the elections, to decide what \nwe do?''\n  So, Madam President, if we do nothing at all, problems are going to \nworsen.\n  The recent explosion in the so-called ``independent expenditure ads'' \nis just another illustration, another example of what we are facing. It \nis a particularly virulent form of political advertising. In my view, \nindependent expenditures are the ``crack cocaine'' of negative ads. \nThey are potent, they are deadly, and they are going to kill the \nsystem.\n  They are not tied publicly to any candidate--no reporting, no \naccountability. We do not even know who is running the ads half the \ntime.\n  In the last election cycle, Republicans spent $10 million on \nindependent expenditures; Democrats spent $1.5 million. But those \nfigures are nothing compared to what we are going to see in this cycle.\n  Independent expenditure ads push candidates to the margins. \nCandidates become bit players in their own races. The debate is defined \nby whoever has the most money. That is ultimately who dominates the \nmedia. We used to interrupt programs for ads. These days, we interrupt \nthe political ads for programs.\n  The solution? Well, we have been grappling with that question for a \nlong time. There are those who look at all of this and contend that \nnothing is wrong, that this is America, this is free speech. What is \nwrong with the system? You ought to be able to go out and raise $145 \nmillion if you want to be a U.S. Senator.\n  The majority leader just said last March, ``The system is not \nbroken.'' Madam President, the majority leader, for whom I have great \nrespect, in my view is wrong. We believe the system is badly broken, \nand so do the American people. Ninety-two percent think we spend too \nmuch money on politics today. Almost 9 in 10, 89 percent want \nfundamental change in our system.\n  I have great respect for the sponsors of the legislation. Senators \nMcCain and Feingold have spent a tremendous amount of their time, at \nthe expense of other issues, to fashion a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that will allow us to move ahead--not solve all the \nproblems--but move the ball ahead.\n  It is not a perfect solution. It doesn't include the most critical \ncomponent of reform, in my view, which is overall spending limits. But \nit gets us off dead center. If it doesn't address central problems, it \ndoes address several of the major problems we have in our system today. \nIt bans soft money and regulates independent expenditures. It provides \nbetter disclosure, so people have a good idea of who is giving how much \nto what candidate and why. It limits the ability of the super-rich to \nbuy political office.\n  Forty-six of forty-seven Senate Democrats already voted for the \nMcCain-Feingold bill last year.\n  Now, earlier this month, all 45 Democrats in the Senate signed a \nletter reiterating their support for the legislation. Even after the \nbill was changed, Democrats would say we still support the McCain-\nFeingold bill unanimously. Every single man and woman in the U.S. \nSenate Democratic caucus would walk to the floor this afternoon and \nvote for it.\n  We are pleased that four brave Republicans have said they, too, will \nnow support this effort. We only need one more Republican vote. I \nbelieve in the end we will have that vote and more.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill is the least we should do. Democrats will \noffer amendments to strengthen it. If we were in the majority, we would \nfight to cap spending. The Buckley versus Valeo decision was only 5-4, \nand 126 legal scholars have said spending limits are constitutional. \nBut we don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. We hope \nthose who disagree with us will resist the temptation to kill this \nchance with poison pills.\n  Our goal should be reform, not revenge. If one side or the other \ntries to use this debate to settle political scores or punish enemies, \nwe will fail. We are confronted with a systemic problem and we need a \nsystemic solution.\n  Madam President, as I said at the beginning, we spent a lot of time \nand a lot of money investigating abuses in past election cycles. We \nhave all put out our press releases, expressed our indignation, our \nshock, and now the American people are waiting. They wonder whether \npoliticians' self-interests will once again override the public good. \nThey wonder if after all the hearings, all the press releases, if after \nall that we do nothing, what then? They know the system is broken. They \nknow this is going to be our only chance perhaps this Congress to fix \nit. I hope we can demonstrate that their pessimism, their cynicism, in \nthis case, is not warranted.\n  I hope we can rise up to what we did last July when Republicans and \nDemocrats, against the odds, decided to come together and balance the \nbudget in the next 6 years and put this economy on track well into the \nnext century. We did it then. We did it with the Chemical Weapons \nTreaty last spring, and now we can do it again. With the leaders we \nhave from Arizona and Wisconsin, with Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether, we can make it happen. This is our chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate now begins a debate that will \ndetermine whether or not we will take an action that most Americans are \nconvinced we are utterly incapable of doing--reforming the way we are \nelected to office. Most Americans believe that Members of Congress have \nno greater priority than our own reelection. Most Americans believe \nthat every one of us--whether we publicly advocate or publicly oppose \ncampaign finance reform--is working either openly or deceitfully to \nprevent even the slightest repair to a campaign finance system that \nthey firmly believe is corrupt. Most Americans believe that all of us \nconspire to hold on to every single political advantage we have, lest \nwe jeopardize our incumbency by a single lost vote. Most Americans \nbelieve we will let this Nation pay any price, bear any burden to \nensure the success of our personal ambitions--no matter how dear the \ncost might be to the national interest.\n  Mr. President, now is the moment when we can begin to persuade the \npeople that they are wrong. Now is the moment when we can show the \nAmerican people that we take courage from our convictions and not our \ncampaign treasuries. Now is the moment when we can begin to prove that \nwe are--in word and deed--the people's representatives; that we are \naccountable to all the people who pay our salaries, and not just to \nthose Americans who finance our campaigns. Mr. President, now is the \nmoment when we should take a risk for our country.\n  I am a conservative, and I believe it is a very healthy thing for \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\nto be skeptical about the purposes and practices of public officials \nand refrain from expecting too much from their Government. Self-\nreliance is the ethic that made America great, not consigning personal \nresponsibilities to the State.\n  I would like to think that we conservatives could practice the self-\nreliance which we so devoutly believe to be a noble public virtue, and \nrely on our ideals and our integrity to enlist a majority of Americans \nto our cause, rather than subordinate those ideals to the imperatives \nof fundraising. I would like to think the justice of our cause, the \ngood sense of our ideas will appeal to a majority of Americans without \nthe need to fund that appeal with obscene amounts of money.\n  I am a conservative, and I believe in small government. But I do not \nbelieve that small government conservatives are chasing an idealized \nform of anarchy. Government is intended to support our constitutional \npurposes to ``establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide \nfor the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the \nblessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' When the people \ncome to believe that government is so dysfunctional, so corrupt that it \nno longer serves these ends, basic civil consensus will suffer grave \nharm and our culture will be fragmented beyond recognition.\n  I am a conservative, and I believe that a conservative's primary \npurpose in public life is to give Americans a Government that is less \nremoved in style and substance from the people, and to help restore the \npublic's faith in an America that is greater than the sum of its \nspecial interests. That, I contend, is also the purpose of meaningful \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, opponents of campaign finance reform will argue that \nthere is no public hue and cry for reform, despite the fact that more \nand more public polls show that the people support reform by ever-\nwidening margins. A recent poll commissioned by my own party revealed \nthat the public now considers campaign finance reform to be among the \nmost important issues facing the country.\n  But no matter, opponents will note that they have stood for \nreelection and won with their opposition to reform on full public \ndisplay. Thus, they will argue, the people don't really care about \nreform. But that is because the people don't believe that either the \nincumbent opposing reform, or the challenger advocating it, will \nhonestly work to repair this system once he or she has been elected \nunder the rules that govern it. They distrust both of us. They believe \nthat this system is so thoroughly riddled with financial temptations \nthat it corrupts us all.\n  The opponents will argue the people are content. I will argue that \nthe people are alienated, and that this explains why fewer and fewer of \nthem even bother to vote.\n  This problem should motivate all public officials to repair both the \nappearance and the reality of government corruption. Whether great \nnumbers of elected officials are, in fact, bribed by campaign \ncontributors to cast votes contrary to the national interest is not the \nsingle standard for determining the need for reform. Although, it would \nbe hard to find much legislation enacted by any Congress that did not \ncontain one or more obscure provision that served no legitimate \nnational or even local interest, but which was intended only as a \nreward for a generous campaign supporter.\n  Mr. President, I do not concede that all politicians are corrupt. I \nentered politics with some of the same expectations that I had when I \nwas commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy. First among them \nwas my belief that serving my country was an honor, indeed, the most \nhonorable life an American could lead.\n  I believe that still. Regrettably, many Americans do not.\n  I am honored to serve in the company of many good men and women whose \npublic and private virtue deserves to be above reproach. But we are \nreproached, Mr. President, because the system in which we are elected \nto this great institution is so awash in money that is taken so \ndisproportionately from special interests that the people cannot help \nbut suspect that our service is tainted by it.\n  If most Americans feel they have sufficient cause to doubt our \nintegrity, then we must seek all reasonable means to persuade them \notherwise. Reform of our campaign finance laws is indispensable to that \nend.\n  As long as the wealthiest of Americans or the richest organized \ninterests can make six figure contributions to political parties and \ngain the special access to power such generosity confers on the donor, \nmost Americans will dismiss even the most virtuous politician's claim \nof fairness and patriotism.\n  And who can blame them when they are overwhelmed by appearance that \npolitical representation in America is measured on a sliding scale. The \nmore you give, the more effectively you can petition your government. \nIf a Native American tribe wants to recover their ancestral lands--pay \nup, the Government will hear you. If you want to build a pipeline \nacross Central Asia--pay up, the President will discuss it with you. If \nyou want to peddle your invention to the Government--pay up, you get an \naudience with Government purchasing agents. But if all you pay is your \ntaxes, and you want your elected representatives to help you seek \nredress for some wrong, send us a letter. We'll send you one back.\n  Mr. President, this a dark view of our profession, and I do not \nbelieve it fairly represents us. I believe such instances of influence \npeddling are, thankfully, an exception to the honest government that \nmost public officials work hard to provide this Nation. But we cannot \nblame the people for thinking otherwise when they are treated to the \nspectacle of influence and access peddling which assaulted them in the \nlast election; when they are told repeatedly that campaign \ncontributions are the only means through which they can petition their \nGovernment; the politicians are selling subway tokens to the government \ngravy train.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of reform will tell you that there isn't \ntoo much money in politics. They will argue there's not enough. They \nwill observe that more money is spent to advertise toothpaste and \nyogurt than is spent on our elections.\n  I don't care, Mr. President. We should not concern ourselves with the \ncosts of toothpaste and yogurt marketing. We aren't selling those \ncommodities to the people. We are offering our integrity and our \nprinciples, and the means we use to market them should not cause the \nconsumer to doubt the value of the product.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Feingold, Senator Thompson, Senator Collins, \nand the other sponsors of this legislation have but one purpose--to \nenact fair, bipartisan campaign reform that seeks no special advantage \nfor one party or another, but only seeks to find common ground upon \nwhich we can all begin to restore the people's faith in the integrity \nof their Government.\n  Each of us may have differences as to what constitutes the best \nreform, but we have subordinated those differences to the common good, \nin the hope that we might enact those basic reforms which all Members \nof both parties could agree on.\nIt is not perfect reform. There is no perfect reform. We have tried to \nexclude any provision which would be viewed as placing one party or \nanother at a disadvantage. Our purpose is to pass the best, most \nbalanced, most important reforms we can. All we ask of our colleagues \nis that they approach this debate with the same purpose in mind.\n  Mr. President, on Monday, we will offer a substitute amendment to S. \n25, which represents a substantial change to the original McCain-\nFeingold Campaign Finance Reform Act, but at the same time, maintains \nthe core--the heart--of the original bill.\n  I strongly believe in all the provisions of the original bill. In \nfact, as the debate proceeds, we intend to offer a series of amendments \nthat would restore the component parts of our original bill. We intend \nto proceed to those amendments in good time.\n  For now, I would like to outline for my colleagues the contents of \nour substitute.\n  Before I do, I want to stress the purposes upon which this \nlegislation is premised:\n  First, for reform to become law, it must be bipartisan. This is a \nbipartisan bill. It is a bill that affects both parties fairly and \nequally.\n  Second, genuine reform must lessen the amount of money in politics.\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\n Spending on campaigns in current, inflation-adjusted dollars has risen \ndramatically. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate \nraces in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986, the total had risen to $645 \nmillion, and in 1996, to $765 million. If you include the Presidential \ncampaigns, over a billion dollars was spent in the last election. And \nas the need for money escalates, the influence of those who give it \nrises exponentially.\n  Third, reform must level the playing field between challengers and \nincumbents. Our bill achieves this goal by recognizing the fact that \nincumbents almost always raise more money than challengers, and as a \ngeneral rule, the candidate with the most money wins.\n\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n  Title I of the modified bill seeks to reduce the influence of special \ninterest money in campaigns by banning the use of soft money in federal \nraces. Soft money would be allowed for State parties in accordance with \nState law.\n  In the first half of 1997 alone, a record $34 million of soft money \nflowed to political coffers. That staggering amount represents a 250 \npercent increase in soft money contributions over the same period in \n1993.\n  We do differentiate between State and Federal activities. Soft money \ncontributed to State parties could be used for any and all state \ncandidate activities. Soft money given to the State could be used for \nany State electioneering activity.\n  If a State allows soft money to be used in a gubernatorial race, a \nState senate race, or the local sheriff's race, it would still be \nallowed under this bill. However, if a state party uses soft money to \nindirectly influence a Federal race, such activity would be banned 120 \ndays prior to the general election. Voter registration and general \ncampaign advertising would be allowed except in the last 120 days prior \nto the election.\n  To compensate for the loss of soft money, our legislation doubles the \nlimit that individuals can give to State parties in hard money. The \naggregate contribution limit in hard money that individuals could \ndonate would rise to $30,000.\n  Our soft money ban would serve two purposes. First, it would reduce \nthe amount of money in campaigns. Second, it would cause candidates to \nspend more time campaigning for small dollar donations from people back \nhome.\n\n\n                                TITLE II\n\n  Title II of the modified McCain-Feingold seeks to limit the role of \nindependent expenditures in political campaigns. The bill does not ban, \ncurb, or control real, independent, non-coordinated expenditures in any \nmanner. Any genuinely independent expenditure made to advocate any \ncause which does not expressly advocate the election or the defeat of a \ncandidate is fully allowed.\n  The bill does responsibly expand the definition of express advocacy, \nwhich the courts have ruled Congress may do. In fact, the current \nstandards for express advocacy were derived from the Buckley versus \nValeo case. As we all know, that Supreme Court case stated that \ncampaign spending cannot be mandatorily capped. This bill is fully \nconsistent with the Buckley decision, and I would ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter signed by 126 constitutional scholars which testifies to \nthe constitutionality of McCain-Feingold be printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Brennan Center for Justice,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 22, 1997.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Feingold: We are academics who \n     have studied and written about the First Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution. We submit this letter to respond \n     to a series of recent public challenges to two components of \n     S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill. Critics have argued that it \n     is unconstitutional to close the so-called ``soft money \n     loophole'' by placing restrictions on the source and amount \n     of campaign contributions to political parties. Critics have \n     also argued that it is unconstitutional to offer candidates \n     benefits, such as reduced broadcasting rates, in return for \n     their commitment to cap campaign spending. We are deeply \n     committed to the principles underlying the First Amendment \n     and believe strongly in preserving free speech and \n     association in our society, especially in the realm of \n     politics. We are not all of the same mind on how best to \n     address the problems of money and politics; indeed, we do not \n     all agree on the constitutionality of various provisions of \n     the McCain-Feingold bill itself. Nor are we endorsing every \n     aspect of the bill's soft money and voluntary spending limits \n     provisions. We all agree, however, that the current debate on \n     the merits of campaign finance reform is being sidetracked by \n     the argument that the Constitution stands in the way of a ban \n     on unlimited contributions to political parties and a \n     voluntary spending limits scheme based on offering \n     inducements such as reduced media time.\n\n\nI. Limits on Enormous Campaign Contributions to Political Parties from \nCorporations, Labor Unions, and Wealthy Contributors Are Constitutional\n\n       To prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, \n     federal law imposes limits on the source and amount of money \n     that can be given to candidates and political parties ``in \n     connection with'' federal elections. The money raised under \n     these strictures is commonly referred to as ``hard money.'' \n     Since 1907, federal law has prohibited corporations from \n     making hard money contributions to candidates or political \n     parties. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 441b(a) (current codification). \n     In 1947, that ban was extended to prohibit union \n     contributions as well. Id. Individuals, too, are subject \n     to restrictions in their giving of money to influence \n     federal elections. The Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (``FECA'') limits an individual's contributions to (1) \n     $1,000 per election to a federal candidate; (2) $20,000 \n     per year to national political party committees; and (3) \n     $5,000 per year to any other political committee, such as \n     a PAC or a state political party committee. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 441a(a)(1). Individuals are also subject to a $25,000 \n     annual limit on the total of all such contributions. Id. \n     Sec. 441a(a)(3).\n       The soft money loophole was created not by Congress, but by \n     a Federal Election Commission (``FEC'') ruling in 1978 that \n     opened a seemingly modest door to allow non-regulated \n     contributions to political parties, so long as the money was \n     used for grassroots campaign activity, such as registering \n     voters and get-out-the-vote efforts. These unregulated \n     contributions are known as ``soft money'' to distinguish them \n     from the hard money raised under FECA's strict limits. In the \n     years since the FEC's ruling, this modest opening has turned \n     into an enormous loophole that threatens the integrity of the \n     regulatory system. In the last presidential elections, soft \n     money contributions soared to the unprecedented figure of \n     $263 million. It was not merely the total amount of soft \n     money contributions that was unprecedented, but the size of \n     the contributions as well, with donors being asked to give \n     amounts $100,000, $250,000 or more to gain preferred access \n     to federal officials. Moreover, the soft money raised is, for \n     the most part, not being spent to bolster party grassroots \n     organizing. Rather, the funds are often solicited by federal \n     candidates and used for media advertising clearly intended to \n     influence federal elections. In sum, soft money has become an \n     end run around the campaign contribution limits, creating a \n     corrupt system in which monied interests appear to buy access \n     to, and inappropriate influence with, elected officials.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money contributions \n     to national political parties, by requiring that all \n     contributions to national parties be subject to FECA's hard \n     money restrictions. The bill also would bar federal \n     officeholders and candidates for such offices from \n     soliciting, receiving, or spending soft money and would \n     prohibit state and local political parties from spending soft \n     money during a federal election year for any activity that \n     might affect a federal election (with exceptions for \n     specified activities that are less likely to impact on \n     federal elections).\n       We believe that such restrictions are constitutional. The \n     soft money loophole has raised the specter of corruption \n     stemming from large contributions (and those from prohibited \n     sources) that led Congress to enact the federal contribution \n     limits in the first place. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court held that the government has a compelling interest in \n     combating the appearance and reality of corruption, an \n     interest that justifies restricting large campaign \n     contributions in federal elections. 424 U.S. 1, 23-29 (1976). \n     Significantly, the Court upheld the $25,000 annual limit on \n     an individual's total contributions in connection with \n     federal elections. Id. at 26-29, 38. In later cases, the \n     Court rejected the argument that corporations have a right \n     to use their general treasury funds to influence \n     elections. See, e.g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990). Under Buckley and its \n     progeny, Congress clearly possesses power to close the \n     soft money loophole by restricting the source and size of \n     contributions to political parties, just as it does for \n     contributions to candidates, for use in connection with \n     federal elections.\n       Moreover, Congress has the power to regulate the source of \n     the money used for expenditures by state and local parties \n     during federal election years when such expenditures are used \n     to influence federal elections. The power of Congress to \n     regulate federal elections to prevent fraud and corruption \n     includes the power to regulate conduct which, although \n     directed at state or local elections, also has an impact on \n     federal races. During a federal election year, a state or \n     local political party's voter registration or get-out-the-\n     vote drive will have an effect on federal elections. \n     Accordingly, Congress may require\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\n     that during a federal election year state and local parties' \n     expenditures for such activities be made from funds raised in \n     compliance with FECA so as not to undermine the limits \n     therein.\n       Any suggestion that the recent Supreme Court decision in \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, 116 S. \n     Ct. 2309 (1996), casts doubt on the constitutionality of a \n     soft money ban is flatly wrong. Colorado Republican did not \n     address the constitutionality of banning soft money \n     contributions, but rather the expenditures by political \n     parties of hard money, that is, money raised in accordance \n     with FECA's limits. Indeed, the Court noted that it ``could \n     understand how Congress, were it to conclude that the \n     potential for evasion of the individual contribution limits \n     was a serious matter, might decide to change the statute's \n     limitations on contributions to political parties.'' Id. at \n     2316.\n       In fact, the most relevant Supreme Court decision is not \n     Colorado Republican, but Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, in which the Supreme Court held that corporations \n     can be walled off from the electoral process by forbidding \n     both contributions and independent expenditures from general \n     corporate treasuries. 494 U.S. at 657-61. Surely, the law \n     cannot be that Congress has the power to prevent corporations \n     from giving money directly to a candidate, or from expending \n     money on behalf of a candidate, but lacks the power to \n     prevent them from pouring unlimited funds into a candidate's \n     political party in order to buy preferred access to him after \n     the election.\n       Accordingly, closing the loophole for soft money \n     contributions is in line with the longstanding and \n     constitutional ban on corporate and union contributions in \n     federal elections and with limits on the size of individuals' \n     contributions to amounts that are not corrupting.\n\n\n     ii. efforts to persuade candidates to limit campaign spending \n  voluntarily by providing them with inducements like free television \n                        time are constitutional\n\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would also invite candidates to \n     limit campaign spending in return for free broadcast time and \n     reduced broadcast and mailing rates. In Buckley, the Court \n     explicitly declared that ``Congress . . . may condition \n     acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate \n     to abide by specified expenditure limitations.'' 424 U.S. at \n     56 n.65. The Court explained: ``Just as a candidate may \n     voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he chooses to \n     accept, he may decide to forgo private fundraising and accept \n     public funding.'' Id.\n       That was exactly the Buckley Court's approach when it \n     upheld the constitutionality of the campaign subsidies to \n     Presidential candidates in return for a promise to limit \n     campaign spending. At the time, the subsidy to Presidential \n     nominees was $20 million, in return for which Presidential \n     candidates agreed to cap expenditures at that amount and \n     raise no private funds at all. The subsidy is now worth over \n     $60 million and no Presidential nominee of a major party has \n     ever turned down the subsidy.\n       In effect, the critics argue that virtually any inducement \n     offered to a candidate to persuade her to limit campaign \n     spending is unconstitutional as a form of indirect \n     ``coercion.'' But the Buckley Court clearly distinguished \n     between inducements designed to elicit a voluntary decision \n     to limit spending and coercive mandates that impose \n     involuntary spending ceilings. If giving a Presidential \n     candidate a $60 million subsidy is a constitutional \n     inducement, surely providing free television time and reduced \n     postal rates falls into the same category of acceptable \n     inducement. The lesson from Buckley is that merely because a \n     deal is too good to pass up does not render it \n     unconstitutionally ``coercive.''\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Ronald Dworkin,\n       Professor of Jurisprudence and Fellow of University College \n     at Oxford University; Frank H. Sommer Professor of Law, New \n     York University School of Law.\n     Burt Neuborne,\n       John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law, Legal Director, \n     Brennan Center for Justice, New York University School of \n     Law.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Our bill establishes a so-called bright line test 60 days \nout from an election. Any independent expenditure that falls within \nthat 60-day window could not use a candidate's name or likeness. Ads \ncould run which advocate any number of causes. Pro-life ads, pro-choice \nads, anti-labor ads, pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican Party ads, pro-\nDemocrat Party ads--all could be aired in the last 60 days. However, \nads mentioning the candidates could not.\n  If soft money is banned to political parties, money will inevitably \nflow to independent campaign organizations. These groups run ads that \neven the candidates who benefit from them often disapprove of. Further, \nthese ads are almost always negative attacks on a candidate and do \nlittle to further healthy political debate. As we all know, they are \nusually intended to defeat a candidate, and are often, in reality, \ncoordinated with the campaign of that candidate's opponent. They are \nnot genuinely independent, nor are they strictly concerned with issue \nadvocacy.\n  Our bill explicitly protects voter guides. I believe this is a very \nimportant point. Some groups have unfairly criticized our original bill \nwhen they argued that it prohibited the publication and distribution of \nvoter guides and voting records. While I view those arguments as \nmisinformation, the sponsors have, nevertheless, worked to make our \nlegislation even more explicit in its protection of such activities.\n  Let me stress--so no one can have any grounds to assume otherwise--\nthis legislation completely protects voter guides. I will read the \nprovision addressing this matter in the hope that it will allay any and \nall concerns about voter guides.\n       (C) Voting Record and Voter Guide Exemption.--The term \n     express advocacy shall not include a printed communication \n     which is limited solely to presenting information in an \n     educational manner about the voting record or positions on \n     campaign issues of two or more candidates and which:\n       (i) is not made in coordination with a candidate, or \n     political party or agency thereof;\n       (ii) in the case of a voter guide based on a questionnaire, \n     all candidates for a particular seat or office have been \n     provided with an equal opportunity to respond;\n       (iii) gives no candidate any greater prominence than any \n     other candidate; and\n       (iv) does not contain a phrase such as ``vote for,'' ``re-\n     elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot for,'' (name of \n     candidate) for Congress,'' ``(name of candidate) in 1997,'' \n     ``vote against,'' ``defeat,'' or ``reject'' or a campaign \n     slogan or words which in context can have no reasonable \n     meaning other than to urge the election or defeat of one or \n     more candidates.'\n\n  Mr. President, I hope this clear and concise language dispels any \nrumors that this modified legislation will adversely affect voter \nguides.\n\n\n                               TITLE III\n\n  Title III of the modified McCain-Feingold bill mandates greater \ndisclosure. Our bill mandates that all FEC filings documenting campaign \nreceipts and expenditures be made electronically, and that they then be \nmade accessible to the public on the Internet not later than 24 hours \nafter the information is received by the Federal Election Commission.\n  Additionally, current law allows for campaigns to make a best effort \nto obtain the name, address, and occupation information of the donors \nof contributions above $200. Our bill would eliminate that waiver. If a \ncampaign cannot obtain the address and occupation of a donor, then the \ndonation cannot and should not be accepted.\n  The bill also mandates random audits of campaigns. Such audits would \nonly occur after an affirmative vote of at least four of the six \nmembers of the FEC. This will prevent the use of audits as a purely \npartisan attack.\n  The bill also mandates that campaigns seek to receive name, address, \nand employer information for contributions over $50. Such information \nwill enable the public to have a better knowledge of all who give to \npolitical campaigns.\n\n\n                                TITLE IV\n\n  Title IV of the modified bill seeks to encourage individuals to limit \nthe amount of personal money they spend on their own campaigns. If an \nindividual voluntarily elects to limit the amount of money he or she \nspends in his or her own race to $50,000, then the national parties are \nable to use funds known as coordinated expenditures to aid such \ncandidates. If candidates refuse to limit their own personal spending, \nthen the parties are prohibited from contributing coordinated funds to \nthe candidate.\n  This provision serves to limit the advantages that wealthy candidates \nenjoy, and strengthen the party system by encouraging candidates to \nwork more closely with the parties.\n\n\n                                TITLE V\n\n  Last, the bill codifies the Beck decision. The Beck decision states \nthat a nonunion employee working in a closed shop union workplace, and \nwho is required to contribute funds to the union, can request and be \nassured that\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\nhis or her money will not be used for political purposes.\n  I personally support much stronger language. I believe that no \nindividual--a union member or not--should be required to contribute to \npolitical activities. However, I recognize that stronger language would \ninvite a filibuster of this bill and would doom its final passage. As a \nresult, I will fight to preserve the delicately balanced language of \nthe bill, and will oppose amendments offered on both sides of the aisle \nthat would result in killing campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, what I have outlined is a basic summary of our \nmodifications to the original bill. I have heard many colleagues say \nthat they could not support S. 25, the original McCain-Feingold bill \nfor a wide variety of reasons. Some opposed spending limits. Others \nopposed free or reduced rate broadcast time. Others could not live with \npostal subsidies to candidates. Others complained that nothing was \nbeing done about labor.\n  I hope that all my colleagues who raised such concerns will take a \nnew and openminded look at this bill. Gone are spending limits. Gone is \nfree broadcast time. Gone are reduced rate TV time and postal \nsubsidies. And we have sought to address the problem of undue influence \nbeing exercised by labor unions. All the excuses of the past are gone.\n  Mr. President, on Monday I will review the provisions of the \nsubstitute again and will lay the modified bill before the Senate. I \nlook forward to discussing the specifics of the measure at that time.\n  Mr. President, the sponsors of this legislation claim no exclusive \nright to campaign finance reform. We offer good, fair, necessary \nreform, but certainly not a perfect remedy. We welcome good faith \namendments intended to improve the legislation.\n  But I beg my colleagues not to propose amendments designed to kill \nthis bill by provoking a filibuster from one party or the other. The \nsponsors of this legislation intend to have votes on all relevant \nissues involved in campaign finance reform, and we will use every \nresource we have under Senate rules to ensure that we do.\n  If we cannot agree on every aspect of reform; if we have differences \nabout what constitutes genuine and necessary reform, and we hold those \ndifferences honestly--so be it. Let us try to come to terms with those \ndifferences fairly. Let us find common ground and work together to \nadopt those basic reforms we can all agree on. That is what the \nsponsors of this legislation have attempted to do, and we welcome \nanyone's help to improve upon our proposal as long as that help is \nsincere and intended to reach the common goal of genuine campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Mr. President, when I was a young man, a long time ago, I would \nrespond aggressively and often irresponsibly to anyone who questioned \nmy honor. I am not a young man now, and while I have been known to \noccasionally forget the discretion which is expected of a person of my \nyears and station, I lack both the will and the ability to address \nattacks upon my honor in the manner I once addressed them. I now prefer \nto clear up peacefully the misunderstandings that may cause someone to \nquestion my honor. That is the task which I believe the sponsors of \nMcCain-Feingold have undertaken.\n  I remember how zealously a boy would attend the needs of his self-\nrespect. But as I grew older, and as the challenges to my self-respect \ngrew more varied, I was surprised to discover that while my sense of \nhonor had matured, its defense mattered even more to me than it did \nwhen I believed that honor was such a vulnerable thing that any empty \nchallenge threatened it.\n  Now, I find myself faced with a popular challenge to the honor of a \nprofession of which I am a willing and proud member. It is imperative \nthat we do all we can to address the causes of the people's distrust.\n  Meaningful campaign finance reform will not cure public cynicism \nabout modern politics. Nor will it completely free politics from \ninfluence peddling. But, coupled with other reforms, it may prevent \ncynicism from becoming utter alienation, as Americans begin to see that \ntheir elected representatives value their reputations more than their \nincumbency. I hope it would even encourage more Americans to seek \npublic office, not for the honorifics bestowed on election winners, but \nfor the honor of serving a great nation.\n  Mr. President, we must not fear to take risks for our country. We \nmust not value the privileges of power so highly that we use our power \nunfairly, and subordinate the country's interests to our own comfort. \nWe may think that we trade on America's good name to stay in office and \nshine the luster of our professional reputations, but the public's \ngrowing disdain for us is a stain upon our honor. And that is an injury \nwhich none of us should suffer quietly.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to begin by once again expressing \nmy admiration and gratitude to the senior Senator from Arizona for his \nextraordinary leadership on the issue of campaign finance reform. This \neffort has already been a long and difficult one, but it is all about \nhis courage and his exceptional commitment to the good of this country. \nHe is in a more difficult situation than I am in as a member of the \nmajority party. But the fact is he is one of the greatest Republicans \nof our time. And they are lucky to have him.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator Lott, the majority \nleader, for helping us get this bill up to the floor. And I also \nappreciate the fact that he took some time this morning to say a little \nbit about how he got here; about what it was like for him to try to be \nelected to the U.S. Senate.\n  I think those kinds of stories and accounts are going to be very \nimportant as this debate proceeds because we need to tell the American \npeople just what is involved in running for the Congress these days. We \nneed to tell them the truth about how many people are truly invited to \nparticipate in a process that is so awash in money that almost every \nAmerican must feel like they are not invited to participate.\n  I also want to, of course, especially thank my leader, Senator \nDaschle, not only for his powerful statement on behalf of our bill but \nalso for his leadership in working diligently to make sure that all 45 \nmembers of the Senate Democratic caucus are in support of the McCain-\nFeingold bill; a bill that has been initiated by a member of the other \nparty. That is a great tribute to him and to the cause of \nbipartisanship in favor of campaign finance reform.\n  I also want to do something that may not be terribly popular out here \nas the debate goes on. I want to thank the President of the United \nStates, because the fact is he has been diligent, consistent, and \npersistent in support of this particular piece of legislation. He has \noffered his personal help. He has offered the help of his staff. Before \nit is finished, before we claim our final victory on this issue, I am \ngoing to certainly repeat the fact that President Clinton has been \nfighting for reform.\n  Mr. President, it was just over 2 years ago that the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and I began \nthis long, sometimes tortuous, journey on the path to campaign finance \nreform. In fact, it was September 1995 when we first introduced our \nbipartisan reform proposal, a proposal that is centered on the premise \nthat it is imperative that we reduce the role and influence of money on \nour electoral system.\n  For 2 years, though, Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and I \nhave been stymied by opponents of reform who desperately cling to the \nabsurd notion that the more money you pour into the political system \nthat our democracy somehow gets better. Sometimes the comparison is \nmade that we spend as much money on elections as we spend on potato \nchips. I don't know what this has to do with the question of political \nreform but it is an argument we are treated to anyway. Of course, no \none outside the Washington Beltway believes in that argument. No one \noutside of this town thinks we need more money spent on the political \nprocess. In fact, if you talk to any average American they will tell \nyou they are just horrified by the amount of money that is spent on our \nelectoral system. But they are tired of excessive spending. They are \ntired of the onslaught of negative attack ads all throughout a campaign \nseason. And, yet, they are even more tired--they are\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\nsick and tired--of the ongoing revelations of abuse and wrongdoing \nrelated to elected officials and campaign fundraising.\n  Nonetheless, our opponents, such as our colleague and our friend, the \njunior colleague from Kentucky, continue to argue that more campaign \nspending somehow strengthens democracy and expands citizen \nparticipation. Of course, I disagree with him on this point. And so do \nthe facts.\n  The facts say this: The 1996 election speaks for itself. In 1996, \ncandidates and parties spent in excess of $2 billion. That was an all-\ntime record amount of campaign spending.\n  In a year where we spent more money on Federal elections than in any \nother year in our history, let's ask the question: Was democracy \nstrengthened? Did we expand citizen participation? We all know the \nanswer. Mr. President, we did not. Almost a year after the fact we are \nstill feeling the fallout from the 1996 elections. After months of \nhearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee, led by the Senator from \nTennessee, it is clear that we had widespread abuse and wrongdoing on \nboth sides of the aisle. We have had congressional investigations, a \nJustice Department investigation, an FBI investigation, and even a CIA \ninvestigation, all relating to the way we elected our representatives.\n\n  That doesn't sound like the strengthening of democracy to me.\n  As for participation, we had the lowest voter turnout in 72 years--a \nclear sign that the electorate was not exactly energized by all this \ncampaign spending. We know the truth. They were turned off.\n  Perhaps most disheartening, our campaign finance system just lacks \nany sense of fairness anymore.\n  In 1996, incumbents outspent challengers by ratios of 2 to 1 and 3 to \n1, and to no surprise. The reelection rate for Members of the House and \nSenate remained well above the 90 percent level.\n  As the Senator from Arizona has said, the time for reform is right \nnow.\n  Over the course of the last several months, the Senator from Arizona \nand I have had two clear consistent messages. The first was that our \npreference was to work with the majority leader in scheduling debate on \nbipartisan reform legislation. Thankfully for the kind of cooperation \nthat serves this body very well, we have achieved that.\n  Of course, the majority leader has already begun the debate. He says \nwe should not shift the subject. He wants to focus instead on the White \nHouse. But I think what we ought to focus on is the whole system. We \nought to focus on the question of whether this system has anything to \ndo with the principle that everybody's vote should cost the same.\n  We are already hearing talk about filibusters--about ways to make \nsure the legislation does not pass.\n  But I do want to say that I am very impressed with the way in which \nthis bill came to the floor, and I am grateful.\n  Our first choice always was the cooperative approach.\n  Mr. President, our second message was one that the Senator from \nArizona just made very plain once again. That is our willingness and \ncontinued willingness to make the changes that need to be made to do \nthe right thing.\n  We demonstrated this willingness to compromise when we worked with \nthe junior Senator from Maine who suggested a number of changes to our \nbill that I think actually strengthen the bill. I think there may be \namendments out on the floor by either party that can make the bill \nstronger, and a better reform bill.\n  That is the spirit in which Senator McCain and I come to the floor. \nWe know that this bill isn't perfect. It is not the ideal Feingold \nbill. It is not the ideal McCain bill. That is how we got together--by \ncompromises and trying to come up with a reasonable passage.\n  Prior to the August recess, the Senator from Arizona and I stood here \non the Senate floor with some of our colleagues and expressed the hope \nthat this debate would occur. We also said that if we were unsuccessful \nwith that effort we would bring the legislation to the floor in \nSeptember.\n  Mr. President, for opponents of campaign finance reform, for those \nWashington interest groups--whom I like to refer to as ``the Washington \ngatekeepers''--who joined with the Senator from Kentucky in opposing \nany changes to our current system, it is September. It is a Friday in \nSeptember. And we hope for all of those who have declared this bill \ndead over and over again that today will be remembered for them as \n``Black Friday.''\n  For the rest of the country, for the 90 percent of the Americans who \nbelieve we should be spending less on our elections, for the \nunderfunded challengers who are consistently blown out of the water by \nwell-entrenched incumbents, and for those who believe that the first \namendment is a right belonging to all Americans, not just a commodity \nfor the wealthy few, I hope this Friday will be remembered as the day \nwe took the first step in providing with this reform proposal the first \nreal opportunity to fundamentally change the nature of our political \nsystem.\n\n  The base package of reforms the Senator from Arizona and I have \npieced together represents a solid first step on the path to more \ncomprehensive reform.\n  As he has already highlighted, the package will ban so-called soft \nmoney. That means that the Washington soft money machine that has \nfostered the multihundred-thousand dollar contribution from \ncorporations and labor unions and wealthy individuals will be shut down \nforever. The American people won't have to hear about outrageous levels \nof contributions that they couldn't even dream of giving even once in \ntheir lives.\n  The base proposal also modifies the current statutory definition of \n``express advocacy.'' It does not affect issue advocacy. It redefines \nin an appropriate manner ``express advocacy'' to provide a clear \ndistinction between expenditures for communications used to advocate \ncandidates and, on the other hand, those used to advocate issues. And \nthat is all it does.\n  It does not do, as the majority leader has suggested, ban billboards. \nOf course, it doesn't. It doesn't touch voter guides. We explicitly \nprovide that voter guides are permitted. And it doesn't ban one single \ntelevision or radio ad, ever. It simply does not do that. And we will \nrepeat that statement as often as it needs to be repeated.\n  Candidate-related expenditures will be subject to current Federal \nelection laws and disclosure requirements. Of course they will. But \nthat is all.\n  No form of expression will be prohibited.\n  That statement is simply inaccurate.\n  The proposal will require greater disclosure of campaign \ncontributions and expenditures, and provide the Federal Election \nCommission with the tools to better enforce our campaign finance laws.\n  It includes a strict codification of what is known as the Supreme \nCourt's Beck decision, thus requiring labor unions to notify nonunion \nmembers that they are entitled to request a reduction of the portion of \ntheir agency fees used for political purposes. Of course, I find it \nlaughable that anyone could believe that the central problem in the \ncampaign finance system is an issue of union dues. That is laughable on \nits face.\n  What about corporations? What about all of the other special interest \ngroups? Does anyone really believe that labor is the only problem? \nNonetheless, we try to reasonably and appropriately address this issue \nrather than ignoring it.\n  Finally, the base package includes a provision that for the first \ntime encourages candidates to abide by some kind of a voluntary \nfundraising restriction. That is a significant step.\n  As my colleagues know, the Supreme Court ruled in the decision in \nBuckley versus Valeo that it is fully consistent with the first \namendment to offer candidates incentives to encourage them to \nvoluntarily limit their campaign spending.\n  In fact, the Buckley Court specifically upheld the Presidential \nsystem that we have today which offers public financing in exchange for \ncandidates agreeing to voluntary spending limits.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I have added a provision to this base \npackage that tracks that concept.\n  Under current law, Mr. President, political parties are permitted to \nmake expenditures in coordination with the Senate candidate up to a \ncertain limit. That limit is based on the size of each State.\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\n  In California, for example, the parties are each permitted to spend \nabout $2.8 million in coordination with the candidate.\n  Our proposal provides that candidates who decide to pour a great deal \nof their own personal funds into a campaign would simply no longer be \nentitled to those party expenditures on their behalf.\n  Specifically, if a candidate agrees to limit their personal spending \nto less than $50,000 per election, they will continue to receive help \nfrom their party committees. If they don't, they just won't receive \nthat money.\n\n  It is a basic concept. If you want to pour millions and millions of \ndollars of your personal money into a campaign to try to buy a Senate \nseat, you should be able to do so.\n  We don't disagree with Buckley versus Valeo on that point. We don't \ndisagree. We just do not think you should get some kind of a benefit, \nsome kind of a privilege after you have done so.\n  It is very important to recognize that distinction.\n  That is what Buckley said, and that is what this proposal reflects. \nWe should not reward such candidates. We should not give them the equal \nbenefit with their opponent who is not a millionaire and who should be \nable to receive that.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the outline of our base package. It is \nmodest reform. It is a strong step in the right direction, and it \nprovides us with the vehicle to move campaign finance reform forward.\n  But there is another piece to our effort. The base package makes \nseveral important reforms.\n  But the one thing it does not do enough of is doing something about \nthe position of incumbents and challengers in financing their \ncampaigns. We know what the problems are. Incumbents consistently blow \naway challengers who lack the resources to run their campaign.\n  The flow of campaign cash through the corridors of Congress \nundermines public confidence and trust in this institution. \nOfficeholders spend more time panhandling for campaign contributions \nsometimes than they do on the Nation's legislative business.\n  That is why the Senator from Arizona and I are announcing our \nintention to offer a McCain-Feingold amendment to our own vehicle. Why? \nBecause we want some accountability on this issue. We want to see that \nthe Members of the U.S. Senate are prepared to stand up in the public \nspotlight and tell the American people whether they are willing or \nunwilling to change a system that is so clearly rigged in their own \nfavor.\n  Mr. President, that road is going to be a true test of reform. That \nwill be one of the votes that tells us how serious the U.S. Senate is \nwith fundamentally changing a political system that has spiraled out of \ncontrol, and has led to so many charges of abuse and undue influence; \nand, yes, Mr. President, corruption.\n  Our amendment will again build on what the Supreme Court said was \npermissible in the Buckley decision. The amendment offers an incentive \nto candidates to encourage them voluntarily to limit their fundraising. \nThe incentive in this case is a half-priced discount on television \ntime. And that, of course, would have more to do with reducing the cost \nof campaigns than anything else.\n  Candidates who wish to receive the discounted television time would \nhave to agree to three simple rules. First, they would have to agree to \nraise a majority of their campaign funds from people who live in their \nown State. That seems reasonable. Second, they must agree to raise no \nmore than 25 percent of their total campaign contributions from \npolitical action committees. Finally, they have to agree again to spend \nno more than $50,000 of their own personal money on a campaign.\n  By doing so, Mr. President, we would provide candidates, for the \nfirst time ever, with the opportunity to run a competitive campaign \nwithout having to raise and spend millions of dollars. It tries to \nlevel the playing field. It is fair to both parties, and that \nprovision, that amendment that we will offer, is clearly \nconstitutional.\n  There will be a vote on that amendment, and we will find out if \nSenators favor or support changing the rules that have so clearly \nfallen apart in recent years. I look forward to that debate. I look \nforward to the other amendments that will be offered that could well \nimprove this bill even more.\n  So before concluding, I do want to again thank my colleague from \nArizona, but I want to make two points, two points that I think will be \nsomething of a road map to what will happen in the next few days.\n  First, there is going to be, if you have a scorecard, two different \ngroups out on the floor. One group of Senators is going to try to force \na filibuster. They are going to offer amendments and use procedural \ntactics in any way they can to force either the Democrats or the \nRepublicans to filibuster. The majority leader already said today, with \ngreat pride, that he would get the other side to filibuster. He has \nalready announced that that is his goal. But there is another group of \nSenators, Mr. President. That is the bipartisan group. That is not the \nfilibustering group. That is the group of Senators from both parties \nwho are working together to avoid a filibuster and reform our system. \nKeep your scorecard. There are two very clear groups--the filibusterers \nand the bipartisan Senators. That is where we are in the difference on \nthis issue.\n  The second final point I want to make, Mr. President, is that not \nonly are there two groups of Senators on this issue--and we will find \nout exactly who they are--there are also two different visions of our \ndemocracy represented in the Senate. One vision is the vision of a \nrepresentative democracy. The other vision is what I like to call a \nvision, an acceptance of something that is more akin to a corporate \ndemocracy. We have become a corporate democracy.\n  What do I mean by that? When I was 13 years old, I received a gift of \na share of stock. One of our relatives wanted to teach me how the stock \nmarket worked and how our economy worked. I think it was maybe a $13 \nstock in the Parker Pen Co., one of our great prides in Wisconsin and \nin my hometown of Janesville. My father told me that in addition to \nowning a share of that stock, I would have a vote at the stockholders' \nmeeting. And being already interested in politics, I thought: Great. \nWhen is the election? When is the stockholders' meeting? I want to go \nvote. And he laughed. He said, ``Well, I better tell you something. The \nnumber of votes you get depends on how many shares you have. You don't \nhave the same vote and the same power as everyone else because it is a \ncorporation. It is based on how much money you are able to put into the \ncorporation, and so you could go to the shareholders' meeting but your \nvote wouldn't count very much.''\n  Mr. President, sadly, that reminds me more of America today than ever \nbefore. This is not a democracy anymore of one person-one vote. If we \nkeep this system of $300,000, $400,000 contributions and access to \npoliticians based on contributions, we will have sealed this as a \ncorporate democracy, not a representative democracy.\n  That is the question before us. Will we abandon all the other \nAmericans who simply cannot afford the cash to play the game? We have \nto reject the corporate democracy, Mr. President. We have to return to \na representative democracy. That is what this country is all about. \nThat is what this institution is all about. Fortunately, in the coming \ndays, we will find out who is on which side.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the opening \nstatements made on this issue. I appreciate the sincerity of those who \nhave made them. I wish to make this first personal point before I make \nsome additional points. The Senator from Arizona said that there is \nonly one purpose here, and that purpose is to enact fair and effective \ncampaign finance reform. I wish to make it very clear that I accept \nthat purpose on behalf of the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from \nWisconsin, the Senator from Tennessee, or anyone else involved in this \nmatter. I do not challenge for one moment their sincerity. Certainly we \ncannot challenge their earnestness. Certainly we cannot challenge their \nmotives. I want it clearly understood that\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\nI have that kind of feeling about what they are doing.\n  I want it equally understood that I think they are fundamentally \nwrong and that, in their effort to get to what they consider to be a \nsincere and proper goal, they could do irreparable damage to our Nation \nand to the fundamental freedoms about which I care just as passionately \nas they do. I hope they will grant to me the same sense of honor and \nintegrity that I am more than willing to grant to them, and that we \nwill not get into the name-calling business of saying, if you oppose \nMcCain-Feingold, you are somehow opposed to anything that is true and \nbeautiful and worthwhile.\n  I believe McCain-Feingold cuts at some of the most fundamental \nfreedoms we have in this country, and I am going to outline that. I \nwant everybody to understand that I am not acting because I believe \nsomething sinister or improper is going on here.\n  As to the second point, before I go into some of the specifics I want \nto talk about, I would say to Senator Feingold, I think you ought to \nmeet Senator McCain. From the notes I have made in this morning's \ndebate, Senator Feingold said, if I quote him correctly, ``No form of \nexpression will be prohibited,'' just after Senator McCain said, ``No \nad mentioning the name of a candidate will be allowed in the last 60 \ndays of the campaign.''\n  I do not find those two statements coinciding with each other. \nIndeed, the Senator from Arizona, in his summary of the things that \nwould be allowed and would not be allowed, gave us a whole list of that \nwhich would be allowed to take place and that which would be prevented. \nTo me, we are debating ways in which Government power will be marshaled \nto control legitimate speech, and we are saying, with all of the \nintensity of middle-aged theologians debating how many angels can dance \non the head of a pin, that this will be allowed and that will not; this \nis permissive but that is not; 60 days is legitimate but 61 is not, \nback and forth, in and out on all of these particulars. We are going to \nmarshal the full power of the Federal Government of the United States \nof America and focus that power like a laser beam on this particular \nad, this particular contribution, this particular activity, all in the \nname of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, to me marshaling Government power to regulate what can \nand cannot be said in another context is called censorship. And \nmarshaling the power of the Federal Government to censor political \nspeech is not an activity in which I would lightly engage.\n  The statement was made by the minority leader that Buckley versus \nValeo was a close call; it was only 5 to 4. On the issue of whether or \nnot spending money in campaigns represented protected speech under the \nfirst amendment, Buckley versus Valeo was 9 to nothing. And in every \nsubsequent decision from that time forward, the Court has reemphasized \nthat. Let us understand that. We are talking about the most fundamental \npolitical right that we have in this country, the right of free debate \nand speech in a political campaign. I want to lay that down as the \nfundamental predicate, when we get into the details of this, when we \nargue with the Senator from Arizona about what is and what is not wise \nand proper, we are talking about tinkering with the fundamental right \nof Americans to engage in robust political activity. We should tread on \nthis ground very, very carefully. I think that is why the Supreme Court \nslapped down the first attempt to tread on this ground by such an \noverwhelming margin.\n\n  Now, some specifics. The Senator from Arizona laid down the three \nprinciples that we are going to see preserved in the substitute bill to \nMcCain-Feingold, S. 25. I am delighted there will be a substitute bill \nto S. 25.\n  I have gone through S. 25 reading it personally. If ever there were a \nmaze of regulations subject to misinterpretation and reinterpretation \nby bureaucrats enforcing them, this is the maze.\n  This morning on this floor we had a series of speeches regarding the \nIRS and how the Tax Code is used and abused with ordinary citizens. I \nwonder what the IRS or regulators like those who work for the IRS would \ndo with the provisions of S. 25? Saying, well, you could have run that \nad, but you can't run this ad; you could have had this guide, but you \ncan't do that guide; this was OK last Tuesday, but it is not OK on \nThursday.\n  Now, the fundamental assumption here underlying what we are hearing \nis that money is the only factor in determining the outcome of an \nelection, and that if we can only level the playing field, which we \nhear over and over again, in terms of money, then we will have fair \nelections.\n  Well, when we raise the issue of people who defeat incumbents without \nhaving as much money as incumbents have, we are told always, well, that \nis the exception that proves the rule. That is an aberration. That is \nnot the way things normally happen; incumbents normally win. Yes, \nincumbents do normally win. And they normally win for a whole series of \nreasons, not necessarily connected with money.\n\n  I am interested that Senator Feingold is raising this issue when he \nis one of the challengers who defeated an incumbent in order to get \nhere. And, while I will not pretend to be an expert on his campaign, \nit's my understanding that he spent less than his incumbent opponent in \norder to do it, thus demonstrating that maybe the ability to \ncommunicate better than your opponent has something to do with who \nwins. Maybe the ability to write a smarter ad than your opponent does \nmay have something to do with who wins. Maybe even having a more \npowerful message than your opponent has something to do with who wins. \nOr maybe which State you live in, whether it be predominantly \nRepublican or Democrat, in terms of the leanings of the voters in the \nfirst place, has something to do with who wins. It is not necessarily \nmoney as the only ingredient in what happens.\n  All of us here, because we live in the beltway circumstance, saw the \nad campaign that went on in the senatorial race in Virginia in 1996. \nYou couldn't avoid it if you lived anywhere in the Washington area for \nany period of time. Mark Warner spent something like $25 million trying \nto defeat Senator John Warner. He didn't succeed. He outspent him \noverwhelmingly. What advantages did John Warner have to fight off that \nkind of money barrage as an incumbent? There are those here who will \nsay his only advantage was, as an incumbent, he could raise more money. \nClearly he could not raise more money. There is not enough money in the \nworld to warrant raising more money than Mark Warner spent in that \nrace.\n  I know my opponent in the primary race in Utah outspent me 3 to 1. He \nspent $6.2 million in a primary in Utah. When I say there isn't enough \nmoney--to spend more money, he was buying ads on Saturday morning \ncartoons. He had run out of places to spend it.\n  Yes, there are finite limits. I think Mark Warner reached those \nfinite limits in Virginia. Why didn't he defeat John Warner if he had \nthat kind of money advantage? John Warner had 18 years of service in \nthe U.S. Senate, which means 18 years of answering phone calls, sending \nletters, attending bar mitzvahs, going to Rotary Clubs. John Warner was \nknown as the most popular politician of either party in the State of \nVirginia. That is a fairly significant advantage for an incumbent to \nhave, regardless of money.\n  John Warner has spent 18 years with name recognition against somebody \nof whom no one had ever heard. Yes, money buys name recognition. An \nincumbent doesn't have to spend any money to buy name recognition. That \nis a significant advantage.\n  John Warner had a staff. I can give that example. I didn't run \nagainst an incumbent Senator but I ran against an incumbent Congressman \nwho had a congressional staff. When the Congressman wanted to come to \nWashington to attend a fundraiser with a PAC group, who paid for it? \nThe taxpayer, because it was a trip back and forth from his \ncongressional district to the Capitol. When I came to Washington \nchallenging him, trying to hold a fundraiser among the PAC's, who paid \nfor it? My campaign paid for it. I had to raise that money. It put us \non a level playing field. Both have the same amount of money, I don't \nget to come to the fundraiser but my opponent does because he's an \nincumbent.\n  When my opponent put out a press release accusing me of committing a\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\ncrime, which he did--actually, that was one of the good things about my \ncampaign. Everybody thought he had lost his mind, and I got some extra \nvotes as a result of it. Nonetheless, when my opponent put out the \npress release accusing me of a crime, who prepared it? His press \nsecretary. Who paid the salary of the press secretary? The taxpayers. \nHe was an incumbent. He is entitled to a staff.\n  When my press people went to the press conference to say, ``No, Bob \nBennett did not commit that crime,'' who paid their salary? My campaign \ndid. So let's put him on a level playing field. He gets his staff paid \nfor as an incumbent by the taxpayers. I, as a challenger, don't get my \nstaff paid for. I have to raise the money.\n\n  Incumbents have all kinds of advantages that have nothing to do with \nmoney. They also, sometimes, have some disadvantages that have nothing \nto do with money. We have the example--perhaps an extreme one but let's \nuse an extreme one to make a point--back in the 1994 election, Mike \nSynar, the Congressman from Oklahoma, lost his primary. He spent \n$325,000. His opponent spent less than $10,000. His opponent's campaign \nconsisted entirely of distributing his business card, sticking it under \nwindshields in parking lots, and written on the back of the business \ncard was the phrase, ``Not the incumbent.'' And he beat the incumbent. \nThe incumbent in that circumstance had a $325,000 to, let's say, \n$10,000 money advantage; he had the disadvantage of a voting record \nthat members of his particular congressional district didn't like.\n  We cannot let ourselves get into this notion that money is the only \nfactor and then write laws based on that assumption because, if we do, \nwe will do violence to the Constitution and freedom of speech.\n  Now, let me go down the three points that the Senator from Arizona \nmade, as the core points of McCain-Feingold and the proposed change \nthat we will have. First, he said it must be bipartisan. I will grant \nhim that. McCain-Feingold will damage both parties equally, damage the \nprocess for everybody. It doesn't play favorites. It will be equally \nbad.\n  Second, he says we must lessen the amount of money overall in \ncampaigns. If he had listened to the expert testimony that we have had \nin the Governmental Affairs Committee this last week, he would find \nthat even people who support McCain-Feingold, who come out of the \nacademic community and commented on this, told us you cannot control \nthe amount of money in political campaigns. The Senator from Kentucky \nhas said, ``Controlling political money is like putting a rock on \nJello. You put it on one place and it squeezes out another.'' And these \nexperts said the same thing. They said political money has been in the \nprocess ever since George Washington was President and will always be \nin the process, and we have had a continuing process of simply trying \nto control it. But you are not going to eliminate it. It is always \ngoing to be with you.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. As I listened to my colleague suggest that you cannot \ncontrol money, I can't help but think back to----\n  Mr. BENNETT. May I correct that? I said you cannot control the total \namount of money. You can control where it flows.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is fair, Mr. President. Let me nevertheless ask the \nsame question I was going to ask, because I think it is relevant. Last \nyear in Massachusetts, Governor Weld and I agreed on a fixed amount of \nmoney that we would spend in our race. We agreed on a fixed amount of \nmoney for our media, and a fixed amount of money for the campaign on \nthe ground, so to speak. We agreed, both of us, to have no money from \nthe national political parties and no money from independent \nexpenditures. We set up a mechanism whereby we were able to control not \nhaving those independent expenditures come in. In the end, we had a \ncampaign that had no national money, no independent expenditures, and \nwe spent the fixed amount of money that we said we would.\n  So I ask my colleague, how it is he can say that you can't control it \nwhen in fact there is evidence of it having been controlled in that \nrace, as well as in Governor races and other races in the rest of the \ncountry where they have accepted limits?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Massachusetts for an example that \nI think makes my point. You made the decision, your opponent made the \ndecision, and you are in control in this circumstance of the amount of \nmoney that is spent. What McCain-Feingold does is take that decision \nout of your hands and put it in the hands of the bureaucracy.\n\n  When I say you can't control the amount of money, I should be more \nspecific. You can't control it by Government fiat. You certainly can \ncontrol it in terms of what happens in your own campaign, just as I \nmade the decision in my campaign that there would be no negative ads. I \nrefused to run any ads attacking my opponent. But I would oppose any \nGovernment rule that would say to me I could not make a different \ndecision if I wanted to. And I would oppose any Government regulation \nthat would say that you and Governor Weld could not have made that \ndecision on the basis that you wanted to, instead of there being more \nparticulars that would be imposed upon you by Federal law that would \nsay, ``Well, you have come fairly close but we are going to put this \nregulation and that regulation on top of the decision that the two of \nyou jointly made.''\n  I applaud you for what you did. I think every campaign would be \nbetter off if the candidates could sit down in advance and make that \nkind of a deal. But I want every deal to be a separate deal, made by \nseparate candidates, rather than dictated from this Chamber.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my friend yield for a further question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would ask him that, now having at least established one \ncan arrive at a control, the issue is whether or not the Government \nmight play a role in that? I ask the Senator if he is aware that, in a \nnumber of States and in a number of cities, they have in fact passed \nlegislation where there is an accepted regime of control for how much \nis spent in a campaign, or for the mechanism for raising it? The city \nof New York, State of Maine, a number of other States have accepted \nthis.\n  So, really, the question is not whether or not you can do it, I would \nsubmit to my friend, it is whether or not one is willing to do it, \nwhether you have the desire of doing it. That is really the bottom-line \nquestion, I would suggest.\n  Mr. BENNETT. May I respond to my friend, and then I see the Senator \nfrom Kentucky wants to get into this.\n  In the first place, I think we ought to wait for some experience from \nthese cities and States as to what happens before we rush to Federal \nlegislation on the basis of the bills that they have passed. I think it \nis salutary that the States are being used as a lab, to see what works \nand what does not. I don't know that there has been any constitutional \nchallenge to any one of these statutes yet. I would expect there would \nbe. And I would like to have the reasoning of the courts before us \nbefore I rush to Federal legislation. Then, as I said, I would like to \nhave some on-the-ground experience to see how it really works.\n  If I may give a separate kind of example, in the State of Utah we \nallow corporate contributions for statewide races--Governor, attorney \ngeneral, Lieutenant Governor, what have you. There has not been a hint \nof scandal. There is no outcry to stop that. And we have had a series \nof outstanding Governors, both Democrats as well as Republicans, every \none of whom has been a man of highest rectitude.\n  So, if you are going to look for a local example of something that \nworks, you could say, based on my State's experience, that we ought to \nopen the whole thing up and let corporate contributions come in as well \nas individual contributions. The one thing that we do have in Utah that \nhas made it work is full and complete disclosure so that everybody \nknows that, if the Utah Power and Light Company has given to X \ncampaign, that is on the public record. And when the Governor goes to \ndeal with utility regulation, everybody knows how much the power \ncompany gave him.\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield just for an observation?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Massachusetts was talking about State \nand local referenda. There have been some. Most of them have either \nbeen struck down by the courts, as in the case of Missouri, Minnesota, \nOregon, and Cincinnati. The balance are in litigation, such as the new \nState law in Maine which virtually no one believes will be upheld by \nthe Federal courts.\n  The Senator is correct, there has been some experimentation at the \nState and local level. Virtually all of them have been struck down or \nare on the way to being struck down.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Kentucky for that additional \ninformation. Let me go back to the three points made by the Senator \nfrom Arizona: Must be bipartisan--I agree, this is bipartisan. Two, \nmust lessen the amount of money overall in politics--if the experts \nthat have testified before our committee are correct, and I believe \nthey are, in a free society that is simply an impossible goal. You can \ndisclose it, and I think we should; you should shine as much light, \nsunshine, exposure as you can, and I think we should. You should do \nthings about getting people better informed of what is going on, and I \nthink we should.\n  I am perfectly willing to talk about amending the current laws to go \nin that direction. But you should not kid yourself that in a free \nsociety, somehow Government can control the total amount of money \npeople want to spend in political advocacy.\n  So we come to the third principle, laid down by the Senator from \nArizona, that there must be a meaningful campaign finance reform, which \nis we must level the playing field between challenger and incumbent. We \nmust help the challenger.\n  I have already made the point, and will make it again, that the best \nway you can help the challenger in the field of money is to allow the \nchallenger to raise more money than the incumbent. If you level the \nplaying field and say to the challenger--my own example again \nrepeated--you cannot raise any more money than the incumbent, but the \nincumbent starts out with all of the name recognition, all of the years \nof going to Rotary Clubs and bar mitzvahs, all of the staff paid for by \nthe taxpayer available to him, all of the record of answering letters \nand doing favors and congressional constituent service, and you can't \nspend any more to try to overcome that advantage in the name of \ncampaign finance reform, you have decapitated the challenger and \nguaranteed that the incumbent is going to get reelected in virtually \nevery circumstance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield for another comment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As an observation on what the Senator said about \nleveling the playing field, that was raised in the Buckley case, and \nthe Supreme Court said it was constitutionally impermissible for the \nGovernment to try to level the playing field. In fact, the Court said:\n\n       The concept that Government may restrict the speech of some \n     elements of our society in order to enhance the relative \n     voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.\n\n  So my friend from Utah is correct, even if it were possible somehow \nfor the Government to figure out how to micromanage and level the \nplaying field, it is truly constitutionally impermissible for the \nGovernment to try to do that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Kentucky for that additional \ninformation about this particular issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to end as I began by expressing my deep concern \nover this whole attempt to tiptoe into the area of free expression in a \nfree society regarding political activity and political speech. I know \nit is frustrating to see large amounts of money come into a campaign. I \nhave heard my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, tell of his \npersonal experience when Buckley versus Valeo was handed down, where he \nwas in a Senate race with the man who became Senator Heinz. The story \nends well because Senator Specter became Senator Specter as well, but \nnot in that race.\n  He, Senator Specter, was running the campaign. There were spending \nlimits. Buckley versus Valeo struck those limits down in terms of an \nindividual American being allowed to spend whatever amount of money he \nwanted to spend in expressing his own point of view. As Senator Specter \nsaid, ``Senator Heinz had virtually unlimited resources and I did not. \nAnd Senator Heinz put those resources into the race and I was \nprohibited.''\n  ``Now,'' says Senator Specter, ``my brother had enough money to fund \nmy campaign, but my brother was forbidden to put that money into the \ncampaign and, therefore, I was at an unfair disadvantage to John \nHeinz.''\n  My solution to that would be let his brother put the money in the \ncampaign. If we are going to level the playing field, and Heinz has x \namount of money that he can put in and Senator Specter has a brother \nwho has x amount of money he can put in, in the spirit of the decision \njust described by the Senator from Kentucky, I would have no problem \nwith saying, OK, let Senator Specter's brother put it in, let's level \nthe playing field by letting both sides spend.\n  Now, if Senator Specter's brother put it in, it darn well better be \ndisclosed where he got the money, where it came from and let people ask \nthe question: What did Arlen Specter's brother expect to get in return \nif Arlen Specter took enough money from him to match John Heinz?\n\n  Or to put it in a more contemporary circumstance, we see in the \nPresidential situation where we have these kinds of limits, in this \nlast election, Jack Kemp wanted to run for President. Those of us who \nknow Jack and can read his body language could tell he was anxious to \nrun for President. He looked at the fundraising problem that he faced \nunder the present limitations, and he said, ``I can't physically do it. \nI have to go out and raise this much money at $1,000 apiece. I can't \nphysically stand the wear and tear.''\n  Sitting at Jack Kemp's elbow, figuratively, was somebody who believed \nin everything Jack Kemp believed in. His name is Steve Forbes. Steve \nForbes could have funded a Kemp campaign for President without noticing \nit. But under the circumstances in which we currently are operating, \nSteve Forbes is forbidden to do that. So, ultimately, what did he do? \nHe ran for President himself. At some point in this debate, I will have \nsome comments about that, too, and what happened with that injection of \nmoney coming from Steve Forbes.\n  But wouldn't it be a better kind of system if Steve Forbes could say, \n``Jack, you're better known than I am, you have more experience in this \narena than I do, you probably have a better chance of making it, you \nrepresent the same ideas I feel strongly about, here's a check for $15 \nmillion; go to it, Jack.''\n  The first question that Jack would have been asked is, ``What did you \npromise Steve Forbes in order to get $15 million?'' And that might be a \nvery embarrassing question for Jack to answer. Indeed, Jack might say, \n``Steve, I'm not going to take your money because I don't want to have \nto answer that question.'' But that is the kind of openness and honesty \nthat I think would make the system a whole lot better than what we are \ntalking about here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield before he \nleaves, I would like to ask him a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I was listening with great interest to my friend from \nUtah in describing the Government controls over political speech that \nare a part of or actually at the heart of McCain-Feingold. I know, for \nexample, that there is this distinction which the Senator from Utah \nreferred to in terms of what is commonly referred to as issue advocacy. \nDo things on the 61st day before the election, but if it is the 60th \nday or closer, you can't do other things.\n  I am sure my friend from Utah knows this, but an agency of the \nFederal Government would be put in charge of making these decisions, \nwould it not?\n  Mr. BENNETT. An agency of the Federal Government would decide what \nwas permissible and what was not on the 60th day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So an outside group seeking to criticize a Member of \nCongress--they didn't like how he or she voted on day 58 before an \nelection--\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\nwould then be prohibited by the Federal Government from expressing \ncriticism of this incumbent during that period, would it not?\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And is it reasonable to assume, I ask my friend from \nUtah, if that would be an enormous advantage to incumbents?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Well, the assumption is that it would be an advantage to \nincumbents because it would give them freedom from criticism by an \noutside group in that period. My sense of smell tells me the outside \ngroup would, even under McCain-Feingold, probably find some way to try \nto get around that.\n  For example, as I understand the Senator from Arizona, he said there \ncan be no criticism by name of a candidate, so perhaps the outside \ngroup would say, ``The Congressman from the Third Congressional \nDistrict of Utah is terrible, but we didn't name him.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But this agency would have to decide whether that was \nspecific enough.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The agency would have to decide, and once the agency \ndecided, yes, it is all right to attack the Congressman but not to \nattack him by name, or, no, you can't say the Congressman from the \nthird district, but you can say some Congressman, or whatever, you \nwould, again, have Government dictating that which was permissible \nspeech in terms of the content of the ad.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Utah, looking at the McCain-\nFeingold bill, section 303, it gives the FEC the authority to seek an \ninjunction. So the FEC could choose to go to court and shut this group \nup, could it not, under this authority?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It could.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So you can imagine a group of aggrieved citizens who \nhave been dramatically and adversely affected by a vote of an incumbent \nMember of Congress on the 57th day before an election essentially shut \nup because of the proximity to the election, quieted by the heavy hand \nof the Federal Government, unable to criticize an official action of a \nMember of Congress during that time period. Is the Senator from \nKentucky right in assuming that would be the likelihood of this?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I believe the Senator is partly right. I think either \nthat would be the likelihood, that a group would be deprived of its \nright to exercise free speech in that area, or another equally likely \noutcome, in my view, is that the outcry from the group over the \ninjunction would be sufficiently significant in the press that it would \noverride any discussion of substantive issues from that point forward \nand the last 60 days of the campaign would be spent bickering over \nwhether or not the group really should or should not have had that \nright. Either way, it distorts the political dialog in a way I find \ncorrosive and damaging to the intent of the Constitution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Let me yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, and then \nI will come back to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \neffort to have a good discussion, and I think that is a very important \npart of what we are trying to achieve here. I, obviously, want the \nSenator from Kentucky to be a part of that.\n  The allegation has been made by the Senator from Kentucky that \nsomehow someone is being shut up or shut out of the system. Wouldn't it \nbe true, notwithstanding the effort to seek an injunction as to \nexpenditure for ads under the aegis of this entity, that they would, \nnevertheless, be free to participate, like every other citizen, by \nraising so-called hard money, money for the campaign for the candidate, \nby participating in the campaign itself, by holding fora, by holding \nany kind of participatory effort that they want, which, in effect, is \nonly limiting the clutter and the impartiality of the last 60 days of a \nrace because of the undue influence of money.\n  My question is, wouldn't America be better off to have a \nparticipatory process where people are encouraged to come out of their \noffices and into the meeting halls and candidates are encouraged to go \ninto the living rooms rather than simply rely on money to distort the \nprocess?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I respond to my friend from Massachusetts by saying \nthat, of course, the country would be better off if all of those things \nhappened. There is no reason whatsoever to believe that the \nprohibitions of one kind of expression that are outlined in McCain-\nFeingold would automatically produce all of the other more beneficial \nkinds of expression that the Senator from Massachusetts has described.\n  There is no credible cause-and-effect relationship between the two. \nWe are back to the fundamental point that I am trying to make in this \nentire presentation, which is, we are talking about ways in which the \nGovernment will regulate speech. And that, in any other context, is \ncalled censorship. And I am opposed to it.\n  Now, I must go back to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Utah, this is an interesting \nhypothetical to discuss, but there is virtually no chance the courts \nwould allow the kinds of restrictions on issue advocacy in the McCain-\nFeingold bill. The Supreme Court addresses issue advocacy; that is, the \nway others are able to criticize our records.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts is saying, I think, is that he \nwould like that criticism to be less effective. In other words, do not \nuse something really effective like television, just go out and go door \nto door. There isn't any chance the Supreme Court is going to say, \n``Deny to an aggrieved group the opportunity to use the most effective \nway to criticize our records,'' which we all know requires: (a) The \nexpenditure of money, and (b) the use of television. That is the \neasiest way for that criticism to have an impact.\n  The good news is--the good news is--there is virtually no chance that \nany court in America would uphold the kinds of restrictions on issue \nadvocacy by groups that are contained not only in the original McCain-\nFeingold bill but in the substitute that in all likelihood will be \noffered Monday. That is the good news.\n  I thank my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Does the Senator from Massachusetts ask me to yield \nfurther for an additional comment? If he does, I will be happy to do \nso.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator simply to acknowledge \nwhat I think he would acknowledge is the state of the law, which is \nthat there is a distinction that the Court has drawn between issue \nadvocacy of the kind the Senator from Kentucky was referring to--which \nI would not seek to restrict; I understand the first amendment--and \nexpress advocacy of a candidate.\n  There is a clear distinction the Court has drawn between a legitimate \neffort to talk about an issue in the abstract and an effort to help a \ncandidate get elected. I think that most Americans would feel, in fact, \nin answer to the Senator saying, ``Well, there's nothing in here that \nconnects the amount of money to the effort to get people, you know, \ninto the living rooms and out of their offices,'' I suggest \nrespectfully to my colleague, there is, because the more the money, the \nmore there is this effort to simply have these distorted 30-second \nadvertisements, the less people feel connected or need to connect to \nthe politician or the process and the more they are in fact alienated \nfrom it.\n  In the experience of Massachusetts, where we set a limit on what we \nwould do, I in fact felt an enormously greater incentive to go out and \norganize at the grassroots level because I knew it was that much more \nimportant.\n  So would my friend from Utah acknowledge that in fact there is a \ndistinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy and there is in \nfact a connection in the way that we can begin to bring people back \ninto the process by getting rid of the cynicism that they have and the \nsense of being absolutely separated from all of this money?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I can respond to the two questions by my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Yes; there is clearly. The answer to his first one, an attempt to \ndefine the difference between issue advocacy and express advocacy in \nterms of a candidate, how that would play out under McCain-Feingold in \nterms of the 60-day rule is still very troubling to me and, in my view, \ndoes indeed cross over the line and become censorship.\n  Now, as to his second question, this is a matter of \npolitical experience. Obviously, every Member of this Chamber\n\n[[Page S10010]]\n\nhas his or her own political experience to draw back on. I will only \ncomment in terms of my own, that I am known in Utah as a politician who \nbelieves perhaps more strongly than any other in the importance of \ngrassroots organization.\n\n  I am currently spending all the money that I am currently raising in \nbuilding such an organization. Some of the people who work for the \nSenator from Kentucky under the other hat he wears as chairman of the \nRepublican Senatorial Campaign Committee are a little disturbed that I \ndo not have more money left in the coffers from the amount I have \nraised, and where has its gone?\n  It is going right now into building a precinct-by-precinct, voting-\ndistrict-by-voting-district campaign organization so that if I have no \nmoney for television, I have at least one person for every 10 or 20 \nhouseholds who will go out and knock on doors on my behalf. I am \nbuilding that organization right now. I believe in that fundamentally.\n  However, my personal experience says that I cannot energize these \nfolks without some ads on television. I can give them all the letters, \nI can give them all the phone calls, I can tell them all how wonderful \nthey are, but until they see something on the screen, they are not \nconvinced I am a serious candidate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I may finish.\n  At the same time, my experience in the last campaign is that when \nthere were ads attacking me, I found that the general public did not \npay any attention to them and did not care. But my own troops all \npanicked until I was able to get back on television and answer those \nads. And they heaved a gigantic sigh of relief.\n  By the same token, I am told by my opponent's people--Utah is a small \nenough State that virtually all the politicians talk to each other, \nparticularly when the campaign is over--that it was one of my ads \npuncturing my opponent's attack on me that took all the starch out of \ntheir door-to-door grassroots organization.\n  The former chairman of the Democratic State committee said, ``I was \nshaving in the morning, feeling good about the campaign. We were \nclosing the gap on you. Our attacks were taking hold. I had the radio \non and heard your voice come on on the radio. At the end of 60 seconds, \nI said, `It's all over. He has just punctured our balloon. There's no \nway we can get anybody going again.' ''\n  So, these things play hand in hand. Everyone has his or her own \nexperience in it. We come back to the basic posture that I took. We, as \ncandidates, should be in charge of our campaigns. We, as candidates, \nshould make the decision as to what is said, when it is said, how it is \nsaid. We should make the decision whether we use grassroots or \ntelevision or radio or billboards or handbills or newspapers.\n  Those around us who want to get into it should be free to make their \nown decisions in that regard. The heavy hand of the Federal Government \nshould not be in that circumstance saying, ``This group can; that group \ncannot. And 61 days is OK; 60 days is not. The public is not smart \nenough to sort through all of this and make their own decisions. We \nmust regulate how the money is raised. We must regulate how it is \nspent.''\n  I am perfectly content to have the Federal Government regulate from \nwhom it is raised. I think the ban we have had on corporate \ncontributions since Mark Hannah's days is legitimate. In terms of \ndirect contributions to candidates, I think that is a legitimate \nrestriction which we have had in this country for longer than I am old. \nI have no problem with that.\n  I am perfectly willing to have the Federal Government involved in \nrequiring full disclosure so that everybody knows if I take money from \nFred Thompson, I am going to have to answer for that, that everybody \nknows what I am doing. I have no problem with that.\n  But I have serious, serious fundamental problems, in terms of my \ndevotion to the Constitution, people who know me know on the floor how \nstrongly I feel about this--I think we are treading on very, very \nsacred ground when we say the Federal Government is going to start to \nmake these kinds of decisions for candidates and groups and ordinary \nAmericans, and it is going to do it in a way that carries the full \npunitive power of the Federal Government behind it.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Utah \nfor his very enlightening presentation. Since I have not yet spoken on \nissue advocacy, I want to pick up for a few moments what we were \ndiscussing at the end of the colloquy with the Senator from \nMassachusetts. On the question of issue advocacy, the Court has not \nbeen vague on this at all. This is not a gray area.\n  The Court has been quite precise in the area of issue advocacy. Issue \nadvocacy is criticism of us. Groups are entitled to do it at any time \nthey want to and as loud as they want to. We never like it. We can \nstipulate that we never like it. Now, the biggest group in America in \nthe field of issue advocacy on television is the AFL-CIO, and it is \nmostly targeted to Members of my party. We can stipulate that we do not \nlike it worth a darn. But no effort to try to restrict that through \nlegislation in the Congress is going to change it.\n  It is not a gray area. The Nation's experts on the first amendment, I \nthink we would all agree, is the American Civil Liberties Union. In a \nletter to me earlier this year, they said this about the provisions in \nMcCain-Feingold dealing with issue advocacy. This is the exact quote, \nMr. President:\n\n       Worst of all is S. 25's blunderbuss assault on issue-\n     oriented speech. The weapon is an unconstitutional expansion \n     of the definition of ``expressed advocacy'' in order to sweep \n     classic issue speech within the zone of regulation as \n     independent expenditures.\n\n  So let me just make it simple. There isn't any chance, Mr. \nPresident--no chance--that through legislation, we can shut up all of \nthese groups who seek to criticize us. We can stipulate that we do not \nlike it, but they are going to keep on doing it. No amount of standing \nup here on the floor of the Senate and arguing that somehow we are \ngoing to be able to purify the process and get rid of all these critics \nis going to get the job done.\n  In this whole field, Mr. President, at the end of the day we get back \nto the Constitution. You begin and you end this debate with the First \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, as the Senator from Utah has \npointed out. This is core political speech, according to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. That is not Mitch McConnell's interpretation. That is \nnot Bob Bennett's interpretation. This is the law of the land. As the \nSenator from Utah said, when you start moving around in this field, you \nbetter tread lightly. The courts were not only good in the Buckley \ncase, they have been good since. The whole trend has been to more \nbroaden the area of permissible political discourse in this country.\n  The Court has said it is impermissible for us to decide how much \npolitical speech is enough--impermissible. In spite of that, the \nreformers persist in promoting the notion that it is somehow desirable \nfor the Federal Government to determine how much political discourse we \nare going to have in our campaigns in this country.\n  You hear them say time and time again--we heard it this morning, and \nwe will hear it next week--``We're spending too much in American \npolitics.''\n  Remember what the Supreme Court says that means: that they are \nsaying, ``We're speaking too much. We're speaking too much.'' How much \nis too much?\n  Last year, there was a lot of political speaking because there was a \nwar on out there for the future of the country. We had a change in \n1994, and a Republican Congress came in for the first time in 40 years. \nThe status quo forces didn't like it, and they fought back in 1996. A \ngood deal was said. That is speech. A lot of it cost money, and \nspending did go up.\n  When all was said and done, I say to my friend Utah, we spent per \neligible voter last year $3.89, about the price of a McDonald's value \nmeal. Looking at it another way, of all the commercials that were shown \non television last year, 1 percent of them were political commercials. \nAnd they say we are speaking too much. They think it is a good idea to \nshut all these people up, shut down those outside groups that are \ncriticizing us, put a cap on how much a campaign can say.\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\n  Who gets the power then? Conspicuously exempted--and I am not arguing \nwe ought to take away the exemption--but conspicuously exempted from \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act is the press.\n  I have looked and I have searched to see whether there is any \nprovision in here, and I say to my friend from Utah, that the press \ncannot criticize us in the last 60 days of an election. I have been \nlooking feverishly to see if I can find if there is any prohibition on \nthe press endorsing candidates in the last 60 days of the election. \nMaybe I just have not read this carefully enough, but I cannot seem to \nfind it.\n  So what we are talking about here is a transfer of power away from \ngroups that want to comment about our record and talk about us, \nfrequently in an unfavorable way. The original version of McCain-\nFeingold wanted to shut up the campaigns themselves so they could not \ntalk too much. And I hear from Senator McCain, he is going to offer an \namendment to try to bring that back.\n  We shut down the campaigns and we shut down the issue groups. Who \ngets to talk? Who gets to talk about Government interference in the \nlast 60 days of the election? Why, the press gets to talk. We know darn \ngood and well that all of this issue advocacy restriction in here is \nflatout unconstitutional and is not a question in anybody's mind that \nknows anything about the Supreme Court.\n  OK, so issue advocacy survives in the courts. Even if we passed it \nhere, somehow that spending limits on campaigns survives, so you are \ngoing down the home stretch, you are in the last few days, and the \ncampaign runs out of money and you can't say anything. But the labor \nunions are there with issue advocacy, they have raised their money by \nchecking off union dues, taking it in many instances from people \ninvoluntarily. They are hammering away at you, the liberal press is \nrunning exposes on the front page and endorsing your opponent on the \neditorial page--welcome to the brave new world of campaign finance \nreform where the groups are shut up, the candidates are shut up, and \nthe press is running the game.\n  Now, the good news is the Court will not allow this to happen. But \nwhat is sad is that anybody would even be proposing this. What is \ndisturbing is that anybody would even be suggesting that it would be a \ngood idea to have less political discourse in this country.\n  There is a lot of discussion going on all the time about public \naffairs in this country. The press is talking about it every day. Most \nobjective studies would indicate that 85 to 90 percent of the people in \nthat line of the work are on the left. Hollywood is making statements \nall the time about what kind of society we have. Many of us feel about \n100 percent of them are on the left. So you have the press on the left, \nyou have Hollywood on the left, and the candidates and the groups with \nthe Government clamping down on what they can say in the heat of a \ncampaign. It sounds like something straight out of Orwell's ``1984.'' \nYet there is serious discussion here on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nthat this somehow would be an improvement in the American political \nsystem.\n  Write it down--we are not speaking too much in the American political \nprocess. We are not going to pass this unconstitutional piece of \nlegislation. If we were foolish enough to do it, the courts would \nstrike it down. The argument we hear is the people are crying out for \nus to do this, that they are just desperate for us to pass this kind of \nlegislation. Let me say in a survey taken just a few months ago by a \nreputable polling firm which I was just looking at this week, they \nasked 1,017 registered voters open-ended what they thought the most \nimportant problem in America was, and not a single one of them \nmentioned campaign finance reform. Then the pollsters thought maybe it \nwill be different if they put it on the list, so they put it on a list \nof 10 topics. It came in dead last of the 10.\n  We will hear time and time again, as I have today, and we will hear \nit more next week, that everyone is clamoring for us to pass this big \nGovernment solution to this nonexistent problem of too much political \ndiscussion in this country. Eighty-seven percent of the people, by the \nway, would be less likely to vote for a Member who supports \nunconstitutional reform.\n  Now the proponents of this legislation this week sent out a press \nrelease saying they had found 126 people who said this bill was \nconstitutional. My reaction to that is that I could probably find 126 \npeople who say the Earth is flat. But the people who handle this \nlitigation, America's experts on the first amendment--the American \nCivil Liberties Union, and clear and unambiguous decisions by the U.S. \nSupreme Court--make it abundantly clear that this is unconstitutional.\n  Now, the people of the United States did not send us up here to pass \nblatantly unconstitutional legislation. Sure, you can craft a question \nthat will get the answer you want. Spending limits on the surface \nsounds like a good idea. If you ask people if they are in favor of \nspending limits they will say yes. On the other hand, if you rephrase \nthe question and say do you think there ought to be a limit on how many \npeople can participate in your campaign, 99 percent of them will say \nno. The same issue expressed a different way.\n\n  So the people are not clamoring for us to shut down political \ndiscussion in this country. They are not clamoring for us to push \npeople out of the process. They are not asking us to make it impossible \nfor them to criticize our records in proximity to an election. Sure, if \nyou ask them about the influence of special interests they will say \nthat is a terrible thing. Do you know the definition of a special \ninterest, Mr. President? Special interest is a group that is against \nwhat I am trying to do. But of course the organization I belong to--\nwhether it is the VFW, the Farm Bureau, the National Rifle Association \nor the Electrical Workers Union--we are not a special interest. We are \na bunch of Americans trying to do the right thing for our country. The \nterm special interest is meaningless. It is a pejorative term applied \nto any group opposed to what we want done.\n  As a practical matter, the founders of this country knew that there \nwould be a seething cauldron of special interests. They expected us to \norganize. They expected us to contribute to campaigns. They expected us \nto be criticized if we came here to serve in the Senate or in the \nHouse. We were not to be above criticism. They envisioned lobbyists. \nThat is another part of the First Amendment. It gives people the right \nto petition the Government. A lobbyist, of course, is a person working \nfor a group trying to do something I'm against. But the person we have \nhired to represent our group in Washington is doing the right thing.\n  Mr. President, this is going to be a good debate. There may be an \neffort in this bill to shut off campaigns, to quiet the voices of \nindependent groups who want to criticize us, but there is going to be \nplenty of discussion on this issue here in the Senate. I hope, Mr. \nPresident, that many people will take an opportunity to listen in \nbecause when they hear the words ``campaign finance reform,'' they \ndon't understand that generally means somebody is trying to put the \nGovernment in charge of their ability to participate in the American \npolitical process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, proponents of campaign finance reform \nsay it is an assault on the Constitution. I say that McCain-Feingold is \nan assault on an incumbent's protected system that is rapidly losing \nfaith with the American people. These claims about government takeover, \nand government regulation, and big government, of course, resonate with \nme as well as they do many other people, because I'm against that. I'm \nagainst the more intrusive government and I'm against more and more \nregulation, and I'm against government doing things that it should not \nbe doing, especially the Federal Government.\n  However, I think we have too quickly divided up into liberal and \nconservative counts and Democrat and Republican counts on this issue. \nAs I read my history, Senator Barry Goldwater, the father of modern \nconservatism, in many people's view, was one of the most avid \nproponents of campaign finance reform a few years ago.\n  So let's go back to the basics. People who are basically conservative \nthink that the Government ought to do the things the Government ought \nto do and\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\nnot things that it shouldn't. What should the Government be doing? Mr. \nPresident, if the way we elect our Federal officials and the \nmotivations that they come to Washington with is not relevant and is \nnot something that we ought to be concerned with, then what is? That is \nthe basis of Government. Government does a lot of things it should not \nbe doing, but how we elect our Federal officials, who are the arbiters \nof everything else in society anymore, seemingly, is certainly the \nsubject of our attention.\n  As I listen to this debate today, it is almost like under the current \nsystem we don't have regulation and that we are trying to impose \nregulation on an otherwise pristine system. We have the most heavily \nregulated system in the area of campaign finance reform than almost any \nother area in the country. Under the current system, you have a Federal \nElection Commission with detailed rules, timeframes, limit frames and \nso forth. You have $1,000 limitation; you have $5,000 limitation for \nPACs; you have $20,000 limitation as far as committees are concerned; \nan overall $25,000 limitation as to how much you can contribute in 1 \nyear. You have soft money rules, you have hard money rules, you have \npercentages of soft money you can do certain ads with--there has to be \na certain percentage of soft and hard money. You have transfers of \nmoney going back and forth between State and national parties, all \nunder a detailed set of rules that nobody understands. To run in a \npolitical campaign any more nowadays you have to have a team of lawyers \nand a team of accountants and a team of people keeping up with all the \nregulation.\n\n  That is our current system. My friend from Utah talks about our \nfriend Jack Kemp and Mr. Forbes and how it would be much better if we \nhad a different kind of system in our Presidential primaries. That is \nour current system he is complaining about. I think he makes some good \npoints there. I think we ought to look at limitation amounts there. I \nthink they are somewhat ridiculous and too low. All of that is our \ncurrent system.\n  So, what we are doing here, it looks to me like in McCain-Feingold is \nbasically two things: One is a ban on soft money; secondly, it is \nsaying about independent expenditures, that if you have candidate \nexpenditures, you call them that and treat them that way.\n  Under the current law, express advocacy is regulated now. It is \nregulated now. This idea that we are going to cut off somebody from \nsaying something or that we are going to shut people up and close \npeople off is simply not true. That makes interesting rhetoric but it \nis not in this bill, it is not in this legislation.\n  What it basically says is two things. In 1974 we passed a law and we \nwent along for almost two decades, electing Presidents under that law. \nNot a breath of scandal as far as campaign finance reform under that \nlaw and under the rules that we set forth then, for soft money problems \nin that entire period of time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Did I hear the Senator say since the passage of the \nPresidential system it has been scandal free?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Up until----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Until 1976, the year in which the explosion of soft \nparty money occurred, was right in the Presidential election cycle.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No, the soft money problem really rose its head in \nabout 1988, but it really didn't become a major problem until this last \nelection.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But the Senator is referring only to years in which \nthere are Presidential elections, which are the years of the system he \nis applauding, where you have voluntary spending limits that the Court \nupheld; has the Federal system been effective, I ask my friend from \nTennessee?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. For about two decades we did not have a soft money \nproblem because people abided under the rules laid down in 1974.\n  What has happened since that time is that soft money has come into \nthe system and now we have about $262 million in soft money in the \nsystem that we didn't have back in 1974 when we laid down the rules at \nthat time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me make sure I understand what the Senator is \nsaying. The soft money problem has arisen in the Presidential years, \nfor the most part. Is it not reasonable to assume that the reason the \ncandidates having been spending the limit of the taxpayer funds, \nturning to soft money, it is a way to get around the spending limit, is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, yes, that is absolutely true.\n  That, therein, lies the problem. We had a system for about two \ndecades whereby people made a deal with the Government to run for \nPresident, and that is we will take millions of dollars in public money \nand we don't raise any private money.\n  The Supreme Court held that up, it worked fine, no scandal, no \nconstitutional problem, until we decided that there was not enough \nmoney in the system and that there were ways that we could get more \nmoney for our Presidential campaigns. We have just seen the results of \nthat. The soft money situation started. We figured out a way that money \ncould be given to the parties for the benefit of the Presidential \ncandidates, and you could just add that, to the public financing that \nwe already had. And so in this last campaign we had about $262 million \nin soft money, in addition, which was about 10 times what it had been a \ndecade before. And that is the situation that we have now.\n  So some people are saying, look, let's basically go back to what we \nthought we were doing in 1974. A lot of people disagree with that, \ncertainly. A lot of people don't think we ought to do that. A lot of \npeople don't like things that smack of public financing at all. A lot \nof people don't realize that we have public financing for Presidential \ncampaigns in this country, as anathema as that phrase is. But now, \nafter a situation that worked pretty good for a while, nobody was \nsaying there wasn't enough money in our Presidential campaigns. I don't \nthink anybody was saying we didn't have enough commercials during the \nPresidential years. It worked pretty good. But now we have this \nadditional influx. We had a system that some people opposed and that \nsome people thought was good. It was our system. To say that it was \ntotally laissez faire, free market, unregulated is simply unfair. We \nhad a system. Now we have seen a gaming of the system, whereby millions \nof dollars in addition though that is put on the plate.\n  Now, at a minimum, if that is what we ought to want to do, we ought \nto revisit this as Congress. This is not something Congress came up \nwith. Congress didn't say soft money was a good idea. Congress didn't \nsay the current system we have is what we want. It was done little by \nlittle, by the FEC, by a court decision here, and by the FEC; advisory \nopinions. And then one party would see an opportunity for soft money \nand the other party, instead of blowing the whistle, would jump on the \nbandwagon, too. So we now have tremendous sums of money poured into our \nPresidential campaigns that we did not envision in 1974.\n  Now, again, if we think that is a great idea, let's come back as a \nCongress and put our stamp of approval on that. But just under the idea \nof congressional prerogatives alone, under the idea that we should not \nlet some commission downtown set such important rules for us, where we \nhave legislated something quite different, under those ideas, we ought \nto revisit it. That is another good reason why we are having this \ndebate.\n  On the other hand, some of us don't think that is such a good idea, \nthat we should not only revisit it, but we should do something about \nit. I think that, basically, what we are doing in the soft money debate \nhere is going back originally to where we were when we last legislated \nin this area. When we passed the current law in 1974, we did not say it \nwas OK for major corporations and major labor unions to give hundreds \nof thousands of dollars for the benefit of Presidential candidates in \naddition to what was publicly financed. We have gotten totally away \nfrom what we said we wanted.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would my distinguished colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Certainly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On the issue of soft money and where it has gone, there \nis\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\na very strong point that if the definition of issue advocacy, issue \ncommercials, contrasted with advocacy commercials, if that distinction \nwas sharpened up--my colleague and I discussed this at some length with \nAttorney General Reno when she appeared before the regular judiciary \noversight hearing back on April 30 and the questions were propounded to \nher about these commercials on both sides, Republican and Democrat--\nRepublican commercials extolling the virtues of Senator Dole, and \nDemocrat commercials extolling the virtues of President Clinton, and \nknocking each other in reverse. Those were somehow viewed as \nbeing issue commercials as opposed to advocacy commercials.\n\n  The question I take up with my colleague at this point, which is a \ncorollary to the soft money, is whether the soft money would really \nhave so much effect, and whether we couldn't contain it by \ncongressional enactment on the question of constitutionality. I would \nbe interested in the answer to two questions of the Senator, the \ndistinguished lawyer Senator Thompson. If we said that--short of saying \nvote for President Clinton or vote against Senator Dole, instead if the \nlikeness appears and the language is very strong urging the election of \none and the defeat of another, I ask if that would satisfy \nconstitutional muster, in the Senator's opinion, and what effect that \nwould have on limiting the utility of all this soft money that we found \nin the 1996 Presidential election?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As the Senator knows, much of the soft money went for \nthose kinds of ads. I would not be supporting a provision that I did \nnot think would pass constitutional muster. What this bill does is \nbasically what the Senator says. It says that you look to the \ncircumstances. If something is called an issue ad, but it is really an \nad for a particular candidate, it is called such. If it walks, quacks, \nand acts like a duck, we are going to call it a duck. You can still say \nwhatever you want to say. Nobody is shutting anybody off. There are no \nfree speech implications here. But if you are really going to do a \ncandidate ad--and in some cases, we have candidates going around \ncoordinating with independent groups, and the groups run an attack ad \non their opponent, the candidate dictates where and when that ad is \ngoing to be, and all the details and the composition of it, and it is \ncalled an independent expenditure.\n  What this would do would be to say we have a regulatory system. \nWhether anybody likes it or not, we already have a regulatory system. \nIf it is an express ad for a particular candidate, it is already \nregulated. What this legislation would do is say you would look at the \nfactors, look at the given situation. If it is an express ad, if it is \nreally for a candidate, we are just going to call it that, and it is \ngoing to be regulated under the same system express ads are regulated \nunder now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield further, on the issue of so-\ncalled independent expenditures, they appear in many cases--if not \nmost--not to be independent at all, and that there is, in fact, \ncoordination. Some people on the independent expenditure group are \nmembers of the candidate's staff collaterally, and there is good reason \nto flout the law because the remedies taken by the Federal Election \nCommission are often very late and very ineffectual. One piece of \nlegislation that is pending would sharpen the requirements as to \nindependent expenditures, calling for a tough affidavit with strong \npenalties, in addition to the regular perjury penalties, for the person \nwho makes the so-called independent expenditure. And then finally, the \nFEC would require a corollary affidavit by the candidate on whose \nbehalf the expenditure was made and the campaign committee to try to do \nsomething with teeth in it to stop the so-called independent \nexpenditures, which are in fact coordinated. Would my colleague think \nthat would be of some help to stop that pernicious practice?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I think that is a direction that we are trying to \nhead in. I am not for trying to sit down and detail what somebody can \nsay or not say. That is clearly unconstitutional. You can't do that. \nThe Buckley case made a distinction between contributions and \nexpenditures. Basically, it said you can't regulate expenditures. \nIndependent groups ought to be able to do whatever they want to do \nwhenever they want to do it. But we decided a long time ago that, as \nfar as campaign finance was concerned, we were electing the judges of \nour society in a way--you know, when we go to elect judges in our \nsystem, they are supposed to be independent. The litigants on either \nside can do things and get paid large sums of money, and so forth, but \nwhat you can do with regard to a judge is highly, highly narrow, in our \nsystem, and is regulated.\n  In a sense, we are the same way. I mean, we get elected by people--\none vote, one person; it is an equal deal. No matter how poor or rich \nyou are, or your status in society, your vote counts as much as anybody \nelse's. We are elected. I represent all of the people of the State of \nTennessee, no matter how many votes I get. The President represents all \nof the people of the country. We come up here and we are supposed to \nrepresent everybody. We are supposed to pass legislation evenhanded. We \nhave different views on different things. We have support here and \nopposition there. But we are supposed to try to give it our best \nobjective shot as to representing all of the people.\n  Given that situation in a democracy, we decided a long time ago that \nwe were going to place some rules on it, because it didn't look good \nand it didn't make us feel good and didn't give us confidence in our \nsystem if we saw hundreds of thousands of dollars going into the \npockets of people from interests who we were regulating or who we were \npassing laws on, when the people maybe on the other side of the issue \ndidn't have the money to do that. Are you going to be able to take \nmoney out of campaigns? Of course not. But we decided once upon a time \nthat a person ought to have a limit of $1,000--I personally think that \nis too low--and $5,000 for a PAC, and $25,000 overall.\n  We have a regulated system now because we know in our democratic \nsociety there needs to be some kind of control on the amount of money \nthat goes into the pockets of politicians. It is pretty simple and \nbasic. The Supreme Court or nobody else has ever said otherwise. The \nSupreme Court, in Buckley, has recognized that we do and we can \nregulate on the contribution side of things--on the contribution side--\nhow much money we can get. There is no question in my mind that we can \nregulate the soft money that is now coming into our system. This is not \na constitutional argument. What we have now is a system that protects \nincumbents. It is a system that is becoming more and more isolated, \nmore and more specialized, making it so that only a professional \npolitician who has been out there raising money all his life, or some \nwealthy individual, is going to be able to be a part of the system \nanymore.\n  My friend from Utah, a few minutes ago, made a very effective case \nthat not only do incumbents have tremendous fundraising advantages, but \nthey have other advantages. I agree with that. But that just makes the \nfundraising advantages that much more. The money goes to the \nincumbents. Maybe I just haven't been at it long enough. I have never \nrun for office before this one. I had never run before about 3 years \nago. I have run as a challenger against a person who was a \ncongressional incumbent, and then I have run as an incumbent. I don't \nthink we ought to get too bogged down with our own personal war \nstories, but I have seen it from both sides. I have had the \ndisadvantages and the advantages of both sides of it. But all I know is \nthat all the PAC money goes to incumbents. It doesn't matter what \nanybody believes anymore; it is their likelihood of getting reelected. \nIncumbents get reelected 90 to 95 percent of the time. The more upset \nthe American people get with us, the more heavily incumbents become \nentrenched. I wonder why that is.\n  Well, I think that part of it is what we are dealing with here today. \nFor those who want to make this out as some kind of new regulatory, big \nGovernment scheme that we are imposing on an otherwise pristine system \nthat we have here now, we heard some testimony the other day in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and I had heard things like it before. \nThis was from a businessman, a gentleman representing a bunch of \nbusinesses in this country. He said, ``We are tired of this\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\nsystem, tired of this soft money, tired of being hit up. We are tired \nof the extortion overtones of what is happening.'' What we have now is \na system, and what we had in this country in this last Presidential \nrace was people sitting in the White House--and it could have come from \na Senate office or congressional office, or anyplace of power--making \ncalls to individuals saying, ``I think it would be a good idea if you \nwould send us $50,000 or $100,000.'' And they feel that it probably \nwould be a pretty good idea, from their standpoint, to maybe go ahead \nand send it on.\n\n  Now, for those who are concerned about the coercive nature of big \nGovernment, chew that one over for a little while. That is what we have \nnow. We have gotten to the point now that, since the soft money \nsituation is totally unlimited, any politician can call up, and as long \nas they go through the guise of running it through one of the parties, \nwhich, in turn, will inure to their benefit, they can ask anybody for \nany amount of money.\n  So I think the American people look at that, and they don't think the \nsystem is on the level.\n  It all gets back to pretty basic stuff for me. I think the American \npeople look at a system where we spend so much time with our hand out \nfor so much money from so many people who do so much business with the \nFederal Government who we are basically regulating and legislating on, \nand they look at that system and the amounts of money that are involved \nnowadays, and they don't have much confidence in it.\n  We will continue to see those lists in the newspapers of the hundreds \nof thousands and millions of dollars of contributions and the pieces of \nlegislation put up against those contributions, the implication being \nthat there indeed is a quid pro quo. People look at that, and there is \na very little wonder that we are now having less than half our people \nvoting. My understanding is we only have 6 percent of the American \npeople making political contributions.\n  So during the last few months we have had hearings that I think have \nbeen very enlightening. I want to talk about that a little bit later in \na little bit more detail in terms of some of the things that have come \nout that in large part have to do with the actions of individuals and \nthe ability that we gave them to pursue unlimited amounts of soft \nmoney.\n  I think that the first thing we have to do, of course, is have \naccountability for those who have violated the law, for those who \nengage in improper activity, as part of what we have to be about.\n  I think the public record is developed now so that without question \nthere needs to be an independent counsel to look at this entire mess--\nnot who made a phone call from what room and just focus on that--this \nentire mess that we have seen over the last several months. We need \nsomeone independently to take a look at that.\n\n  But, my friends, if we think that accountability is going to solve \nour problem as far as the system we have in this country, we are making \na terrible mistake because whoever is in power, if they have the right \nto pressure people for unlimited amounts of money, our system is \nconstantly going to be and will remain a scandal waiting to happen. I \nhope that we will have learned that from this last one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nTennessee for his comments and his leadership on a lot of these issues \nwith respect to this legislation, and this issue in general.\n  I associate myself with the comments that he has made about the \nimpact that our current system is having on the politics of our \ncountry. That is what this debate is about. In my judgment, this is the \nmost important debate which we will have in the Senate this year--\nperhaps the most important debate and opportunity that we have had to \naddress the concerns of the American people, and with respect to this \nsystem, in many years.\n  I heard the Senator from Kentucky, for whom I have great respect for \nhis capacity of advocacy and depth of his commitment to this issue. No \none should doubt that he is passionately committed to the \ninterpretation he has both of the Constitution and the issues at stake.\n  But, as the Senator from Tennessee has just pointed out, while it \nsounds good to suggest to people that somehow regulating campaign \nfinance is going to shut down debate, the fact is the Supreme Court has \nalready approved of that kind of regulation. What we see today is an \nabuse of what the Supreme Court intended to take place. The Supreme \nCourt drew a distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy, \nand properly so.\n\n  I am confident that the Senator from Tennessee and I would agree that \nboth of us want a healthy and robust debate in this country and no \nlimitation on the first amendment right to discuss an issue. But there \nis a distinction between an issue and what some of the money under the \nguise of issue expenditure is seeking to do. What it is clearly seeking \nto do as an abuse of what the Supreme Court established is not to \nsimply talk about the issue but rather to affect the election and \nimpact express advocacy.\n  The Supreme Court has made it very clear that express advocacy is \nsomething that seeks to defeat or help a candidate. Issue advocacy can \ndiscuss Social Security, it can discuss welfare reform, and it can \ndiscuss any of the issues that we vote on and argue about in the Senate \nwithout talking about a candidate--without attacking the candidate's \nrecord--which properly ought to be left to the campaign, in the \njudgment of the Supreme Court.\n  We will argue, I think, considerably over this in the next days. I am \nprepared as we go further in this debate to discuss at considerable \nlength what the Supreme Court has actually said and not said and how, \nin fact, there is nothing in McCain-Feingold that is impermissible \nconstitutionally.\n  What I think we need to focus on as we go forward here is the overall \ndisarray of the system that the Senator from Tennessee has referred to \nand that all of us need to address as we think about how we are going \nto bring people back into a good-faith relationship with their \nGovernment. There isn't anybody in politics today--neither an observer \nnor a critic nor a pundit nor a participant--who could properly say \nthat the American people believe this system is on the level or believe \nthat somehow this whole process is responsive to their real needs.\n\n  The poll data show that 92 percent of Americans believe that money is \nwhat gets something done in Washington; 88 percent of the people \nbelieve that if you give money, you will get something back in return; \n49 percent of Americans believe that the special interests, the \nlobbyists, et cetera, basically run the Government.\n  I don't know how you can be in public life and not be concerned about \nthat kind of impact on the body politic of our Nation.\n  If that many people believe that their representatives are affected \nby money, we ought to be concerned about it. If that many people in \nAmerica believe that the way you get something done is by contributing \nmoney, we ought to be concerned about it.\n  All you have to do is listen to a fairly candid statement by one \nperson before the committee the other day who, in giving something like \n$400,000 or $300,000, said that it was clearly given directly to affect \nthat person's access and that person's ability to be able to get \nsomething done.\n  Mr. President, this isn't the first time that we have heard this \ndiscussion here--not by any means. We have had a century of different \nefforts to try to plug what most people have accepted at one point or \nanother as a series of loopholes and try to do justice to the \nrelationship that we want to have with the voter.\n\n  Mr. President, four decades ago, another Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator John F. Kennedy, warned of the rising costs of political \nelections and the dangers they posed to the American political process. \nHe said that there was the danger of political contestants ``becoming \ndeeply obligated to the big financial contributors from the worlds of \nbusiness, labor, and other major lobbies,'' and that there was the \ndanger of equal access to the political system being shattered.\n  That is what former President Kennedy said before he became \nPresident. The fact is that today equal access has been shattered. It \nhas been shattered.\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\n The truth is today that all of us understand the impact of money on \nAmerican politics, on the capacity to be elected, and on people's \nperceptions of our politics.\n  Back in 1959 when John Kennedy said a solution must be found to the \nsoaring costs of political contests, the total amount of money spent \nback then on all congressional races, both the House and the Senate \ntotal, was $6.3 million--on all the House and Senate races, just about \n1960.\n  The median cost of a single candidate race for the U.S. Senate today \nis $2.6 million.\n  In the Presidential contest prior to Senator Kennedy's remarks back \nin 1959, the two Presidential candidates spent a total of $12.9 \nmillion. In the last Presidential election they spent more than $150 \nmillion just in the money that is allowed to go directly into their \ncampaigns, and over $600 million, maybe $700 million, if you count all \nthe soft money that flowed as an excuse to do away with the other \nlimits that have been put in place.\n\n  Mr. President, it is very, very clear that the American people have \nreached a point where they understand that the rising costs of \ncampaigning is nothing less than outrageous. Last year the House and \nSenate candidates spent more than $756 million--a 76 percent increase \njust since 1990.\n  There is nothing in our economy, nothing in the increases in the \ncosts of campaigning, that justifies a 76 percent increase, except the \nArmageddon of the new arms race we have for money in campaigns.\n  The more money you get, the more you can blast your opponent, the \nmore you can put out whatever your message is, the more you can distort \nthe electoral process.\n  Last year more than $4 billion was spent on all elections, and 20 \nyears ago it was less than $600 million.\n  The American people, as Senator Thompson just pointed out, business \npeople and others, are tired of having politicians call them and say, \n``Well, we need $20,000, we need $50,000, we need $75,000.''\n  I think it is clear that the damage that such amounts of political \nmoney have done to the increase of our public cynicism is inescapable. \nThese amounts heighten the perception that Federal lawmakers respond to \nthe special interests and not to the public interests; that Federal \nlawmakers favor those who are greedy over the needy; the Federal \nlawmakers are, in reality, increasingly becoming Federal lawbreakers.\n  We know that power has its own corrupting capacities. History has \nproven that many times over. Now we are seeing that money and power are \nbecoming one and the same, and both together are having an increased \ncorruptive and corrosive process on our system. Even if it were only \nthe perception that that were happening, that perception is something \nthat we ought to be sensitive to and willing to respond to.\n  It seems to me that the headlines of the last months, while they have \nbeen singularly directed at our party--my party--I don't think anybody \nhere in a candid discussion of this issue could not in fairness agree \nthat they have embroiled both parties --all politicians; the entire \nsystem.\n  Only a few months ago we were seeing memos circulated where \nleadership members of the Republican Party were chastising openly those \npeople who give money, suggesting that they were going to get hurt in \nthe legislative process if they continued to give to Democrats. Senator \nThompson just talked about the sort of extortion air that hangs over \nthis city and our system as a consequence of those kinds of threats. \nAll of us are harmed by that.\n  All of us ought to be reaching for a means of being able to get rid \nof the capacity of any member of the electorate to make those kinds of \ndeterminations.\n  In the latter part of the 19th century, the chieftains of industry in \nthis country found that the use of wealth served them well, and they \nused it brazenly by purchasing Senate seats from the State legislatures \nin Colorado, West Virginia, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The 17th \namendment to our Constitution put an end to that practice, but Congress \nstill had to use taxpayer money in order to investigate and determine \nthe results of congressional elections in Michigan, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, Illinois, and other States as a consequence of that.\n  Abuse of campaign funds has obviously contributed to the worst \nscandals that we have known in this country--the Teapot Dome scandal \nand the Watergate scandal. And today now we are living through another \ninvestigation of the impact that money has on the political process.\n  Mr. President, it just really is time for us to find a commonality of \nground where we can come to some kind of compromise and agreement that \nthe current system cannot continue to work. It seems to me clear that \n``the power of the Government to protect the integrity of the elections \nof its officials is inherent.'' It is something that we ought to adhere \nto.\n  That is not my comment. That was something Theodore Roosevelt said in \nhis fourth annual message to the Congress. He said then, ``There is no \nenemy of free Government more dangerous and none so insidious as the \ncorruption of the electorate.''\n  That is what Senator Kennedy was speaking to 40 years ago when he \ntalked about how ``adequate Government regulation of the elective \nprocess [is] the most vital function of self-government.''\n  Mr. President this actually goes back to the very Founding Fathers' \nefforts with respect to the kind of Government they tried to put up. In \nthe Federalist Papers, James Madison pointed out, ``The aim of every \npolitical Constitution is * * * to obtain for rulers men who possess \nthe most wisdom to discern, and the most virtue to pursue the common \ngood of the society.'' And the second aim he said was ``to take the \nmost effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous while they \ncontinue to hold the public trust.''\n\n  ``Keeping them virtuous while they hold the public trust.''\n  I do not think they could have conceivably imagined the degree to \nwhich our capacity to go to voters and ask for their vote has become \ntied to our ability to be able to raise large sums of money.\n  Mr. President, when I came to the Congress in 1985, and when I ran in \n1984, I made a decision then to try to run for office without taking \nthe larger sums of money. I did not suggest then at any time, and in \ndebates since then on campaign finance reform I have made it very \nclear, that if regulation of some level of political action money were \npart of the reform system I would take it. I don't think there is an \ninherent problem with political action committee money. But I do think \nthat what people object to is the perception that the large amounts of \nmoney are what somehow distort the system. And so I have run now for \nthe Senate three times without taking PAC money. I may be the only \nMember of the Senate who has been three times elected since PAC money \nwas allowed and not taken it. I am proud of that, but I have to say \nthat I do not know if I can continue to do that with the current rate \nof escalation in the cost of campaigns.\n  Last time I ran for office in 1996, I had the most expensive Senate \nrace in the United States of America--$12 million. I raised more money \nwithout PAC money than any other person running for the Senate--$10 \nmillion, but obviously simple math shows that that left me a gap of $2 \nmillion. And so now in my first year of my third term in the Senate I \ncontinue to spend time raising money for the race that took place a \nyear ago. I continue to have to try to put away a debt assumed in order \nto run for office. I do not think people should have to assume debt to \nrun for office, but countless Senators have done that, countless \ncandidates are forced into doing it.\n\n  If I believe strongly in the ideas and policies I do believe in, if I \nwant them to be heard, if I want to be able to fight for them, the way \nthe American system is now set up, I have to do that. You have to go \nout and look for the money. Clearly, as we have learned, this \ninstitution is increasingly an institution which is represented by \npeople who either have their own money or have enormous access to great \nsums of money. And the truth is that challenger after challenger after \nchallenger falls short for lack of capacity to stand on the same ground \nas the incumbent.\n  Now, are there examples like the Senator from Utah gave where, \nindeed, a challenger may be well-heeled and an incumbent does not spend \nas much? You bet there is. I spent less than each\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\nof my opponents when I was an incumbent because I was not able to raise \nas much as they were because they had their own money and they would \nwrite their own check. I believe that our system is out of kilter \nbecause of that inequity as well as the result of the amount of money \nthat people have to go out and raise in the system. It seems to me we \nhave an opportunity here to be able to address all of those concerns.\n  I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a \nparticular concern about the capacity of some of our supporters to be \nable to use their structure to unfairly imbalance the playing field--\nspecifically, obviously, the labor movement and some other entities. I \nwould want to say that I think that is a fair concern. If we are going \nto approach this fairly, then we have to find some measure of defining \nwhat that fairness is and of understanding that a fair playing field is \nnot a fair playing field that gives our side an advantage over theirs \nor vice versa.\n  But something is very clearly wrong or defined in this debate when 45 \nDemocrats have already signed up saying we are prepared to vote for \nthis reform and only four Republicans have joined that effort. We are \nnow at the magic number of 49--49 Senators prepared to vote for \ncampaign finance reform. And since the only votes left to get are votes \nthat must come from the Republican Party, it is fair for America to ask \nthe Republicans to step up to fair reform. It is fair for the \nRepublican Party to be asked now to become part of this effort to \nreestablish a connection between the American voter and those of us \nelected to represent them.\n  Hopefully in the course of this debate we can find that common \nground. But let us not hide behind phony arguments about the \nConstitution, what it does or does not say about free speech. Let us \nacknowledge that the Supreme Court has already defined the difference \nbetween express and issue advocacy. Let us be honest about the fact \nthat the Supreme Court has already said we are permitted to regulate \ncampaigns; that we are permitted to regulate contributions. None of \nthose things does violence to the Constitution. And let us also be fair \nin not having some artificial debate about the new protections for \nlabor.\n\n  No one in this country is suddenly going to believe that the \nRepublican Party is adopting the labor movement and is going to protect \nevery member of the unions and they are going to be the ones to come to \nthe floor and protect them by offering some measure that somehow gives \nthem new freedom. We are prepared to codify Beck, and we are prepared \nto codify the notion that people ought to be given the right to choose, \nbut what we believe they will offer is something that seeks to go much \nfarther than that and becomes nothing less than an effort to kill \ncampaign finance reform.\n  So my hope is that this opportunity will be an opportunity that the \nAmerican people will ultimately be proud of and they will make a \njudgment that we came together in a legitimate, bona fide effort to \nfind common ground.\n  McCain-Feingold-Thompson and others, myself included, is not a bill \nthat many people on this side feel goes far enough. There are many of \nus who have already compromised significantly in coming to the place of \nMcCain-Feingold, which may be at the very edge of what may be \npermissible to get some kind of compromise. The truth is that many of \nus on this side of the aisle think anything that leaves you going out \nraising money leaves you exposed to the question: Well, who did you get \nit from? Why did they give it to you? What did you do after they gave \nit to you?\n  That is the central question that is being asked in the hearings that \nwe are going through right now. The fact is that is the only way you \nwill ever get away from that question: Why did that person give you the \nmoney? And particularly if it is large amounts of money. You will \ncontinue to have the corrosive connection that makes people so \napprehensive about the current system. And ultimately I personally \nbelieve America will come to a conclusion that the way you eliminate \nthe corrosiveness is to get the special interest money out of politics, \nallow people time to debate, allow them time to take the issues, \norganize, have adequate money to run a campaign, but do not make them \ngo out with their hands out always asking for money.\n\n  That is not what we do here. We do something less than that. But the \ntruth is that even if we were to pass McCain-Feingold as it is \ncurrently, people are going to have to go out and raise pretty large \nsums of money still and they are still going to be left with people \nasking: What did they give you? What did you do with the money? What \ndid you do for them? I think we are better off if the question doesn't \nhave to be asked and we do not have the suspicion hanging over our \nheads.\n  In addition to that, it seems clear to me that McCain-Feingold seeks \nalso to have increased enforcement. We have no enforcement today. \nPeople wonder why the current system is out of control. It is out of \ncontrol because it is set up in a way that perpetuates a lack of \ncontrol. You have an FEC that can never make a decision; they are \nunwilling to make a decision. It is divided up evenly between \nRepublican and Democrat representation so there is an even number of \nvotes, nobody can break a tie, and nobody wants to come in. If we can't \nhave regulation of laws we put in place, of course, we are going to \nhave violations.\n  So all we are seeking to do in this legislation is put a little teeth \ninto the concept of enforcement. The other thing we try to do is have \nsome kind of limitation on the capacity of wealthy candidates to be \nable to simply walk in unfairly and pour enormous sums of money into \nthe campaign. We do it in a way that is totally constitutional because \nthey are still allowed to go out and do it if they want, do it under \nanother structure, but it seems to me that all we do is have an \nincentive for them not to do it because obviously under the \nConstitution we cannot limit their right to spend their own money.\n\n  I cannot imagine that most people believe this institution ought to \nbe an institution exclusive to those who have enormous amounts of \nwealth. And there is a disproportionate representation already with \nrespect to that relative to most of the country. And that is not, I am \nconfident, what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The McCain-Feingold \nbase package that has already been scaled back from the original \nMcCain-Feingold is really already a significant compromise by many \npeople in the effort to achieve reform, and over the course of the next \nweek or so we will have an opportunity to test the constitutional \nissues, an opportunity to test whether or not anybody is left out.\n  I might just comment about that. I heard my colleague from Kentucky \ntalk about how people would be diminished in their ability to \nparticipate. Well, once again, I point to the experience of what \nhappened in Massachusetts. We had a very robust debate in \nMassachusetts, Mr. President. Many people might say we had too many \ndebates. We had nine 1-hour televised debates--nine of them. I think \nfive or more were statewide televised, others were on C-SPAN, a couple \nof them were local. But together with the coverage of the free media, \nthe press, which I think did a good job of trying to bend over backward \nto present both points of view, both sides, a side-by-side presentation \nof issues, there was no lack of dialog and no lack of debate. But what \nwe did was keep the craziness out; we kept the cacophony out; we kept \nout of this wild extraordinary race for the extra dollar the group that \ndistorts. We had a campaign where people could hear the issues. We had \na campaign where people could listen to the candidates. We had a \ncampaign where there was a premium for people on the ground to be \ninvolved organizing, street for street, community for community.\n\n  That is what American politics is supposed to be. And I proudly say \nthat the campaign we conducted in the State of Massachusetts for the \nSenate in 1996 has been written up by most critics across the country \nas one of the best Senate campaigns in years. I know that for myself I \nnever ran one so-called hard negative advertisement. Every one of our \nadvertisements was comparative, so to speak. And if I had my choice, we \nwould have spent half what we spent on paid advertising. But I was \nunable to secure an agreement from the Governor that we would spend \nless than the amount he chose to spend.\n  I spent twice what I have ever spent in any Senate campaign on media. \nMy\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\nbelief is that ultimately it was not money that made the difference. It \nwas the debate and the public dialog and the capacity of our fellow \ncitizens to learn and understand where we stood on the issues, what we \nbelieved, what we had done or had not done and what we wanted to \nachieve on their behalf.\n  And so I believe there is a better standard, and I believe there is \nsomething that we can do that can be regulated here, that puts both \ncandidates on an even keel but does not commit our entire system to a \nperpetual money chase and to the perpetual and increasingly corrosive \nperception that this system is up for grabs for the money which hurts \nevery single one of us.\n  It is my hope, in the course of the next days, as we debate this, \nthat we will have an opportunity to really vote on substantive \namendments, and that we can find the common ground for compromise.\n  I have just a couple of quick comments. I know the Senator from \nMissouri wants to speak.\n  I understand some of the fears that colleagues have on the other \nside. As I said earlier, I think, in my judgment, if we look at this \nfairly we ought to be able to find ways to address some of those fears. \nBut in the end, notwithstanding some of the constitutional arguments \nmade and notwithstanding some of the opposition that is grounded in \nsort of how the politics are played, it seems to me there are some \npeople who just don't want to give up the money, who like the money, \nwho recognize the advantage they have because of the money and who are \nwilling to place the entire relationship of our Government and our \ncitizens in jeopardy as a consequence of the advantage that money gives \nthem.\n  I hope, over the course of the next days, the American people will \njoin this debate. Americans must make it clear that they want this \nchange now. It is on the floor. If they are adequately forceful in \nletting their Senators know that this is something that does matter, I \nbelieve it can have an impact and ultimately make a difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to \nexpress myself regarding a challenge which faces the United States of \nAmerica. It is the challenge of making sure that our political system \noperates to allow the real representatives of the people, \nrepresentatives who will express the view and the will of the people, \nto inhabit the positions of responsibility in Government.\n  The American people, I think, are convinced that the current \npolitical system is flawed, and I believe they are right. But I do not \nbelieve that the answer is some sort of broad campaign finance \nlegislation that restricts core political speech; or even that says we \nwill penalize people who are wealthy if they want to spend their own \nmoney so only the people who are even more wealthy can pay both the \npenalty and finance their campaign. I believe the focus should be on \nenforcing existing laws, not creating new ones. This administration's \nconcerted policy of selling access to the White House and using any and \nall means to raise money is reprehensible. As a matter of fact, I think \nit is illegal. And the answer to such law breaking is law enforcement, \nnot law proliferation.\n  No doubt the administration's disregard for the law has contributed \nto public discontent. But at a deeper level, I believe that the \nsentiment that the system is broken stems from the fact that elected \nrepresentatives of the people are out of touch with the people on all \nmanner of important issues. I am reminded of Federalist Paper No. 57 in \nwhich James Madison emphasized that legislators must be given ``a \nhabitual recollection of their dependence on the people.''\n  The best way to solve the problems we face, in my judgment, and to \nprovide the much-needed ``recollection of [our] dependence on the \npeople,'' is not through making it impossible for people to express \nthemselves, not by limiting what people can say, not by calling our \nopponents special interests. It is, though, by doing something that \nAmericans have found to be a workable solution all across this country, \nand they have embraced it from the very highest office in the land to \nthe very lowest office in the land. It is the concept of term limits. \nTerm limits will provide true reform.\n  I believe that incumbency is the real problem in our system. \nIncumbency is, and always has been, the single greatest perk in \npolitics. It is the single greatest obstacle to true political reform. \nIt is the way in which people obscure the view of the political \nuniverse by inhabiting the podium themselves, and the challenger does \nnot have a chance. Committee assignments translate into campaign \ncontributions; bills mean big bucks; and over and over again, no matter \nhow you structure it, no matter what you say about it, the incumbent \ncontinues to win.\n\n  People who have been on this floor throughout the debate so far as it \nrelates to the so-called campaign finance reform talked about the fact \nthat sometimes incumbents are outspent, sometimes they are not. But if \nyou look at the data, the data are that in 90 percent of the cases--\nmore than 90 percent of the cases in the Congress--incumbents win.\n  The value of incumbency is as strong as ever and, in my judgment, \nafter witnessing what happens when you have campaign reform, you almost \ninevitably elevate the value of incumbency.\n  One of the speakers who spoke not long ago here on the floor \nindicated he wanted to limit the amount of money that would be spent in \na campaign. He would have done so voluntarily. Well, of course. People \nwho have 100 percent name recognition will always want to limit the \namount of money that is spent. Hershey's doesn't need to advertise that \nit sells chocolate. It is the new company that needs to advertise. \nKleenex doesn't need to advertise that it sells tissues. It is the new \none that does. And the incumbents will always want to put limits on \nchallengers. Because whenever you limit what someone can say about you, \nand you are an incumbent, you have the only access to the marketplace. \nYou have the only access to the podium. It is no revelation to find \nthat those who inhabit public office want to keep the expenditures \ndown. They don't want competition to be able to talk about what they \nhave done or how they have performed, or to compete with them for a \nposition in the marketplace. They don't want the competition to be able \nto walk in and say, ``We can do a better job.''\n  We have watched it over and over again. In the 1996 congressional \nelections, which were heralded as highly competitive, here is the data: \n94 percent of all Members who sought reelection were returned to \nWashington. Incumbency remains the biggest perk of all. The best way to \nget reelected is to be elected and then to stay here. And if you have a \nchance once you are here, vote for campaign reform, which makes it \nharder and harder for anyone else to challenge your message or the \ninformation you send out under your frank on the letter that you don't \nhave to pay postage on, financed by the Government.\n  What competition there was, in 1996, came as a result of voluntary \ndepartures, not any weakening of the power of incumbency. Term limits, \nin my judgment, are a tried and tested reform. I happen to be a person \nupon whom term limits have operated. I was the Governor of my State. \nIt's an awful good job being Governor. If anybody ever offers you the \nchance to be Governor, take it. I know a number of you in the Senate \nhave previously been Governors. They are such good jobs that people \nwould struggle to keep those jobs.\n  Sometimes jobs are so good that people will do illegal things to keep \nthem. I won't cast any specific aspersions, but we saw an awful lot of \nactivity in the national election in 1996, where people were apparently \nwilling to have dealings with some pretty shady characters, even folks \nfrom overseas, even overseas governments, in an effort to keep jobs.\n  It seems to me one of the things we ought to do is to say to people: \nThese jobs don't belong to you. They belong to the people of this \ncountry. We ought to level the playing field, occasionally, and make it \npossible for people to come in. If we are really interested in offering \nthe opportunity to new individuals and to people who have not \ntraditionally had access to power--for example, minorities and women--\nwe ought to have term limits. Term limits will open the door and we \nwill find out\n\n[[Page S10018]]\n\nsomething important about the American people, and it is this: The \nAmerican people are capable.\n  There is kind of a myth around here that the Senate is an exclusive \nclub of 100 people; somehow 100 people who are exclusively endowed with \nthe capacity to run the U.S. Senate and our country. It is the idea \nthat we are the only smart ones who could get this job done. That is \nprobably as close to coming to real humor as we get in this body; it is \nlaughable. The American pool of talent is not shallow. It is deep. \nThere are millions of people in this country--yes, there are millions \nwho could do the kind of job that is necessary to run America. That is \nthe virtue of a democracy. The virtue of a democracy isn't that you get \na few people at top and you keep them there to impose their will on the \ncountry. The virtue of a democracy is that the will of the people is \nimposed on those who govern. We are not here to impose our will on \nthem. We are here to reflect the will of the people.\n\n  I don't think making sure we can stay here forever and retire here, \nor be carried out feet first, is what this country is all about. Let's \ntry what has already happened in a number of other settings \npolitically. Mr. President, 41 Governors are subject to term limits. \nWhy? Because the people want a fair system. They want public officials \nwho are reminded constantly of their responsibility to the people--20 \nState legislatures have term limits, countless State and local \nofficials nationwide; the President, since 1951, has been term limited. \nAs a result, term limits are enormously popular.\n  People know they work. This is not a proposed sort of reform about \nwhich people know nothing. This is a proposed reform with which people \nare intimately familiar. They have seen it work in 40-plus States for \nGovernor. They have seen it work in their city councils, they have seen \nit work in the Presidency of the United States. They think ``give \nsomeone else a chance'' is a good idea, and so do I.\n  In Maine, 64 percent of the public voted in favor of term limits. In \nmy home State of Missouri, voters have supported every term limits \nproposal ever placed on the ballot, by majorities as high as 2 to 1. In \nCalifornia, 63 percent of the people voted for term limits. In Florida, \nterm limits passed by better than a three-fourths majority. Even most \nincumbents do not win by these margins, and rightly so. Most incumbents \ndon't reflect the will of the people as dramatically as term limits do. \nTerm limits mean no more politics as usual.\n  What do I mean by that? It is just this simple. A think tank known as \nthe Cato Institute issued a study that compared the voting behavior of \nrecently elected Members, those who have just come from the people, and \ncompared it with long-serving Members who have been ensconced as \nincumbents. They concluded that term limits would have made an enormous \ndifference. Here is what it said. The study concluded that, recently \nelected Members exercise greater fiscal restraint--were more careful \nwith the public's money--and were more responsive to voters. Why am I \nnot surprised? Those findings were confirmed by a study of the National \nTaxpayers' Union.\n  Specifically, the Cato study found that based on the voting patterns \nof recently elected Members, a term-limited Congress would have \ndefeated the tax increases of both President Bush and President \nClinton, and would overwhelmingly have supported the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. No wonder people want term limits as a \nway of restoring confidence in government, because it would do what we \nreally need to have done, and that is that we need to make sure that \nthe will of the people is what is reflected here.\n  You know, low-cost elections are not the ultimate objective. The \nultimate objective is that the will of the people should be the supreme \nlaw of this land. Above all else, term limits serve the much-need \nfunction of providing legislators with this awareness that they need to \nhave, according to Madison in the Federalist Papers, ``a recollection \nof their dependence on the people.''\n  Term limits provide a reminder that the power of legislators comes \nfrom the people, and that it is no hardship to return to live as one of \nthe people. As a matter of fact, it would be a condition to be imposed \non everyone, were we to embrace term limits.\n  Experience has proven that we do not need a professional legislature. \nIt has been a professional Congress, on the other hand, that has \nbrought us such successes as the House bank, the midnight pay raises, \nand the savings and loan debacle.\n  What is wrong with the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform \nproposal? I will say this, it will make matters worse by strengthening \nincumbents.\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal, scaled down or not, is an incumbent \nprotection proposal masquerading as reform. This should not come as a \nsurprise to us, because it is certainly no surprise to the American \npeople. Laws written by incumbents in Washington cannot realistically \nbe expected to have any effect other than to entrench the incumbents in \nWashington.\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal does nothing to address the problem of \nincumbency. Indeed, it makes it worse. The proposal would actually \nstrengthen incumbents by regulating the one route by which challengers \ncan hope to offset the advantages of incumbency, and that is free and \nopen discussion of the issues. No matter how you slice it, McCain-\nFeingold is a restriction on the ability of people to discuss public \nissues, some of which could be substantial embarrassments to \nincumbents.\n  I think it is fine to restrict the politicians, but I am not in favor \nof restricting the people. Perhaps that is the difference between these \ntwo proposals. McCain-Feingold would restrict the people in their \nability to speak. Term limits would restrict the politicians in their \nability to perpetuate themselves in office.\n  The trappings of office provide an incumbent with a highly visible \nlectern. You can get to the podium easily if you are in the Senate or \nthe House, and you can address the voters. The incumbent's voice can be \neasily amplified from this position of power to drown out all others. \nAny proposal that limits the ability of challengers and their \nsupporters to present a different vision--whenever you say that the guy \non the outside can't speak clearly, can't speak effectively, can't \nspeak loudly, can't compete with the guy on the inside--impoverishes \nthe very foundation of America, which is public debate. You exacerbate \nthe problems that exist within the system that we have, and that is \nthat incumbents are already too strong. They should be limited.\n  We limit the President. We limit Governors. We limit members of the \nhouses and senates of many States. We limit city councils. We limit \nterms in the PTA. We ought to limit terms in the U.S. Congress. Let's \nput limits on the politicians, not limits on the people. Let's limit \nthe perpetual service of politicians, not the political activity of our \ncitizens.\n  Nothing--nothing--is more threatening to an incumbent than an \ninformed individual who votes on the basis of principle rather than on \nthe basis of personality. What good is an incumbent's name recognition \nwith voters who want to focus first and foremost on the issues? And \nwhat does the proposal do? This proposal would limit the ability of \npeople to express themselves and spend money to talk about issues. Of \ncourse, if it is all just down to name recognition, I bet there are a \nlot of incumbents who would like a proposal that would just eliminate \nthe ability of people to talk about issues.\n  Cutting back on issue advocacy limits the ability of voters to inform \nthemselves and to discuss the issues. Here we have a proposal that is \ngoing to cut down on the ability to form groups, to feel free about \nbeing involved in those groups, cut down on the ability of people to \nmake contributions to those groups, cut down on the ability of those \ngroups to discuss the issues.\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal is not just bad policy, though; it is, \nin my judgment, unconstitutional. Proponents of campaign finance reform \ntalk in terms of reforming the campaign finance system because they are \nafraid to say what they are really advocating. What they are really \nadvocating is the banning of political speech. I know everybody gets \ntired of political speeches, and we all make our jokes about political \nspeech, but there is nothing closer to the heart of liberty\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\nitself, there is nothing closer to the core of what it means to be free \npeople than to have free, uninhibited, unbridled capacity in the \nculture and among its citizens to speak politically. Political speech \nis noble. It is the opportunity to put feet to freedom, to actually \nmake a difference.\n  In a world in which it costs money to reach voters, if you limit \nspending, you are going to limit the ability of people to speak. It is \nthat simple. Oh, we limited spending before, and what did it do? It \nmeant that the nonincumbent had a tough time, and it also meant that \npeople who were very, very wealthy could find their way into the U.S. \nSenate and House of Representatives. I submit to you that we have our \nshare of very, very wealthy people here. Of course, we know that there \nis no way ultimately to limit what a person spends out of his or her \nown pocket because the Constitution has been so interpreted.\n\n  So all we do when we limit everyone else is to say we want the \nwealthy to have more and more advantage as they singularly and uniquely \ncan approach the podium and be heard in a society which ought to hear \nthe voice of every man and every woman based on merit rather than based \non their own personal wealth.\n  These proposed limits on speech are flatly unconstitutional. The \nSupreme Court said as much 20 years ago in Buckley versus Valeo. The \ntext of the first amendment has not changed and cannot be changed in \nthis Chamber.\n  The scaled down version of McCain-Feingold still violates the first \namendment, in my judgment. The only thing truly scaled down by this new \nversion of the legislation is the people's right to free speech. The \npeople's right is scaled down, their right to speak freely, to express \nthemselves, those on the outside to challenge those of us on the \ninside. It is compressed. I sometimes wonder why I wouldn't want to \nstop people from being critical of me. But you know, I think we ought \nto be above and beyond our own personal interests here. We ought to be \ntalking about the public interests, not the personal or political \ninterests of incumbents.\n  Specifically, the law attempts to limit the ability of groups to \nassociate a candidate with his record on issues that matter most to the \ngroup. Now wait a second. The law attempts to limit the ability of \ngroups to associate a candidate with his record. I can understand how \nthere would be a lot of folks in this Chamber who would not like for \ngroups of people to know what they have done or to be able to tie a \ncandidate for reelection with his record.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield just for a short observation on \nthis very point?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Go ahead.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, the Senator from Missouri is absolutely \ncorrect. It would give the Federal Election Commission new powers to go \nto court to seek an injunction on the allegation of a ``substantial \nlikelihood that a violation is about to occur.''\n  In other words, the point the Senator from Missouri is making, the \nFEC would be going to court to get an injunction to shut people up so \nthey couldn't criticize our records.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for his comment. It is a chilling \ncomment to think that the FEC, related to the Congress, could intervene \nto ask a court to stop someone from criticizing the Congress. It makes \nyou wonder whether or not this is not a bill to transport us all to \nsome regime in some other land. The soil of America would find such \nactivity to be so repugnant that you would think it might cause an \nearthquake the dimensions of which have never before been understood.\n  America stands for something profoundly different. America stands for \nsomething. And it says that when you vote for something here, you \nshould have to stand and answer to the people and you shouldn't be \nprotected by an election committee or some campaign finance reform \nwhich would keep you from being charged with having voted as you did, \nwhich would keep the people from holding you responsible. God forbid \nthe day in America when someone is free to vote here and not be \nresponsible for that vote and can call upon some part of Government to \nprotect himself or herself from having to respond to the people and \nexplain the vote. Such an endeavor, as pointed out by the Senator from \nKentucky, is flatly unconstitutional, and it is a shocking outrage to \nthe conscience of freedom-loving Americans.\n  Incumbents enjoy the ability to trumpet the favorable aspects of \ntheir record through franked mail. They enjoy high name recognition. We \nget to stand on the floor of the Senate, and C-SPAN proclaims our \nmessage. We speak it ourselves. And so-called campaign finance reform, \nis to come in and deprive our competitors from the opportunity to speak \ntheir message. I can't believe that a nation based on competition would \nwant to yield the potential for that competition.\n\n  It certainly does not cure the bill's unconstitutionality that it \nrestricts issue advocacy only during the weeks leading up to the \nelection. Those happen to be the weeks that are relevant. The \nsuggestion is that, well, we are going to allow people to do issue \nadvocacy but not right before the election, so we will only forbid it \nwhen it really counts.\n  The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution is not something to be \ntaken lightly. Free speech, political speech, is not something to be \ntaken lightly, not something to be tampered with, not something to say, \n``Well, we'll allow you to have free speech so long as it doesn't \nmatter, but when it gets to be important, when it is time for that \nspeech, you lose it.'' Well, I see the hands of time are running out \nand you all are being victimized again by another so-called short \nSenate speech which is going rather long.\n  I want you to know that I do not believe this so-called campaign \nfinance reform is real reform. I believe that this is the kind of thing \nthat would impair our ability to have the kind of political dialog and \ndebate that is fundamental and necessary, and I intend to propose as a \nsubstitute to this, term limits, which are a real reform. They have \nbeen tried and tested. They are no pig in a poke.\n  Since 1961, the Presidency of the United States has been term \nlimited; 41 States across America have term limits for Governors, for \nState legislators in a number of States, city councils, as I indicated, \nclubs, PTAs. People know what term limits can do. They know about the \nneed to rotate fresh ideas and people close to the constituency through \npublic office. Term limits provide true reform; campaign finance \nprovides the illusion of reform.\n  I plan to offer term limits as a substitute for the McCain-Feingold \nversion of campaign finance reform. I want to force a vote on true \npolitical reform, not illusory reform that will be struck down by the \ncourts.\n  There is just one clear answer as far I am concerned. The answer is \nto limit the politicians, not to limit the citizens. Limit terms, not \nspeech. A viable and vigorous political debate in this country is \nessential to the survival of this democracy. We know we can do with a \nnew set of politicians in office. As a matter of fact, in many offices \nacross this Nation, we have seen that when we rotate people through \nthose offices, we get better service. No wonder people endorse term \nlimits. We should limit politicians, not speech.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments and discuss some of \nthe points raised by my colleagues today on the subject of campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Proponents of campaign finance reform have expressed concern over the \ncost of Federal election campaigns. One Senator stated that the cost of \ncampaigns has increased 73 percent over the last 10 to 20 years. \nHowever, the cost of most things in life have also increased. For \nexample, the Federal Government has grown so much over the last three \nor four decades that it spreads out and touches nearly part of our \nlives. In fact, there was a study which found that the Government \ninvolves itself in about 60 percent of everything we do today.\n  The Federal Government's intrusion in the lives of my constituents \nhas led many of them to either become involved in campaigns or travel \nto Washington to have their voices heard about the role of the \nGovernment in their lives. Congress should not suppress the\n\n[[Page S10020]]\n\nability of Americans to have their voices heard.\n  If we go back to the level of Government that we had in 1930, we \nwould not see the need for the number of people who have to travel out \nhere day after day, year after year to get their points across, to let \nthe Government know how certain legislation is going to affect them, \ngood or bad.\n  We often hear the phrase, ``The system is broken.'' The average \ncampaign today costs about $4.5 million on average and the cost should \nbe debated. However, the cost of political campaigns is still less, as \nwe heard many times, than we spend every year on advertising for potato \nchips, yogurt, or toothpaste.\n  So are the campaigns getting out of hand in the amount of money we \nspend? No. In fact, there are those who argue that we need to have more \nAmericans involved in politics to have their voices heard. That is what \nmakes a great democracy. The more involved you can get in what the \nGovernment does, the more that Government is going to respond to your \nneeds and the needs of the country.\n  Mr. President, the system is broken. It is a club for millionaires or \ncould become a club for millionaires. If we continue to impose new \nrestrictions, that is exactly what would happen. It would only be \nmillionaires who would be able to run for office. So, in other words, \nwe would cut off the average American's chance of ever running or \nholding any public office, to come and bring concerns to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, or even in the State \nhouses.\n  I have also heard people say that ``Fundraisers used to be held \naround Senate schedules. Now it's just the opposite, that the Senate \nschedules are held around fundraisers.''\n  That isn't true in my office. We try to spend the vast majority of \nour time doing the work that we were sent here to do. Yes, we are going \nto face a campaign; yes, we are going to have to raise money, but we \nare sure not going to make the work that we were elected to do a lesser \npriority. I do not believe most of our colleagues have done that. But \nthat is one of the charges issued today.\n  If we increase the limits on the ability to raise X amount of dollars \nor we are required to accept smaller contributions, we will discourage \nmany individuals who would like to campaign and serve in Congress. \nThese individuals will have to spend more time trying to raise money \nthan doing the job that they were elected to do. It gets to be a money \nchase, as we have heard here many times today.\n  Each election, however, is like a basic ad campaign. Every candidate \nneeds to communicate a message. Every candidate needs to be able to go \nout and talk to the voters to tell them what he supports, what his \nagenda will be, how he is going to vote on the important issues.\n  If he does not have a chance or the opportunity to communicate his \nview to the voters, how are they going to know what this candidate \nrepresents? How are they going to know what to expect from him, and how \nare they going to make a decision between candidate A and candidate B?\n  When you look at costs--I believe it was said earlier, too, today it \nis about $1.2 million to buy a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl. Now, \nwe are not going to advertise during the Super Bowl. But if you go into \nan average television market across the country, an average spot for 30 \nseconds today is going to cost you over $3,000. Now, again, that is a \nlot of money, but you are going to have to run a decent campaign again \nto deliver your message.\n  We need to inform our voters. If we cannot, as candidates cannot tell \nour voters how we are going to vote, what our values are, what we are \ngoing to stand up for, how we are going to vote on special issues, you \ncan bet somebody is going to tell them that. But they are not going to \ntell it probably the way you would like. In other words, we are going \nto have opponents out there. You are going to have special interest \ngroups, independent expenditures, or, more terrifying, you are going to \nleave it up to the media, you are going to allow the media to frame \nthis debate.\n  I do not want a newspaper or TV station, liberal or conservative, to \nbe out there telling the voters what they think my position is or to \nframe my campaign in their words. As we know, I have views about how a \nlot of these stories and editorials are written. So if we leave it up \nto the editorial pages of our newspapers, or television reports and \nother stories, I do not think they are going to get the accurate \npicture of the campaigns or the candidates involved. A truly informed \nelectrorate will result from preserving the free speech of people to \nbecome involved in these campaigns and the right of candidates to \ncommunicate their agenda.\n  What we are hearing today in the Senate is to put on more limits. \n``The system is broken.'' We hear that again. ``The public is \ncynical.'' I do not think they are cynical about honest campaigns. But \nthey are from the headlines of those who have broken campaign laws. \nThat is what you should be cynical about.\n  We heard Senator Kerry here just a few minutes ago talking about his \nlast campaign, spending in the neighborhood of about $12 million. That \nwas a tough race. That is a lot of money. But have we heard any charges \nof illegalities involved in the race? No. So did the amount of money \ncorrupt the race? Evidently not.\n  So it isn't the money. But it is real chutzpah--if you know what the \nterm is; that is really ``in your face''--when we have those who are \nout there calling the loudest for campaign finance reform saying that \nit could even involve a special session of Congress. I would call that \n``a good defense being a good offense.'' In other words, let us deflect \nthe real problem of the issue today, and that is over the problems of \npast campaigns, those who have broken the laws but yet are calling for \nnew laws to be implemented. In other words, the chutzpah is similar to \na saying in this morning's paper, ``It's like the person who killed his \nparents and then argued for mercy from the courts because he was an \norphan.'' ``Stop me from killing again. Do not allow me to go out and \nbreak these laws again. Let's have new laws on the books,'' just like \nsomehow new laws are going to prevent the intent of breaking them.\n\n  There has been discussion about independent expenditures and \nestablishing new limits. But, again, we cannot muzzle everybody. We are \ngoing to allow the unions to continue spending and collecting millions \nof dollars. No attempts really to rein in that abuse. So in other \nwords, when it comes to reforms, it is OK to reform only if it limits \nmy opponents more than it would limit me. Now, that would be good \nreform, but, again, in whose eyes? If we cannot do across-the-board \nreform, then no reform is good reform.\n  A good defense is a good offense, again, to divert attention from the \nproblems at hand. A lot of people are looking at hearings going on in \nCongress this year, and you hear the rhetoric or the spin that this is \nall about campaign finance reform.\n  This is about those who broke existing laws, who abused the laws in \nthe last campaign. That is what these hearings are supposed to flush \nout and look at, not by putting new limits on what we can say, who can \nsay it, when we can say it. Who is going to determine that? Who is \ngoing to become a new censor?\n  What that would do is take away more of your rights as individuals to \nparticipate in any campaign, whether Democrat, Republican, independent, \nwhatever it might be. New limits would only mean average Americans \nwould have new constraints placed on how they could become involved in \nthe political process. In this instance, groups, individuals and \ncandidates would be muzzled in a free country.\n  Again, who would be out there talking? Again, ``The system is \nbroken.'' Their answer, ``Put more controls on free speech.'' But in \norder to do that, it means bigger Government. ``More Government is the \nanswer. If we can only put a few more controls, put a few more limits, \nspend a few more dollars somewhere else, somehow that is going to fix \nthe system.''\n  The system may need some reforms. It may need some tinkering. It may \nneed some changes. But I think overall our system is not broken. Have \nlaws been broken? Has the system been abused? Yes, it has. That is \nexactly what the Thompson hearings have been trying to find out. But \nthey have been blunted by those who have been accused and, yes, even \ncharged with\n\n[[Page S10021]]\n\nbreaking those very laws. They say, ``Well, if we did, we're sorry, but \nwe need to push for new laws. We need new changes.''\n  If there are those in Congress or any place else who would sell their \nintegrity for a $2,000 contribution rather than representing the \nmillions of people back home--by the way, an individual contribution is \nsomewhere around the neighborhood of $25 per contribution--if there are \nindividuals who would do that, they would be easily found out. If they \nare going to vote that way or betray the trust back home, they are \ngoing to be found out. If they are found out, they should be thrown \nout.\n  But I believe nearly all, if not all, Members in this body are very \nhonorable men and women who work very hard to try to serve their \nconstituents back home, Republicans and Democrats, having the best \ninterests of their constituents back home at heart. They try do that \nwith a lot of honesty.\n  But what are Americans to think if they hear day after day that \ncampaigns, that Congress, is corrupt, that it is for sale to the \nhighest bidder? Again, if there are such individuals, they will be \nfound out and they will be thrown out. But I believe the public concern \nof campaigns in a large part is not because of the system itself but \nbecause of those who have abused the system, those who have broken the \nlaws, and they remain unpunished.\n  New laws, I do not believe, will cure the intent of those who want to \nbreak them. So I say, let us open the system, let us have full \ndisclosure--Who contributed to the campaigns? How much did they \ncontribute? --so that the public can judge who is supported by whom, \nwhich groups are involved, what are the issues at stake.\n\n  Let us not put the Federal Government in control. Isn't public \ninvolvement better than having censorship by the Federal Government? \nYou know, most people have a real concern today about big Government. A \nlot of people say they do not think a bloated bureaucracy can provide \nthe best service today. They have sent many of us here to Washington \nwith the charge of streamlining and downsizing the Federal Government \nthat they believe is out of hand, unwieldy, spending too much money.\n  Is the way to fix the campaign finance system by putting more control \nof the system into the hands of the Federal Government, to give them \nmore control, more power, and, yes, even censorship on what you can \nsay, when you can say it? Is it negative? Is it positive? Who is going \nto decide all of that?\n  I believe Americans as a whole want the ability to participate and to \nparticipate in the elections as they choose.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me thank my colleague from Minnesota for a fine \ncontribution to this very important debate and assure him I agree with \nhis views virtually 100 percent. An outstanding contribution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, at the outset for my participation in this debate I \ncongratulate Senator Feingold and Senator McCain for their months of \neffort in constructing a comprehensive program to deal with the problem \nof campaign finance and for bringing the Nation and the Senate to this \nmoment of debate, but also Senator Daschle, whose tireless efforts have \nalso brought us to this moment of judgment, and Senator Lott for \nscheduling this debate.\n  I, also, in listening to this morning's discussion, want to \ncompliment Senator McConnell. For, while I do not share his ultimate \njudgments on the McCain-Feingold bill, he reminds us of an important \nprinciple in the debate. And that is, there may be problems in how we \nfinance our campaigns, the problems of money in American politics, but \nSenator McConnell reminds us there are real constitutional limitations \nin how we approach this issue and that ultimately the Nation does not \nsuffer from too much political discussion or too much debate among \ncandidates but too little. So while I differ with his ultimate \njudgment, I think the Senate is well served by his limitations in how \nwe approach this question.\n  Mr. President, for my own part, I enter this debate with a reminder \nto all of my colleagues that there is nothing short of the credibility \nof our entire form of Government that is at issue. The world's oldest \nconstitutional democracy, founded on the principle of majority rule, is \nnow threatened by the fact that only a minority of Americans \nparticipate. It is therefore a question of our entire credibility of \ngovernance. The United States has experienced for more than a \ngeneration the continuing relentless decline in voter participation.\n  In the last elections in 1996, 49 percent of the American people \nparticipated in choosing the leadership of the Federal Government. It \nis, Mr. President, a serious issue. For a long time the leaders of the \nU.S. Government have found reasons to excuse the fact that most \nAmericans do not participate in this form of Government, that the \nUnited States alone among the great democracies may now be governed by \nthe judgments of a minority of our people alone.\n  I have heard all of these debates. First, we convinced ourselves that \nit was not convenient for most Americans to participate in our \nelections. So we enacted postcard registration to make it simpler. But \nstill the American people did not come.\n\n  Then we convinced ourselves it was because people were not aware of \nthe timing of elections. So through public service announcements and \nthen the hiring of campaign workers, we filled the airwaves, we called \npeople on the phone, we visited their homes to remind them, and still \nthey did not come.\n  On more than a few occasions we appealed to people's patriotism to \nparticipate in the electoral system. And after all these efforts, most \nAmericans are still not participating.\n  Perhaps, Mr. President, there is another reason, painful to admit, \nbut unmistakable: The majority of Americans who are not participating \nin Federal elections did not forget to vote, it wasn't inconvenient to \nvote; but by their failure to participate they were expressing \nthemselves. Not participating in an American election is a means of \nexpression. It is a vote of no confidence, not simply in the candidates \nor the political parties, but in the process itself.\n  In truth, there are myriad reasons. The sterility of the debate, \nperhaps because people perceive no real choices, no relevancy of the \npolitical discussion to their own lives. Perhaps it is because the \ndecline in the quality of journalism itself, where character \nassassinations become a substitute for discussion of real issues. Or \nperhaps most important, most insidious, it is how we are financing our \ncampaigns. The sense of most Americans that voting is not a determinant \nof a decision, where money has become the principal determinant of the \noutcome of struggles for political power.\n  There is perhaps no better witness for this argument than one Roger \nTamraz, who appeared before the Governmental Affairs Committee only \nlast week. By his own words he had come to the conclusion that though \nan American citizen, he did not vote in Federal elections because \ncontributing $300,000 was a better and more effective means of \nparticipating than ever casting a vote for a candidate of his choice.\n  Mr. President, I will admit that I rise on the floor of the Senate \ntoday as an advocate of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill by a \ncircuitous route. Like many of my colleagues, I have feared campaign \nfinance reform because of the threat of Government regulation of \npolitical speech. I have believed that free, fair and open competition \namong the political parties was the best means to assure that all \nparties were heard and that the American people ultimately ruled by \nmajority will.\n\n  I can no longer, after the expense of the 1996 election and my own \ninvolvement in the U.S. Senate campaign in my own State of New Jersey, \nremain with that conclusion. The campaign reform bills of 1974 and \ntheir revision in subsequent years are no longer working. There is no \ngoverning electoral authority in the Federal statutes.\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\n  Through a series of decisions by the Federal courts, the practical \nexpense of the political parties, the governing statutes are being \nevaded, violated, or are simply irrelevant. There is no governing \nauthority in this country today for the financing of Federal campaigns. \nWhile this Congress has addressed the issue innumerable times, we have \nmade no progress. In a decade, this Senator has voted on 113 occasions \nto reform campaign finance and come to no conclusions. The Senate has \nconsidered 321 pieces of financial reform legislation, heard 3,361 \nspeeches, and filled 6,742 pages of the Congressional Record with \ndebate. It cannot go on. We are at a genuine critical point in the \npolitical history of this country.\n  Some would argue that there are some modifications that can be \nenacted without fundamental reform, and we will meet our responsibility \nto improve the process, declare success and simply move on to another \nFederal election in 1998. I am of a decidedly different view. I believe \nit would be worse to deal with this problem in the margins and declare \nthat we have done much than to deal with this properly and fail and at \nleast be honest with the American people that the problem exists. That \nis the choice because many, I will predict a majority, of the U.S. \nSenate, will decide that we can ban the use of soft money in the \npolitical process, do nothing about independent expenditures, express \nadvocacy, the cost of television time, overall campaign spending, and \nstill declare success.\n\n  To me, Mr. President, that will be the worst outcome because this \nproblem is not only serious, it is complex, and goes to every aspect of \nthe campaign finance system.\n  First is the problem of controlling express advocacy groups. There is \na real threat that the national political system is evolving into a \ndebate where special interest groups will argue over the heads of the \nAmerican people in multimillion-dollar campaigns in which neither \ncandidates nor political parties are able to participate. Single-issue \nadvocacy groups with virtually unlimited funding, distorting the \nissues, steering the campaigns, with candidates who are unable or \nwithout the resources to even participate. An American political system \nwith campaigns by surrogates.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill, by at least attempting to limit the ability \nof these organizations to distort candidate's positions or enter into \nthe debates as their surrogates, addresses this issue. But without this \nprovision, the overall legislation would be meaningless, and indeed in \nmy judgment, counterproductive.\n  There is, of course, the issue of foreign money where not only must \nthe law be clear, but the penalties high, where people who seek to \nparticipate in our system but do not share our nationality. There is \nthe obvious problem of soft money, unregulated, undeclared, unknown \nparticipants in the financing of Federal campaigns who opened a door \nwhich has now become a monstrous window through which millions of \ndollars flow, distorting the very purpose of campaign finance \ndisclosure or control.\n\n  There is the effort at the prompt disclosure of campaign \ncontributions so that every American makes their own judgment about who \nis contributing, how much, what they represent, and whether they can \nthen identify with a candidate receiving those contributions. They are \nall a part of the McCain-Feingold legislation, each critical, but each \nan integral part that if eliminated from the legislation weakens the \nwhole effort at reform.\n  But then finally there is one aspect of the McCain-Feingold bill that \nhas not survived to this debate on the floor of the Senate, but in my \njudgment must be added before genuine reform has been achieved and this \nSenate concludes this debate. It is the issue of reducing the cost of \ntelevision advertising. Behind the spiral of rising campaign costs is \nthe issue of the cost of television advertising. There is no increased \ncost in American campaigning without the cost of television \nadvertising. They are one and the same--inescapable in the conclusion. \nThe cost of campaigns have increased 72 percent in the last 6 years \nalone. That is overwhelmingly driven by network television. In my own \ncampaign for the U.S. Senate last year, 84 percent of all the money \nraised went to television advertising.\n  An amendment will be offered to this legislation, appropriately \ncalled the challengers' amendment, because largely incumbents will \nalways raise the funds necessary to feed the television networks but \nchallengers cannot. Unless and until we reduce the cost of television \nadvertising, this becomes a process open to incumbents or \nmultimillionaires only. The average American will never be able to \nparticipate in this process and will be excluded at the Senate door.\n\n  But make no mistake, the vote for campaign finance reform is not a \nvote for the McCain-Feingold financial legislation. It is a vote for \nthe challengers' amendment. Consider a process where as in the State of \nNew Jersey the average cost of a television advertisement is $50,000. \nSome single 30-second ads can cost $100,000. What is it that is being \npurchased? The television networks control this time by a public \nlicense. The air time belongs to the American people. It is granted to \nthe television networks by license, for free. They then return to \ncandidates for public office who seek to debate public policy issues, \nto communicate with the American people who own this air time and \ncharge millions upon millions of dollars.\n  Now here I agree with the Senator from Kentucky. The answer is not to \nreduce the amount of time that candidates have on the air to discuss \ntheir issues. It is not to regulate what those candidates communicate \nto the American people.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said less than 1 percent of all the \nadvertising last year in the most expensive political race in American \nhistory was political advertising. In the midst of deciding about the \nAmerican future debating these important critical national questions, \nAmerican people were still hearing more about the sneakers of choice, \nthe best and worst toothpaste, or how it is they should feed their cats \nand dogs. There is not too much political discussion, but it is too \nexpensive. It is wrong.\n  In a proper process, the great corporations that own the television \nnetworks as a means of political responsibility should have come \nforward and offered this time for candidates to debate or reduce the \ncost of advertising to discuss their respective issues, but they have \nnot. They were challenged and they failed. Now it is up to the \nCongress.\n\n  Some would say it is unconstitutional. It is the taking of property \nof the television networks. But indeed we crossed that threshold a long \ntime ago in reducing only marginally the cost of advertising for \ncharities and political debates. The problem is we reduced it only \nmarginally, leaving the cost far, far too high. There is no right of a \ncorporation to own a license. It is a license for air time that belongs \nto the public. It is granted and it is responsible that costs should be \nreduced.\n  Sometimes it is almost unbearable as a Member of the Senate to hear \nthe television networks with their anchors on the evening news berating \nthe political system, challenging the candidates for public office, the \nPresident and the Members of the Senate to do something about campaign \nfinance reform, reduce its cost, reform the process. The problem is the \ncost being charged by the television networks themselves. What are all \nthese fundraisers? What is it we are doing running around the country \nraising money endlessly, from interests where we should never be \nseeking money, spending time that should be spent with citizens \ndebating issues? It is to feed the networks that are demanding this \nmoney. When the challengers amendment we will have a chance to do \nsomething about it, to reduce the costs.\n\n  Mr. President, that comes to a final objective in McCain-Feingold and \nthe whole system of reform. Every American knows that there is a \nproblem of too much money. I have made clear my own belief that there \nis also a problem of too much cost in advertising. But there is one \nother element that drives this reform effort. If most of the problems \nof the American people were represented by those who had money, this \nreform legislation would be much less important because there is more \nthan enough contact between candidates for the U.S. Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives and people who are able to donate and attend \nfundraisers. We see\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\nthousands of Americans at hundreds of fundraisers. There is no lack of \ncommunication or discussion of public policy issues. The problem is \nthat most of the American people who have the most serious problems in \ntheir own lives don't have the money to attend these events. And since \nthey cannot attend these events, they are not being heard and their \nproblems are not getting addressed. They are outside the process.\n  What is driving the need for campaign finance reform, in my judgment, \nis to free the candidates to once again discuss issues, to campaign on \nthe streets of America with people who have no money but do have real \nconcerns.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a debate that it would be difficult to \noverestimate in its importance. The McCain-Feingold legislation is \nabout campaign finance reform, but it is also about something much more \nfundamental. We are debating the integrity of the U.S. Government, \nwhether or not the American people, a majority of whom no longer \nparticipate in this electoral process, can once again identify with the \nnational political debate and at some point in the future return to \nparticipating in this system of government.\n  I do not know how long, if we fail to reform this process, levels of \nparticipation will continue to decline while the Nation maintains \npolitical stability and a belief in this system of government. But I \nknow it cannot go on forever. We may or may not succeed with the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation. Perhaps some will succeed in passing a \nlesser measure dealing in the margins of reform and leaving the larger \nproblem unanswered. If they do so, they do a disservice to the Senate \nand to the country.\n  Mr. President, before this debate has concluded in the coming days \nand weeks, I will return again. But I am grateful for this chance to \nshare a few opening thoughts on what is a critical moment in the life \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey \nleaves, if I might just impose upon him for a few moments. I was \nlistening to his comments and his enthusiasm for the portions of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill that seek to make it more difficult for citizens \nto engage in issue advocacy and to change the rules with regard to \nindependent expenditures.\n\n  I make reference to a letter I received from the American Civil \nLiberties Union earlier this year discussing those two types of citizen \nexpression. Quoting from the letter:\n\n       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after 20 \n     years of campaign finance decisions.\n\n  That is after a whole string of cases, beginning with Buckley.\n\n       First, independent expenditures for ``express electoral \n     advocacy'' by citizens groups about political candidates lie \n     at the very core of the meaning and purpose of the first \n     amendment.\n       Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lies totally \n     outside the permissible area of Government regulation.\n\n  I say to my friend from New Jersey, on what basis does he reach the \nconclusion that there is any chance whatsoever that these portions of \nthe McCain-Feingold, since there is no hint that the courts are ever \ngoing to tamper with express advocacy--there is a whole line of cases, \nthe most recent one about 3 months ago--does my friend from New Jersey \nthink there is going to be some revelation in the courts? Are they \ngoing to rethink 20 years of decisions in this area? Or does he think \nwe ought to just pass, blatantly, unconstitutional legislation \nregardless of what the Supreme Court says?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. In response to the Senator from Kentucky--though it \nis not the thrust of his question--I will return to the major inquiry. \nI will share publicly what I discussed with the Senator previously \nprivately; that is, my concern that if he is correct that the Federal \ncourts will not allow McCain-Feingold, as currently written, to deal \nwith express advocacy or independent expenditures, then we face \na fundamental problem in that express advocacy and independent \nexpenditures would be unregulated while we would be reducing the \nability of the political parties or candidates to express themselves. \nWe would, therefore, be dealing with campaigns by surrogates over the \nheads of the political parties and the candidates.\n\n  In my judgment, that does not constitute reform, and it raises the \nquestion, as I expressed to the Senator privately, whether there should \nbe a severability clause at all in this legislation because, in my \njudgment, if you cannot constitutionally deal with express advocacy and \nindependent expenditures, I, speaking only for myself, do not believe \nthat we can regulate the candidates in the political parties as \nenvisioned by this legislation. That issue remains before the Federal \ncourts.\n  Now, finally, dealing with the Senator's question, it is my own \nbelief that the Constitution can be satisfied, and I hope we can gain \nthe Federal Court's approval, by allowing express advocacy of issues by \npeople who do not name candidates or a campaign in their express \nadvocacy and, hopefully, channel people's interest and finances to the \npolitical parties and the candidates separately. Therefore, every \ncitizen has two routes of involvement--the political parties and a \ncandidate of their choice or express advocacy without advocating an \nindividual candidate independently. But I will concede to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, I believe it is an open constitutional question. There \nis an invitation here to the Federal courts. I simply hope we can get \nan affirmative reaction from the courts. But I do not disagree with the \nSenator from Kentucky; it is an open issue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may regain my time. The Senator \nfrom Washington has been waiting to speak. Mr. President, it is not an \nopen constitutional question; it is a closed constitutional question. \nThere is no chance that the courts are going to allow these kinds of \nrestrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, many of the constitutional questions that \nare debated here today in the context of the validity of this bill have \nalready been debated this year in a more open and more refreshing \nmanner. When those who propose to limit free speech on political issues \nhad the courage to propose an amendment that would restrict the first \namendment right of free speech on political issues, while they were, in \nmy view, entirely wrong, while they proposed a disaster to the most \nfundamental basis of free government, they at least had the \nintellectual integrity and consistency to recognize that what they \nwanted to do was inconsistent with the first amendment as it has \nexisted from the time of the first Congress until this day.\n  Now they produce a bill with two fundamental flaws. In most \nrespects--many at least--it is clearly unconstitutional and, in every \nother respect, it is bad policy. I think I would like to make a few \nremarks about the way in which political debates are conducted in this \ncountry surrounding election campaigns. I will try to deal a little bit \nabout the way the McCain-Feingold bill treats these various \ncommunications. And perhaps I will elicit a few additional remarks from \nmy friend from Kentucky in doing so.\n  In 1974, when the present campaign finance law was passed--with the \nsupport, I may say, of just those people and organizations and \nnewspapers that now find how great a failure that 1974 law was and, \nlike the drunk waking up the morning after with a hangover, prescribed \nthe hair of the dog that bit them--their focus was on candidates, on \nthe source of money for candidates to express their ideas through the \nmass media. In that focus, they prohibited a wide range of sources of \nmoney and greatly limited other sources of money, so that a candidate \nmay not take more than $1,000 per election from an individual, or more \nthan $5,000 from a political action committee, an organization that was \ncreated, in effect, by that 1974 law. So they placed severe limits on \nthe one kind of political debate for which each candidate is totally \nresponsible. No candidate can avoid responsibility for what he or she \nsays in public, in print, or on television. This forum of advocacy is \nnow subject to severe limits as a result of the 1974 law.\n  Now, it is interesting to note that much of the support for the kind \nof bill or the kind of ideas that are reflected in McCain-Feingold, the \nkind of ideas\n\n[[Page S10024]]\n\nthat have just been presented by the Senator from New Jersey, stem from \nthe fact that mass campaigning costs money, the money has to be raised \nby individual candidates, and the candidates don't like to spend the \ntime raising money that the 1974 law requires. So we are told that the \ncandidates ought to be supported by a subsidy from the Federal \nGovernment or a subsidy from the private sector in the form of \nnoncompetitive prices for television advertising.\n\n  Mr. President, I can certainly sympathize with the views of those who \ndo not like raising money for their own candidacy. I couldn't possibly \nclaim that I do myself. But to exactly the extent that it takes \ncandidates too long to do so is a direct result of the reforms of 1974. \nAnd this reform in McCain-Feingold will make that situation far worse \nbecause the limitation on sources for candidates are tightened. So \ncandidates, in order to get their own message out, will have to spend \nmore time raising money.\n  As an incidental, I think it is not at all unhealthy that we who have \nthis rather exalted status as U.S. Senators should be forced to go hat \nin hand to our constituents and to others interested in the political \nprocess and show a little bit of humility and ask for that support. \nMany of the supporters of reform feel that that is somehow demeaning, \nand that the Government ought to come up with the money that they use \nto engage in their candidacies. Personally, Mr. President, I think they \nmight just as well advocate lifetime terms for Senators. Certainly no \none would be subject to pressures from campaign contributors under \nthose circumstances. But the very mention of that process simply shows \nthat an attempt to avoid responsibility is an attempt to avoid \nresponsibility, whether it is called lifetime terms and avoiding \ndemocracy entirely, or whether it simply comes in the guise of saying \nthat the Government ought to pay for these campaigns.\n  In any event, Mr. President, the first defect, though perhaps not an \nunconstitutional defect, of this bill is that it takes the very set of \nrules that have created the demand for more rules for indirect spending \nand makes them worse. It takes the very criticism of the time \ncandidates spend raising money and requires them to spend more time \nmaking money, and does it in the one area in which the candidate can be \ncalled to order, can be held responsible by his or her constituents: \nthat is to say, spending directly by a candidate on his or her own \ncampaign.\n\n  The immediate result of a restriction of this first form of free \nspeech--that on the part of candidates--was to push those who are \nvitally interested in the decisions that we and other candidates across \nthe country make with respect to public policy away from supporting \ncandidates into supporting political parties.\n  Most academics over the course of the last 30 or 40 years have \ndecried the decline of political party discipline and accountability, \nand have said that one of the shortcomings of American democracy is \nthat parties don't mean very much; that they have very little political \ninfluence even over the candidates who are elected using the party \nname, and have called for methods of creating a greater degree of \ncohesion and party responsibility. Yet, when the two major political \nparties have discovered a method of raising money and are advocating \ndirectly or indirectly the election of candidates carrying their name, \nthat very system is now considered by the reformers to be such a \nterrible tragedy as to cause the introduction of a bill that will make \nit practically impossible for either major political party to raise \nsufficient amounts of money, either to call for a certain degree of \nresponsibility on the part of its candidates, or to get its message \nacross to the American people.\n  I think I do agree, I say, Mr. President, to my friend from Kentucky, \nthat that portion of constitutional opinion of the 126 scholars, or \nwhatever the number was that he mentioned, with respect to limiting \ncontributions to political parties, is probably correct. I seriously \ndoubt a form of contribution can be prohibited. But on the basis that \ncontributions to candidates can be limited, contributions to the \nparties can probably be limited. It doesn't make it a desirable course \nof action. It makes it a highly undesirable course of action.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield at this point?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think the Senator from Washington is correct. There \nare simply no cases on the issue of whether the Congress could in \neffect federalize the two national parties; what McCain-Feingold seeks \nto do. Soft money by definition means non-Federal money. Our two great \nnational parties get involved in Governors' races, county \ncommissioners' races, legislators' races, and so on.\n  This bill seeks to basically turn them into Federal parties, and take \naway their ability to participate outside the Federal system.\n  The Senator from Washington is entirely correct. There simply aren't \nany cases on that point because nobody has ever thought that was a good \nidea before.\n  So I think my colleague is correct. Even if maybe some court would \nrule that you could do it, it is not a desirable result.\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer to that from my perspective, as the \nperspective from the Senator from Kentucky is, of course, it is not. Of \ncourse, it is highly undesirable. It will atomize the political system. \nIt will make Members far more free than they have been even in the past \nfrom any loyalty as a party, and thus reduce the ability of a Congress \nor of any other body to reach coherent decisions, but, more importantly \nthan that, will reduce the ability to communicate a coherent set of \npolitical ideas to the people of the United States in connection with \nelection campaigns. That is why it is so tremendously undesirable. Even \nif I am correct that it is constitutional to create such limits, they \ncertainly violate the spirit of the first amendment which is designed \nto create a field in which the widest range of political ideas can be \ncommunicated in the broadest possible fashion.\n\n  However, when we get to the third way in which money can be spent to \ncommunicate political ideas, I find myself in total agreement with the \nSenator from Kentucky. That has to do with direct expenditures on \nadvocating the election or the defeat of candidates by persons \nunconnected with political parties.\n  Before I get to that, we started with the fact that money that is \ngiven to and spent by candidates certainly carries with it a huge \nresponsibility. Candidates cannot avoid responsibility for what their \npolitical ideas are that they express with their moneys they spend on \ntheir own campaigns. They get a degree of protection from their own \npolitical party when it spends money. They can say ``No, that really \nwasn't quite right. I didn't really believe in that attack on my \nopponent.'' It is hard to shed that responsibility completely because \neach candidate has chosen a political party, and its political party's \nname appears beside his or her name on the ballot. But the \nresponsibility of a candidate is only indirect.\n  In other words, the party's advertisements, the party's \ncommunications bluntly can be less responsible than the candidate's own \nexpressions. The candidate has a certain degree of invulnerability from \nany such irresponsibility.\n\n  But, by definition, when another group, or another wealthy \nindividual, decides that the election, or the defeat of a candidate, is \nimportant enough to want to spend a significant amount of money on it \nand engages in that activity without consulting the candidate or the \nparty, that communication beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt is \nprotected by the first amendment--beyond the slightest shadow of a \ndoubt.\n  This complex and Byzantine form of regulation in the present law, \nwhich would be made more complex and more Byzantine by the passage of \nMcCain-Feingold, raises this question of whether or not expenditures \nare actually independent, and creates a bonanza for lawyers and for \naccusations. But it doesn't need to exist in an intelligent system. But \nclearly when those expenditures are independent, they can advocate the \nelection, or the defeat of a candidate, with entire impunity. They are \nprotected by the first amendment. They ought to be protected by the \nfirst amendment. They will continue to be protected until we repeal, or \nmodify, that first amendment, and decide that we ought to choke off \nfree speech on political ideas.\n\n[[Page S10025]]\n\n  Well, obviously, the candidate who benefits from these independent \nexpenditures has absolutely no responsibility for them whatsoever. \nHowever scurrilous or inaccurate they may be, they are not the \ncandidate's fault. They are independent of the candidate. The \norganization of the individual who was presenting them or paying for \nthem and does not appear on the ballot can't effectively be held \nresponsible in a political sense for that form of communication.\n  So, first, in 1974 we forced expenditures from the most responsible \nuse to a less responsible use. Now, if we pass McCain-Feingold, we \nforce them into an entirely irresponsible channel, even when we are \ndealing directly with the election or the defeat of candidates. But, \nMr. President, the real point is we cannot stop the money from being \nspent.\n\n  The decisions made by the Congress are vitally important to people's \nlives, and the people whose lives are affected by them are going to try \nto affect elections for membership in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives. Obviously, they have to have that right in a free \nsociety.\n  Well, then we move on to the fourth method of communicating ideas. \nThat goes to the benefit of this debate under the title of ``issue \nadvocacy.'' Again, any individual, any group, has a total complete \nprotected right to communicate ideas or views about political ideas. \nAgain, these reforms create this totally artificial lawyer-enriching \ndistinction between an independent expenditure on behalf of a candidate \nand issue advocacy, an issue different but a distinction in the real \nworld, but one that suddenly becomes very important when you want to \nget Government involved in all of these ideas.\n  Were the advertisements by the AFL-CIO all through the last election \ncampaign that said, ``Tell Congressman X to stop destroying Medicare'' \nissue advocacy? That is what the AFL-CIO claims. In fact, of course, \nthey were designed to defeat candidate X in the next election.\n  Mr. President, let us be absolutely certain that the AFL-CIO and \nevery other organization has a perfectly totally protected \nconstitutional right to engage in that activity, and to engage in \nindependent expenditures directly at the same time.\n  That is a separate question as to whether or not we ought to require \na labor union, or any other voluntary organization organized primarily \nfor one purpose, to not spend the money of its members on an entirely \ndifferent political purpose without their consent. Clearly, we can \nrequire that consent in any reasonable way which we propose, but once \nthat consent is granted, the constitutional right is absolute.\n\n  Then, fifth, Mr. President--and the Senator from Kentucky outlined \nthis question I thought with great simplicity and clarity and elegance \na couple of hours ago--fifth, of course, we have the newspapers and the \ntelevision and radio stations, the forms of mass communication in this \nsociety which enter into this struggle gleefully, at great length, \ncontinuously and totally protected by the first amendment.\n  We on this side of the aisle can complain about the fact that most of \nthe major metropolitan newspapers, editorial writers and their \nreporters are biased to the left, but none of us for a moment claim the \nright to control their speech or to say that they can't write \neditorials or that we have the right to say their news stories are \nbiased and keep them out of the newspapers or out of television \nstations.\n  I must say, and I trust that the Senator from Kentucky will agree \nwith me, when we use this pejorative ``special interest,'' these \nnewspaper editorial writers do have a special interest in restricting \nall other forms of free speech about politics so that they can occupy \nthe field alone or almost alone and greatly increase their influence \nover the actions of the voting public.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I could ask my friend from Washington, I listened \ncarefully to his observations about independent expenditures, which are \nso-called hard money, federally regulated within the FEC jurisdiction, \nand his observations about non-Federal money, soft money, which is \noutside the Federal jurisdiction, both of which there are whole lines \nof cases--I have counted 13 here just in the few moments I \nwas listening to Senator from Washington--making it abundantly clear \nthere is nothing we can do here in the Congress to restrict either.\n\n  My question to my friend from Washington is, if a Member of Congress \nwere sort of cynically approaching this issue and his real goal was to \nweaken, for example, the Republican National Committee, would he not be \npretty safe to advocate some kind of new restrictions on independent \nexpenditures and issue advocacy since there is literally no chance the \ncourts would uphold it and take the gamble that a court might, never \nhaving ruled in a whole area of party soft money, weaken the parties \nwith a ruling saying it is possible to federalize the two parties; \norganized labor would then, as the biggest force engaging in issue \nadvocacy, still be totally unrestricted, as you and I think they should \nbe. And since the Republican National Committee responds to those issue \nadvocacy campaigns with its soft money, would not such an approach \nbenefit substantially, it could be argued, our dear colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle for whom the AFL-CIO issue advocacy is almost \n100 percent favorable?\n  Mr. GORTON. There is little question but that that would be the \nresult. In fact with my own views on where the constitutional line is \nlikely to be drawn, it seems to me that would be almost the inevitable \nresult of the passage of McCain-Feingold. Its restrictions on money to \npolitical parties might well be upheld, probably would be upheld at \nleast in part. It is possible that they would be upheld in their \nentirety. Their other restrictions will inevitably be found to be \nunconstitutional.\n  So we have now restricted the candidate's ability to communicate his \nor her ideas. We have restricted the political party's ability to \nreflect their ideas and the ideas of their candidates, the Democratic \nParty as much as the Republican Party. But because, at least as \npolitics are constituted today, those additional interests, especially \norganized labor, are primarily on the Democratic side, we have enhanced \ntheir ability to communicate, or we have increased their competitive \nability to communicate. Let's put it in that fashion. More of the \nairwaves, more of the mass media will reflect their views. For that \nreason, because of the general bias of most newspapers and their \nreporters and their editorial writers and television commentators, \nRepublican candidates historically depend far more on their own ability \nto raise money and the ability of their party to raise money than have \ncandidates on the other side.\n\n  But there is a risk. The law of unintended consequences could easily \nresult in a few years in a reversal of that situation, and the benefits \nof the spending might very well end up on this side of the aisle. \nCertainly the unintended consequences of 1974 are exactly what we are \ndealing with here today.\n  My focus, however, is on the fact of responsibility. It is \nappropriate for voters to hold candidates responsible for the ideas \nthat they communicate. It is reasonably appropriate for them to hold \npolitical parties responsible. But they cannot hold candidates \nresponsible for a form of communication over which the candidates have \nabsolutely no control. So negative campaigning, it seems to me, will \nincrease rather than decrease with the passage of this bill. \nIrresponsible charges, unprovable charges, false charges will increase \nrather than decrease if we should pass this proposal.\n  But the fundamental point is the amount of money in the political \nsystem will not decrease at all because those who feel vitally affected \nby what happens in politically elected bodies will find a way to spend \nthat money, will be protected by the Constitution in their spending of \nthat money, and will just do it in less responsible channels than they \ndo today.\n\n  That, it seems to me, is the policy argument against this proposal. \nIn fact, if we want to make campaigns more candidate oriented and more \nissue oriented, we would at the very least raise the limitation on \ncontributions to candidates to the level at which they were in 1974 by \nreflecting the ravages of inflation since then, and we would encourage \ncontributions to political parties. What we would do--I am certain that \nthe Senator from Kentucky agrees with me--is we would see to it the\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\nsource of those funds is reported contemporaneously and prominently. \nThe immense amount of time and effort and money that is being spent on \ninvestigating the Democratic National Committee and the Presidential \nelection of 1996 would, I am certain, have been absolutely unnecessary \nhad all of these contributions and all of their sources and all of \nthese activities been public knowledge at the time at which they were \ngiven, the time at which those actions were taken. Why? Because it \nwould not have happened that way.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If my friend will yield, in fact the Democratic \nNational Committee had the option to report in October, chose not to, \nfor the very reason we all know now, that it would have been horrible \npublicity. So the act of rather contemporaneously disclosing, as my \nfriend is pointing out, would have created at least a decision on their \npart, Are we going to take the money and take the heat or are we going \nto forgo the money? Disclosure would have been the best disinfectant.\n  Mr. GORTON. As it was they could take the money and avoid the heat.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his courage in this matter and \nthe clarity with which he speaks on it. We simply cannot, consistently \nwith the Constitution of the United States, limit political speech. We \ncan only limit responsible political speech. We can only force money \nfrom responsible challenges into less responsible ones. We can only \nincrease the power of the press, the very group that is most anxious to \nlimit speech by others than its own members, and/or do what some \nproposed to do just a few months ago, say the first amendment doesn't \nwork anymore and we better change it. As I said at the beginning of my \nremarks, that may have been, as it was, terrible policy, but it was at \nleast intellectually honest. To present us with an unconstitutional \nbill is neither.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Washington for his really \nquite straight observations about this debate. They are right on point. \nHe has articulately pointed out that in a country where the Government \nis $1.6 trillion a year, it is not unreasonable to assume that people \nwould want to influence in whatever way they could the decisions that \nare made that affect their lives so greatly. The Court has made it \nperfectly clear that the ability to speak and to influence the course \nof events in any way that is constitutionally permissible is going to \nbe protected, and the only really honest debate, as the Senator from \nWashington pointed out, was from those who stood up and said we ought \nto amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years to give \nthe Government the power to control political discourse. The good news \nis, Mr. President, only 38 Members of the Senate voted to amend the \nfirst amendment for the first time in 200 years. The first amendment is \ngoing to be secure today and it is still going to be secure when the \ndebate on McCain-Feingold is over.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) the inventory of public housing units owned and \n     operated by public housing agencies, an asset in which the \n     Federal Government has invested approximately \n     $90,000,000,000, has traditionally provided rental housing \n     that is affordable to low-income persons;\n       (3) despite serving this critical function, the public \n     housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including \n     the concentration of very poor people in very poor \n     neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public \n     housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations \n     aggravates the problem and places excessive administrative \n     burdens on public housing agencies;\n       (5) the interests of low-income persons, and the public \n     interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing \n     program that--\n       (A) consolidates many public housing programs into programs \n     for the operation and capital needs of public housing;\n       (B) streamlines program requirements;\n       (C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the \n     maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with \n     appropriate accountability to both public housing residents \n     and localities; and\n       (D) rewards employment and economic self-sufficiency of \n     public housing residents; and\n       (6) voucher and certificate programs under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 are successful for \n     approximately 80 percent of applicants, and a consolidation \n     of the voucher and certificate programs into a single, \n     market-driven program will assist in making section 8 tenant-\n     based assistance more successful in assisting low-income \n     families in obtaining affordable housing and will increase \n     housing choice for low-income families.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to consolidate the various programs and activities \n     under the public housing programs administered by the \n     Secretary in a manner designed to reduce Federal \n     overregulation;\n       (2) to redirect the responsibility for a consolidated \n     program to States, localities, public housing agencies, and \n     public housing residents;\n       (3) to require Federal action to overcome problems of \n     public housing agencies with severe management deficiencies; \n     and\n       (4) to consolidate and streamline tenant-based assistance \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the floor S. 462, \nthe Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This bill is \nsimilar to public and assisted housing reform legislation, S. 1260, \nthat was introduced\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\nin the 104th Congress and passed unanimously by this body.\n  The Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 addresses a \npublic housing system fraught with counterproductive rules and \nregulations that make it impossible for even the best run public \nhousing authorities [PHA's] to operate effectively and efficiently. It \nwill help to make public housing a platform from which residents can \nachieve the goal of economic independence and self-sufficiency. In \naddition, it promotes increased residential choice and mobility by \nincreasing opportunities for residents to use tenant-based assistance.\n  The following reforms contained in the Public Housing Reform and \nResponsibility Act represent significant improvements in current public \nand assisted housing policies.\n  First, the bill consolidates a multitude of programs into two \nflexible block grants to expand the eligible uses of funds and allow \nmore creative and efficient use of resources. The bill also repeals a \nnumber of current programs that are obsolete, unused, or unfunded.\n  Second, it institutes permanent rent reforms such as ceiling rents, \nearned income adjustments, and minimum rents that provide PHA's with \nthe tools to develop rental policies that encourage and reward work and \nfurther the goal of creating mixed-income communities. The bill also \nremoves the floor on rents that may be charged under the Brooke \namendment, while assuring that poor families will not pay more than 30 \npercent of their income for rent.\n  Third, S. 462 requires tough, swift action against PHA's with severe \nmanagement deficiencies and provides HUD or court-appointed receivers \nwith the necessary tools and powers to deal with troubled agencies and \nprotect public housing residents.\n  Fourth, it requires intervention with respect to severely distressed \npublic housing developments that trap residents in deplorable living \nconditions and are costly to operate or maintain. It provides residents \nwith alternative housing using vouchers or other available housing.\n  Fifth, the bill permanently repeals the one-for-one replacement \nrequirement and streamlines the demolition and disposition process to \npermit PHA's to demolish or sell vacant or obsolete public housing.\n  Sixth, it gives PHA's broad flexibility to develop or participate \nwith other providers of affordable housing in the development of mixed-\nincome, mixed finance developments.\n  Seventh, it repeals Federal preferences that have had the unintended \nconsequence of concentrating the poorest of the poor in public housing \ndevelopments and allows PHA's to operate according to locally \nestablished preferences consistent with local housing needs. The bill \nstill maintains the requirement that most housing assistance be \ntargeted to very low-income households.\n  Eighth, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act calls on \nPHA's to increase coordination with State and local welfare agencies to \nensure that welfare recipients living in public housing will have the \nfull opportunity to move from welfare to work.\n  Ninth, the bill provides residents with an active voice in developing \nthe local PHA plans that will govern the operations and management of \nhousing and for direct participation on housing authority boards of \ndirectors. It also authorizes funds for resident organizations to \ndevelop resident management and empowerment activities.\n  Finally, S. 462 merges the section 8 voucher and certificate programs \ninto a single, choice-based program designed to operate more \neffectively in the private marketplace. It repeals requirements that \nare administratively burdensome to landlords, such as ``take-one, take-\nall,'' endless lease and 90-day termination notice requirements. These \nreforms will make participation in the section 8 tenant-based program \nmore attractive to private landlords and increase housing choices for \nlower income families.\n  The reforms contained in this legislation will significantly improve \nthe Nation's public housing and tenant-based rental assistance program \nand the lives of those who reside in federally assisted housing. The \nfunding flexibility, substantial deregulation of the day-to-day \noperations and policies of public authorities, encouragement of mixed-\nfinance developments, policies to deal with distressed and troubled \npublic housing, and rent reforms will change the face of public housing \nfor PHA's, residents, and local communities.\n  Reform of the public housing system has been and remains a bipartisan \neffort in the Senate. I want to thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato for his strong and steadfast support of \npublic housing reform. Further, I appreciate the commitment of the \nranking member of the Committee, Senator Sarbanes, and the ranking \nmember of the Housing Subcommittee, Senator Kerry, to the reform \neffort.\n  S. 462 represents the input of many members of this body as well as \nthe administration. Since the unanimous approval of this legislation by \nthe Banking Committee on May 8, we have worked to make a number of \nneeded technical changes to the bill. In addition, the managers \namendment to the bill reflects a number of policy changes that have \nbipartisan support.\n  First, the amendment revises the income targeting provisions for \npublic and section 8 tenant-based housing contained in the committee-\npassed bill. Most important, the amendment would increase the \npercentage of section 8 tenant based assistance that would be targeted \nto families with very low incomes.\n  Second, the managers amendment modifies an amendment initially \napproved by the Banking Committee, which permits housing authorities to \nrequire applicants for public housing to sign a release for information \nconcerning the applicant's illegal drug use. I appreciate the \nwillingness of the sponsor of the amendment, Senator Grams, to work \nwith Senators Leahy, Kennedy, Kerry, and Jeffords to address their \nconcerns about the confidentiality of medical records and potential \nconflicts with other statutes.\n  As reflected in the managers amendment, the Grams amendment will not \nsupersede the Public Health Service Act, and is not intended to \nabrogate or otherwise limit any provision of the Public Health Service \nAct, or the regulations issued pursuant to the Public Health Service \nAct. Any action pursuant to this provision must be taken in conformance \nwith the Public Health Service Act.\n  Finally, the bill contains an amendment proposed by Senator Gramm, \nalong with Senator D'Amato, to prohibit the admission of sexually \nviolent predators into public and assisted housing and provide housing \nauthorities access to records on past convictions. One of the important \npurposes of S. 462 is to incorporate measures which reduce crime and \nincrease the safety and security of residents of public and assisted \nhousing. This amendment is an important and useful contribution to \nmeeting the goals of the legislation.\n  I urge the passage of S. 462, so that we can begin the process of \nreconciling our differences with the House-passed version of public \nhousing reform.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 462 and urge all my \ncolleagues to support this public housing reform legislation.\n  I want to thank Senator Mack, chairman of the Housing Subcommittee \nand his excellent staff for their great work on this legislation. \nSenator Mack has proved to be a tireless partner in trying to put \ntogether a consensus piece of legislation. I also want to thank Senator \nSarbanes for his active participation in drafting the current \ncompromise language.\n  Finally, I want to congratulate Senator D'Amato for shepherding this \nimportant piece of housing legislation through the Senate for the \nsecond year in a row. He has taken an active interest in this and other \nhousing legislation which helps to put our Nation's housing policy on a \nmore sound and fiscally responsible foundation.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It contains many of the \nkey ingredients needed to bring the public housing program back to \nhealth. It includes many important management reforms requested by \nSecretary Cuomo that will make HUD a more efficient and responsive \norganization, a direction in which we can all agree the Department must \nmove.\n  The bill gives local public housing authorities both new powers and \nnew flexibility to define and meet local housing needs. At the same \ntime, it makes the consequences for failing to\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\nmeet those needs more certain and more severe.\n  This bill eliminates many of the provisions of current law that \nnumerous critics have pointed to as causes for the decline of public \nhousing, provisions such as Federal preferences and one for one \nreplacement. While well-meaning, these laws have had the unintended \nconsequence of contributing to an image--and in some cases the \nreality--of public housing projects as islands of desperate poverty, \nridden by crime and joblessness.\n  By repealing these laws, the Senate bill gives local housing \nofficials much more independence. They will have to identify the \nhousing needs in their communities and address them in a more effective \nway that avoids the pitfalls of the past. This is a significant new \nresponsibility. Many housing authorities have already proven to be \nextremely creative and innovative. For those, this bill will prove to \nbe a huge benefit to the residents, the PHA's, and their communities as \na whole.\n  As part of this bargain, we now require housing authorities to devote \na greater number of the rental assistance vouchers to serve extremely \nlow income families. This is an important improvement that has been \nmade in the legislation since the committee approved it, and I thank \nChairman Mack for his cooperation in achieving this goal.\n  We have also expanded and improved the opportunities for residents to \nbe informed about and participate in the public housing planning \nprocess. Residents will be able to take a more active role in the \nprovision of services to other public housing residents. I strongly \nsupport these initiatives.\n  Other PHA's will have a more difficult time with the transition to \ngreater independence. HUD will have to continue to have a significant \noversight role in these areas. But as HUD's staff and authority \ndiminish, I look to the residents of public housing to exercise their \nvoices and participate enthusiastically and aggressively in the PHA's \nplans and activities, along the lines established by this bill. In the \nlong run, it is the residents who will be the best watchdogs. We must \nmake sure they are adequately empowered to exercise this function \neffectively.\n  In the long run, Mr. President, I hope this bill, when enacted into \nlaw, will make public housing the kind of showcase to which we can \nproudly point to in seeking the additional resources we need to really \nstart addressing the affordable housing crisis affecting so many of our \nStates, from my own State of Massachusetts, to New York, California, \nUtah, and elsewhere. That will be the measure of success I will use in \nthe years to come.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nPublic Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 (S. 462). With the \npassage of this important legislation, the Senate today renews its \ncommitment to ensuring that every American family has a decent, safe \nand affordable home. The bill builds upon and improves those aspects of \nthe Nation's public and assisted housing programs which are working \nwell and takes dramatic and vital steps to eliminate areas of failure \nin the system.\n  This legislation recognizes that the vast majority of public housing \nis well-managed and provides over 1 million American families, elderly \nand disabled with decent, safe and affordable housing. However, housing \nand social policy concerns, as well as Federal budget constraints, \ndictate the need for reform. The reform measures contained in S. 462 \nwill reduce the costs of public and assisted housing to the Federal \nGovernment by streamlining regulations, facilitating the formation of \nlocal partnerships and leveraging additional State, local, and private \nresources to improve the quality of the existing stock. These changes \nwill help ensure that Federal funds can be used more efficiently in \norder to serve additional families through the creation of mixed income \ncommunities.\n  This legislation represents the culmination of over 2 years of a \nbipartisan, consensus-building effort to enhance and revitalize \naffordable housing throughout the Nation. This fruitful effort has been \nled by Senator Connie Mack, chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and \nCommunity Opportunity, whom I salute for his determination and \ncommitment to an informed and reasoned approach in confronting issues \nof enormous complexity. Senator Mack has sought input from the \nadministration, resident groups, public housing authorities, low-income \nhousing advocates, nonprofit organizations and state and local \nofficials who are responsible for implementing the Federal requirements \nestablished by Congress.\n  Mr. President, this legislation makes several critical improvements \nto the Nation's public and assisted housing system. It will protect our \nresidents by maintaining the Brooke amendment, which caps rents at 30-\npercent of a tenant's income, and mandating tenant participation. It \nwill institute reasonable rent requirements to encourage welfare \nrecipients who currently receive housing subsidies to move to work. It \nwill expand homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income \nfamilies. The bill will speed the demolition of distressed housing \nprojects through the repeal of the one-for-one replacement requirement. \nAlso, the section 8 tenant-based voucher and certificate programs will \nbe combined into a single, streamlined voucher system. The needless \nconfusion which results from the differing rules and regulations of \nthese two separate programs will be eliminated in order to increase the \nparticipation of private landlords in a unified, simplified system\n  This legislation recognizes that every American deserves to live in a \nsafe and secure community. To achieve that goal, a number of important \nprovisions have been added to the legislation at my request. The \nlegislation will allow HUD to waive rent and income requirements to \npermit police officers a lower rent as an inducement to living in \npublic and assisted housing. Loopholes in the current law which allow \ndrug dealers and violent criminals to escape eviction if they commit \ntheir crimes off the premises of the public housing authority will be \neliminated. In addition, public housing authorities will be judged and \nrated based on the effectiveness of their anticrime policies, and their \ncoordination with local law enforcement and tenant organizations in \ndeveloping and implementing anticrime strategies.\n  I would like to highlight one important anticrime provision which has \nrecently been added to the legislation. This provision would mandate \nthe exclusion of child molesters and sexually violent predators from \nreceiving Federal housing assistance. In addition, local public housing \nagencies would be granted access to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's [FBI] national database on sexually violent offenders. \nThis improved records access provision is critical to ensuring that \nthese offenders are properly screened out. I would like to thank my \ncolleague Senator Gramm for joining with me in ensuring that the \nfamilies and children who live in public housing are protected from \nconvicted sex offenders. Senator Gramm's leadership as the sponsor of \nthe Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 \n(Public Law 104-236), which established the FBI database, and his \ndiligence in bringing this issue to the attention of the committee are \nto be commended\n  Mr. President, the reform provisions contained in this bill will \ngreatly improve the quality of life of the families residing in public \nand assisted housing and will help to ensure the long-term viability of \nour Nation's existing stock of affordable housing. I thank my \ncolleagues on the Senate Banking Committee for their hard work and \nspirit of bipartisan compromise which they have shown throughout the \nprocess. I respectfully urge this legislation's speedy passage.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 462, the Public \nHousing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997.\n  This bill is the culmination of months of hard work and careful \nconsideration. It represents the collective wisdom of housing authority \ndirectors, public housing residents and resident organizations, local \nelected officials, and experts at HUD. As a result of this open, \ninclusive, and bipartisan process, this bill represents widespread \nagreement among stakeholders.\n  I want to take a moment to extend my special thanks to Senator Mack \nfor his hard work over the past 3 years to get us to this point. \nSenator Mack has worked tirelessly to listen to every argument, to \nentertain every question,\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\nand to consider every opinion as we moved this bill from introduction \nthrough the committee and now to the floor. He has proven to be \nresponsive to serious concerns and has shown the willingness and \nability to build coalitions in the interest of getting legislation \npassed. I greatly appreciate his willingness to work with me and my \ncolleagues to produce this important piece of legislation.\n  Likewise, I want to thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the \nHousing Subcommittee. Senator Kerry has long been one of the chief \nadvocates for public and assisted housing in the Congress of the United \nStates. This public housing bill, particularly in it efforts to target \nassistance to those most in need, reflects Senator Kerry's indelible \nstamp.\n  Finally, I greatly appreciate the skill with which Senator D'Amato \nhas managed this bill and other important legislation, such as the \nmark-to-market proposal. He has been an important partner in the \nsuccess we are achieving here tonight.\n  Mr. President, public housing is the program everyone loves to hate. \nIt is easy to understand why; bad high-rise public housing projects are \neasy targets for the press. These projects are magnets for crime and \ndrugs. They stick out like sore thumbs and ruin whole neighborhoods.\n  But the fact is that most public housing is good housing. In fact, in \nmost communities around the country, public housing cannot be \ndistinguished from the private housing stock that surrounds it. Most \npeople don't even know when public housing is in their neighborhoods.\n  Many of the provisions of S. 462 will help make the public housing \nprogram a more effective program. It will give local housing \nauthorities greater autonomy, and greater responsibility, to meet the \nhousing needs in their communities. It will provide for a broader, more \neconomically diverse mix in public housing, which experts universally \nagree is necessary to create healthier communities. The bill includes \nimportant provisions to encourage public housing residents to go to \nwork by delaying any rent increases that would otherwise accompany \nincome gains.\n  The bill will expedite the demolition of bad public housing, which \nhas been a point of emphasis for both Secretary Cuomo and former \nSecretary Cisneros. It will enable HUD to set aside bad public housing \nmanagement more quickly and replace it with the type of professionals \nthat can turn these agencies around. Many of the reforms in this bill \nwill result in spending taxpayers dollars more efficiently and \neffectively, and in residents benefiting from imported conditions.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and I \nlook forward to continuing to move forward to conference in a \nbipartisan spirit. I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe the public housing bill is sound \nlegislation and would like to extend my appreciation to the chairman \nand the subcommittee staff for all of their hard work.\n  I would especially like to thank the chairman for working with me to \ninclude two provisions in the public housing bill. One measure would \nmake vouchers available for Public Housing residents who are victims of \ncrime. This provision would give them the change to live in better \nsurroundings. Also included in the bill is a Housing Cost Commission to \ndetermine the full cost to the Federal Government of each of the \nhousing programs administered by HUD. The data from this Commission \nwill be available for Congress as it works to improve the efficiency \nand quality of federally assisted housing programs.\n  I appreciate being able to work together for the goal of improving \nour public housing system and ensuring that these programs provide \nnecessary assistance to low income individuals while giving them an \nopportunity to help themselves.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of S. 462, the \nPublic Housing Reform and Responsibility Act. This bill is \ncompassionate legislation that provides much-needed regulatory relief \nand commonsense reform for public housing in America. I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of S. 462. It makes permanent the reform measures \nthat have been added onto recent appropriations bills. It provides much \nneeded additional regulatory relief and paperwork reduction to well-\nmanaged public housing agencies. It imposes tougher penalties on \ntroubled housing authorities. And finally, it strengthens the ability \nof authorities to improve the safety of their tenants by enhancing \ntheir powers of screening and eviction.\n  S. 462 makes permanent various reform measures that have been \napproved in appropriations bills during the last 3 years. It \npermanently repeals Federal preferences that have had the unintended \nconsequence of concentrating the poorest of the poor in public housing \ndevelopments and allows housing authorities to operate according to \nlocally established preferences consistent with local housing needs. \nThe bill still maintains the requirement that most housing assistance \nbe targeted to very low-income households. S. 462 also repeals the one-\nfor-one replacement requirement and streamlines the demolition and \ndisposition process to permit housing authorities to demolish or sell \nvacant or obsolete public housing.\n  S. 462 also provides much needed additional regulatory relief and \npaperwork reduction to public housing agencies. The bill significantly \nreduces the complexity that public housing authorities have in \nreceiving funding. S. 462 consolidates a multitude of programs into two \nflexible block grants to expand the eligible uses of funds and allow a \npublic housing agency to more efficiently and creatively use its \navailable resources.\n  The bill also repeals the highly burdensome requirements of the \nFamily Self Sufficiency Program, which was passed in 1990 as part of \nthe National Affordable Housing Act. Congress now recognizes that, \nwhile well-intentioned, FSS was an unfunded mandate that placed \nenormous administrative burden on public housing agencies. I believe \nthat public housing agencies should be permitted to direct all of their \nenergies to provide safe and affordable housing to low-income families, \nsenior citizens, and the disabled. Public housing agencies should not \nhave to drain their scarce resources to do the work better suited to \ncounty social service agencies.\n  More importantly, however, the FSS mandate has been made unnecessary \nby the enactment last year of the landmark welfare reform bill. Because \nthere will be 50 locally determined welfare reform laws, these laws are \nthe more appropriate vehicle for moving public housing families from \nwelfare to work.\n  While providing much needed regulatory relief to well-managed public \nhousing agencies. S. 462 also imposes tough, new penalties for troubled \nauthorities. I am very supportive of swift and strong action to correct \nthe management deficiencies of troubled housing authorities. While less \nthan 5 percent of the 3,400 housing authorities in this country are \ntroubled, their poor condition and lack of safety tend to dominate the \nnews. I believe that, working together, we must act decisively to \nimprove their condition.\n  S. 462 also contains three provisions that I personally authored. The \nfirst provision relates to the Congregate Housing Services Program, \nwhich was authorized by the Housing and Community Development \nAmendments Act of 1978 to provide 3- to 5-year contracts to fund \nservices for eligible residents of public housing authorities. CHSP \nprovides for ailing seniors, who normally would be institutionalized in \nnursing homes to remain housed in less expensive elderly-only projects \nthat provide them with at least one hot meal a day, a social worker to \nmonitor their health and medication, and housekeeping services.\n  CHSP is good program because it provides ailing low-income seniors \nwith the dignity of having their own apartment at a cost that has been \nestimated to be 66 percent lower than the costs of institutionalizing \nthem in nursing homes.\n  As I strongly support CHSP, I have had language added into S. 462 to \nguarantee the continuation of funding for this important program.\n  I have included two other provisions into S. 462 that are designed to \nenhance tenant safety. My first provision strengthens the eviction \npowers of public housing authorities by permitting them to quickly \nterminate the leases of tenants that are found by a legal police search \nto have illegal drugs in their possession.\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n  My second tenant safety provision--now commonly known as the Grams \nAmendment--has been the subject of high amount of controversy. As you \nknow, current law permits public housing authorities to reject \napplicants who have a record of violent criminal activity, who are \nabusing illegal drugs, or who are abusing alcohol in a way that could \nadversely affect the safety and peaceful enjoyment of other tenants. \nPublic housing authorities have responded to this legislation by \nchecking on their applicants' criminal records, prior tenancy records \nand--in a few cases--information from the records of drug abuse \ntreatment facilities. Public housing authorities that have instituted \nthis screening have reported back to me that they have been able to \nsignificantly reduce illegal drug use and crime in their projects.\n  Several months ago, several of Minnesota's public housing authorities \nrequested that I get an amendment into the public housing reform bill \nthat would clarify their right to get information about illegal drug \nuse from the records of drug abuse treatment facilities. Their request \nwas prompted by a lawsuit being filed against the Minneapolis Public \nHousing Authority by people that are opposed to their screening for \nillegal drugs.\n  I agreed to do the amendment, because I have previously toured public \nhousing projects throughout Minnesota and have had touching \nconversations with Minnesotans who were fearful about the affects of \nillegal drugs on their own safety and the future of their children. I \nam also concerned that the money that public housing authorities have \nbeen spending to defend themselves against frivolous lawsuits regarding \ntheir screening programs could be better spent on providing housing to \nAmerica's most needy families.\n  After I added in safeguards to protect applicants' privacy and \nconfidentiality rights, my amendment was unanimously accepted by the \nDemocrats and the Republicans on the Senate Banking committee, and it \nwas part of the public housing reform bill that the Committee \nunanimously voted to report out on May 8. At the time, no one on the \ncommittee considered my amendment to be controversial.\n  After we completed committee action on the bill, I heard from quite a \nfew organizations that were concerned that the language of the \nlegislation preempted the medical record confidentiality protections of \nthe Public Health Service Act. Furthermore, there was concern that the \ntype of information that the amendment would permit a public housing \nauthority to review would conflict with the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, the Fair Housing Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. I took these \nconcerns very seriously because I am a strong supporter of laws that \nprotect medical confidentiality and protect people with disabilities \nfrom discrimination.\n  Over August recess, my staff had meetings with HUD, the DOJ, HHS, and \nHousing Subcommittee staff to address the concerns regarding the \namendment. On September 11, I submitted to the committee a scaled-down \nversion of the Amendment that does not preempt the Public Health \nService Act and does not conflict with ADA, Fair Housing, or the Rehab \nAct. I am happy that this version of my amendment has been retained in \nthe bill.\n  In conclusion, I am very pleased that the Senate will be reporting \nout this long overdue piece of legislation today. I commend Senator \nMack for sponsoring this moderate and balanced piece of legislation and \nfor carefully shepherding it through the Senate.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator \nD'Amato, as well as Senator Mack, the chairman of the Housing \nOpportunity Subcommittee and the ranking members for including in the \nmanager's amendment the text of several proposals that I drafted and \nwhich I believe will strengthen the legislation.\n  The first of these is an amendment which will ban violent sexual \npredators from eligibility for, and thus admission to, public housing \nfacilities. The second initiative allows public housing authorities \naccess to State records concerning sex offender convictions. Both of \nthese provisions were approved by the House in its version of the \nlegislation.\n  In a letter endorsing the effort to rid our public housing of these \nviolent predators, the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren said that ``* * * each and every American, regardless of \nsocio-economic class, has the right to a safe and secure \nneighborhood.''\n  Mr. President, I do not believe that there is a constitutional right \nto have access to public housing. If there is a right involved here, it \nis the right of people to know that the person living next door to them \nand their children is not a convicted sex offender. Adoption of these \namendments will insure a safer environment for the adults and children \nwho reside in public housing.\n  I urge adoption of the amendments.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, I \nintroduced a bill earlier this session, along with Senator Kyl and \nnumerous other Senators, on occupancy standards. The State Housing \nProtection Act transfers authority to set occupancy standards from the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to the States. Occupancy \nstandards was an issue in last year's conference of the public housing \nbill. I rise today to urge the members of the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to address occupancy standards \nagain this year when the public housing reform bill goes to conference.\n  The State Housing Protection Act does not address privately owned \ndwellings, only rental dwellings. Under the Fair Housing Act, private \nproperty owners are permitted to set occupancy standards that limit the \nnumber of persons who may rent an apartment dwelling, if the standards \nare reasonable. At present, there is no clear guidance in this area, \nand there is controversy over what is a reasonable standard.\n  Following passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1988, some activists \nbrought lawsuits against housing providers, charging that two persons \nper bedroom standards discriminated against families. Housing providers \npersuasively argued to HUD that consistently applied two persons per \nbedroom standards do not discriminate against families. So, in order to \ngive housing providers a safe harbor from inappropriate legal \nchallenges, in 1991, HUD issued guidance which indicated that two \npersons per bedroom would be presumed to be a generally reasonable \nstandard by HUD, and housing providers would generally not be sued by \nHUD for discrimination if they used that standard.\n  Housing providers, of course, were not precluded in the guidance from \nexceeding that standard. Private housing providers adjusted to that \nguidance and relied on it when adopting occupancy policies for their \nrental units. HUD's own handbooks for public and assisted housing also \nestablished that standard. HUD itself adhered more strictly to that \nguidance until the Clinton administration arrived.\n  In 1995, HUD issued and then quickly retracted a new guidance that \nwould have required housing providers to allow as many as 8 to 10 \npeople in a two bedroom apartment and 12 to 15 in a three bedroom \napartment--if the housing providers didn't want to be sued for \ndiscrimination by HUD. HUD realized that the 1995 guidance was \nunworkable and put back in place the 1991 two person per bedroom \nguidance. However, there have been a number of court decisions \noverturning HUD's actions in this area. So there is still a void and no \nclarity as to how it is being interpreted by HUD or whether it will be \nchanged again by HUD in line with the 1995 attempt.\n  Housing providers need certainty in their establishment of such \nfundamental business judgments as occupancy standards. Nobody likes to \nbe sued for discrimination, but you especially don't like when you \ndon't know the rules that are being used by the Government. Republicans \nand Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have acknowledged the \nneed for clarity and have promised to work with me in conference on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to encourage the members of the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Development to address the \nissue of occupancy standards when the public housing reform bill goes \nto conference committee. Earlier this year, Senator Faircloth and I \nintroduced the State Housing Protection Act which transfers from HUD to \nthe States, the authority to set occupancy standards. Yet, the \ncommittee did not\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\naddress the matter when it considered its public housing reform bill.\n   Mr. President, Senator Faircloth and I have worked on this issue for \n2 years. In the 104th Congress, Senator Faircloth and I blocked HUD \nfrom imposing national occupancy standards until it completed an \nofficial rule. Soon thereafter, we introduced a bill with \nRepresentative McCollum which prohibited HUD from setting a national \noccupancy standard. The House included that bill in its 1996 public \nhousing reform bill, but it died in conference committee late last \nyear.\n  In May of this year, the House passed its public housing reform bill \nwhich included a section that prohibits the Secretary of HUD from \nestablishing a national occupancy standard. Senator Faircloth and I \nhave tried to change the current policy on occupancy standards because \nwe believe that HUD generally has pursued an occupancy standard policy \nthat encourages overcrowding, thereby depreciating housing stock that \nis scarce to begin with. We believe that HUD is poorly serving lower-\nincome families and defeating its own purpose. Again, I encourage the \nmembers of the conference committee to seriously consider restricting \nHUD's ability to set a national occupancy standard.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to thank the floor managers \nfor agreeing to include the city of Indianapolis flexible grant \ndemonstration amendment in the manager's amendment to S. 462.\n  The Lugar amendment would authorize the city of Indianapolis,in \ncoordination with its public housing authority, to receive and combine \nprogram allocations from Federal housing assistance funds so that it \nhas the flexibility to determine the best use of these funds. This \namendment has the support both of Mayor Goldsmith and of the \nIndianapolis Housing Authority.\n  My flexible grant demonstration amendment would give the city of \nIndianapolis, in coordination with the Indianapolis Housing Authority, \nthe ability to receive and combine covered housing assistance to which \nthe Indianapolis Housing Authority would otherwise be entitled. Covered \nhousing assistance is defined as operating assistance, modernization \nassistance, section 8 certificate and voucher programs assistance, \ncapital and operating funds assistance, and tenant-based rental \nassistance. It does not include other housing assistance programs for \nwhich the city or its public housing authority would otherwise be able \nto compete.\n  This demonstration program would last for 2 to 5 years and would \nserve a variety of purposes. It could be used to provide incentives for \nlow-income working families to become economically self-sufficient, to \nreduce costs of housing assistance by providing funds in the most \neffective manner, to increase the stock of affordable low-income \nhousing and housing choices for low-income families, to increase home \nownership among low-income families and for other ways in which the \ncity in coordination with the public housing agency could make more \neffective use of limited housing funds.\n  Under no circumstances would there be any reduction in the number of \nlow-income families who would otherwise be served with housing \nassistance had these amounts not been combined. In fact, by allowing \ngreater flexibility and cost-effectiveness in the use of these funds, \nmy amendment will increase and enhance housing assistance to lower \nincome families who need it.\n  I urge support for my amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have a question regarding section 107(d) \nof S. 462, which adds a new performance indicator for the extent to \nwhich the public housing agency is providing acceptable basic housing \nconditions. I do not see what could be much more fundamental to a \nhousing authority's performance than offering its tenants decent \nhousing conditions in which to live.\n  Mr. MACK. I agree.\n  Mr. KERRY. The committee report, on page 15, indicates that both the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] and HUD's inspector \ngeneral pointed out that under the current performance evaluation \n[PHMAP] system, a PHA can escape ``troubled'' designation even though a \nsubstantial portion of its units would not meet basic housing \nconditions. This seems totally unacceptable. Will the proposed \namendment in section 107(d) of S. 462 allow HUD to give this \nperformance indicator enough weight to solve this problem? Will that \napproach assure that we do not have authorities that are deemed \nacceptable performers even though they offer widespread substandard \nhousing conditions?\n  Mr. MACK. The amendment in S. 462 would allow HUD, subject to the \nrulemaking process, to give this performance indicator enough weight in \nthe PHMAP system so that it can appropriately affect the determination \nwhether a PHA is designated ``troubled.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. As you know, one of the most important principles of \nthis public housing bill is resident empowerment. To this end, the \nlegislation mandates that resident advisory boards assist in the \ndevelopment of public housing agency [PHA] plans. It also requires that \nPHA's: first, conduct public hearings to collect input on their \nproposed plans; second, make a copy of their proposed plan available \nfor public inspection at least 45 days prior to the public hearing; and \nthird, provide notice of the date of the public hearing at least 45 \ndays in advance of the hearing.\n  Given this emphasis on resident participation, I would anticipate \nthat PHA's would make every effort to ensure that each resident is \naware of his or her opportunities to provide input. I would expect \nPHA's to prominently display, at each of their assisted housing \ndevelopments, information about the hearings, as well as information \nabout where residents can view copies of the proposed agency plans. I \nwould also expect that PHA's, to the maximum extent practicable, will \ncontact resident groups directly to inform them of this information. Is \nthis how you anticipate the process will work?\n  Mr. MACK. That is the type of scenario I envision. The legislation \nwas carefully crafted so that residents will have a significant voice \nin the policies and programs that will affect them. I agree that the \nonly way their interests can truly be served is to provide them with as \nmuch advance notice and information about the public hearings as \npossible--and to incorporate their recommendations where appropriate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would first like to thank the chairman \nof the Housing Opportunity and Community Development Subcommittee for \njoining me in this colloquy regarding a very serious problem for many \nlow-income citizens living in mobile home parks. These good people, \nmost of whom are senior citizens, are not able to use section 8 \nassistance because their park owners refuse to accept it.\n  In the vast majority of cases, mobile home tenants own their mobile \nhome and rent the space on which the home sits. Unfortunately, many \nresidents become unable to pay the rising space rates and require low-\nincome housing assistance under section 8. This is especially common \namong elderly residents whose income drops following death of a spouse \nor illness.\n  Under the current system, because section 8 assistance payments are \nmade to landlords, section 8 participation requires that the landlord \nsign a rental assistance contract with the appropriate housing \nauthority. For various reasons, many mobile home park owners are \nrefusing to sign these contracts. Consequently, their residents are \nbeing denied the section 8 assistance they need to meet their housing \ncosts.\n  Without section 8 assistance, these very low-income, primarily \nelderly, residents, have few options. Some will be forced to move their \nhomes to parks which accept section 8 assistance. However, this is an \nexpensive and laborious process. It costs a minimum of $10,000 to \nrelocate a mobile home, money that most low-income tenants do not have.\n  Some residents will not even have the option of moving their mobile \nhomes to parks which accept section 8 payments. In areas with a \nshortage of spaces, tenants will have to either abandon their homes or \ncontinue to pay unaffordable space rents. Because currently high-space \nrents reduce the demand for mobile homes, those who must abandon their \nhomes will likely not recoup their investment, often losing their \nentire lifesavings.\n  This is a critical problem for many in my State of California. Mobile \nhomes are one of the few sources of affordable housing in many areas of \nthe State, especially for senior citizens. There are\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\napproximately 700,000 mobile home residents in California 50-60 percent \nof whom are seniors. Without section 8 assistance, many of these \nresidents will lose their homes and lifetime investments.\n  Mr. MACK. I am aware that this problem exists, Senator, and I am very \nsympathetic.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the chairman's response. I would like to \noffer a solution. The House-passed Public Housing bill, H.R. 2, \ncontains a provision that allows section 8 payments to go directly to \nmobile home tenants of parks which refuse to enter into section 8 \ncontracts. This provision, section 330, gives the money directly to the \ntenants thereby obviating the need for a contract between the park \nowner and the local housing authority. Because the House provision only \napplies to tenants who already live in parks that do not accept section \n8, it does not force park owners to take in new tenants with section 8 \nassistance.\n  I hope, Mr. Chairman, that when we get to conference on the Public \nHousing bills, we can seriously consider section 330 of the House-\npassed bill as a possible solution to the very urgent problem facing so \nmany mobile home tenants.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator from California for her concern. I \nshare her desire to prevent displacement of these good tenants and I \nhave every intention of working with her during conference to assure \nthat this problem is appropriately addressed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the Chairman's willingness to help solve \nthis serious problem and I look forward to working with him on it in \nconference.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The relocation provisions contained in section 115 \nstate that residents shall be relocated to areas that are generally not \nless desirable than the location of the displaced person's dwelling. Is \nit your understanding that a comparably desirable area would be one \nthat is not subject to unreasonable adverse environment conditions, and \none which offers similar access to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and the displaced person's place of employment?\n  Mr. MACK. I agree that these should be the primary factors that a \npublic housing authority takes into consideration when providing \nrelocation assistance. It is our intention that the interests of \nresidents be protected to the maximum possible extent during the \ndemolition and relocation process.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1257\n\n                   (Purpose: To provide a substitute)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Werner, which nominations were \n     received by the Senate and appeared in the Congressional \n     Record of September 4, 1997.\n       Public Health Service nominations beginning William E. \n     Halperin, and ending Trinh K. Nguyen, which nominations were \n     received by the Senate and appeared in the Congressional \n     Record of September 12, 1997.\n\n\n  STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATIONS OF MARJORIE O. RENDELL AND RICHARD A. \n                                LAZZARA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to see two more hostages \nreleased by the Republican majority to serve the American people as \nFederal judges.\n  Anticipation of the President's radio address on the judicial vacancy \ncrisis has obviously reached the Senate. I expect even those who have \nspent so much time this year holding up the confirmations of Federal \njudges were uncomfortable defending this Senate's record of having \nproceeded on only 9 of the 61 nominees received through August of this \nyear. As rumors of the President's impending address have circulated \naround Capitol Hill, this Senate has literally doubled its \nconfirmations from 9 to 18 in the course of 23 days. That demonstrates \njust how low the Senate's output has been over the first 8 months of \nthis year. With these two confirmations, the Senate will have finally \nachieved the snail-like pace of confirming two judges a month while \nstill faced with almost 100 vacancies.\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has once again chosen to \nskip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow and that of Christina \nSnyder who have been nominated to be district court judges in the \nCentral District of California. As I detailed again yesterday, Ms. \nMorrow has been the victim of a mysterious hold for months.\n  Marjorie Rendell has been a fine district court judge since 1994. \nPresident Clinton nominated her to a seat on the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit on the first day of this session. At the time, I \ncould not have imagined that it would take nine months for the \nJudiciary Committee to accord her a hearing and report her nomination \nto the Senate. Senator Specter and Senator Biden are both to be \ncommended for pressing their efforts to have this nomination \nconsidered. Indeed, Senator Specter ultimately chaired her confirmation \nhearing.\n  Judge Rendell received the ABA's highest rating of well qualified for \nappointment to the third circuit. She has been active in the Visiting \nNurse Association of Greater Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Bar \nFoundation and active in the community. Senator Kennedy described her \ncareer as ``one of great distinction and insight.'' Even Senator \nSessions concurred that Judge Rendell ``was a very impressive \nwitness.''\n  The good news is that her confirmation fills a vacancy on the third \ncircuit, the bad news is that it creates a vacancy on the district \ncourt at a time when it is taking far too long to confirm good \nnominees.\n  I congratulate Judge Rendell and her family and look forward to her \nservice on the third circuit.\n  I am delighted to see the Senate moving forward with the nomination \nof Richard Lazzara to be a Federal judge in the Middle District of \nFlorida. The Senate first received this nomination in early May 1996, \nover 16 months ago. It should not have taken us this long to get to \nthis point.\n  I know that the chief judge in that district, Elizabeth Kovachevich, \nhas been speaking out about the workload, backlogs and vacancies in her \ncourt. Judge Kovachevich has noted that serious crimes are up 28 \npercent in her district and civil filings are up 25 percent for the \nsecond straight year leading to a growing backlog of over 3,200 cases. \nBoth Senator Graham and Senator Mack were strong supporters of this \nnominee at his hearing in early September. I was struck that Senator \nMack called the situation one of ``crisis proportions'' and pointed out \nthat the district is having to take unprecedented steps to deal with a \nbacklog growing ``at an alarming proportion.''\n  I have introduced legislation recommended by the Judicial Conference \nof the United States to add three additional judges for that district, \nbut their needs remain unaddressed because that bill has not received \nthe attention that it deserves.\n  Filling this vacancy without further delay is a start. The people of \nOrlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa have had to wait a long time for judge \nLazzara. This nominee received the highest rating possible from the \nAmerican Bar Association. He is an experienced Judge, having served as \na Florida County judge, a Florida circuit judge and a Florida appellate \njudge over the last 10 years.\n  I congratulate Judge Lazzara and his family and look forward to his \nservice on the Federal Court.\n  With Senate confirmation of these two judges, the Senate continues to \nlag well behind the pace established by Majority Leader Dole and \nChairman Hatch in the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, the \nSenate had confirmed 36 Federal judges. With today's actions, the \nSenate will have confirmed one-half that number, only 18 judges. We \nstill face almost 100 vacancies and have over 50 pending nominees to \nconsider with more arriving each week.\n  For purposes of perspective, let us also recall that by the end of \nSeptember 1992, during the last year of President Bush's term, a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate had confirmed 59 of the 72 nominees \nsent to us by a Republican President. This Senate is on pace to confirm \nless than one-third of a comparable number of nominations.\n  We still have more than 47 nominees among the 69 nominations sent to \nthe Senate by the President pending before the Judiciary Committee who \nhave yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. Many of \nthese nominations have been pending since the very first day of this \nsession, having been re-nominated by the President. Several of those \npending before the committee had hearings or were reported favorably \nlast Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the \nvacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago persist. The \nCommittee has 10 nominees who have been pending for more than a year, \nincluding 5 who have been pending since 1995.\n  While I am encouraged that the Senate is today proceeding with the \nconfirmations of Judge Rendell and Mr. Lazzara, there remains no excuse \nfor the Committee's delay in considering the nominations of such \noutstanding individuals as Prof. William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. \nBeaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. \nAiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding \nnominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a \nhearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been favorably \nreported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but \nhave been passed over so far this year. Nor is there any explanation or \nexcuse for the Senate not immediately proceeding to consider the other \nfive judicial nominations pending on the Senate calendar.\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot try \nthe cases and incarcerate the guilty if you do not have judges. The \nmounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of \nemergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day. \nNational Public Radio has been running a series of reports all this \nweek on the judicial crises and quoted the chief judge and U.S. \nattorney from San Diego earlier this week to the effect that criminal \nmatters are being affected.\n  I have spoken about the crisis being created by the vacancies that \nare being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the \nrate that we are going, we are not keeping up with attrition. When we \nadjourned last Congress there were 64 vacancies on the Federal bench. \nAfter the confirmation of 18 judges in 9 months, there has been a net \nincrease of 30 vacancies, an increase of almost 50 percent in the \nnumber of Federal judicial vacancies.\n  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has called the rising number \nof vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the federal \njudiciary.'' Senator Hatch has said that we can do better. I agree with \nthem and add that we must do better. I have urged those who have been \nstalling the consideration of these fine women and men to reconsider \ntheir action and work with us to have the Senate fulfill its \nconstitutional responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10050-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ROBERT E. HUYSER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in the year that the Nation celebrates \nthe 50th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force, we must \npause today to mourn the passing of an individual who was one of the \nkey figures in the history of that service, Gen. Robert E. ``Dutch'' \nHuyser.\n  For almost 40 years, Dutch Huyser helped to protect America through \nairpower. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he became a B-29 \npilot and flew numerous missions in the Pacific in support of Allied \nefforts to defeat Imperialism. Following the war, when the Air Force \nwas established as a separate military service, he became a bright and \npromising young officer who would help to shape cold war policy and \nbecome known as the father of\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\nthe program which eventually yielded the C-17 Globemaster aircraft. \nBefore he would reach the highest echelons of the Air Force though, \nDutch Huyser still had a lot of flying to do, and he found himself in \nthe cockpits of B-29's over Korea and B-52's in Vietnam when the United \nStates became embroiled in conflicts in those nations.\n  Throughout his career, Dutch Huyser established an impressive record \nof awards, citations, and medals that is far too extensive to cite \nhere. Suffice it to say, he set an excellent example for devotion, \npatriotism, and professionalism for all Air Force officers to follow, \nand I am confident that he served as an important role model for many \nof his subordinates throughout his career.\n  An obvious competent and talented officer, pilot, and manager, the \ncareer of Dutch Huyser progressed quickly. Following his service in \nVietnam, he specialized in airlift matters and later became the \nCommander of the Military Airlift Command. In that position, he was an \nadvocate for increased lift capabilities for the Air Force, and he \nfought hard for the modernization and expansion of the transport fleet. \nAs mentioned above, he is universally credited as being the father \ncredited as being the father of the C-17 program, an aircraft that \nproves its capabilities and worth on a daily basis as it transports \ntroops and equipment to spots around the world.\n  After three major wars, almost 10,000 flying hours, and 38-years in \nthe Air Force, General Huyser finally hung his uniform up for the last \ntime in 1981. Though he left the military, he continued to make many \ncontributions to aviation and the security of the United States.\n  Sadly, Gen. Robert ``Dutch'' Huyser passed away earlier this week, \nbut perhaps fitting for a man who dedicated his life to the Air Force, \nhe was on an Air Force base when he died. I am certain that the entire \nSenate would join me in saluting the many contributions that General \nHuyser made to the Air Force and the defense of the United States, as \nwell as extending our deepest sympathies to his wife, Wanda, and their \ntwo daughters. They can be proud of all that their husband and father \ndid to make our Nation a safer, stronger, and better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10052-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President. This week, the American Tort Reform \nAssociation is holding a series of events to mark the National Lawsuit \nAwareness Week. Since it was founded in 1986, ATRA has played a \nvaluable role in the effort to restore fairness, balance, and \npredictability to the civil justice system.\n  To commerate this week, ATRA is hosting a 5k ``Tort Trot'' to benefit \nthe Hydrocephalus Research Foundation. Patients who suffer from \nhydrocephalus--excess fluid on the brain--particularly have been \nimpacted by law suit abuse. Such patients require brain shunts to drain \nthe excess fluid from the brain. While these shunts have saved the \nnearly 75,000 hydrocephalus patient's lives, they are made out of \nsilicone which is becoming scarce. The silicone supply used by implant \nmanufacturers is threatened by deep pocket liability lawsuits. Rather \nthan take a risk over a product which they did not design or \nmanufacture, some suppliers are exiting the medical device market.\n  Congress can fix this problem. We can pass meaningful tort reform to \nmake sure that our system no longer lines the pockets of special \ninterests at the expense of those in need of life-saving medical \ndevices.\n  Americans deserve a system of justice, not justice delayed. Those \nwrongfully injured should have access to a timely remedy from the \nresponsible party. A recent study found cases take about 2\\1/2\\ to 3 \nyears to be resolved, and even longer in appealed cases. In our \npresent--overburdened--system, 50-70 cents of every jury-awarded dollar \ngoes to lawyers and legal costs.\n  I want to focus my remarks on reforming the product liability system; \nhowever, I also want to mention a case which illustrates the need for \noverall civil justice reform. This case, coined the ``Great New Orleans \nTrain Robbery'' by the national media, resulted in a $2.5 billion \npunitive damages award against a company found to be only 15 percent at \nfault in an accident that did not result in loss of life, serious \ninjuries, or major property damage.\n  On September 9, 1987, a railroad tank car containing butadiene, a \nvolatile compound used in making synthetic rubber, was located in a \nrail yard in New Orleans on tracks that belong to CSX Corp. Since the \nfire involved hazardous materials, the officials involved made a \ndetermination that the best approach was to let the fire burn itself \nout. In order to avoid any possible harm to nearby residents, an \nevacuation of those living near the yard was undertaken. The fire \nlasted 36 hours. By all accounts, fire officials, and corporate \nrepresentatives undertook heroic efforts to protect life and property. \nAs a result, and as I said earlier, no deaths or significant injuries \nwere involved, and there was only minimal property damage.\n  One year later, the National Transportation Safety Board--the Federal \nagency charged with investigating transportation accidents--determined \nthat CSX had not caused this accident. In fact, other than providing \nthe track over which the tank car was operated, CSX had no connection \nto the car.\n  The very day of the fire, a group of law firms brought a class action \nsuit against CSX and other companies alleging various kinds of physical \nand mental anguish. A jury has now decided that the 8,000 plaintiffs \nshould be awarded $3.5 billion in punitive damages. Although CSX was \nonly found to be 15 percent responsible--presumably because they owned \nthe track--its portion of the punitive damage award is $2.5 billion.\n  How can it be that a Federal agency determines that a company has no \nresponsibility for an accident, another agency declines to assess any \nsafety violation against that company, and yet, this enormous verdict \nis awarded?\n  The case in New Orleans is but the latest example of why we need to \nreform the entire civil justice system. We need to place some limits on \nverdicts. We need to modify the laws regarding joint liability. \nFinally, we need to provide disincentives for lawyers to sue the deep \npocket every time they can.\n  Before I begin talking about product liability reform, Mr. President \nI ask unanimous consent that articles appearing recently in the Wall \nStreet Journal and the Washington Post relating to this almost \nunbelievable case, appear in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 18, 1997]\n\n                           Louisiana Jackpot\n\n       The tort wheel of fortune turns round and round. By all \n     accounts, the legal freak show is about to descend on the \n     ``fen-phen'' diet-pill manufacturers. There will be \n     ``thousands of lawsuits scattered all around the country,'' \n     one tort lawyer roared in the Journal yesterday. But before \n     this circus hits town, attention should be drawn to the one \n     now playing in Louisiana.\n       In a case that has already been dubbed the Great New \n     Orleans Train Robbery, 8,047 residents of the Big Easy hit \n     the jackpot, winning $3.4 billion in punitive damages in a\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\n     state court. Forget about McDonald's hot coffee and BMW's \n     paint job; the Louisiana train case is one of the wildest \n     examples yet of the craziness that infects our civil-justice \n     system.\n       If the accident that led to the huge award didn't get much \n     attention at the time, that was because nothing much \n     happened. On December 9, 1987, a tank car carrying butadiene, \n     a petroleum byproduct, caught on fire while standing on a \n     railway track in the Gentilly section of New Orleans. The \n     fire burned for 36 hours and about 1,000 neighborhood \n     residents were evacuated. No one died. No one was seriously \n     hurt. There was no significant property damage.\n       Within hours the personal-injury lawyers were on the scene \n     sniffing out clients, and the first lawsuit was filed before \n     the fire had even stopped burning. Ultimately, the class in \n     the suit decided last week ballooned to 8,047 people, seeking \n     compensation for the mental anguish that the incident \n     supposedly imposed on them.\n       Along the way, a much smaller group of plaintiffs ended up \n     in federal court, which dismissed a bunch of cases and \n     awarded several plaintiffs each about $1,000 in compensatory \n     damages. The court ruled against punitive damages. Reading \n     the writing on the wall, some of the original plaintiffs in \n     the federal case apparently jumped over to the state case as \n     soon as they realized they could shop for more money there.\n       There are nine defendants in the tank-car case, but the one \n     that got socked with by far the biggest judgment--$2.5 \n     billion in punitive damages--was CSX Transportation, a unit \n     of CSX Corp. Never mind that CSX's only connection to the \n     case was that it owned the track on which the tank car was \n     resting. Never mind that an investigation by the National \n     Transportation Safety Board concluded that CSX bore no \n     responsibility for the accident, which was cause by a faulty \n     gasket. And never mind that the owner and previous owner of \n     the tank car admitted liability for the accident at the \n     trial.\n       None of this reality mattered to the jury, which was \n     looking for someone with deep pockets. Stymied because it \n     couldn't go after the previous owner, which under state law \n     was exempt from punitive damages, it settled on CSX.\n       The jury, of course, was encouraged to reach this decision \n     by the plaintiff's lawyers, whose notion of justice has more \n     to do with how much money they can siphon off for themselves \n     than how much they can help their clients. The lawyer \n     representing many of the plaintiffs was one Wendell Gauthier, \n     the class-action king better known for masterminding the \n     Castano tobacco suit.\n       He and his colleagues were in high dudgeon, carrying on \n     about ``corporate greed,'' executives who travel in ``private \n     Lear Jets and their limos,'' and corporations that cared more \n     about the rich residents of the French Quarter than the \n     lower-middle-class, mostly black residents of Gentilly. \n     ``There is only one thing that will make a company that big \n     respond,'' said Mr. Gauthier in asking the jury for punitive \n     damages.\n       It's widely expected that Judge Wallace Edwards will \n     overturn or drastically reduce the verdict. One school of \n     thought opines that this means such unfair awards don't \n     really do any damage; courts usually rein in such irrational \n     exercises of jury power so all turns out well in the end. Or \n     does it? Each case sends a ripple through the civil-justice \n     system. It encourages fee-hungry plaintiff's lawyers to chase \n     crazier and crazier cases, and it encourages companies to \n     settle, no matter how outrageous the claim, if only to avoid \n     having to play Russian roulette in court.\n       Louisiana, recognizing the need to restore sanity to its \n     civil-justice system, last year enacted a comprehensive tort-\n     reform law that pretty much eliminates punitive damages. This \n     will have the welcome effect of reining in runaway juries and \n     neutralizing Mr. Gauthier and his fellow tort tycoons. But it \n     of course comes too late for CSX and the other defendants in \n     the Great New Orleans Train Robbery.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 9, 1997]\n\n              Jury Awards $3.4 Billion in 1987 Rail Blast\n\n       A jury awarded damages totaling $3.4 billion today to 8,000 \n     people who said they were injured mentally and physically by \n     a 1987 railroad tank car explosion.\n       Hardest hit by the award was rail firm CSX Transportation, \n     a unit of Richmond-based CSX Corp., which was ordered to pay \n     $2.5 billion.\n       The plaintiffs accused CSX Transportation and eight other \n     defendants of negligence in the Sept. 9, 1987, incident in \n     which a rail car carrying the petrochemical butadiene leaked \n     and caught fire.\n       Residents from nearly 200 blocks in New Orleans were \n     evacuated overnight. They said they suffered health problems \n     and mental anguish, which the defendants disputed.\n       Chicago-based defendant GATX Corp., which was ordered to \n     pay $190 million, said there were no deaths or significant \n     injuries and no major property damage occurred.\n       Defense attorney Brent Barriere said: ``This should have \n     been a case of reasonable damages for the inconvenience of \n     residents being out of their homes for about 36 hours. But it \n     was not reasonable. It was outrageous.''\n       Plaintiffs' attorney Wendell Gauthier said the companies \n     had been ``careless and indifferent'' to the people living \n     near the railroad. He said the accident was preceded by \n     ongoing mishandling of dangerous materials by the defendants.\n       CSX Transportation President A.R. Carpenter said in a \n     statement that the firm was ``very disappointed with this \n     decision. . . .It is clearly not consistent with the facts.\n       ``CSXT handled the leaking car in complete accordance with \n     very stringent federal safety standards. The National \n     Transportation Safety Board investigation into this accident \n     concluded the incident was not caused by CSXT,'' he said.\n       Juror Kimbra Whitney told reporters she thought the \n     defendants did not do enough to protect residents of the \n     area. ``I felt the evidence showed they were unconcerned,'' \n     she said.\n       Other defendants ordered to pay damages were Mitsui & Co., \n     $375 million; Alabama Great Southern Railway, $175 million; \n     and Illinois Railroad Co., $125 million.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Commonsense product liability reform is vital to the \nglobal competitiveness of American manufacturers and workers. U.S. \ncompanies face product liability insurance costs that are 20 to 50 \ntimes greater than those of our foreign competitors. Due to these high \ncosts, American many manufacturers spend more on litigation than on \nresearch and development and the American consumer is deprived of the \nhighest quality and most innovative product.\n  In addition, commonsense reform is vital to the health--in a very \nreal sense--of millions of Americans. In 1993, Jim Vincent, the \nchairman and CEO of Biogen, indicated to this committee that his \ncompany decided not to pursue research into the development of an AIDS \nvaccine, because of the current U.S. product liability system. In \naddition, availability of many biomaterials such as silicone, \npolyester, dacron, and rubber that are used in lifesaving medical \nimplant devices is being threatened by our current product liability \nsystem.\n  Despite years of effort, the only Federal tort reform we have been \nable to accomplish has been in the areas of food donations, securities \nlitigation, general aviation aircraft, and individual volunteer \nliability. The one area of reform that has been, in effect, long enough \nfor us to measure its results is the General Aviation Revitalization \nAct of 1994, which was signed by President Clinton on August 17, 1994.\n  The aviation liability reform bill enacted a statute of repose for \ngeneral aviation aircraft. In 1994, proponents of the bill said that it \nwould produce jobs. It has. To date, over 9,000 new jobs, good jobs, \nhave been created. Single engine aircraft are being manufactured in \nAmerican again, and an endangered industry has been revitalized. \nPresident Clinton was right to support that bill. Let us bring the \nresults of the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994 to the broad \nsegments of our country and industries.\n  The principles which we begin this conversation should be based on \nmaking the product liability laws in this Nation fair for consumers who \npurchase defective products while placing the burden on those \nresponsible for putting these products into the stream of commerce. We \nalso should seek to ensure that those who misuse products, or use them \nwhile under the influence of drugs or alcohol, do not collect a \nwindfall which becomes a burden for American consumers in the form of \nincreased costs for products--useful products that are no longer \navailable in the market, and the loss of jobs and greater \nopportunities.\n  We should not affect the ability of plaintiffs to sue manufacturers \nor sellers of medical implants. Rather, we should allow raw materials \nsuppliers to be dismissed from lawsuits if the generic raw material \nused in the medical device met contract specifications, and if the \nbiomaterial supplier is not classified as either a manufacturer or \nseller of the implant.\n  Strong product liability reform is good for America. It ensures that \nconsumers, injured by a product, will be fairly compensated. It will \nenhance American innovation, which is the best in the world, by \ntreating responsible entrepreneurs fairly while treating the bad actors \nharshly and to the full extent of the law.\n  As chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee I am committed and \nlook forward to working with members of this committee, on both sides \nof the aisle, and with the administration toward ending the 20-year \nstudy and painstaking endeavor to provide our Nation with sound and \nfair Federal\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nproduct liability law. It took the European community about 6 years to \naccomplish this goal and create the European Product Liability \nDirective. Japan enacted its first product liability reform law almost \n2 years ago. Our Nation, this Congress, and this administration should \npull together and meet the challenge of our foreign competitors and \nenact fair and balanced product liability law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10053-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to add my name to the list of \ncosponsors of S. 1133, the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act, \nintroduced by Senator Coverdell, and ask unanimous consent that my name \nbe added. This bill will allow families to invest in education savings \naccounts, or A-Plus accounts, for their kids' K through 12 expenses.\n  Mr. President, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provides several \neducation-related tax provisions for students and their families. Yet \nthese provisions are mainly aimed at making higher education more \naffordable. While I am all for student loan interest deductions and tax \ncredits for 2- and 4-year degrees, K through 12 education is not cheap \neither, and families could greatly benefit by saving up through A-Plus \naccounts. But for a last minute veto threat of the entire balanced \nbudget act, families would have the option of savings accounts for \ntheir kids' future.\n  Why are education savings accounts a good idea? For the same reason \ntax credits for college expenses are a good idea: They help families \nafford a quality education for their kids. These A-Plus accounts can be \nused for public, private, and home schooling education expenses. \nQualified expenses include tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs \nservices, books, supplies, equipment, and transportation. This will \nmean a lot to hard-working families trying to make ends meet.\n  Opponents like to equate education savings accounts with vouchers, \nand they consistently use the terms interchangeably as if they are one \nand the same. This is a red herring. Unlike vouchers, education savings \naccounts would not redirect State or local funds otherwise available \nfor public education. To the contrary, I believe public school students \nwill greatly benefit by saving money for general school expenses. And \nfrom what I'm hearing, families across the country agree with me. Let \nme reiterate: We are talking here about using one's own hard-earned \nmoney for education expenses, not diverting public funds that would \notherwise be spent on public schools.\n  Now, I do not support the use of vouchers in Montana because I \nbelieve they would disrupt public school financing and the costs to our \npublic schools would outweigh the benefits to our students. But this is \na separate issue, and one better left to the Montana Legislature.\n  Opponents have also claimed that education savings accounts would \nviolate the establishment clause of the Constitution because Federal \ndollars would indirectly benefit religious schools. I'll simply respond \nby saying that under that reasoning, any federal financial aid to \nstudents attending Marquette, Georgetown, or Brigham Young would also \nviolate the Constitution. We all know that is not the case.\n  Although we were blocked from including education savings accounts in \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act, thanks to the efforts of Senator Coverdell we \nwill have another chance to send this bill to the President. At that \ntime we will have the chance to show our support for America's families \nby making education more affordable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10055-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10055-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  A message from the House of Representatives, delivered by one of its \nreading clerks, announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2266.

A bill to protect personal employment information reported \nto the National Directory of New Hires; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\n            the employee information protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Employee \nInformation Protection Act of 1997. This bill will correct a serious \nproblem with the 1996 welfare reform law that threatens the privacy of \nevery American.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues are aware of the fact that \nthe new welfare reform law created a national new hire directory, which \nrequires States to collect the name, address, and Social Security \nnumber of all newly hired employees and send this information to \nWashington, DC. This new hire directory will be housed at the Social \nSecurity Administration, under agreement with the Office of Child \nSupport Enforcement, and the data will be checked against a registry of \nchild support cases to detect overdue payments.\n  Concerns with this new hire directory nearly killed the welfare \nreform bill in the Montana Legislature and in several other State \nlegislatures, but folks inside the Beltway do not seem too concerned. \nBut I am concerned, and I will tell you why.\n  I am all for tracking down deadbeat parents and recovering overdue \nchild support. But this new directory covers every new hire in every \nState and does not distinguish between deadbeats and nondeadbeats. \nWhat's more, the new law puts no limits on how long employee data may \nremain in the national new hire directory, and the Office of Child \nSupport Enforcement has not developed any limits. It is especially \nalarming to me that in addition to the Office of Child Support \nEnforcement and the Social Security Administration, the Treasury \nDepartment has access to the directory and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services has the discretion to provide researchers access to the \ndirectory. With the revelations this week at the Finance Committee \nhearings of abuse of taxpayer information at the IRS, it is urgent that \nwe take measures to protect personal information from abuse.\n  The Employee Information Protection Act is simple--in fact it is only \none sentence long, not counting the findings. That sentence reads: \n``Information entered into such database shall be deleted 6 months \nafter the date of entry.'' That is it. This 6-month limit on retention \nof new hire data would give the Child Support Office sufficient time to \ncheck employee data against the child support case registry and start \ncollection efforts on the deadbeats. At the same time, it will provide \nsome protection for the personal information of the vast majority of \nAmericans who do not owe child support.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a good look at this situation and if you \nhave concerns as I do, join me in sponsoring the Employee Information \nProtection Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that Monday's New York \nTimes article on the new hire directory be inserted into the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Employee Information \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. \n     2105) requires Federal and State child support enforcement \n     agencies to implement new programs to collect overdue child \n     support payment, thereby reducing the burden on taxpayers by \n     lowering welfare payments.\n       (2) Among the new programs created under such Act and the \n     amendments made by such Act, is the National Directory of New \n     Hires, to be administered by the Social Security \n     Administration, under agreement with the Office of Child \n     Support Enforcement of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services. Under this program, States are required to develop \n     a reporting system whereby employers must report to their \n     respective States the name, address, and social security \n     number of all newly hired employees. States must forward the \n     new hire data within 3 days of receipt to the National \n     Directory of New Hires, where the data will be checked \n     against the Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders to \n     detect overdue child support.\n       (3) The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 does not limit how long employee \n     data may remain in the National Directory of New Hires, and \n     the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services has not developed any such limits \n     as of September 15, 1997. In addition to the Office of Child \n     Support Enforcement of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and the Social Security Administration, the \n     Department of the Treasury has access to the directory and \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the discretion \n     to provide researchers access to the directory.\n       (4) The overwhelming majority of newly hired individuals do \n     not have child support orders entered against them, yet their \n     personal data can be viewed by Federal agencies without such \n     individuals' knowledge or consent.\n       (5) Recent disclosures of unauthorized viewing of taxpayer \n     information by officials of the Internal Revenue Service \n     highlight the potential for abuse of such information and the \n     need for safeguarding measures.\n       (6) Several States with new hire reporting programs have \n     time limits on data retention ranging from 6 to 9 months.\n       (7) A 6-month limit on retention of new hire data in the \n     National Directory of New Hires, from the date such data is \n     entered, would allow sufficient time to check the data \n     against the Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders and \n     to initiate action against individuals with overdue child \n     support, and would reduce the potential for abuse and misuse \n     of the data.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to safeguard \n     personal information concerning employees who do not have \n     child support orders pending against them by placing a \n     reasonable time limit on the retention of new hire data \n     reported to the National Directory of New Hires.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMIT ON NEW HIRE DATA RETENTION.\n\n       (a) Requirement To Delete Data After 6 Months.--Section \n     453(i)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 653(i)(2)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following: ``Information \n     entered into such database shall be deleted 6 months after \n     the date of entry.''.\n       [(b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of title \n     III of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. \n     2198).]\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 22, 1997]\n\n           U.S. Inaugurating a Vast Database of All New Hires\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, Sept. 20.--Enforcement of child support \n     obligations enters a new era on Oct. 1, when the Federal \n     Government will start operating a computerized directory \n     showing every person newly hired by every employer in the \n     country so Federal and state investigators can track down \n     parents who owe money to their children.\n       States will be able to use the directory to locate parents \n     and dun them, typically by securing court orders to employers \n     to deduct child support from wages and salaries.\n       Keeping track of parents who move from state to state is \n     one of the most difficult tasks in collecting child support, \n     officials say. More than 30 percent of the 19 million child \n     support cases involve parents who do not live in the same \n     state as their children.\n       President Clinton will soon announce the National Directory \n     of New Hires, which is required by the 1996 welfare law. But \n     the director is not just for welfare recipients. It will \n     record basic information, including names, addresses, Social \n     Security numbers and wages, for everyone hired after Oct. 1 \n     for a full- or part-time job by an employer of any size.\n       It will be one of the largest, most up-to-date files of \n     personal information kept by the Government. Michael Kharfen, \n     a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     said the Government expected to receive data on 60 million \n     newly hired employees a year. Wages must be reported every \n     three months; the Government expects to receive 160 million \n     wage reports each quarter.\n       The size and scope of the database have raised concerns \n     about the potential for intrusions on privacy.\n       Federal and state officials predict that the new Federal \n     directory, combined with similar directories in all states, \n     will produce billions of dollars in new child support \n     payments. States like New York, Virginia, Texas and Missouri, \n     which have required the reporting of newly hired workers in \n     the last few years, say the procedure has been extremely \n     helpful in locating absent parents.\n       In New York, Daniel D. Hogan, a spokesman for the state's \n     Department of Family Assistance, said that three million \n     people had been hired in the last year and that more than 5 \n     percent of them had been found, through matching of computer \n     files, to owe child support.\n       When people change jobs, Mr. Hogan said, New York officials \n     inform the new employers of any child support obligations so \n     the money can immediately be withheld from wages.\n       ``We don't give them an opportunity to become deadbeats,'' \n     Mr. Hogan said. ``The biggest problem facing us in child \n     support enforcement is people who move out of state. The best \n     part of the Federal reform is that it will allow us to break \n     down barriers state to state.''\n       Health and Human Services will maintain a separate register \n     listing everyone who\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\n     owes or is owed child support. It will check each new \n     employee against the list of child support orders to see if \n     the worker owes any money.\n       Thomas D. Neal, a child support specialist in the Texas \n     Attorney General's office, said: ``The national directory \n     will tremendously enhance our ability to locate absent \n     parents and collect child support. Before now, we did not \n     have a good mechanism to know that another state was looking \n     for an individual who might be working in Texas.''\n       Virginia has required the reporting of all newly hired \n     employees since 1993. Patricia Addison, manager of operations \n     for the state's child support program, said, ``We've found it \n     an invaluable tool.''\n       The State of Virginia is routinely informed whenever a \n     person takes a new job. By contrast, Ms. Addison said, in the \n     past, ``the only way we found out that the father had changed \n     jobs is that the child support payments stopped.''\n       Despite the enthusiasm of state officials, Robert M. \n     Gellman, an expert on privacy and information policy, \n     expressed concern that the new data would be misused.\n       ``The Government is creating a gigantic new database with \n     very broad uses and very little attention paid to the \n     protection of personal privacy,'' he said. ``Private \n     detectives will find a friend in the police department or a \n     child welfare office to give them access to information in \n     the directory of new hires. That already happens with \n     criminal, medical and credit records.''\n       Mr. Gellman predicted that Congress would increase the \n     number of people authorized to use the new directory, just as \n     it has expanded the list of officials with access to Federal \n     tax return information over the years.\n       Under Federal law, state welfare and child support \n     officials will have access to the new national directory. The \n     Internal Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration \n     and the Justice Department will also have access for some \n     purposes.\n       A parent living with a child will be able to use the \n     directory to get information about an absent parent who owes \n     child support. For example, a mother with custody of a child \n     will be able to ascertain the father's home address, the name \n     and address of his employer and the amount of the father's \n     income, assets and debts. Using such information, the mother \n     may ask a local court to modify the child's support order if \n     the father's earnings have increased.\n       In Missouri, child support collections rose 17 percent, to \n     $279 million, in 1996 after the state required reporting of \n     newly hired workers. Teresa L. Kaiser, director of the \n     Missouri program, said, ``We had a big increase in \n     collections from `job jumpers,' parents who want work in one \n     place for a few months, then move to another job before we \n     could get a wage-withholding order.''\n       States say the reporting of new employees not only \n     increases child support collections, but also saves money in \n     other programs. State officials can often reduce or eliminate \n     payments for welfare, food stamps, unemployment insurance and \n     Medicaid after learning that the recipients of such aid have \n     been hired.\n       Under Federal law, the hiring of a new employee must be \n     reported within 20 days to state authorities, who then have 8 \n     days to send the data to Washington. States may establish \n     tighter deadlines for employers, and many have done so.\n       Collections through the Federal child support program \n     increased last year by 50 percent, to $12 billion, from $8 \n     billion in 1992. But nationwide, only half of the families \n     with child support orders receive the full amount due, and \n     millions get nothing.\n       Here is how the new program will work:\n       Employers may file information by mail or magnetic tape. \n     States may also take the information over the telephone, by \n     fax or through the Internet.\n       An employer who fails to report new employees may be fined \n     $25 for each newly hired worker. An employer who conspires \n     with an employee to flout the reporting requirements may be \n     fined $500.\n       A multistate employer may file a report with one state \n     listing all of its hiring across the country. Or, it may file \n     a separate report for each new employee in the state where \n     the person works.\n       The Federal Government will require only six items of \n     information: the name, address and Social Security number of \n     each newly hired employee, the employer's name and address \n     and the identification number assigned to the employer by the \n     Government.\n       But many states are requiring employers to file additional \n     information, like telephone numbers, dates of birth, driver's \n     license number and details of health insurance coverage \n     provided to new employers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1224. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to ensure full Federal \ncompliance with that Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n             the facility superfund compliance act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, today, I am introducing, with the \nSenator from Oregon, Ron Wyden, legislation to ensure that Federal \nagencies comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act.\n  This same legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives for several years by my home State colleague, Dan \nSchaefer. His leadership in this area has been very important.\n  This legislation is very important to the country, but particularly \nto Colorado, where we have had several problems with the Federal \nGovernment applying one standard for themselves, and a different higher \nstandard on private parties. I think this is unfair and should be \nchanged. I've always believed that Superfund reform would be easier if \nall parties were in the same bathtub with the same scrub brush.\n  I've tried to address Colorado's problems with EPA, but unfortunately \nI've had little success in getting their attention. One example I have \nbrought to their attention was a former research institute at the \nColorado School of Mines in Golden, CO. The research institute at \nGolden was shut down in the late 1980's after years of research had \nbeen done by the School of Mines, private entities, and several \nagencies of the Federal Government, including the Environmental \nProtection Agency [EPA].\n  After the site ceased doing research various environmental \ncontaminants were found at the site and in 1992 there was an accident \nthat resulted in the contents of a holding pond spilling into Clear \nCreek. While there was no contamination found in Clear Creek, the EPA \nhad an emergency response cleanup contractor remove approximately \n22,000 cubic yards of material from the pond and had it placed in a \ntemporary stockpile. The EPA then issued a unilateral administrative \norder [UAO] for its disposal. Despite the fact that EPA, the Department \nof Energy, the Department of Defense, and the Bureau of Mines did \nresearch at the site none of them were the subject of the UAO, even \nthough the Bureau of Mines was identified as a potentially responsible \nparty [PRP]. Only the State of Colorado, the Colorado School of Mines, \nand the private parties were subject to the UAO. To put it plainly, the \nEPA stuck everyone but their sister agencies with a bill for millions \non cleanup.\n  In the case of the State of Colorado, they have appropriated a total \nof $7.465 million for cleanup to cover their costs and the costs the \nFederal Government should be paying. It's my view that this money could \nbe spent much better, or not spent at all. However, to have the State \nspend it because EPA won't enforce and Federal agencies won't be \nresponsible is unacceptable. There is also another case in Colorado \ninvolving a Superfund site in Leadville. Leadville is a small town that \nwas the home of Baby Doe Tabor and formerly was the site of a large \namount of mining. While there is still some mining that occurs in \nLeadville, they are also beginning to rely more on tourism dollars.\n  Unfortunately, the city has a stigma attached to it; it is a \nSuperfund site. All the homes are a Superfund site, all the schools are \na Superfund site, all the restaurants are a Superfund site, all the \nbusinesses on the main street are a Superfund site. They've been told \nthat because of various mounds of old tailings laying around, the \nentire city has to be on the national priority list. It's interesting \nto note though, that the safety concerns of EPA seem to stop short when \nit comes to Federal responsibility. This story is one of two water \ntreatment plants, one Federal, one private. The private plant, because \nit's on the Superfund site was built at much greater cost than the \nFederal plant, which is conveniently just outside the Superfund site. \nThis is despite the fact that the level of contamination is basically \nequal at both locations. While the EPA disputes this claim, the people \nwho live in Leadville and work at the cleanup site know the difference.\n  In case I'm accused of relying on anecdotes for this legislation let \nme describe two documents that found their way into my office. Let me \ndescribe them in reverse chronological order, the first is an August 2, \n1996, memorandum which subject is, ``Documentation of Reason(s) for Not \nIssuing CERCLA 106 UAO's to All Identified PRP's.'' I want to quote a \nfootnote in this document; it states that, ``Pursuant to the applicable \nprocedures, DOJ must concur with any EPA decision to issue a UAO under \nCERCLA section 106\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\nto a Federal agency.'' So if DOJ doesn't concur EPA won't act. So it is \nrevealing to note that a December 15, 1994, letter from a region VIII \nattorney stated that, ``It is my understanding, however, that DOJ has \nnever approved of the issuance of a unilateral order to a Federal \nagency.''\n  By the Federal Government's own admission they will not enforce \nagainst a sister agency. Since there is no environmental ``cop on the \nbeat'' for Federal agencies, the Federal Government should be relieved \nof their immunity against lawsuits and be treated the same as any \nprivate party. That includes having to comply with laws that elected \nState legislatures enact. This is what this legislation does. It is my \nintention to see it enacted into law as quickly as possible.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for joining me in this \neffort.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in 1992, Congress enacted the Federal \nFacilities Compliance Act, which requires Federal facilities to obey \nkey environmental laws including the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct and State hazardous waste laws.\n  However, subsequent Federal court decisions threaten to undermine the \nimportant principle that Federal Government facilities must comply with \nthe same environmental laws that govern the private sector. In fact, \none court decision that covers the Hanford Nuclear Reservation would \nallow Hanford to poison the water, pollute the air and contaminate the \nsoil for decades, and be immunized for any violations that occur before \nthe Hanford cleanup is completed sometime in the next century.\n  This court ruling allowed the interagency agreement among the Energy \nDepartment, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington \nDepartment of Ecology that governs the Hanford cleanup to be used as a \nshield to block an enforcement action against the Energy Department for \nviolations of the Clean Water Act.\n  The Energy Department's use of interagency agreement to bar \nenforcement of environmental laws not only undermines the Federal \nFacilities Compliance Act but also puts at risk the health of citizens \nwho live downstream or downwind from Hanford, and near other Federal \nfacilities around the country.\n  Madam President, we also have a double standard here. The Superfund \nlaw only authorizes interagency agreements for Federal facilities; \nthere is no comparable provision and no comparable immunity from \nenforcement for private sector sites.\n  Today, Senator Allard and I are introducing the Federal Facilities \nSuperfund Compliance Act to put an end to this double standard. Our \nlegislation makes clear that Federal Government facilities are subject \nto the same environmental cleanup laws that apply to the private \nsector. And they are subject to the law now, not sometime off in the \nfuture.\n  Under this legislation, an interagency agreement, such as the Hanford \nTri-Party Agreement, can no longer be used as a means to evade other \nenvironmental requirements.\n  Our legislation also makes clear that if Federal facilities fail to \nmeet their obligations, States and affected citizens will be able to \nenforce against the Federal Government for these violations just as \nthey would be able to enforce against private parties for violations of \nenvironmental laws at a private sector Superfund site.\n  Our citizens who live in the shadow of contaminated Federal \nfacilities should not have to wait years or decades to obtain the \nhealth and environmental protections our laws are supposed to provide. \nI urge all our colleagues to support this important legislation to \nprovide citizens who live downwind or downstream from Federal \nfacilities equal protection under our environmental laws.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. \n        Gramm):\n\n\n               the department of commerce dismantling act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, for 3 years now, the Department of \nCommerce has been the target of critics in Congress and around the \ncountry. With the completion of the Balanced Budget Act and the tight \ndiscretionary budgets mandated by that law, I believe it is time once \nagain to raise the question of Commerce's ongoing existence.\n  Is it necessary to have our Nation's weather and mapping services \nhoused in the same department as our trade promotion activities, or \nwould the American people be better served by smaller, tighter agencies \nwith more clearly defined objectives? I suggest that through \ncomprehensive restructuring we can both better serve the American \npeople and help keep the budget within the spending targets that are \nnow law.\n  Why terminate the Department of Commerce? The debate over the past 3 \nyears has provided us with a simple answer: It's the least defensible \ndepartment in a Government littered with wasteful, unnecessary \ndepartments. Its bureaucracy is bloated, its infrastructure is in \ndisrepair, and its resources are strained to encompass numerous \nactivities that have absolutely nothing to do with commerce or trade. \nFormer Commerce Department officials, the General Accounting Office, \nand the inspector general have repeatedly testified before Congress \nthat the Department of Commerce suffers from mismanagement, \nduplication, and a general lack of accountability. Confronted with this \nweight of evidence, I believe that the Commerce Department cannot be \nreinvented. Instead, the only responsible action is dismantle the \nDepartment to better serve the Congress and the American people.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill along with Senators Brownback, Kyl, \nFaircloth, Gramm, Nickles, Allard, Hutchinson, and Hagel which targets \nthis waste and duplication. It transfers those functions that can be \nbetter served elsewhere, consolidates duplicative agencies, and \neliminates the remaining unnecessary or wasteful programs. Preliminary \nestimates indicate the bill will save about $2.5 billion over the next \n5 years. How does it achieve these savings?\n  First, it eliminates unnecessary, duplicative and wasteful programs \nsuch as the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and \nTourism Administration, the Technology Administration, and the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration.\n  Second, it takes NOAA--which comprises the lion's share of the \nDepartment's activities--out from under the Department umbrella. Many \nof the functions under NOAA, including the Nation's weather service, \nare vital activities that all observers agree should be carried on. As \nan independent agency, NOAA will have the opportunity to focus on these \ncore functions, free to achieve the savings necessary to fulfill its \nresponsibilities.\n  Third, it rationalizes U.S. trade policy by consolidating the \nInternational Trade Administration, the Bureau of Export \nAdministration, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative within \nthe U.S. Trade Administration. Currently, 19 Federal agencies are \ncharged with promoting trade, but only 8 percent of total Federal \nspending on trade promotion is directed by Commerce. The bill before us \ntakes a dramatic step toward consolidating our existing trade \nactivities, achieving the administrative savings necessary to \nrationalize our trade promotion efforts and make them more effective.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a new Federal Statistical Service by \ncombining the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis \nwith the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Department of Labor. It \nalso creates within the service a Federal Council on Statistical Policy \nto advise the service and Congress on statistical issues. Once again, \nthe goal is to consolidate functions of the Federal Government that \nhave been dispersed across the Federal Government. It's a more \nrational, efficient means of accomplishing these tasks.\n  Mr. President, some have argued that this effort will handicap \nAmerican businesses by depriving them of their chief advocate in \nWashington. That's nonsense. Businessmen and women across this country \nunderstand what's necessary to promote economic growth and jobs--and \nit's not another Government handout.\n  As Jim Barrett, president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce stated: \n``Of all the priorities that the Congress can set to assist Michigan \nbusiness, keeping the Commerce Department is not even on the radar \nscreen.\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\n* * * A balanced budget with lower interest rates will do much more \nthan the Department of Commerce as it is presently structured ever \ncould.''\n  A poll conducted by the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce indicates \nMr. Barrett wasn't just speaking for himself. Forty-seven percent of \nthose polled support eliminating the Department of Commerce--while only \n6 percent were opposed. That is a ratio of almost 8 to 1 in favor of \neliminating the Department of Commerce.\n  The lesson of the Commerce Department is simple. Absent clearly \ndefined responsibilities and goals, the Department has become the \nresting place for the odds and ends of the Federal Government. In the \nprocess, it has provided shelter for numerous programs that do not \nserve the American people well.\n  This legislation targets those programs, unburdening the taxpayer \nfrom being forced to continue their subsidy, while freeing the more \nworthy programs to better accomplish their jobs. This legislation is an \nexercise in good government, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act--Highlights\n\n       Terminates unnecessary department agencies: Eliminates the \n     Technology Administration, the Minority Business Development \n     Administration, the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration, and the Economic Development \n     Administration.\n       Eliminates wasteful department programs: Eliminates the \n     Office of Technology Policy, the Advanced Technology Program, \n     the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, the Federal \n     Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer, the Metric \n     Program, the NOAA Corps, the NOAA Fleet, grant programs under \n     the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration, and ocean and atmospheric grant programs.\n       Consolidates trade functions: Rationalizes U.S. trade \n     policy by consolidating the International Trade \n     Administration, the Bureau of Export Administration, the \n     Office of the United States Trade Representative, and \n     spectrum management within the United States Trade \n     Administration.\n       Consolidates oceanographic, atmospheric and scientific \n     functions within a newly independent National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration: Consolidates the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, the National Bureau of \n     Standards (formerly the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology), spectrum research and analysis functions of the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration, \n     and the Office of Space Commerce. Core functions of NOAA, \n     such as fisheries management and the National Weather \n     Service, are preserved.\n       Consolidates statistical functions: Establishes a new \n     Federal Statistical Service by combining the Bureau of the \n     Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis with the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics from the Department of Labor. Also creates \n     within the Service a Federal Council on Statistical Policy to \n     advise the Service and Congress on statistical issues.\n       Corporatizes the Patent and Trademark Office: Establishes a \n     fee-funded, wholly owned government corporation, based on \n     legislation reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     this year.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The terminations, transfers and consolidations called for \n     by this bill are to be completed over a thirty-six month \n     period under the direction of the Office of Management and \n     Budget.\n\n                        Administrative functions\n\n       The office of the Secretary, General Counsel, Inspector \n     General, and other administrative functions are terminated \n     six months after enactment of this bill.\n\n                  Economic Development Administration\n\n       The EDA provides grants and assistance to loosely-defined \n     ``economically depressed'' regions. EDA's functions are \n     duplicated by numerous other federal agencies including the \n     Departments of Agriculture, HUD, and Interior, the Small \n     Business Administration, the Tennessee Valley Authority and \n     the Appalachian Regional Commission. The parochial nature of \n     the program often targets EDA grants to locations with \n     healthy economies which do not need federal assistance. The \n     EDA is terminated within this bill.\n\n                 National Technical Information Service\n\n       The National Technical Information Service is transferred \n     to the Office of Budget and Management for privatization. If \n     an appropriate arrangement for the privatization of functions \n     of the NTIS is not made within 18 months, then the Service is \n     transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration and OMB is directed to provide legislation to \n     Congress that would transform NTIS into a government-owned \n     corporation.\n\n              Bureaus of the Census and economic analysis\n\n       The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis would \n     be transferred, along with the Bureau of Labor Statistics to \n     the newly created Federal Statistical Service, beginning the \n     process of consolidating the federal government's statistical \n     functions. The bill then requires the President to study and \n     propose legislation to further the consolidation of these \n     functions.\n\n                  Minority Business Development Agency\n\n       Although MBDA has spent hundreds of millions on management \n     assistance--not capital assistance--since 1971, the program \n     has never been formally authorized by Congress. The MBDA's \n     stated mission, to help minority-owned businesses get \n     government contracts, is duplicated by such agencies and \n     programs as the Small Business Administration, and Small \n     Business Development Centers, along with the private sector. \n     The MBDA would be terminated.\n\n                       Technology Administration\n\n       The Technology Administration currently works with industry \n     to promote the use and development of new technology. The \n     federal government is poorly equipped to ``pick winners and \n     losers'' in the marketplace. This agency is terminated, \n     including the Offices of Technology Policy, Technology \n     Commercialization, and Technology Evaluation and Assessment.\n\n             National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\n       The National Institute of Standards and Technology is \n     redesignated as the National Bureau of Standards and \n     transferred to the newly independent NOAA. The Advanced \n     Technology Program (ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension \n     Partnerships are terminated; these programs are often cited \n     as prime examples of corporate welfare, wherein the federal \n     government invests in applied research and product \n     development programs which should be conducted in the private \n     sector.\n\n       National Telecommunications and Information Administration\n\n       The NTIA, an advisory body on national telecommunications \n     policy, would be terminated, including its grant programs. \n     Federal spectrum research and analysis functions would be \n     transferred to the National Bureau of Standards while federal \n     spectrum management functions would be made an independent \n     arm of the Federal Communications Commission. Finally, NTIA's \n     laboratories would be moved to the OMB for privatization. If \n     a suitable arrangement is not made within 18 months, they \n     would be moved to NOAA.\n\n                      Patent and Trademark Office\n\n       Providing for patents and trademarks is a constitutionally-\n     mandated government function. This bill would establish the \n     PTO as a government-owned corporation and require the PTO to \n     be supported completely through fee collection. This text is \n     the same as S. 507 reported by the Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary earlier this year.\n\n            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n       The bill establishes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration as an independent agency. Consolidated within \n     the newly independent National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration are the National Bureau of Standards (formerly \n     the National Institute of Standards and Technology), spectrum \n     research and analysis functions of the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration, and the \n     Office of Space Commerce.\n       Core functions of NOAA, such as fisheries management and \n     the National Weather Service, are preserved, while outdated \n     programs like the NOAA Corps, NOAA Fleet, and 30 other \n     atmospheric programs are terminated.\n\n                   United States Trade Administration\n\n       The Department of Commerce claims to be the lead in U.S. \n     Trade policy, but actually only plays a small part. Five \n     percent of Commerce's budget is dedicated to trade promotion, \n     and it comprises only 8 percent of total federal spending on \n     trade promotion. Furthermore, nineteen different federal \n     agencies have trade responsibilities.\n       Our legislation would begin the process of consolidating \n     and rationalizing federal trade policy by combining the \n     Bureau of Export Administration, the International Trade \n     Administration, and the United States Trade Representative \n     under the same roof, the United States Trade Administration. \n     The U.S. Trade Representative would retain its current \n     Cabinet and Ambassador status.\n       In an additional attempt to make our trade policies more \n     coherent, the USTR would serve as a member of the Board of \n     Directors of the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation. Finally, the bill requires the \n     President to transmit a plan to Congress to consolidate other \n     federal export promotion activities and export financing \n     activities and how to transfer those functions to the USTA.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Department \nof Commerce Dismantling Act as an original cosponsor. This legislation \ncontinues the battle to do away with unneeded government and wasteful \nspending. Over a 3-year period the Department of Commerce would be \ndismantled. Certain programs would be transferred or consolidated into \nagencies or departments that are better suited to handle them. Other \nprograms and agencies would be terminated altogether. Unnecessary \nagencies and several tiers of bureaucracy would be\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\neliminated. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nabolishment of the Department of Commerce would save taxpayers more \nthan $2 billion over 4 years. I commend Senator Brownback for his \nleadership in crafting this legislation to abolish the Department of \nCommerce.\n  Today the Department of Commerce is a 31,000 person department \ncosting American taxpayers $4 billion annually. Sixty of these \nemployees have the rank of deputy assistant secretary or higher and \nhave annual salaries of at least $96,000 each.\n  During my campaign, I ran on the ideals of less government, lower \ntaxes, fewer Federal regulations and more personal responsibility. To \nobtain such goals, I called for the abolishment of four Federal \ndepartments including the Departments of Commerce, and Energy. Earlier \nthis year I signed on as an original cosponsor to legislation to \nabolish the Department of Energy, sponsored by Senator Rod Grams.\n  The Department of Commerce, as we know it today, was created in 1913 \nduring the Woodrow Wilson administration to help promote American \nbusinesses around the world. Today, only 5 percent of the Department's \nnearly $4 billion budget is dedicated to trade promotion. By comparison \n$2 billion is spent annually out of the Department's budget on the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, there \nare 19 other Federal agencies that hold some jurisdiction over trade. \nTrade is now a small part of the Department of Commerce.\n  America's future lies in trade, but the Department of Commerce's \nbureaucracy is a relic of the past. This legislation attempts to \ncorrect that by consolidating trade functions under a single agency, \nthe United States Trade Administration, and eliminating the waste, \nbureaucracy, and duplication we have today in the Department of \nCommerce.\n  The time has come to abolish the Department of Commerce. We cannot \ncontinue to waste tax payers' dollars on outdated inefficient, and \nredundant programs. Taxpayers deserve better.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Abraham in \nintroducing the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act. This \nlegislation was completed after months of research and hearings in \nwhich we investigated the many costly structural, managerial, and \nprogrammatic problems confronting the Department. We have concluded \nthat these problems are so severe and systemic that the department \ncannot be reinvented. To provide American taxpayers with the services \nthey require at the level of efficiency and quality they demand, the \nDepartment of Commerce must be dismantled.\n  The Department of Commerce is a hodgepodge of unrelated functions and \nmissions ranging from antidumping investigations to zebra mussel \nresearch. It is comprised of 11 unrelated agencies, overseeing more \nthan 100 programs, catering to more than 1,000 customer bases, and \noverlapping the work of 71 other Government offices and agencies. This \nentire agglomeration is unmanageable, and diminishes the quality of \nthose Commerce functions which must be provided by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  For example, historically, Secretaries of Commerce have focused their \nattention almost exclusively on the Department's trade functions. \nHowever, trade activities only account for 8 percent of the \nDepartment's budget, and Commerce accounts for less than 6 percent of \ntotal Federal spending on trade. Commerce is just one of 19 Federal \nagencies involved in trade issues, and isn't even regarded as the lead \ntrade agency--the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is.\n  However, while Secretaries of Commerce travel abroad on foreign trade \nmissions, serious management problems have languished at Commerce \nheadquarters. For example, in 1992 the General Accounting Office \nindicated that the National Weather Service modernization program and \nthe Decennial Census--two important functions--were both experiencing \nsevere management failures. Today, 5 years later, both of these \nprograms remain on GAO's list of high-risk government management \nproblems. This year, before the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nSubcommittee on Government Management, which I chair, the Department of \nCommerce's inspector general testified ``I think it is fair to say that \nthere is little Departmental leadership or oversight in key \nadministrative areas.''\n  Mr. President, in part as a result of this lack of leadership, the \nDepartment has also initiated or continued to perform functions which \nare not just mismanaged, but are unnecessary. In fact, in many \ninstances, the Department which professes to be the advocate for \nAmerica's business has gone into competition with them. In testimony \nbefore the Subcommittee on Government Management, representatives from \nthe private mapping, weather forecasting and venture capital industries \nstated that the Department of Commerce routinely competes with \ncompanies in their fields. Because taxpayers unknowingly subsidize the \nDepartments commercial ventures, Commerce is a formidable competitor \nfor small businesses. By going into business, Commerce also misuses \ntaxpayer resources that should be devoted to truly governmental \nfunctions.\n  Other functions performed in the Department of Commerce are just a \nwaste of taxpayer dollars. For example, the Advanced Technology Program \nprovides handouts to America's largest and wealthiest corporations to \ndo product development research. This program is corporate welfare, \nplain and simple, and should be terminated. The Economic Development \nAdministration duplicates the efforts of dozens of other economic \ndevelopment programs around the Federal Government.\n  And finally, the Department of Commerce has become entirely too \npoliticized. Most employees at Commerce are dedicated public servants. \nHowever, too many of their leaders obtained their jobs when political \nconnections prevailed over the public good.\n  The Department of Commerce began in 1902 and has evolved over the \npast 94 years into an agency which has no clear mission or \nresponsibility, and is too unmanageable to reform. I believe the \nDepartment of Commerce Dismantling Act is the next necessary step in \nthat evolution. The Commerce Department Dismantling Act would retain \nthe important functions which are performed in Commerce, it \nconsolidates many important functions with those performed elsewhere in \nthe Federal Government, and it eliminates the waste. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1228. A bill to provide for a 10-year circulating commemorative \ncoin program to commemorate each of the 50 States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              THE 50 STATES COMMEMORATIVE COIN PROGRAM ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce legislation \nwith Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Banking Committee, to create a \ncirculating commemorative quarter representing each of the 50 states. \nLast year, legislation was enacted which instructed the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to study the feasibility of a circulating commemorative \ncoin. That study found that there is considerable public interest in \nthe circulating commemorative quarter and that collecting such coins \nwould produce significant earnings. The bill that I am introducing \ntoday will implement this program. Identical legislation has been \nintroduced in the House.\n  As we all know, the circulating quarters in use today are Washington/\nEagle quarters, that is they have a bust of George Washington on one \nside and an eagle on the reverse side. Under this legislation, \nbeginning in 1999, the Mint would strike only statehood quarters until \nall 50 states were represented. Only the design on the back of quarters \nwould change. There would be no changes whatsoever to the physical \nsize, weight, or other specifications of quarters. This uniformity is \nnecessary to ensure that these new quarters will continue to work in \nvending machines, telephones, parking meters, and for other similar \ntransactions.\n  This program would operate for 10 years, with the Mint producing five \ndifferent statehood coins per year. The order in which States will be \nrepresented is based on the order in which States ratified the \nConstitution and\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\njoined the Union. If a new state joins the Union during the life of the \nprogram, it will be extended in order to ensure that the new State is \nrepresented.\n  The design for each State will be selected by the Secretary of the \nTreasury in consultation with the Governor, the Commission on Fine \nArts, and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. Each \nState will nominate a design to the Secretary.\n  It is my hope that this proposal will spark interest in every State \nacross our Nation. I hope that school children begin to study the \nhistory of their States in search of an appropriate individual or \nemblem to represent their States on the reverse side of these quarters. \nI hope that artists, coin collectors, historians, and scholars debate \nand ultimately join together to suggest an appropriate representation \nfor their State.\n  I know that there are a wide range of appealing options for my own \nState of Rhode Island. Of course there is the founder of Rhode Island, \nRoger Williams or Anne Hutchinson, who, like Roger Williams, dedicated \nher life to the principle of religious freedom and tolerance. There is \nthe Anchor of Hope, which is our State motto and is represented on our \nflag. Rhode Island is the Ocean State, so a seascape would be an \ninteresting proposal, as would be a lighthouse or a gull.\n  I am delighted to have Senator D'Amato's support in introducing this \nbill. I am sure that he agrees that the point of this new program is to \nhonor all 50 States, and to encourage an interest in the unique history \nof each State. This program creates a program through which we can \ncelebrate our diverse heritage.\n  I send a bill to the desk and ask for its appropriate referral.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``50 States Commemorative Coin \n     Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is appropriate and timely--\n       (A) to honor the unique Federal republic of 50 States that \n     comprise the United States; and\n       (B) to promote the diffusion of knowledge among the youth \n     of the United States about the individual States, their \n     history and geography, and the rich diversity of the national \n     heritage;\n       (2) the circulating coinage of the United States has not \n     been modernized during the 25-year period preceding the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (3) a circulating commemorative 25-cent coin program could \n     produce earnings of $110,000,000 from the sale of silver \n     proof coins and sets over the 10-year period of issuance, and \n     would produce indirect earnings of an estimated \n     $2,600,000,000 to $5,100,000,000 to the United States \n     Treasury, money that will replace borrowing to fund the \n     national debt to at least that extent; and\n       (4) it is appropriate to launch a commemorative circulating \n     coin program that encourages young people and their families \n     to collect memorable tokens of all of the States for the face \n     value of the coins.\n\n     SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF REDESIGNED QUARTER DOLLARS OVER 10-YEAR \n                   PERIOD COMMEMORATING EACH OF THE 50 STATES.\n\n       Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting after subsection (k) the following new subsection:\n       ``(l) Redesign and Issuance of Quarter Dollar in \n     Commemoration of Each of the 50 States.--\n       ``(1) Redesign beginning in 1999.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of \n     subsection (d)(1) and subsection (d)(2), quarter dollar coins \n     issued during the 10-year period beginning in 1999, shall \n     have designs on the reverse side selected in accordance with \n     this subsection which are emblematic of the 50 States.\n       ``(B) Transition provision.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), the Secretary may continue to mint and issue quarter \n     dollars in 1999 which bear the design in effect before the \n     redesign required under this subsection and an inscription of \n     the year `1998' as required to ensure a smooth transition \n     into the 10-year program under this subsection.\n       ``(2) Single state designs.--The design on the reverse side \n     of each quarter dollar issued during the 10-year period \n     referred to in paragraph (1) shall be emblematic of 1 of the \n     50 States.\n       ``(3) Issuance of coins commemorating 5 states during each \n     of the 10 years.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The designs for the quarter dollar coins \n     issued during each year of the 10-year period referred to in \n     paragraph (1) shall be emblematic of 5 States selected in the \n     order in which such States ratified the Constitution of the \n     United States or were admitted into the Union, as the case \n     may be.\n       ``(B) Number of each of 5 coin designs in each year.--Of \n     the quarter dollar coins issued during each year of the 10-\n     year period referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as \n     the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of \n     quarter dollars which shall be issued with each of the 5 \n     designs selected for such year.\n       ``(4) Selection of design.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Each of the 50 designs required under \n     this subsection for quarter dollars shall be--\n       ``(i) selected by the Secretary after consultation with--\n\n       ``(I) the Governor of the State being commemorated, or such \n     other State officials or group as the State may designate for \n     such purpose;

Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, to introduce a bill which will authorize the 50 \nStates Circulating Commemorative Coin Program.\n  This program, which allows for a temporary change to the reverse side \nof our quarters starting in the year 1999, has my complete and \nenthusiastic support.\n  Mr. President, I feel it is appropriate as we enter the new \nmillennium to embark on a decade-long celebration honoring each of our \n50 States in the order in which they ratified the Constitution and \njoined the Union. All States shall submit, for final selection by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, a design befitting the motto or symbol of \neach State.\n  The benefits of this program in promoting State pride on a national \nlevel and educating our citizens about our States' unique character and \nhistory are substantial.\n  In the year 1999, our Nation will be 223 years old. Before our next \nbig celebration marking the tricentennial in the year 2076, we should \ntake time to commemorate the attributes of every State in this Union.\n  Through this circulating coin program, we will be giving American \nyouth an opportunity to cultivate an interest in the rich history that \nformed these United States. These coins will provide our teachers with \na tangible tool to instill this interest.\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\n  The educational advantage for our children will not only be achieved \nin classrooms, but on playgrounds and in homes around the Nation.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I feel that the excitement and \nanticipation of the different coins in this program will also capture \nthe interest of adults. Just imagine, receiving a collectible memento \nwhen you are handed your change.\n  And may I point out, Mr. President, while the entire set of 50 \ncirculating quarters will cost only $12.50, this very affordable \ncollection will generate a minimum of $2.6 billion and conceivably as \nmuch as $5 billion in additional earnings for the Treasury. These off-\nbudget earnings will be applied directly to reduce borrowing to fund \nthe national debt.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my \ncolleague, Congressman Michael Castle, who has worked tirelessly to \npromote this great program. Identical legislation Mike Castle sponsored \npassed the House on a record vote of 413 to 6. I am pleased that his \nefforts to create this commemorative coin are about to be realized. His \noutstanding leadership and dedication on this matter has been an \ninspiration to all who have committed their support.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee, I intend to press for prompt \npassage of this broadly supported bill and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1229. A bill to provide for the conduct of a clinical trial \nconcerning digital mammography; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n       THE DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nprovide for a much needed clinical trial for the benefit of women's \nhealth. My bill would provide $20 million to the Nation's Office of \nWomen's Health to conduct a large-scale clinical trial of digital \nmammography, involving 50,000 women and 20 sites, which could yield \nhard data in as little as a year regarding the potential of this \ntechnology.\n\n  Digital mammography is our best bet for bringing the fight against \nbreast cancer into the 21st century. This technology could answer the \nquestion of what age a woman should begin seeking annual mammograms. It \ncould prevent unnecessary biopsies, as well as catch the countless \nbreast masses undetected by conventional mammography. Dr. Martin Yaffe, \na senior cancer-imaging researcher from Canada, is quoted in the Wall \nStreet Journal of March 20, 1997, as drawing this comparison, ``Using a \nconventional x ray mammography to find a tumor in dense breast tissue \nis like trying to find a cotton ball in a cloud. Digital technology \nallows us to improve the quality of the image and avoid missing the \ncancer.''\n  While conventional mammography invokes the usual procedure for x \nrays, which views the film of a breast image on a light box, digital \nmammography takes advantage of an advanced x ray source for digital \nimage capture, allowing image enhancement, feature recognition, and the \nability to adjust the display contrast to highlight shadows and \notherwise undetected signs of breast cancer. Mammography is the only \nmeans for detecting breast micro-calcifications, typically the earliest \nindicator of nonpalpable breast cancers.\n  Many of my Senate colleagues have taken a personal and avid interest \nin combating breast cancer. With good reason. More than 40,000 women \nwill lose their battle with breast cancer this year alone, while \nanother 2.6 million will continue to live with the disease. Further, \nthe rate of diagnosis has been steadily increasing for the last 50 \nyears. For women aged 40 to 45, breast cancer is the leading cause of \ndeath. Given these staggering statistics and the fact that women are \nliterally defenseless against this disease, it is imperative that we do \neverything possible to promote early detection and treatment.\n  On June 3 of this year, 62 U.S. Senators sent a letter to the \nAppropriations Committee, urging funding for the Department of Defense \nPeer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. This program is world \nrenowned and responsible for many of the most important advances in \nbreast cancer research. It has even facilitated several small-scale \ntrials in digital mammography.\n  However, this program has, to date, proven unable to conduct a large-\nscale clinical trial of digital mammography. And yet, it is only a \nlarge-scale trial that can determine definitively the efficacy of this \ntechnology in saving women's lives. There are two bottom lines here. \nFirst, the trial would tell women at what age and with what frequency \nthey should receive mammograms. Second, the trial would provide the \nHealth Care Financing Administration with the data it needs to set a \nreasonable and appropriate cost for a digital mammography. We are all \nfamiliar with the role HCFA plays in setting not just rates of \nreimbursement but standards for reimbursement of healthcare services; \nthe private sector takes its lead from HCFA. Once HCFA acts to make \ndigital mammographies available to women, private pay insurers will \nfollow suit. Therefore, in the interest of public health, the onus is \non us to move these trials forward.\n  The NIH has an appropriation from the Senate for next year that \nreflects almost a billion dollar boost. Rightly so. But despite that, \nthe National Cancer Institute simply does not have the resources to \nfund a clinical trial of this size. Grant dollars are still scarce \nrelative to the number of compelling grant applications. The reality \nthat NCI is simply unable to dedicate the necessary resources to \nconduct a large-scale trial of digital mammography is unfortunate yet \nunderstandable. The Senate is aware of this dilemma, and shares the \nfrustration of the Nation's breast cancer victims. In explaining its \nfiscal year 1998 allocation for the National Cancer Institute, the \nAppropriations Committee report for Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education noted that ``the national investment in cancer research \nremains the key to bringing down spiraling heath care costs, as \ntreatment, cures, and prevention remain much cheaper than chronic and \ncatastrophic diseases, like cancer.''\n  As Congress is well aware, the financial cost of breast cancer is \nindeed staggering. We spend over $5 billion annually on healthcare for \nwomen fighting breast cancer, a figure that is matched in the cost of \nlost productivity to our overall economy. Further, the human cost of \nthis disease is felt tenfold by the families and communities whose \nlives it touches.\n  I realize this bill breaks with convention, to a certain degree. I am \nnot assuming a level of scientific expertise that supplants that of the \ntrue experts at NIH. I am a firm believer in letting science drive \nwhere our research dollars are spent. However, I am willing to force \nthe issue for the sake of women's health. We have available to us \ncutting edge technology that could yield us a remarkable return in the \nform of women's lives. My bill provides a modest sum to ensure that a \nlarge-scale clinical trial of digital mammography does not go unfunded \nany longer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1230. A bill to amend the Small Reclamation Projects of 1956 to \nprovide for Federal cooperation in non-Federal reclamation projects and \nfor participation by non-Federal agencies in Federal projects; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               the small reclamation projects act of 1956\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President. I send to the desk for appropriate \nreference a measure to expand the use and availability of the Small \nReclamation Projects Act of 1956.\n  The Small Reclamation Projects Act has provided important benefits \nthroughout the Reclamation West in the 40 years since it was first \nestablished. Over the past several years there have been various \ndiscussions on ways to expand the benefits of the program. Last \nCongress I introduced two measures that included some of the \nsuggestions that have been made. Neither of the measures would have \naffected ongoing projects.\n  One of the measures, S. 1564, dealt with financing. At the present \ntime, the Secretary is limited to grants and loans to fulfill the \nobjectives of the act. That legislation would have expanded the \nauthority of the Secretary to include the use of loan guarantees as a \nway of stretching the limited federal resources. The other measure, S. \n1565,\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nrevised existing law to expand the purposes for which assistance can be \nreceived from the Federal Government. Irrigation would have remained an \nauthorized purpose, but it would no longer be a required component. The \npurposes would now include the augmentation and management of local \nwater supplies, conservation of water and energy, fish and wildlife \nconservation, supplemental water for existing supplies, water quality \nimprovements, and flood control. The legislation would have limited the \napplication of interest on any loans to those features which are \ncurrently reimbursable with interest under reclamation law.\n  On September 5, 1996, I conducted a hearing on these, and several \nother reclamation measures, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests \nand Public Land Management. Based on the comments that I received at \nthe hearing, and subsequent conversations that I have had with \nindividuals and groups interested in the potential of the Small \nReclamation Program, I have combined the two measures and made several \nchanges in the sustance. I am introducing the measure today and plan to \nrequest that the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources add this measure to its scheduled hearing \non October 7, 1997.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that once the administration has the \nopportunity to read this measure and reflect on our hearing last year, \nthey will change their minds and support this legislation. Quite \nfrankly, I do not understand the reasons for the almost knee-jerk \nopposition of the administration to this proposal or their persistent \nefforts to terminate not only the Small Reclamation Project Act, but \nprograms such as the Rehabilitation and Betterment loan activity. An \nadministration that trumpets its concern for the environment should \nunderstand that one of the best ways of providing additional water \nsupplies for instream uses, as well as for additional consumptive uses, \nis to repair old leaky systems. It may simple be that these programs \neither directly or indirectly help farmers, but I would submit, Mr. \nPresident, that they also benefit the environment and the economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 1231.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the authorization bill \nfor the U.S. Fire Administration for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. I \nwould like to thank the cosponsors of this bill, Senator McCain, \nSenator Hollings, and Senator Rockefeller, for their hard work and \ndedication to making this bill a possibility.\n  The mission of the U.S. Fire Administration is to enhance the \nNation's fire prevention and control activities and thereby \nsignificantly reduce the Nation's loss of life from fire while also \nachieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.\n  The bill, which authorizes the Fire Administration for $29.6 million \nin fiscal year 1998 and $30.5 million for fiscal year 1999, provides \nfor collection, analysis, and dissemination of fire incidence and loss \ndata; development and dissemination of public fire education materials; \ndevelopment and dissemination of better hazardous materials response \ninformation for first responders; and support for research and \ndevelopment for fire safety technologies.\n  With this authorization, our local and State firefighters will \ncontinue to have assess to the training from the National Fire Academy \nnecessary to allow them to better perform their jobs of saving lives \nand protecting property.\n  Additionally, a number of amendments have been proposed to the \nlegislation that established the National Fallen Firefighters \nFoundation. The Foundation was created by Congress in 1992 to assist \ntheir families. These proposed amendments offer some major changes to \nthe structure of the Foundation. In order to allow for a more thorough \nevaluation of the issues surrounding these amendments, we plan to \ncontinue our review of these changes along with an examination of the \nFoundation's relationships with the U.S. Fire Administration and the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency next year.\n  Therefore, I along with my cosponsors, urge the Members of this body \nto support this bill and allow the U.S. Fire Administration to continue \nthe fine job it has been performing for so many years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Frist's \nauthorization bill for the U.S. Fire Administration for fiscal years \n1997 and 1998. I would also like to thank the additional cosponsors, \nSenator Hollings and Senator Rockefeller, for their support of this \nvery important legislation.\n  As chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, I \nam very pleased to see that the bill represents the bipartisan support \nthat is so necessary to move this and other science and technology \nbills before the committee. It would be my hope that this bipartisan \nsupport would be continued for the many actions before this body, the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The United States has one of the highest fire death rates in the \nindustrialized world. Fires account for approximately 4,500 deaths and \n30,000 injuries annually. The extent of this problem covers all sectors \nof society and costs American taxpayers approximately $50 billion per \nyear.\n  With these huge losses, the work of the U.S. Fire Administration \nplays a key role in reducing these numbers. Their work with the \nfirefighters, those who are on the front lines in fighting these \nproblems, should be commended. Their efforts in collecting data and \nother relevant information play a key role in the prevention of future \nfires.\n  The U.S. Fire Administration should continue to educate the public \nagainst the dangers of fire and how to safely protect ourselves and our \nproperty against such dangers.\n  I, along with my cosponsors, urge the Members of this body to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Frist, in introducing legislation to reauthorize the programs \nof the U.S. Fire Administration [USFA].\n  The United States currently has one of the worst fire records of any \ncountry in the industrial world. More than 2 million fires are reported \nin the United States every year. Annually, these fires result in \napproximately 4,500 deaths, 30,000 civilian injuries, more than $8 \nbillion in direct property losses, and more than $50 billion in costs \nto taxpayers. In my State of South Carolina, in 1995, the most recent \nyear in which data are available, 12,776 fires were reported resulting \nin 12 deaths, 103 injuries, and over $40 million in property losses. \nEven more disheartening is the fact that over 80 percent of the annual \ndeaths and injuries from fires occur in residential fires. In South \nCarolina, while only 3,196 of the fires were residential, those fires \nclaimed 8 lives and caused 74 injuries.\n  As terrible as these statistics are, they would reflect a far more \ntragic picture were it not for the USFA. The USFA was created under the \n1974 act, pursuant to the recommendation of the National Commission on \nFire and Control. The USFA is a part of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, and its responsibilities are to administer programs, \nresearch, and applied engineering projects to assist State and local \ngovernments in fire prevention and control. The USFA works with State \nand local governments specifically to educate the public in fire safety \nand prevention, control arson, collect and analyze data related to \nfire, conduct research and development in fire suppression, promote \nfirefighter health and safety, and conduct fire service training.\n  The USFA assists our Nation's fire service which comprises of \napproximately 1.2 million members, 80 percent of whom are volunteers. \nThe fire service is one of the most hazardous professions in the \ncountry. Firefighters not only confront daily the dangers of fire; they \nalso are required to respond to other natural disasters, such as \nearthquakes, floods, medical emergencies, and hazardous materials \nspills. The USFA administers the National Fire Academy, which sponsors \noff-campus and on-campus training and management programs for members \nof the fire and rescue services, and allied professionals.\n  The effort of the USFA is focused in four areas: First, public \neducation and awareness and arson control; second, data collection and \nanalysis; third, fire service training; and fourth, technology and \nresearch and firefighter health and safety.\n  Through public education and awareness the USFA seeks to identify and \neducate the groups for whom fire presents the greatest menace. Efforts \nare focused to increase safety and reduce losses. For example, whether \nby accident or on purpose, children start over 100,000 fires per years. \nAbout 25 percent of the fires that kill young children are started by \nchildren playing with fire. The USFA through public-private \npartnerships had educated children with initiatives such as the \n``Sesame Street Fire Safety Activity Book for Preschoolers,'' National \nSafe Kids, and various guides for parents and teachers.\n  Senior citizens are at the highest risk of being killed in a fire. \nThe USFA has targeted this group through public service announcements \nwith added focus on the importance of buying and maintaining \nresidential smoke detectors.\n  Arsonists are responsible for over 500,000 fires every year. Arson is \nthe No. 1 cause of all fires. Even though it is the leading cause of \nfire, only 15 percent of arson cases result in arrests with juveniles \naccounting for 55 percent of arrests, and only 2 percent result in \nconvictions. It is the second leading cause of fire deaths in \nresidences and the leading cause of dollar loss due to fire. In 1994, \nthe most recent year for which comprehensive data is available, the \ntotal number of arson fires in the United States was estimated at \n548,500--accounting for an estimated 560 fire deaths, 3,440 fire \ninjuries, and $3.6 billion in property damage.\n  Of greater concern are investigators reports that more people are \nchoosing to use fire as a weapon. According to the USFA's ``Arson in \nthe United\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nStates'' report, ``Investigators are becoming more aware of Molotov \ncocktails and pipe bombs being used as incendiary devices. Fires caused \nby explosives or motivated by spite and revenge tend to be more deadly \nbecause they often target residential structures, in keeping with the \ndesire to inflict personal harm.'' In my own State of South Carolina, \nwe suffer from the worst record for church burnings--over 30 since \n1991. I visited with Rev. Lester Grant of Shiloh Baptist Church in \nTownville, SC, last month, and we discussed the recent trend of \ntargeting churches with this new weapon of hatred and violence. I was \nimpressed with how our church communities are rallying and growing \nstronger in the rubble of fires. Church burnings, whether acts of \nhatred or vandalism, have to stop.\n  We must do more to assist our church communities in stopping these \nvile efforts. The USFA has initiated several measures to combat this \ncrime, including: community grants in high risk areas to hire part-time \nlaw enforcement officers, and to pay for law enforcement overtime and \nother church arson prevention activities; National Fire Academy \ntraining courses; additional training and education for arson \ninvestigators with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; arson \nprevention information for the general public; and juvenile arson \nprevention workshops. Although the President's budget request for \nfiscal year 1997 for arson-fighting activities was reduced, this bill \nrestores that funding at last year's level.\n  USFA's emphasis on data collection and analysis provides it with the \nnecessary tools for identifying problems and forecasting trends. USFA \nuse this data to focus efforts in the areas that will most \nsignificantly reduce casualties and property losses caused by fire. \nNational Fire data are published through USFA's National Fire Incident \nReporting System, the only centralized and uniform collection of fire \ndata in the United States.\n  Regarding fire service training, Mr. President, and the National Fire \nAcademy provides national leadership for fire and emergency medical \nservices personnel through education and training. The Academy offers \ntraining and educational programs at the Emmitsburg campus and at other \nsites throughout the country. The Academy trained 83,000 students in \n1996 and plans to increase this number to 300,000 per year in the \nfuture. There now are four applicants for each available slot for many \nof the Academy's courses.\n  Finally, the USFA conducts research on technology to improve the \noccupational health and safety of firefighters including improvements \nto protective clothing and equipment, lifesaving operational \ntechnologies and equipment like liquid fire extinguishing agents, and \nequipment used in vehicle extrication and complex rescues.\n  Mr. President, the efforts of our Nation's 1.2 million firefighters \nare invaluable; they risk their lives every day to save the lives and \nproperty of others. The USFA provides the necessary education, data \nanalysis, training, and technology needed to ensure that these brave \nindividuals do their job as efficiently and safely as possible. We in \nCongress need to do our job: We need to enact this legislation to \nensure that both firefighters and the USFA get the financial resources \nthey need to serve the public. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Frist, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings in introducing \nlegislation to reauthorize the programs of the U.S. Fire Administration \n[USFA].\n  I just want to say a few quick words about this program. The USFA has \na tough and rewarding mission. As I am sure my colleagues have noted, \nthe statistics relating to fires in this country are staggering: \nApproximately 4,500 people die annually, and over 30,000 people are \ninjured. In West Virginia, there were over 9,000 fires in 1995 causing \n28 fatalities and 160 injuries. The fact is, Mr. President, these \nnumbers would be worse if it were not for the brave men and women \nfirefighters who put their lives on the line to save and protect \nothers.\n  I want to take this moment to commend the 1.2 million members of the \nNation's fire service of whom 80 percent are volunteers. In 1995, 163 \nfirefighters were injured in West Virginia in the line of duty. They \ndeserve the best training, assistance, and technology available to do \ntheir job. The USFA provides these invaluable services to these men and \nwomen in an effort to ensure their safety, their health, and to improve \ntheir ability to fight fires with the best available technology.\n  If there is a Federal program that is worth its value in dollars, it \nis this one--an ounce of prevention is clearly worth a pound of cure. \nIn addition to the services the USFA provides firefighters, I want to \ncommend this agency for its education and awareness programs, \nparticularly those that target young children, and for their use of the \nInternet. Children start over 100,000 fires a year from just playing. \nThe USFA has developed an interactive homepage and guide for parents \nclearly demonstrating their awareness of today's tools needed to reach \ntoday's youth.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, the \nchairman of the Science Subcommittee, Senator Frist, for his efforts to \nmove legislation in a bipartisan manner. This bill is a fine example of \nhis efforts to work with Members of both parties to move good \nlegislation that benefits the public as a whole. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 1232. A bill to provide for the declassification of the journal \nkept by Glenn T. Seaborg while serving as Chairman of the Atomic Energy \nCommission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Glenn T. Seaborg is a truly great \nAmerican who for 14 years has suffered outrageous treatment from \nbureaucrats and is in need of our assistance. Dr. Seaborg, codiscoverer \nof plutonium, kept a journal whilst chairman of the Atomic Energy \nCommission from 1961 to 1971. The journal consisted of a diary written \nat home each evening, correspondence, announcements, minutes, and the \nlike. He was careful about classified matters; nothing was included \nthat could not be made public. Even as he was chairman the portions \nrelating to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were microfilmed \nfor public access in their respective Presidential libraries. Before \nleaving the AEC, Dr. Seaborg got it all cleared virtually without \ndeletion. Then lunacy descended. Or rather, the Atomic Energy \nCommission became the Department of Energy and bureaucracy got going. \nSeaborg writes of all this in an article ``Secrecy Runs Amok'' \npublished in Science in 1994. It seems that in 1983 the chief historian \nof the Department asked to borrow one of two sets of the journal, some \n26 volumes in all, for work on a history of the Commission. By the time \nthe author got his journal back passage after passage was redacted, \nmuch of it explicitly public information, such as the published code \nnames of nuclear weapons tests, some of it purely personal, as for \nexample his description of accompanying his children on a trick or \ntreat outing on a Halloween evening. The 26 volumes, ``in expurgated \nform'' as Seaborg puts it, are now available in the Manuscript Division \nof the Library of Congress. But where does one go for sanity? Seaborg \nwrites: ``With the beginning of the Reagan administration, the \ngovernment had begun to take a much more severe and rigid position with \nregard to secrecy.'' The balance between the ``right of the public to \nknow'' and the ``right of the nation to protect itself'' was simply \nlost as, often apologetic, investigators poured over the papers of the \ngreat Americans of the time.\n  Dr. Seaborg recently came to my office seeking assistance in cutting \nthrough the bureaucracy. At this stage in his career he should not be \nforced to expend valuable time and energy trying to get back what he \nlent the Department of Energy. I immediately agreed to offer what \nassistance I could, having had experience of such matters as chairman \nof the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy.\n  Last week, with the energy and water appropriations bill nearly ready \nfor conference, I thought there might be a chance to include a \nprovision that would require the return of the unedited journal to Dr. \nSeaborg. I wrote to\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\nthe chairman and ranking members of the subcommittee, asking for their \nhelp. On Tuesday, September 23, the clerk for Senator Reid, the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, reported to my staff that there had been a \nlong staff discussion on the matter, that it was agreed the Department \nof Energy had acted inappropriately, that the journal was a valuable \nhistorical document, and that things looked promising for including the \nprovision in the conference report.\n  The report was filed today with no mention of the Seaborg journal. \nThis afternoon the clerk for Senator Domenici, the chairman, reported \nthat the Department of Energy had been consulted and that they had \nraised objections to the return of the unexpurgated journal. And so, \nabsent the opportunity for a hearing, the provision was dropped. I \nsuppose doing the right thing for Dr. Seaborg in a simple, expedient \nmanner was too much to expect. I suppose it was wishful thinking that \nthe Department would do its part to rectify the situation. So, Mr. \nPresident, I am introducing the same provision as a free-standing bill. \nI look forward to a hearing on the matter, which the appropriations \nstaff advocates, so that at least this one egregious example of the \nregulation and control of valuable public information can be brought to \nlight and, I trust, remedied.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Seaborg's article in Science be \nincluded in the Record at this point. I send to the desk a bill \nrequiring the return of Dr. Seaborg's journal in the original, \nunredacted form in which it was lent to the Department of Energy, and \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record and referred to \nthe appropriate committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       (1) Whereas Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg is a truly great American \n     who has made indispensable contributions in the development \n     of nuclear energy.\n       (2) Whereas Dr. Seaborg is the co-discoverer of plutonium \n     and eight other elements and as a result of these discoveries \n     was awarded the 1951 Nobel Prize for chemistry.\n       (3) Whereas while serving as Chairman of the Atomic Energy \n     Commission (AEC), Dr. Seaborg maintained a journal consisting \n     of a diary, correspondence, announcements, minutes of \n     meetings, and other documents of historical value.\n       (4) Whereas in preparing the journal, Dr. Seaborg took care \n     to include only information which was not classified and \n     could be made public.\n       (5) Whereas before leaving the Atomic Energy Commission, \n     Dr. Seaborg submitted the journal to the AEC's Division of \n     Classification for review.\n       (6) Whereas Dr. Seaborg's journal was cleared by the \n     Division of Classification, virtually without deletion.\n       (7) Whereas twelve years later, in 1983, the chief \n     historian at the Department of Energy asked to borrow a copy \n     of Dr. Seaborg's journal in order to write a history of the \n     AEC.\n       (8) Whereas when the journal was returned to Dr. Seaborg \n     three years later, passage after passage was redacted, \n     including explicitly public information, such as the \n     published code names of nuclear weapons tests, and purely \n     personal material, such as his description of accompanying \n     his children on a ``trick or treat'' outing one Halloween \n     evening.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLASSIFICATION OF SEABORG JOURNAL.\n\n       The Secretary of Energy shall return to Dr. Glenn T. \n     Seaborg his journal which he prepared while serving as \n     Chairman of the AEC. The journal shall be returned in the \n     original, unredacted form in which it was lent to the \n     Department of Energy in 1983.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Secrecy Runs Amok\n\n                         (By Glenn T. Seaborg)\n\n       Publishing information on scientific projects related to \n     national security requires resolution of the conflicts \n     between the ``right of the public to know'' and the ``right \n     of the nation to protect itself.'' A recent experience of \n     mine in regard to the declassification of historical material \n     may illuminate the problems that can arise.\n       During my years as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission \n     (AEC) (1961 to 1971), I maintained a daily journal. The core \n     of the journal was a diary, much of which I wrote at home \n     each evening. (This continued a habit I had started at the \n     age of 14.) The diary was supplemented by copies of \n     correspondence, announcements, minutes of meetings, and other \n     relevant documents that crossed my desk each day. Both in the \n     diary and the supporting documents rigorous attention was \n     given to excluding any subject matter that could be \n     considered classified information under standards of the day. \n     My purpose was to provide for historians and other scholars a \n     record that might not be available elsewhere of what occurred \n     at high levels of government regarding the AEC's important \n     areas of activity.\n       Illustrative of the general recognition that my journal was \n     unclassified was the fact that in 1965 the AEC historian \n     microfilmed for public access in the John F. Kennedy and \n     Lyndon B. Johnson libraries portions that correspond to those \n     presidencies. To assure myself further that the journal \n     contained no classified material I had it checked by the AEC \n     Division of Classification during the summer and fall of \n     1971, just before my departure from the AEC. It was cleared, \n     virtually without deletions. (Unfortunately, I received no \n     written confirmation of this action which is perhaps \n     understandable because of the obvious unclassified origin of \n     the material.) A copy, which I will refer to as copy #1, was \n     then transmitted by the AEC to my office at the University of \n     California in Berkeley. Also, at about this time, the AEC \n     tansferrd another copy of the journal, referred to \n     hereinafter as copy #2, first to my Berkeley office, then to \n     the Livermore laboratory, and, soon thereafter, to my home in \n     Lafayette, California. It was known that neither my Berkeley \n     office nor my home had any provision for the protection of \n     classified material, and the fact that the AEC saws fit to \n     ship the journal to those places is a clear indication \n     that the AEC regarded the journal as an unclassified \n     document.\n       The office and home copies of the journal remained \n     accessible to scholars for the ensuing 12 years. Then the \n     problems began. In July 1983 the chief historian of the \n     Department of Energy (DOE) asked to borrow a copy for use in \n     the next phase of the History Division's long-term project, \n     the writing of A History of the United States Atomic Energy \n     Commission. Volume IV of the History was to be devoted \n     largely to the years of my chairmanship. The historian \n     promised to return the journal within 3 weeks as soon as \n     copies had been made. I sent him copy #1, the one in my \n     Berkeley office. When the University of California historian, \n     John Heilbron, learned of this transaction, he warned me that \n     the DOE was likely to find classified material in the journal \n     and to hold it indefinitely pending a complete classification \n     review. Relying on past history during which the journal had \n     been treated by the AEC as a wholly unclassified document, I \n     told him I was not worried that this would happen. But, as \n     Heilbron may have been aware from his own experience, times \n     had changed. With the beginning of the Reagan administration, \n     the government had begun to take a new, much more severe and \n     rigid position with regard to secrecy.\n       Despite my repeated entreaties, the historian's office did \n     not return the journal in 3 weeks, nor in 3 months, nor in a \n     year-and-a-half. Nor was any explanation ever offered to me \n     for the delay. Finally, just as Heilbron had predicted, I was \n     informed in February 1985 that the journal had indeed been \n     found to contain classified information. Accordingly, DOE \n     ordered its San Francisco Area Office to pick up copy #2, the \n     one that I kept at home, so that it also could be subjected \n     to a classification review. At first I said I would not allow \n     this. But then I was told that, legally, the journal could be \n     seized and that I could be subject to arrest if I resisted. \n     Faced with this disagreeable prospect, I acceded to a \n     compromise plan (the best of several unsatisfactory \n     alternatives) whereby DOE provided me with a locked storage \n     safe, complete with burglar alarm, so that I could continue \n     to have access to the journal, which I was at that time \n     preparing for publication. It was no longer, however, to be \n     available for use by scholars.\n       Then in May 1985 I was contacted by DOE's San Francisco \n     Area Manager. He said that he had been instructed by DOE \n     headquarters to institute a classification review of copy \n     #2 at my home. He added that the consequence of my not \n     agreeing to this would be that the FBI would seize the \n     papers under court order. He said that the weakness of my \n     case, if I chose to resist, was that there was no record \n     of the journal ever having been declassified by the AEC. \n     Thus, I could be accused of having illegally removed \n     classified material when I left the AEC. He noted that if \n     legal proceedings were instituted, I could, of course, \n     hire a lawyer to defend myself, but that he knew of no \n     case like this where the government, with all its \n     resources, had lost.\n       Under this ultimatum, I agreed to the classification review \n     with the understanding that it would be completed within 10 \n     days. The reviewer started work in my home on 9 May 1985, \n     kept at it for several weeks (not the promised 10 days), and \n     came up with 162 deletions of words, phrases, sentences, or \n     paragraphs, affecting 137 documents.\n       Then in May 1986 I learned that copy #1, the one borrowed \n     by the DOE historian, was also undergoing a classification \n     review. This review was complete in October 1986 and led to \n     deletions from 327 documents. In addition, 530 documents were \n     removed from the journal entirely pending further review by \n     DOE or by other government agencies.\n       At the same time as reviews of my complete journal were \n     being undertaken in DOE and in my home, a further review was \n     taking place in the Bethesda, Maryland, home of Benjamin S. \n     Loeb, who was then collaborating with me in preparation of \n     the book, Stemming the Tide: Arms Control in the Johnson \n     Years, which was to be published in 1987 (1). Copies had been \n     sent to Loeb of just those portions of the journal that \n     related to\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n     arms control. Beginning 10 July 1986, as many as six DOE \n     Division of Classification staff members sat around his \n     dining room table for a few days, selecting a large number of \n     documents which they then took with them back to DOE \n     headquarters in Germantown, Maryland. In due course, most of \n     these were returned with deletions, except that a number of \n     documents that required review by U.S. government agencies \n     other than DOE, or by the United Kingdom, were not returned \n     until August 1990.\n       But there was more. In October 1986 I was informed that the \n     DOE classification people wanted to perform another review of \n     copy #2, the one in my home, in order to ``sanitize'' it, a \n     euphemism for a further classification review of the already \n     reviewed journal. I was informed that the sanitization \n     procedure would take place at Livermore, that it would last 3 \n     to 6 weeks, and that it would involve from 8 to 12 people. \n     Copy #2 was duly picked up at my home and delivered to \n     Livermore on 22 October 1986. When the sanitized version \n     was returned almost 2 months later, it had been subjected, \n     including the prior review, to about 1000 classification \n     actions. These included the entire removal of about 500 \n     documents for review by other U.S. agencies or, in a few \n     cases, by the British. Over my objection, an unsightly \n     declassification stamp was placed on every surviving \n     document.\n       Finally, the DOE sent to the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory a \n     team of about 12 people to begin a ``catalog,'' that is, an \n     itemized listing, of all the personal correspondence I had \n     brought from the AEC and of the contents of my journal and \n     files for the prior 25 years of my working life before I \n     became AEC chairman. Beginning on 29 April 1987, the team \n     spent about 2 weeks at this task. In March 1988 another DOE \n     group visited me for about a month in order to complete the \n     catalog. The motives of DOE in undertaking this task were not \n     clear. They may well have intended to be helpful to me. \n     Before they finished, however, the two groups uncovered some \n     additional ``secret'' material.\n       My grammar and high school and university student papers \n     stored in another part of my home, overlooked by the DOE \n     classification teams, have so far escaped a security review.\n       My journal was finally reproduced in January 1989 (2) in 25 \n     volumes, averaging about 700 pages each, many of them defaced \n     with classification markings and containing large gaps where \n     deletions had been made. In June 1992 a 26th volume was \n     added. It contained a batch of documents initially taken away \n     for classification review and subsequently returned to me, \n     with many deletions, after the production of the other 25 \n     volumes in January 1989. (Many other removed documents have \n     still not been returned.). All 26 volumes are now publicly \n     available in the expurgated form in the Manuscript Division \n     of the Library of Congress.\n       This, then, is a summary narrative of the rocky voyage of \n     my daily journal amid the shoals of multiple classification \n     reviews. Those interested in a more detailed account can find \n     it among the daily entries in my journal for the period after \n     I left the AEC. This is available in the Manuscript Division \n     of the Library of Congress, and has fortunately not yet been \n     subjected to classification review.\n       What is to be concluded about this sorry tale? One \n     conclusion I have reached is that the security classification \n     of information became in the 1980s an arbitrary, capricious, \n     and frivolous process, almost devoid of objective criteria. \n     Witness the fact that the successive reviews of my journal at \n     different places and by different people resulted in widely \n     varying results in the types and number of deletions made or \n     documents removed. Furthermore, some of the individual \n     classification actions seem utterly ludicrous. These include \n     my description of one of the occasions when I accompanied my \n     children on a ``trick or treat'' outing on a Halloween \n     evening, and my account of my wife Helen's visit to the Lake \n     Country in England. One would have to ask how publication of \n     these bits of family lore would adversely affect the security \n     of the United States. A particular specialty of the reviewers \n     was to delete from the journal many items that were already \n     part of the public record. These included material published \n     in my 1981 book (with Benjamin S. Loeb), ``Kennedy, \n     Khrushchev, and the Test Ban'' (3). Another example concerned \n     the code names of previously conducted nuclear weapons tests. \n     These were deleted almost everywhere they appeared regardless \n     of the fact that in January 1985 the DOE had issued a report \n     listing, with their code names, all ``Announced United States \n     Nuclear Tests, July 1945 through December 1984'' (4). A third \n     category of deletions concerned entries that might have been \n     politically or personally embarrassing to individuals or \n     groups but whose publication would not in any way threaten \n     U.S. national security. In fact, I would go so far as to \n     contend that hardly any of the approximately 1,000 \n     classification actions (removals of documents or deletions \n     within document) taken so randomly by the various reviewers \n     could be justified on legitimate national security grounds.\n       Consistent with this belief, I have requested repeatedly \n     throughout this difficult time that a copy of my journal as \n     originally prepared, that is, before all the classification \n     reviews, be kept on file somewhere. I had in mind that there \n     might come a day when a more rational approach to secrecy \n     might prevail and permit wider access, especially to \n     historians, of the complete record. There are indications \n     that, especially with the end of the Cold War, such an era \n     may be at hand or rapidly approaching. While the DOE has made \n     no commitment to honor my request. I am informed that DOE's \n     History Division does maintain an unexpurgated copy for \n     its own use. Perforce, it is handled as a classified \n     document.\n       I would like to emphasize that I received fine and \n     sympathetic treatment from many in the DOE who made it clear \n     to me that they were not in agreement with the treatment \n     accorded me and my journal during the process recounted \n     above. In fact, more than one person in DOE has told me \n     informally that evidence does indeed exist verifying that my \n     journal did indeed receive a clearance before my departure \n     from the AEC in 1971.\n       The problems posed by classification and declassification \n     of sensitive materials are major ones and require wise people \n     who must make sophisticated decisions. It requires a range of \n     individuals who, on the one hand, have vision in regard to \n     the whole range of scientific and national security policies, \n     and on the other hand, have the time to read pages of \n     detailed descriptions in a wide range of areas. Sometimes \n     this complex goal gets derailed by those who see the trees \n     and not the forest. Those in charge of classification should \n     have an appreciation of the need, in our open society, to \n     publish all scientific and political information that has no \n     adverse national security effect (realistically defined).\n       Although I have in general received sympathetic treatment, \n     I cannot help but note that this treatment has produced quite \n     different conclusions at different periods in the country's \n     history. Actually, the AEC, from its beginning in 1947, \n     initiated and executed an excellent progressive program of \n     declassification with an enlightened regard for the need of \n     such information in an open, increasingly scientific society. \n     By the 1960s, this program was serving our country well. \n     Unfortunately, during the 1980s the program had retrogressed \n     to the extent of reversing many earlier declassification \n     actions. Fortunately, the present situation is very much \n     improved so we can look forward to the future with \n     considerable optimism.\n\n\n                               references\n\n       1.

THURMOND (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nSessions, and Mr. DeWine) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 128\n\n       Whereas Congress enacted the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     authorize the temporary supplying of vacancies in the \n     executive departments'', approved July 23, 1868 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Vacancies Act''), to--\n       (1) preclude the extended filling of a vacancy in an office \n     of an executive or military department subject to Senate \n     confirmation, without the submission of a Presidential \n     nomination;\n       (2) provide an exclusive means to temporarily fill such a \n     vacancy; and\n       (3) clarify the role of the Senate in the exercise of the \n     Senate's constitutional advice and consent powers in the \n     Presidential appointment of certain officers;\n       Whereas subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5, United \n     States Code, includes a codification of the Vacancies Act, \n     and (pursuant to an amendment on August 17, 1988, to section \n     3345 of such title) specifically applies such vacancy \n     provisions to all Executive agencies, including the \n     Department of Justice;\n       Whereas the legislative history accompanying the 1988 \n     amendment makes clear in the controlling committee report \n     that the general administrative authorizing provisions for \n     the Executive agencies, which include sections 509 and 510 of \n     title 28, United States Code, regarding the Department of \n     Justice, do not supersede the specific vacancy provisions in \n     title 5, United States Code;\n       Whereas there are statutory provisions of general \n     administrative authority applicable to every Executive \n     department and other Executive agencies that are similar to \n     sections 509 and 510 of title 28, United States Code, \n     relating to the Department of Justice;\n       Whereas despite the clear intent of Congress, the Attorney \n     General of the United States has continued to interpret the \n     provisions granting general administrative authority to the \n     Attorney General under sections 509 and 510 of title 28, \n     United States Code, to supersede the specific vacancy \n     provisions in title 5, United States Code; and\n       Whereas the interpretation of the Attorney General would--\n       (1) virtually nullify the vacancy provisions under \n     subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5, United States Code;\n       (2) circumvent the clear intention of Congress to preclude \n     the extended filling of certain vacancies and provide for the \n     temporary filling of such vacancies; and\n       (3) subvert the constitutional authority and responsibility \n     of the Senate to advise and consent to certain appointments: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) sections 3345, 3346, 3347, 3348, and 3349 of title 5, \n     United States Code (relating to the filling of vacancies in \n     certain offices), apply to all Executive agencies, including \n     the Department of Justice.\n       (2) the general administrative authorizing statutes of \n     Executive agencies, including sections 509 and 510 of title \n     28, United States Code, relating to the Department of \n     Justice, do not supersede the specific vacancy provisions \n     applicable to Executive agencies in title 5, United States \n     Code; and\n       (3) the Attorney General of the United States should--\n       (A) take such necessary actions to ensure that the \n     Department of Justice is in compliance with the statutory \n     requirements of such sections; and\n       (B) inform other Executive agencies to comply with the \n     vacancy provisions in title 5, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am submitting a sense-of-the \nSenate resolution regarding the Vacancies Act. I am pleased to do so on \nmy behalf, and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and other members of the Judiciary Committee. Our purpose is \nto clarify for the Attorney General that the Vacancies Act applies to \nall executive departments and agencies, including the Department of \nJustice.\n  The Vacancies Act provides that, except for recess periods, when an \nofficial serving in an advise and consent position in an executive \nagency leaves, the President may appoint certain individuals to serve \nin that position in an acting capacity for no more than 120 days before \nthe nomination of a permanent replacement is forwarded for Senate \nconfirmation. The Vacancies Act, which is codified in sections 3345 \nthrough 3349 of title 5 of the United States Code, has existed in some \nform since at least 1868.\n  This act is central to the advise and consent role of the Senate. By \nlimiting the time that the President may temporarily fill a vacant \nadvise and consent position, the act strongly encourages the President \nto quickly nominate a permanent replacement.\n  I have become increasingly alarmed at the Clinton administration's \nfailure to nominate officials to fill the vacancies that have occurred \nin executive branch positions, and particularly in the Department of \nJustice. When we held a Justice Department oversight hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee at the end of April, vacancies existed for the \nAssociate Attorney General, Solicitor General, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision, and Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel.\n  I asked Attorney General Reno at the oversight hearing whether she \nwas concerned that a failure to nominate individuals for these \npositions within the 120-day deadline would violate the Vacancies Act. \nShe responded in writing that the Justice Department was not bound by \nthe Vacancies Act. The letter indicated that she could fill these \nvacancies pursuant to the Department's general administrative \nauthorizing statutes without regard to the Vacancies Act.\n  In my opinion, the Attorney General is simply wrong. Her \ninterpretation of the vacancies law in this area is nothing more than \nan attempt to get around the law.\n  First, the plain language of the Vacancies Act since it was amended \nin 1988 states that it applies to all executive departments and \nagencies. By law, the Department of Justice is an executive department, \nso Justice obviously is included. In fact, the original sponsor of the \nact, Representative Trumbull, stated on the Senate floor in 1868 that \nthe act applied to, quote, ``any of the Departments.''\n  Also, the Congress flatly rejected the Attorney General's \ninterpretation when it amended the Vacancies Act in 1988. As explained \nin the report of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Congress made a \nchoice in 1988 of whether to repeal or revive the Vacancies Act, and it \nchose the latter. The report stated that it was time ``to revitalize'' \nthe Vacancies Act and ``make it relevant to the modern Presidential \nappointments process.'' One method of accomplishing this was to assist \nthe President by expanding the number of days he had to submit a \nnominee from 30 to 120 days after the vacancy was created. That way, \nthe President would have more time to submit a qualified replacement.\n  The committee report expressly rejected the Attorney General's flawed \ninterpretation. It stated that the Vacancies Act was the exclusive \nauthority for these appointments, and noted that the authorizing \nstatutes of an executive department or agency do not provide an \nalternative means to fill vacancies. The amendment was made at the \nrecommendation of the Comptroller General, who has battled with the \nAttorney General for many years over this flawed interpretation of \nvacancies law.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of great constitutional significance. \nIf the view of the Attorney General were correct, the President could \nroutinely ignore the advise and consent role of the Senate. In the \nJustice Department, the President would never be obligated to nominate \nany official below the Attorney General for Senate confirmation after \nhis first appointee left, as long as the President was content for the \nperson to serve in an acting capacity.\n  In fact, based on the Attorney General's reasoning, the President \napparently would not be bound by the Vacancies Act for officials in any \ndepartment. Every Federal department from Agriculture to Veterans \nAffairs has authorizing statutes similar to Justice. Many Federal \nagencies do, too. Therefore, based on the Attorney General's reasoning, \nthese departments and agencies can all claim to be exempt from the \nVacancies Act. In fact, when faced with the Vacancies Act, many make \nthe Attorney General's argument, and claim they aren't bound by it \neither. Obviously, the Congress would never have intended for its \nconfirmation power to be circumvented in this manner.\n  The Framers of the Constitution surely would not be pleased. The \nadvise and consent role of the Senate is one of the fundamental checks \nand balances included within our great system of Government. Under the \nappointments clause of article II, section 2, of the Constitution, the \nPresident has the exclusive power to nominate principal officers of the \nUnited States, but the\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\nSenate must give its advise and consent. As Justice Scalia stated for \nthe Supreme Court earlier this year, ``[T]he Appointments Clause * * * \nis more than a matter of etiquette or protocol; it is among the \nsignificant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.''\n\n  The involvement of the Senate is designed to promote a high quality \nof appointments and curb executive abuses. In the words of Alexander \nHamilton in Federalist No. 76, ``The possibility of rejection [is] a \nstrong motive to care in processing.''\n  This resolution is designed to affirm the Senate's role by insisting \nthat the Attorney General stop interpreting the act out of existence. \nIt expressly states what should already be obvious from the plain \nlanguage of the Vacancies Act and its legislative history: that the \nVacancies Act applies to all executive departments and agencies, \nincluding the Department of Justice. The resolution also states that \nthe Attorney General should ensure that the Department of Justice \ncomplies with the act, and that she should inform other executive \nagencies to abide by it, as well.\n  This is not just a technical issue. It is not an idle problem. At \nsome point this year, six advise and consent positions in the Justice \nDepartment have been in violation of the Vacancies Act. The position of \nthe Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division has been \nvacant for over 2 years. This is an excellent example of the problem \nthe Vacancies Act was designed to prevent. The Nation's chief law \nenforcement agency has been without a confirmed chief for crime since \nAugust 31, 1995. No name has been forwarded in the 9 months that this \nCongress has been in session. Mr. President, what message does that \nsend about the Clinton administration's commitment to fighting crime?\n  In the meantime, the Attorney General has been in the middle of a \ntremendous controversy surrounding her reluctance to seek the \nappointment of an independent counsel to investigate apparently illegal \ncampaign fundraising practices. Would not having a politically \naccountable chief of the Criminal Division be helpful to her in \nanalyzing whether crimes were committed?\n  Also, consider the Office of Legal Counsel. Walter Dellinger was \nconfirmed to head OLC in 1993, but he was very controversial. Many \nmembers of this body could not support him. Nevertheless, effective \nJuly 1, 1996, the Attorney General made Mr. Dellinger acting Solicitor \nGeneral. The Senate may not have confirmed him to be Solicitor General. \nOf course, we will never know because by simply naming him acting \nSolicitor General, the administration avoided a fight over his \nappointment. For an entire year, for a full term of the Supreme Court, \nthe United States was represented by a Solicitor General who was acting \nin violation of the Vacancies Act, in violation of the law. The \nPresident has just officially nominated someone else for the vacancy.\n  Moreover, Mr. Dellinger's appointment caused another violation of the \nVacancies Act. When the Attorney General moved Mr. Dellinger, she \nappointed an acting chief of OLC, who served over 120 days without a \npermanent nomination being submitted. Not only did this appointment \nexceed 120 days, it wasn't even legal in the first place. The Vacancies \nAct not only limits the amount of time someone can serve in an acting \ncapacity, it also limits who can serve. Only someone who was the first \nassistant, which refers to the principal deputy, or someone who was \nearlier confirmed to a different advice and consent position can serve \nin the acting position. Mr. Dellinger's replacement did not meet either \nof these requirements. Thus, the chief of OLC was serving in violation \nof the Vacancies Act, in violation of the law, from the first day Mr. \nDellinger left.\n  Mr. President, the vacancies problem is not limited to the Department \nof Justice. It can be found throughout the executive branch. The \nWashington Post reported on August 29, 1997, that 30 percent of the top \n470 political jobs in the administration remain unfilled. When \nconfronted with the Vacancies Act, many departments and agencies use \nthe Attorney General's argument and also claim not to be bound by the \nact.\n  It is time to put the Attorney General's flawed interpretation of the \nVacancies Act to rest. Her reading of the Vacancies Act is a threat to \nthe advise and consent role of the Senate. I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will join me and my cosponsors in supporting this simple but \nsignificant resolution. Let us adopt this important resolution, and \nreaffirm our constitutional duty of advise and consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10068-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       THE VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  KYL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1254\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Kyl for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Jeffords) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1178) to amend the Immigration \nand Nationality Act to extend the visa waiver pilot program, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill insert the following section:\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) the inventory of public housing units owned and \n     operated by public housing agencies, an asset in which the \n     Federal Government has invested approximately \n     $90,000,000,000, has traditionally provided rental housing \n     that is affordable to low-income persons;\n       (3) despite serving this critical function, the public \n     housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including \n     the concentration of very poor people in very poor \n     neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public \n     housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations \n     aggravates the problem and places excessive administrative \n     burdens on public housing agencies;\n       (5) the interests of low-income persons, and the public \n     interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing \n     program that--\n       (A) consolidates many public housing programs into programs \n     for the operation and capital needs of public housing;\n       (B) streamlines program requirements;\n       (C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the \n     maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with \n     appropriate accountability to both public housing residents \n     and localities; and\n       (D) rewards employment and economic self-sufficiency of \n     public housing residents; and\n       (6) voucher and certificate programs under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 are successful for \n     approximately 80 percent of applicants, and a consolidation \n     of the voucher and certificate programs into a single, \n     market-driven program will assist in making section 8 tenant-\n     based assistance more successful in assisting low-income \n     families in obtaining affordable housing and will increase \n     housing choice for low-income families.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to consolidate the various programs and activities \n     under the public housing programs administered by the \n     Secretary in a manner designed to reduce Federal \n     overregulation;\n       (2) to redirect the responsibility for a consolidated \n     program to States, localities, public housing agencies, and \n     public housing residents;\n       (3) to require Federal action to overcome problems of \n     public housing agencies with severe management deficiencies; \n     and\n       (4) to consolidate and streamline tenant-based assistance \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Public housing agency.--The term ``public housing \n     agency'' has the same meaning as in section 3 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except with respect to any provision or \n     amendment identified by the Secretary under subsection (b) \n     and as otherwise specifically provided in this Act or the \n     amendments made by this Act, this Act and the amendments made \n     by this Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Exception.--\n       (1) Determination.--Not later than 2 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall identify any \n     provision of this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, the \n     implementation of which, in the determination of the \n     Secretary--\n       (A) requires a substantial exercise of discretion, such \n     that there exists a significant risk of litigation;\n       (B) requires a need for uniform interpretation; or\n       (C) is otherwise problematic, such that immediate \n     implementation is inappropriate.\n       (2) Notice.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 6 months after the date on which the \n     Secretary makes any identification under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall implement each provision or amendment so \n     identified by notice published in the Federal Register, which \n     notice shall--\n       (i) include such requirements as may be necessary to \n     implement the provision or amendment; and\n       (ii) invite public comments on those requirements.\n       (B) Effective date of notice.--The notice published under \n     paragraph (2) may, in the discretion of the Secretary, take \n     effect upon publication.\n       (3) Final regulations.--Not later than 12 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue such \n     final regulations as may be necessary, taking into account \n     any comments received under paragraph (2)(A)(ii), to \n     implement each provision or amendment identified under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 5. PROPOSED REGULATIONS; TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       (a) Proposed Regulations.--Not later than 9 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit \n     to Congress proposed regulations that the Secretary \n     determines are necessary to carry out the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937, as amended by this Act.\n       (b) Technical Recommendations.--Not later than 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall \n     submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking and \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives, \n     recommended technical and conforming legislative changes \n     necessary to carry out this Act and the amendments made by \n     this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. ELIMINATION OF OBSOLETE DOCUMENTS.\n\n       Effective 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     no rule, regulation, or order (including all handbooks, \n     notices, and related requirements) pertaining to public \n     housing or section 8 tenant-based programs issued or \n     promulgated under the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     before the date of enactment of this Act may be enforced by \n     the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter,\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n     the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on--\n       (1) the impact of the amendments made by this Act on--\n       (A) the demographics of public housing residents and \n     families receiving tenant-based assistance under the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937; and\n       (B) the economic viability of public housing agencies; and\n       (2) the effectiveness of the rent policies established by \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act on the \n     employment status and earned income of public housing \n     residents.\n                        TITLE I--PUBLIC HOUSING\n\n     SEC. 101. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       Section 2 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 2.

TREATMENT OF PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCY REPAYMENT \n                   AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Secretary.--During the 2-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, if the \n     Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, Nevada, is \n     otherwise in compliance with the Repayment Lien Agreement and \n     Repayment Plan approved by the Secretary on February 12, \n     1997, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall \n     not take any action that has the effect of reducing the \n     inventory of senior citizen housing owned by such housing \n     authority that does not receive assistance from the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n       (b) Alternative Repayment Options.--During the period \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary shall assist the \n     housing authority referred to in such subsection to identify \n     alternative repayment options to the plan referred to in such \n     subsection and to execute an amended repayment plan that will \n     not adversely affect the housing referred to in such \n     subsection.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--This section may not be \n     construed to alter--\n       (1) any lien held by the Secretary pursuant to the \n     agreement referred to in subsection (a); or\n       (2) the obligation of the housing authority referred to in \n     subsection (a) to close all remaining items contained in the \n     Inspector General audits numbered 89 SF 1004 (issued January \n     20, 1989), 93 SF 1801 (issued October 30, 1993), and 96 SF \n     1002 (issued February 23, 1996).\n\n     SEC. 408.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, each public housing \n     agency involved in the selection of residents under the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 (including section 8 of \n     that Act) should, consistent with the public housing agency \n     plan of the public housing agency, consider preferences for \n     individuals who are victims of domestic violence.\n\n     SEC. 410.

Mr. President, as we are all well aware, sustained \nmilitary operations around the world, coupled with declining numbers of \nactive duty personnel, have required the Defense Department to rely \nmore and more on the National Guard. Guard units and air assets have \nbeen called to active duty by the President and deployed throughout the \nworld with increasing frequency. Serving directly with their active \nduty counterparts, National Guard units today are in every military \ntheater. Theater commanders have continually stated that it would be a \nchallenge to efficiently execute their operations without the Guard.\n  Two weeks ago, I had the privilege of attending a parade in honor of \nVirginia National Guard soldiers who have been recalled to support \nOperation Joint Guard, the ongoing NATO mission in the former \nYugoslavia. The unit is Company C, 3-116th Infantry Battalion from the \n29th Infantry Division and their mission will be to secure the base \ncamp and Sava River bridge in Slavonski-Brod, Croatia. The 129 soldiers \nof this company will be deployed for up to 270 days. This is the first \ntime an infantry unit has been mobilized under a Presidential callup \nfor the Bosnia operation. I am very proud of this unit and all of the \nCommonwealth's National Guardsmen.\n  With the expanded role of the National Guard, I personally support \ngreater recognition of the National Guard chief. Guardsmen from the \nCommonwealth and across the United States require strong leadership \nwhich can make their concerns known to the active duty military and \nensure that the Guard is ready to perform its important missions. As \nalways, these citizen-soldiers have committed themselves to be ready on \na moment's notice. They must have a leader of sufficient rank and \nstature to effectively advocate their cause.\n  Recently, Senator Stevens delivered remarks to the National Guard \nAssociation on the role of the National Guard Bureau chief. Senator \nStevens' remarks highlight the important issues facing the National \nGuard today and why it is necessary for their chief to receive a place \nat the table with his active duty counterparts. I am submitting Senator \nStevens' remarks for the Record and I encourage my colleagues to take a \nmoment and review his thoughtful comments.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\n                     remarks of senator ted stevens\n\n       Thank you for the recognition and honor you confer on me \n     today.\n       The Harry S. Truman Award, unlike any other, reflects the \n     input of leaders from the 54 association chapters from every \n     corner of America.\n       There is no organization with whom I have worked more \n     closely than the National Guard Association during my 17 \n     years as chairman or ranking member of the Senate Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee.\n       This award reflects the tutelage I received from a previous \n     recipient of this honor, my close friend and mentor, John \n     Stennis.\n       The insight and wisdom of my great friend, compounded by my \n     own experience working with the Alaska National Guard, \n     founded my belief that the Guard serves as an essential \n     pillar of our national security.\n       Over the years, we have worked to modernize during the \n     buildup led by President Reagan in the 1980's, and now \n     realign force structure during the 1990's.\n       Our efforts reflect a determination to fulfill the vision \n     of our Nation's Founding Fathers--that our national defense \n     be maintained and preserved by citizen soldiers--by all \n     Americans.\n       The National Guard, and the National Guard Association of \n     the United States, are the embodiment of that guiding \n     principle in our Constitution.\n       Your conference here in Albuquerque serves to refresh, and \n     reforge, our mutual commitment to ensure the National Guard \n     grows in capability and stature within our national security \n     establishment.\n       While the Guard faces some tough trials in the weeks and \n     months ahead, there is genuine reason for optimism that our \n     efforts will succeed.\n       A major factor contributing to this optimism is the \n     bipartisan budget agreement, negotiated by my good friend, \n     Senator Pete Domenici, who is with us here today.\n       This compact should give us 5 years of stability in defense \n     funding--we've not enjoyed these circumstances since the \n     early 1980's.\n       With predictable spending levels, Secretary Bill Cohen and \n     the Joint Chiefs may plan and implement force realignment and \n     modernization plans.\n       Our job now is to assure Guard participation in the \n     allocation of resources and to modernize the force as we \n     enter the 21st century.\n       You have many real friends to turn to in this effort.\n       We've just heard from one of our most important friends, \n     Joe Ralston.\n       You don't need to hear from me how Joe feels about the \n     National Guard. Just ask Ed Baca, Jake Lestenkof, or Hugh \n     Cox.\n       Secretary Cohen knows first hand what the Guard means to \n     all our States, and is a genuine ally in the Senate on Guard \n     issues--he listens with a sympathetic ear. You'll hear from \n     General Reimer tomorrow. You'll find him a true friend also.\n       Your job, and mine, is to help these friends effectively \n     advocate the Guard's interests and priorities.\n  Now, more than ever before, the National Guard must function as a \ntotal partner in the total force. We cannot permit the National Guard \nto struggle for resources--it needs the total support of the Army and \nAir Force.\n  The Army and Air Force can only achieve their missions--our National \nSecurity missions--with the total participation and support of the \nNational Guard. It's a two-way street, and our system simply won't work \nany other way.\n  Recent missions in Bosnia, Southwest Asia, Haiti, and Korea make \napparent this axiom.\n  Each of you knows the extraordinary service performed by Air and Army \nNational Guard units overseas. On my own visits to these forces, every \nCINC has extolled the performance, readiness, and dedication of the \nNational Guard Forces assigned to their commands. That is the success \nstory of our total force.\n  While undertaking these military missions, the National Guard \ncontinues to serve its State role. Everyone of us here understands the \nunique status the Guard holds as an arm or our State governments. \nWhether responding to natural disasters, or managing the youth \nchallenge program performing so successfully, the National Guard serves \nour communities every day.\n  To ensure the representation of the National Guard at the highest \nlevels of DOD, I authored an amendment sponsored by 48 other Senators. \nThis legislation would change the rank, and role, of the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau.\n  That amendment passed the Senate without any objection, and awaits \nfinal resolution on the Defense authorization bill.\n  We succeeded in passing this legislation in large part because of the \nwork of the Guard, the association, and the adjutants general.\n  The expanded role of the Guard, and its relative size within the \nmilitary, should be reflected in an appropriate rank for the chief.\n  Resolution of this issue must include a voice--and a seat at the \ntable--for the National Guard, when the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs \nmake force structure and resource decisions that impact the Guard.\n  The details of my suggestion are yet to be resolved. Our goal is to \nassure that the National Guard leader is equal in rank and capability \nto the members of the Joint Chiefs.\n  Achieving this priority is only meaningful if we improve and build on \nrelations between the Army, the National Guard, and the Army Reserve.\n  This initiative is meant to build bridges, and expand the dialog and \nunderstanding by Pentagon leaders of the Guard's needs and \ncapabilities.\n  If by doing so, we burn bridges behind us, we will achieve little in \nthe end. We must achieve change--change that all parties can live with, \nand will commit to work together to achieve.\n  We continue to need your support and active involvement--you will \nmake the difference in the end. You and your force meet more Americans \nevery day than all other military forces put together. You need to \nsupport adequate funding levels for all defense activities, including \nthe Coast Guard.\n  You need to tell the chamber of commerce, the Rotary, the Lions, the \nKiwanis Clubs, and the PTA's what America needs is a ready defense \nforce. You are part of that force.\n  Again, let me thank you for honoring me today with the Truman Award. \nI am humbled by your recognition of my efforts.\n  I will continue to be your partner, and advocate, in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10092-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10093-S10094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATION OF LAWSUIT ABUSE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I recognize a growing \ngroup of concerned citizens in West Virginia working to educate the \npublic about their concerns over the costs of what they refer to as \n``lawsuit abuse.''\n  In many areas of West Virginia, local supporters of Citizens Against \nLawsuit Abuse have given their time on a volunteer basis to speak out \nabout an issue that has statewide and national implications. The costs \nof lawsuits can include higher costs for consumer products, higher \nmedical expenses, higher taxes, and fewer jobs, due to lost business \nexpansion and forgone product development. At the same time, the legal \nsystem must provide avenues for recourse and justice. Together, leaders \nand citizens must try to achieve consensus in ensuring that our system \nis balanced and fair to all.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse has a straightforward goal. They want \nto help the public prevent unnecessary lawsuits.\n  When West Virginians see a problem, we work to make people aware of \nit, and we try to make it right. CALA members are citizens who believe \nthey see harm to our society brought on by certain unnecessary lawsuits \nand excessive awards that can cripple a small business or strip an \nindividual of his or her life savings. CALA supporters emphasize that \nthey want to make sure that persons with a real need for the civil \njustice system have access to the courts. Public opinion surveys in our \nstate have shown that a majority of responsible citizens want their \nlegal system to be more fair, more effective, and more sensible, to \nserve everyone's interests.\n  These nonprofit CALA groups have raised local funds to run \neducational media announcements and are speaking to local organizations \nand citizen groups across the State to raise public awareness of the \nissue that they call ``lawsuit abuse.''\n  Supporters of CALA also encourage that citizens do their part by \nserving on juries when they are called. To help encourage the youth of \nWest Virginia to become responsible citizens when they reach adulthood, \nCALA groups have offered scholarship grants to students through an \nessay contest on the subject of importance of jury service.\n  While the local groups have thousands of supporters, there are few \nindividuals who should be recognized for their ongoing leadership and \nfor dedicating countless volunteer hours in the past year. These \nindividuals are Cuz Blake of Bridgeport, chairman and founding member \nof CALA of Northern\n\n[[Page S10094]]\n\nWest Virginia, and Robert Mauk of Huntington, chairman and founding \nmember of CALA of Southern West Virginia. Many others have given their \ntime and energy to these public watchdog groups as well, persons such \nas Sid Davis of Charleston who, despite having to take time off \nrecently for health reasons, has returned to his volunteer position as \nan officer of CALA of Southern West Virginia.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 21 \nthrough September 27, 1997, to be Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week in West \nVirginia. I commend all of the individuals who are involved in Citizens \nAgainst Lawsuit Abuse for their involvement in civic affairs and their \nefforts to promote constructive action in a policy area they care \nabout.\n  As someone who has been a leader for a balanced, responsible form of \nproduct liability reform, I continue to hope for the kind of education, \ndialogue, and consensus-building clearly needed to address problems in \nour legal system that hurt consumers, victims, and the private sector. \nI encourage CALA to continue raising these issues and promoting \nsolutions that ensure justice and improve the legal system. West \nVirginia and the country as a whole need informed, educated, and \ndedicated citizens to help elected officials address serious issues and \nachieve proper reforms when necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10093-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RIGHT TO LIFE OF MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor those of \nRight to Life of Livingston County, Inc. and Right to Life of Michigan \nfor their enduring commitment and dedication to one of today's most \nimportant social issues.\n  Mr. President, to those of us who are pro-life, being pro-life means \nprotecting our families and respecting the sanctity of life. It also \nmeans maintaining the central role of the family in all our lives. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to thank those of Right to Life of \nMichigan for their perseverance in support of those goals. \nUnfortunately, we still must spend much of our time in the political \nsphere, arguing against laws that promote the taking of unborn human \nlives, and I am grateful for all their efforts in that area as well.\n  Ending the tragedy of abortion will not be easy. But groups like \nRight to Life of Livingston County, National Right to Life of Michigan, \nand the National Right to Life Committee, are fighting a winning \nbattle. By their example, as well as their arguments, they are showing \nthe power and the beauty of human life.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, retinal degenerative diseases affect \nmore than six million Americans. This number is expected to climb \nbeyond 10 million as the baby boomers age. This is a vision timebomb \nand I have witnessed its devastating impact on many of our senior \ncitizens. September 27, 1997 marks World Retina Day, a day in which \norganizations around the world dedicated to finding the cures for \nretinal degenerative diseases join together to call attention to the \ncollaborative research that is being done internationally.\n  The most common retinal disease is age-related macular degeneration \n(AMD) which is the leading cause of vision loss in adults over the age \nof 60. Individuals with AMD not only lose their central vision, but \nalso their ability to read, drive and in many cases they lose their \nsense of independence. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a genetic disease \nthat steals the sight of the young, robbing them in the prime of their \nlife, their night vision and then their peripheral vision. RP is a \nprogressive disease, leading in most cases to blindness. There is no \ntreatment to stop the progression of this disease. Usher's Syndrome is \nalso a genetic disease and it is the leading cause of deaf-blindness in \nthe United States. This again shows up in our young, robbing them of \nvision and hearing. The suffering to the patients and their families is \nincalculable.\n  Due to the work funded by the National Eye Institute at the National \nInstitute of Health, and organizations such as the Foundation Fighting \nBlindness and similar organizations worldwide, significant progress in \nresearch has been made. Just this past week a stunning research \nbreakthrough was announced. Scientists have discovered gene mutations \nthat cause AMD. This landmark finding offers the first concrete \nevidence that AMD is genetically linked. There is now hope that by the \ntime the generation of the baby boomers reaches age 60, in about 10 \nyears, that there will be a genetic treatment for AMD. If a treatment \nis found, we will see a return on our investments in eye research, and \nthe savings to the budget in terms of health care costs will be \nsignificant.\n  With the international collaboration among researchers who represent \na broad spectrum of highly specialized scientific disciplines, great \nstrides have been made in understanding AMD, RP, Usher's syndrome and \nrelated retinal degenerative diseases. International breakthroughs and \ncollaboration in research warrant the recognition of World Retina Day. \nI am hopeful that there is a cure in sight. I believe that as we \ncontinue to fund medical research, diseases such as these will become \neradicated and remembered only in the archives of medical \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10094-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay \ntribute to a truly outstanding University in my home State of Missouri, \nSouthwest Missouri State University (SMSU). SMSU was one of 135 schools \nin 42 states selected to the John Templeton Foundation Honor Roll, ``a \ndesignation recognizing colleges and universities that emphasize \ncharacter building as an integral part of the college experience.''\n  Being the only public institution in Missouri to earn the 1997-98 \nHonor Roll distinction, SMSU is also one of the eight state-funded \nschools to receive the award nationwide. Schools competing for the \nHonor Roll were judged on five criteria and out of 2,208 four-year \naccredited undergraduate institutions only the top few were chosen. One \nof the categories where SMSU stood out was in community service. During \nthe 1996-97 school year the SMSU campus, including the faculty and \nstudents, volunteered more than 69,500 hours.\n  It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a University \nlike SMSU, whose service and character-building programs have earned it \nthis distinguished award. I commend SMSU's President, Dr. John Kaiser, \nfor his commitment to excellence and hope for continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10094-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10094-S10095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            JUDGE ROBERT AND HELENE BRANG GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced S. 1222. I \nask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Estuary Habitat Restoration \n     Partnership Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the estuaries and coastal regions of the United States \n     are home to half the population of the United States;\n       (2) the traditions, economy, and quality of life of many \n     communities depend on the natural abundance and health of the \n     estuaries;\n       (3) approximately 75 percent of the commercial fish and \n     shellfish of the United States depend on estuaries at some \n     stage in their life cycle;\n       (4) the varied habitats of estuaries and other coastal \n     waters provide jobs to 28,000,000 United States citizens in \n     commercial and sport fishing, tourism, recreation, and other \n     industries, with fishing alone contributing $111,000,000,000 \n     to the United States economy each year;\n       (5) despite the many values of estuaries, estuaries are \n     gravely threatened by estuary habitat alteration and loss;\n       (6) the accumulated loss of estuary habitat, reaching over \n     90 percent in some estuaries, threatens the ecological and \n     economic bounty of regions experiencing the loss, and can be \n     reversed only by action to restore lost and degraded estuary \n     habitat;\n       (7) the demands on Federal, State, and local funding for \n     estuary habitat restoration activities exceed available \n     resources and prompt serious concerns about the ability of \n     the United States to restore estuary habitat vital to efforts \n     to restore, preserve, and protect the health of estuaries;\n       (8) successful restoration of estuaries demands the full \n     coordination of Federal and State estuary habitat restoration \n     programs;\n       (9) to succeed in restoring estuaries, it is important to \n     link estuary habitat restoration projects to broader \n     ecosystem planning in order to establish restoration programs \n     that are effective in the long term;\n       (10) efficient leveraging of scarce public resources and \n     new and innovative market-based funding for estuary habitat \n     restoration activities would generate real returns on \n     investments for communities through improvement of the \n     vibrancy and health of estuaries;\n       (11) the Federal, State, and private cooperation in estuary \n     habitat restoration activities in existence on the date of \n     enactment of this Act should be strengthened and new public \n     and public-private estuary habitat restoration partnerships \n     established; and\n       (12) such new partnerships would help ensure the ecological \n     and economic vibrancy of estuaries for the benefit of future \n     generations.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a voluntary, community-driven, incentive-\n     based program that will catalyze the restoration of 1,000,000 \n     acres of estuary habitat by 2010;\n       (2) to encourage enhanced coordination and leveraging of \n     Federal, State, and community estuary habitat restoration \n     programs, plans, and studies;\n       (3) to establish effective estuary habitat restoration \n     partnerships among public agencies at all levels of \n     government and between the public and private sectors;\n       (4) to promote efficient financing of estuary habitat \n     restoration activities to help better leverage limited \n     Federal funding; and\n       (5) to develop and enhance monitoring and maintenance \n     capabilities designed to ensure that restoration efforts \n     build on the successes of past and current efforts and \n     scientific understanding.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, this is truly what is called getting the \nlast word, as I understand the unanimous consent agreement is for the \nadjourning of the Senate following my presentation.\n  I regret I was delayed. I wanted to be here to be involved in the \nback-and-forth discussion on campaign finance reform. Nonetheless, I am \nable to offer a few comments about some of the discussion we have had \nin the last few hours on this important issue.\n  It is important for everybody to understand that we are talking now \nabout campaign finance reform, and we ought not take a victory lap by \nvirtue of the fact that it is on the floor of the Senate. We are at the \nstarting line, not the finish line. The starting line was to scratch \nand fight and prod to try to get campaign finance reform to the floor \nbecause a whole lot of people didn't want us to talk about it or to \nconsider it.\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\n  Well, it is here, and now we are going to have some votes. I am going \nto offer amendments, some others will offer amendments, and we will see \nhow people feel about reforming our campaign finance system in this \ncountry.\n  Much of the discussion in the last couple of hours has been by those \nwho say they have constitutional objections to the McCain-Feingold \nbill, for example, and/or other proposals; that they somehow would \nviolate the Constitution. Earlier in the week, 126 legal scholars \nweighed in saying, ``Nonsense, this wouldn't violate the Constitution \nat all.'' In response to the scholars, one of my colleagues said, \n``Well, I suppose we could get 126 people who would tell us the Earth \nis flat.'' I imagine you could, but not constitutional scholars.\n  The issue here is people who understand the Constitution, people who \nstudy the Constitution, weighing in on this question of whether the \nproposals to change our system of campaign financing runs afoul of the \nConstitution. The answer, clearly, at least by 126 constitutional \nscholars is no, that's a bogus issue.\n  Mr. President, this issue of campaign finance reform is a critically \nimportant issue. I have served in public office for some long while, \nand I am proud to serve in public office. I am one of those who \nbelieves public service is important. I wake up in the morning and feel \nprivileged to be able to serve in the U.S. Senate. I come to work \nenjoying my job. I have a thirst for public issues and public debate \nand a contest of ideas. I think this is an honorable profession. I \nenjoy serving here. I want to do the things to advance public policy in \na way that gives the American people some confidence that those of us \nwho serve here serve the public interest.\n  I want to tell a story briefly about the campaign I waged for the \nU.S. Senate, having served for some terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I was better known than my opponent because I was an \nincumbent Congressman, although my opponent had run in statewide races \npreviously. Nonetheless, we both were endorsed by our respective \npolitical conventions to run for the U.S. Senate.\n  So I called for something in public debate with my opponent that I \nthought was unique, unusual, and something that had never been done \nbefore in this country in a Senate campaign. I said to my opponent, Why \ndon't you and I engage in a campaign that is the most unique and \nunusual that has been waged in modern times? Here's my proposition. I'm \nbetter known than you are because I've served in Congress and have run \nstatewide a good number of times. I accept that. I will be better known \nthan you are when we start this race. I propose this: I propose that I \nwill not run any television commercials, no radio advertisements, no \ncommercials of any kind during the entire campaign. You commit to do \nthe same thing, and then what we do is we pool our money and we buy 8 \nhours of prime-time television on the stations that serve in North \nDakota, and each week for 1 hour, we show up at a television station \nand have it simulcast across the stations in North Dakota; we show up \nwith no assistants, no aides, no handlers, no notes, no research \nmaterials, just the two of us, and no moderator, and for 1 hour a week \nprime time that we pay for, we tell North Dakotans why we want to serve \nin the U.S. Senate and the kind of ideas that we have for the future of \nour State in this country; we debate the issues of the day, one on one, \nan hour a week prime time for 8 weeks leading up to the election.\n\n  At the end of 8 weeks, having an hour debate every week, prime time \nsimulcast on all the stations, everyone in North Dakota would know who \nhe is, how he feels about issues, how he reacts in response to a public \ndebate about issues, and they would know who I am and how I respond to \nthe same thing.\n  My opponent chose not to accept that challenge. So the result was we \nhad a traditional campaign: He ran 30-second advertisements, the little \nslash-and-burn 30-second explosion that goes off in our minds that \ncontribute nothing to the public knowledge. It is part of the air \npollution in this country that happens every election year, that on \ntelevision and on the radio, we hear these 30-second and 1-minute \nexplosions that contribute nothing to the political dialog in America. \nSo that is what happened in my Senate race.\n  I regret that was the case because we could have had a Senate race \nthat would have hearkened back to the old days in which, without the \n30-second slash-and-burn advertisements, we would have had live, prime-\ntime debates without notes, without handlers, without moderators, just \ntalking about what we believed was necessary to do to assure a better \nfuture for this country and for our children.\n  Election contests should, after all, be a contest of ideas, but it is \nnot that these days. I have run in 10 statewide elections in North \nDakota--10 of them. So I know something about statewide campaigns. They \nare not any longer contests of ideas. They are an opportunity for \nhandlers and aides and gurus and assistants and pollsters and media \nadvisers to put together these little explosions and put them on \ntelevision, attempting to mischaracterize some other position or some \nother candidate.\n  Often, the television commercial that is paid for by a candidate has \nno explanation except a little line that no one can see on the bottom \nthat the candidate is even sponsoring it. I have made some suggestions \non how we should address that issue, just as an example, and I am going \nto offer it as an amendment and we will have a chance to vote on it in \nthe Senate. Some will not like it. I don't know if it will prevail.\n  Here is what I think we should do. We, by law, say television \nstations are to provide what we call the lowest card rate for political \nadvertising during certain political periods during campaigns. If you \nare running political campaigns and buying political time, you get the \nlowest rate on the rate card and you are guaranteed that by law. I am \ngoing to offer an amendment that I think will change the culture of \nthese 30-second little slash-and-burn commercials that have become the \ntrademark of American campaigns. Mine will be very simple. The only \ncommercials in political advertising that will qualify for the lowest \nrate or lowest cost will be those that are at least 1 minute in length \nand on which the candidate appears on the commercial 75 percent of the \ntime. If those two conditions are not met, they don't buy at the bottom \nof the rate card.\n\n  It costs them much, much more. Let us at least, if we are going to \nhave a law that requires cutrate advertising prices, be afforded \ncampaigns, as now exists in law, let us at least allow that to provide \nan incentive for the right kind of public discussion. No one who is \nthinking, in my judgment, can believe the right kind of public \ndiscourse in this country these days is the little 30-second pollution \nout there on television and radio that contributes nothing to public \ndialog; it simply attempts to cut down the other candidate and demean \nthe other candidate, having nothing to do with the issues.\n  Am I suggesting those who run for public office ought to be free of \npublic scrutiny and free of public criticism? Not at all, but we ought \nto provide some incentives in which the public gets a decent debate \nabout public issues in our campaigns. So we will have an opportunity to \nvote on my amendment during this discussion.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate as a supporter of the McCain-\nFeingold legislation. Would I have written it differently? Yes, I think \nso. There are some things I would have changed substantially, but I \nhave great admiration for Senator McCain and Senator Feingold and for \nthe persistence with which they bring this legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate. They believe the current system of financing campaigns is \nbroken and something ought to be done. There are some in the Senate who \nbelieve that things are just fine, let's just keep going just the way \nwe are going, things are just terrific, and they don't want anybody to \ndo anything to change what is now happening.\n  There is an old saying that the water ``ain't'' going to clear up \nuntil you get the hogs out of the creek. The only way we are going to \nclear up the water of campaign financing in this country is for those \nof us who believe that we need to change the method by which we finance \ncampaigns in this country is if we are able to beat back, by voting on \nthe Senate floor, the attempts of those who want to stall, once again, \nour ability to change this system.\n  Mr. President, I want to show a chart that describes better than all \nthe words\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\nI can use what is wrong with our campaign financing system.\n  This is money in politics, an explosion of money in politics, \nspending on all congressional races, 1976 to 1996. And you say, \n``What's happening to this line?'' Money in politics.\n\n  I wonder if when George Washington and Mason and Madison and Ben \nFranklin sat in that little room in Philadelphia and talked about what \nkind of a constitution they should create for this country, I wonder if \nthey thought that we would get to this kind of situation where a \nrepresentative democracy would see the election of those \nrepresentatives part and parcel of a system in which there is an \nexplosion of money and elections all too often become auctions rather \nthan elections. I do not think so.\n  I do not think this represents the best of democracy. I do not think \nit represents something that we can be proud of, as those of us who \nparticipate. I think we ought to change it.\n  So the question for me and some others in this Chamber is not whether \nwe address this issue and make some changes, the question is, What kind \nof changes should we make? The McCain-Feingold bill comes to the floor \nof the Senate--as I have indicated, I am a cosponsor but I might have \nwritten parts of it differently.\n  As I understand it, the specific McCain-Feingold proposal that is \nbrought to the floor of the Senate now does not contain some of the \ncentral portions that I think are necessary in really making progress \nin reforming our campaign financing system.\n  For example, we have to, in my judgment, have expenditure limits on \ncampaigns in order to be effective. There is too much money in \npolitics. If we do not put spending limits on campaigns, then we are \nnot going to solve the problem. I understand that the spending limits \nwhich were in the McCain-Feingold bill, which were voluntary spending \nlimits, have been removed and we will now have to try to put them back \nin by amendment.\n  So the question for the Senate is going to be, Can we attach \nindividual spending limits, State by State, to campaigns and enforce \nthem in some way in this piece of legislation?\n  Originally, the legislation had what are called voluntary spending \nlimits which had incentives in order to get people to say, ``Yes, we'll \naccept spending limits.'' And the incentives persuading them to accept \nspending limits would then impose limits on the campaigns.\n  It is interesting, the Supreme Court in a case called Buckley versus \nValeo ruled by a 5-4 decision that we cannot have spending limits that \nare enforceable in campaigns. I would like to see the Supreme Court \nrevisit that issue, the 5-4 decision. Everybody has a right to be \nwrong. When the Supreme Court is wrong, of course, it is the law of the \nland.\n  The Supreme Court, in my judgment, was fundamentally wrong here. We \nreally ought to have the Supreme Court review this once again--and I \nthink we reach a different result. But, nonetheless, the result we now \nhave in Buckley versus Valeo says that you cannot have enforceable \nspending limits. So the attempt has been to provide what are called \nvoluntary spending limits and sufficient incentives in law that would \npersuade people to abide by and adopt those spending limits.\n  I think in the coming days it is going to be clear, with respect to \nthe debate in the Senate, the difference between the two groups. I am \nnot talking about Democrats and Republicans; I am talking about two \ngroups of people. There is one group that says, ``Look, things are \nfine. What do you mean, there's too much money in politics? Too much \nmoney spent on Rolaids or Kleenex,'' they will say. ``Gee, we don't \nhave enough money in politics.''\n\n  There is another group that said, ``Wait a second.'' I mean, it does \nnot take glasses to see what is going on here. What has happened is an \navalanche of money is thrown into this political system, and it is \ncorrupting the system. If we cannot have some spending limits \nsomeplace, if we cannot, as a group, decide there is too much money in \npolitics, if we cannot decide that this red line going nearly straight \nup represents the corrosive influence of money in politics, then we are \nnot going to succeed. Yes, we got the bill to the floor of the Senate, \nbut we will not succeed in solving the campaign finance problem that \nexists in this country.\n  So we will see now in the coming weeks, I suppose the coming 2 weeks, \nperhaps, when this is finally complete. There is a group that says, \n``Gee, things are terrific. Let's leave things the way they are. We \nlike money. In fact, the more the merrier.'' They don't say it, but I \nthink they are kind of concocting a golden rule--he who has the gold, \nrules. The fact is that we have one group that has twice as much as the \nother group, so they want the rules to admire that and suggest that \nthat is just fine.\n  I suppose you can make the case that those who do not have as much \nmoney would like to put limits on those who do. But you know, the \nAmerican people are eventually going to rule the day here. The American \npeople are going to make the decision through their representatives \nhere in Congress and through public pressure to say either, ``Yes, we \nthink this is great. We think this flood of money coming into politics \nis a wonderful thing. It really nurtures our political system,'' or the \nAmerican people will likely say, as all the polls tell us, by 70 and 80 \npercent, ``This doesn't make any sense at all. This avalanche of money \nis hurting our political system.''\n  We have what is called ``hard money'' and ``soft money'' and \ncontributions on this side and that side. I imagine that people have \ndifficulty understanding ``hard money'' and ``soft money.'' The easy \nway to understand it, for example, is soft money is the legal form of \ncheating--cheating, yes--because no one anticipated, with current \ncampaign laws, that the kind of money that is now used called ``soft \nmoney'' would be, could be, or should ever be used for purposes it is \nnow being employed to achieve; that is, millions, tens of millions of \ndollars, yes, by both political parties, tens of millions of dollars \nthrown into what is called party building. But it is not party \nbuilding. These are moneys that are spent in a way designed to \ninfluence individual elections and designed carefully in ways to avoid \nit appearing like they are direct expenditures under regulation of the \nFederal Election Commission.\n  The corrosive part of the soft money issue is that is money that can \nbe thrown in--it can be by a corporation, labor organization, rich \nindividuals, you name it--it can be thrown into a race under the guise \nof not part of the hard money contribution, but it can affect that race \nin a dramatic way. The source of the money is never revealed--secret \nmoney out there, never revealed. And you can move the money around \nthree, four different ways to different organizations, and the source \nof the money is never revealed--half a million dollars here, a million \ndollars there.\n  You know who the victims have been of that? We can name some of the \nvictims who at the end of their campaigns, thinking it was them versus \nanother candidate in a contest of ideas in their State, found out it \nwas not that. Yes, that was part of it. Then there are organizations, \nunnamed and newly named organizations, off to the side, running in with \nsaddlebags full of soft money, the source of which no one would ever \ndisclose, putting advertisements on television, negative, corrosive, \nugly advertisements in order to knock one of the candidates out of the \nrace.\n\n  That is what this political system has become. If we do not fix it, \nif we do not address that, shame on us. The American people know it is \nwrong, and we ought to know it is wrong.\n  So the question ought not be for anybody in this Chamber whether we \naddress this issue in a thoughtful way and pass some legislation \nfinally to reform the campaign finance system; the question ought to \nbe, how? How do we do it? We have a couple weeks in which this Senate \ncan express its judgment on that issue.\n  I have great respect for every other Member of this Senate. There are \nsome who stand here today and say they are very concerned about this \naspect or that aspect. I have great respect for them. I am not going to \nsuggest they have impure motives. But I am saying that in the strongest \npossible ways, if they believe that what we ought to do is nothing, if \nthey believe the current system of financing campaigns in this country \nis good for this country, then they are dreadfully wrong. So we will \nsee in the next couple of weeks.\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\n  I just mentioned soft money and independent expenditures. There is \nanother category called issue advertising which is tied in with the \nsame sort of thing--issue advertising.\n  Let me read from an article out of Rollcall.\n\n       While presidential, Senate, and House candidates spent a \n     record $400 million on TV ads last year, more than two dozen \n     organizations dumped an additional $150 million into \n     controversial issue advertising in the 1995-96 cycle . . .\n\n  And guess what? What kind of advertising was this? Eighty-one percent \nof it was negative advertising; 81 percent negative advertising. That \nis the air pollution in this country that we ought to worry about. We \nought to do something about it.\n  I am not suggesting it is inappropriate to have issue advertising. \nBut we ought to make it all accountable. If you are going to come in \nand play a role in these campaigns, then tell the American people where \nyou got your money, whose money is it you are spending, and what is the \npurpose of the expenditure.\n  Mr. President, we have had a lengthy discussion today and the \ndiscussion will go on, I assume, for about 2 weeks, and it will be \nbetween those who believe we ought to have reform and those who don't.\n  Speaker Gingrich calls for more, not less, campaign cash, in an \narticle in the Washington Post. He represents a group who believe that \nmoney is not a problem--we probably need more money in politics, not \nless. I absolutely disagree with him.\n  In another article, ``Group launches effort against campaign finance \nreform bill.'' Some very large influential groups in this country who \nare deeply involved in issue advertising of the type I just described \ndon't want campaign finance reform. I guess I can understand why, but I \nthink they are wrong.\n  Mr. President, 45 members of my caucus signed a piece of legislation \nsaying they are prepared to vote for McCain-Feingold; four in the other \ncaucus said the same thing. If we can get a vote, up or down, we are \nlooking for one or two additional Members of the Senate who will decide \nwhether we pass this legislation.\n  There are those, I suppose, who will say, ``We need more time.'' We \nhave had 6,700 pages of hearing, 3,361 floor speeches--and we can add \ntoday's to that, all of this on the issue of campaign finance reform--\n446 legislative proposals, and 113 votes in the Senate. I don't know of \nanyone who can credibly say we need more time.\n  What we need is the nerve and the will to do what is right. I hope we \nmight see that kind of nerve and will in the next couple of weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10097-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAST-TRACK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been so tempted today, I wanted \nvery much to come and speak about fast track, which the President is \nasking with respect to trade authority, and I was intending to do that \nat time when it was appropriate today, but because of the debate on \ncampaign finance reform time was not available for that. I thought \nabout doing it at the end of my remarks on campaign finance reform, but \nI know that there are those who want to do other things and there is \nsome sort of dispatch for the Senate to adjourn. I will respect that. \nBut I want to say about two paragraphs as I conclude.\n  I hope to come back on Monday and find some time to discuss President \nClinton's proposal to provide fast-track trade authority so he can \nnegotiate additional trade agreements. I am opposed to that, and I am \ngoing to resist vigorously trade authority that would provide the \nPresident, any President, the opportunity to negotiate new trade \nagreements until we fix the problems in the old agreement.\n  Let me leave with a couple of statistics. We now have a pretty good \neconomy, that is true. We tackled the fiscal policy budget deficit. But \nthe other deficit, the trade deficit, is the highest in this country's \nhistory.\n  Every time we negotiate a new trade agreement we seem to lose. We \nnegotiated an agreement with Canada. Our deficit was $13 billion with \nCanada; now it is double. We negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico. \nWe had a $2 billion surplus; now after the trade agreement we have a \n$14 billion deficit. We have a $50 to $60 billion trade deficit with \nJapan, a $40 to $50 billion trade deficit with China. We are up to our \nneck in trade problems and cannot resolve virtually any of those \nproblems because our trade treaties, first of all, were negotiated \ninappropriately to provide the kind of sanctions they ought to for \nthose that don't open their markets to American goods. And second, we \ndon't enforce trade treaties that other countries have signed with us.\n  I want to speak at some great length, I hope on Monday, on this \nsubject. I am not speaking on trade because I am what is called a \nprotectionist, xenophobe, or isolationist. I believe in trade. I \nbelieve in free trade. I demand fair trade, and I believe we ought to \nexpand our trade opportunities. But I believe this country ought to, \nfor a change, stand up for its own economic interests and demand that \nmanufacturing and jobs and opportunity exist in this country's future \nand not trade away those opportunities so that corporations can access \ndime-an-hour labor by 14-year-old kids working 14 hours a day to ship \nproducts to Fargo, ND, or Pittsburgh. That is not free trade. I will \ntalk at some length on Monday about that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/26/senate-section/article/S10100-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
