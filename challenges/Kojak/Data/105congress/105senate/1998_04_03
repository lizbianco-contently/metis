More than wishful thinking, yearning, or shallow \noptimism, we turn to You for lasting hope. We have learned that true \nhope is based on the expectation of the interventions of Your Spirit \nthat are always on time and in time. You are the intervening Lord of \nthe Passover, the opening of the Red Sea, the giving of the Ten \nCommandments. You have vanquished the forces of evil, death, and fear \nthrough the Cross and the Resurrection. All through the history of our \nNation, You have blessed us with Your providential care. It is with \ngratitude that we affirm, ``Blessed is the Nation whose God is the \nLord.''--Psalm 33:12.\n  May this sacred season, including both Passover and Holy Week, be a \ntime of rebirth of hope in us. May Your Spirit of hope displace the \ndiscordant spirit of cynicism, discouragement, and disunity. Hope \nthrough us, O God of hope. Flow through us patiently until we hope for \none another what You have hoped for us. Then Lord, give us the vision \nand courage to confront those problems that have made life seem \nhopeless for some people. Make us communicators of hope. We trust our \nlives, the work of the Senate, and the future of our Nation into Your \nall-powerful hands. In the Name of the Hope of the World. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3191-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In addition, the Senate, of course, will \ntake up any executive or legislative business cleared for Senate \naction. I thank all the Senators who have been working on the \ninternational shipping bill, including the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Hutchison; the chairman of the full Committee on \nCommerce, Senator McCain; Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who has \nbeen working to address some concerns he still has, and he believes he \nmay have an amendment on this later on today; and Senator Harkin and \nothers who worked with us on getting this language agreed to so that we \ncan take up this important legislation.\n  I do confirm that there are some further nominations that we hope to \nmove today. Several of them were considered and approved last night, \nbut we will be going over the list in the next couple hours to see if \nthere are others that can be approved. There will be no rollcall votes \ntoday. The next rollcall vote will occur on or in regard to the \nCoverdell A+ education savings account bill on Tuesday, April 21, at a \ntime to be announced--probably in the morning, hopefully the early \nmorning of Tuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3191-7", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3191-S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ACTIONS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since there is no other Senator seeking \nrecognition at this time, I wish to further comment on the action of \nthe Senate over the past few days, particularly with regard to the \nbudget resolution that passed last night. Because of the lateness of \nthe hour and the fact that we had had 24 votes during the day on \nThursday, we did not really have an opportunity\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\nto give proper accolades when we completed that work.\n  I say again how much I appreciate the leadership of Senator Domenici, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. As always, he exhibited real \nleadership. He knows more about budget substance, about the numbers, \nand about the points of order than all the rest of us combined \nprobably. He did a great job of getting the bill through in, I believe, \nrecord time at least in recent history, certainly since I have been in \nthe Senate since 1988. So I thought that was a \ntremendous accomplishment. He did get good cooperation from Senator \nLautenberg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and he worked \non both sides of the aisle to hold down some of the amendments that \nreally did not need to be offered, either sense of the Senate or could \nbe offered at another time.\n\n  It was really a tremendous accomplishment to get it completed from a \nprocess standpoint, but also the substance deserves more attention than \nwe were able to give it late last night. It is a historic budget \nbecause it does for the first time since, I believe, 1969 get us to an \nactual balanced budget and to a surplus, hopefully, in this year and \nover the next few years, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars of \nsurplus, which is something we have not experienced in a long, long \ntime. So it is balanced. It will lead to surpluses. It provides tax \ncuts, and we hope to have even more tax cuts agreed to in the \nconference report beyond what was actually included in this budget \nresolution.\n  It does take steps to further protect and preserve and allows us to \nlook at reforming Social Security so it will be there not only for our \nparents but for ourselves and our children well into the next century \nby setting aside a surplus for Social Security.\n  I think that is a very positive step. I think we need to think very \ncarefully about how we go beyond not just setting aside some money but \nhow we really deal with the future needs of Social Security. It also, \nafter repeated attacks, continues to say that any tobacco settlement \nthat we may reach will go into Medicare, where it is needed, because \nover the next 8 to 10 years that program will again begin to have \nproblems.\n  So the combination was a really good budget resolution. It goes to \nconference now, as I noted. We will have a good conference. I hope, as \nwe discussed yesterday, that we can actually come up with more tax cuts \nthan we have earmarked in this budget resolution. But I remind my \ncolleagues we can always come up with more than what is provided in the \nbudget if we can find offsets, and we should look for them. We should \nlook for places where there is spending not necessary or that is \nduplicative or can be better used by allowing people to keep their own \nmoney.\n  I do think we should make a special effort this year to begin the \nprocess of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. How in the world in \nAmerica can we defend the fact that young couples, when they get \nmarried, pay more taxes even though they make no more income. The \naverage tax increase for a married couple over what they pay before \nthey are married is $1,400. You talk about fairness in the Tax Code. \nThat is one provision that must be changed, and we will work together \nin a bipartisan way to see if we can eliminate the marriage penalty tax \nthis year.\n  I also thank the Senate for a lot of good work in other areas over \nthe past couple weeks. We did reach agreement on how to consider the \nCoverdell A+ education bill. It will be a very fair process. We will \nhave 15 or so amendments that will be offered dealing with education \nonly, not extraneous matters that we argued about for over 2 weeks. It \nwill deal with education from both sides of the aisle. Some of them may \nbe accepted, some of them may be second degreed, but I think we will \nhave a great education discussion when we return on April 20, and \nhopefully we can complete that bill by April 22.\n  We do hope to take up the NATO enlargement bill later on that week, \nbut I want to make sure that every Senator is comfortable with how that \nis done, make sure that we have enough time to debate that very \nimportant matter fully, but reach a conclusion within, hopefully, 3 \ndays or so--probably by the 26th or 27th of April.\n  The Finance Committee took a very positive step forward earlier this \nweek with regard to IRS reform. The House did a good job last year \ngetting it started, but we found where there are other real abuses by \nIRS. We had a unanimous bipartisan vote to report the IRS reform bill \nout of the Finance Committee, so that bill will be coming to the floor, \nprobably around the first week in May--May 4, something of that nature. \nIt does deal with abuses of such things like the innocent spouse, where \nan innocent spouse, even though he or she may be divorced, is now being \nheld responsible for half or all of the debts of their spouse or former \nspouse in a very unfair way. It does provide for some restrictions on \nthe excesses of penalties and interest. Many of us know instances, now, \nwhere people have found that they owe more in penalties and interest on \ntaxes than they originally owed. So this bill will begin to cut that \nback and get it under control. I think the taxpayers will be very proud \nof that.\n  Finally, I think we should take note of the vote that occurred in the \nSenate Commerce Committee on a tobacco settlement package. It still has \na long way to go, but that vote was 19 to 1, and was reported out. Most \npeople thought it would never get beyond the committee, that it \nprobably would never even be considered. But it was considered, and I \nthink that was a move that will lead us to an opportunity in late May \nto take up that very important legislation to deal with teenage \nsmoking, to try to deal with the Medicare problems that are caused by \nthe health effects of smoking.\n  I commend Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, all those on both \nsides of the Commerce Committee for their leadership there.\n  So, as is typical of the Senate, after a lot of work behind the \nscenes, there was a burst of activity this week, and I think it has put \nus in a position to complete a lot of good bills when we return the \nlatter part of April.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3191-8", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR--S. 414\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, American ports and carriers and \nshippers are disadvantaged by current laws that require all contracts \nto be public. To avoid publication, U.S. ports are bypassed when \npossible and the U.S. carriers lose business. U.S. exporters, unlike \ntheir foreign competitors, must reveal their ocean transportation \ncosts, permitting the foreign competition to undercut them. Recent \neconomic problems in Asia will increase pressure in those countries to \nincrease their exports. S. 414 will be even more important if our \nshippers meet the heightened competitive challenge. S. 414 attempts to \nlevel the playing field between U.S. companies which export and their \nforeign competitors.\n  This bill will encourage greater competition among carriers. It will \nprovide American exporters and importers with greater choice in \nobtaining ocean transportation services and promote more ocean shipping \nactivity for our carriers and our ports.\n  In providing our shippers with this important reform, we have still \nattempted to preserve antidiscrimination provisions in current law and \nthe elements of our current ``transparent'' system that protect our \nports, smaller shippers, and U.S. workers. This bill balances the need \nto have enough transparency to assure fair pricing with contract \nprivacy.\n  Ninety-five percent of U.S. foreign commerce is transported via ocean \nshipping. Half of this trade which is carried by container liner \nvessels with scheduled service is regulated under the Shipping Act of \n1984 and would be affected by these reforms. This legislation \nrepresents an important opportunity to ease the hand of regulation on a \nsignificant sector of commerce.\n  This bill represents the first major reform of this critical industry \nin a decade and the most significant change to the underlying statute \nsince 1984. Its completion complements the free trade revolution that \nhas occurred during this same period and will allow American businesses \nand consumers to take advantage of the global increase in trade, both \nimports and exports.\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have worked on this bill with the \ndistinguished Majority Leader Lott and colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle to advance this important legislation. I really appreciate \nthe leadership of the ranking member of the full Commerce Committee, \nSenator Hollings, as well as certainly the ranking member of the \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, Senator \nInouye, and my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, and the \nchairman of the committee, Senator McCain.\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\n  I would also like to acknowledge the concerns of my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Gorton. I am aware of the outstanding issue that he \nwill soon address with his amendment. I understand the merits of his \namendment. I have sympathy for it. However, I will have to vote against \nit and urge my colleagues to do likewise because its adoption at this \ntime will jeopardize the progress of this bill.\n  I would like to outline the key points of the legislation. Here are \nthe highlights of the floor amendment that I have introduced.\n  We provide shippers and common carriers greater choice and \nflexibility in entering into contractual relationships for ocean \ntransportation and intermodal services. To this end, the most \nsignificant improvements are:\n  No. 1, that we strengthen the right of individual members of ocean \ncarrier groups to negotiate and enter into service contracts with one \nor more shippers, independent of the carrier group. This means that \nindividual carriers will be better able to customize their services \nwithout the interference of the carrier conferences.\n  No. 2, we clarify the rights of groups of ocean common carriers to \njointly negotiate inland transportation rates and services consistent \nwith antitrust statutes and FMC approval. This means that carriers will \nbe able to incorporate electronic commerce, logistics and other \nservices that add value to the customer's contract.\n  No. 3, we continue to require a form of tariff publication. However, \nit is much more flexible than the current tariff filings. Tariffs \nbecome effective upon publication through a private system, such as on \nthe carriers' World Wide Web pages, not a governmental publication. \nAlso tariff changes do not require Government approval. This puts the \nmaritime industry on a similar footing as other transportation \nindustries which we have deregulated in recent years, providing \ncarriers with greater flexibility.\n  The measure protects U.S. exporters from disclosure to their foreign \ncompetitors of certain proprietary business information through their \ncontractual relationships with common carriers by allowing \nconfidentiality of certain service contract terms. As I have mentioned \nearlier, our competitors can and do contract ocean shipping \ntransportation confidentially, and our shippers never know what their \ncompetitors are paying for transportation. However, U.S. shippers' \nocean transportation costs are an open book, and foreign competitors \nuse the information to undercut our exporters whenever possible. Our \nports suffer, too. Shippers who conveniently can, will ship out of \nforeign ports in nearby Canada or Mexico to avoid this penalty.\n  Our shippers say they want more flexibility in dealing with their \nocean carriers and the ability to go outside the traditional tariff \nsystem and conference structure. We have provided this needed \nconfidentiality, but balanced it with protections for ports and U.S. \ndockworkers who seek information on the movement of commodities to \nprotect their competitive position.\n  Additionally, this measure relaxes some of the restrictions on \nindividual carriers relating to practices or preferences in dealing \nwith exporters, but maintains them with regard to the concerted \nactivity of two or more carriers.\n  Finally, the reported bill would have combined the functions of the \nFederal Maritime Commission and the Service Transportation Board into a \nsingle agency. This floor amendment retains these separate agencies and \nfunctions in their current form.\n  Thus, the overall thrust of this entire bill--with the amendment that \nI am offering--is to generate more competition for shippers of all \nsizes in the ocean transportation sector and to make this important \ntransportation link to their overseas markets more affordable and \nsensitive to their individual needs.\n  This is a bill that should help our ports get more business, which \nmeans more jobs in America. It should level the playing field for our \nU.S. carriers while protecting the rights of shippers and dock workers \nand other union personnel. It is very important that we have tried to \nbalance this.\n  Is the bill perfect? No. There are things I would like to have seen \ndifferent. We have had to compromise to a degree. But I do think we \nhave done a good job of working with all the interests here and \nallowing our carriers, shippers and ports to compete, which means jobs \nfor Americans.\n  That is the purpose of this bill. I believe we have done it in the \nbest way we could, balancing all of the competing interests. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2287 to Amendment No. 1689\n\n     (Purpose: To provide rules for the application of the Act to \n                            intermediaries)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington, [Mr. Gorton], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2287 to amendment numbered 1689.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 5, line 10, strike ``ocean''.\n       On page 5, line 15, strike ``ocean''.\n       On page 11, line 16, strike ``ocean''.\n       On page 12, line 8, strike ``ocean''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with the exception of the single paragraph \ntoward the beginning of the eloquent statement by the Senator from \nTexas, I agree, literally, with every word of her remarks. In fact, I \nthink, as I will show to you, that single paragraph with which I \ndisagree is totally inconsistent with the remarks of the Senator from \nTexas. Let me tell you why.\n  For my first 3 years in the U.S. Senate, 1981-1984, I held hearings, \ndrafted, worked on, discussed, and ultimately sponsored and passed the \nShipping Act of 1984. Fifteen years ago, I probably could have recited \nit from memory. I was at that time the chairman of the subcommittee of \nthe Commerce Committee now chaired by my esteemed friend, the Senator \nfrom Texas. The goal of the Shipping Act of 1984 was to breathe fresh \nair, competition, and deregulation into the worldwide system of ocean \ncarriage of goods, at least as that carriage affected the United \nStates. It was an industry controlled by cartels and monopolies far \nless interested in those whom it served than in those who provided the \nservice--most particularly, many foreign-flagged merchant marines.\n  I am certain when I introduced that bill for debate I made the same \nremarks the Senator from Texas has just made--that it was not perfect, \nthat it did not create a purely competitive market, but that it \nrepresented a major step forward in allowing the fresh air of \ncompetition to breathe on the ocean carriage of goods. And now building \non that 1984 act, the Senator from Texas has brought us a further \nproposal which opens up, still wider, the field of ocean carriage of \ngoods to competition. It is in that respect a fine bill.\n  What the bill does is say that shippers can make agreements with \nocean carriers in the same fashion that almost all contracts in the \nprivate sector can be made in the United States without having to \nfollow the specific monetary requirements of filed tariffs, but simply \nas private contracts in which the shipper could get the best possible \ndeal that it can negotiate and the carrier can get as high a price for \nthat carriage as it can negotiate. This is the heart of the free market \nsystem. It is a precisely proper philosophy for the carriage of goods \nby sea. The bill also allows the ocean carriers to get together with \nland carriers so that you can get one price for shipping your goods \nfrom, say, in your case, Mr. President, Cheyenne, WY, to Yokohama, \nJapan, also a major step forward.\n  One thing, however, it does not do, and that is what my amendment is \nall about. If you are a major manufacturer, a huge shipper, capable of \nfilling an entire vessel with a single shipment of your goods, or at \nleast so large a container that you can effectively deal directly with \nthe ocean carrier, you get the advantage of this competitive system. \nYou can make the best deal you can wring out of that ocean carrier.\n  But if you are the kind of shipper or seller that I suspect is more \ncommon in a rural State like Wyoming, and you\n\n[[Page S3200]]\n\nare shipping only a modest amount of goods, you have very little \nleverage with the ocean carrier. You probably don't even know very much \nabout how to engage in that business. So you hire an intermediary, \nusually in one of America's ports, a customs broker, or a freight \nconsolidator, to do it for you. These intermediaries, almost without \nexception, are small business people. That intermediary gets together a \nbunch of shipments from small shippers and it makes the contract with \nthe ocean carrier. In other words, small business people hire other \nsmall business people to consolidate their shipments so they can have \nadvantages equal to those of the big businesses and the big shippers.\n  At the present time, under the 1984 law the same rules as to \npublished tariffs and the degree of competition or lack of competition \napply to the big shipper and the small shipper.\n  And I may say that when the Senator from Texas wrote this bill, she \nprovided the same advantages to the small shipper and the intermediary \nas she did to the big shipper. Obviously, there should not be \ndiscrimination between those two groups. And that is the way the bill \nwas reported from the Commerce Committee--more competition, more \nability to negotiate. You didn't have to tell your competitors what you \nwere paying. Everybody benefited.\n  Oh, but, Mr. President, what happen then? Well, then, the big \nlongshore unions objected. The International Longshoremen's Association \nand the International Longshoremen's and Warehouseman's Union don't \nlike these little guys because sometimes the little guys don't use the \nlongshore unions to put these shipments together. So the longshoremen's \nunions go to the majority leader and the Senator from Texas and say: We \nare not going to let this bill pass unless you help us drive these \nlittle people out of business and say that we will give all of these \nnew competitive advantages to the big boys, who automatically use the \nlongshore unions, but we are not going to give the benefits of \ncompetition to the little people, to that small shipper from Cheyenne, \nWY; we are not going to give them to that freight intermediary in \nSeattle, WA, or in Newark, NJ. Oh, no. They still have to publish their \nrates. They still can't enter into long term contracts and make the \nbest possible deal.\n  So not only are you depriving the small shippers and transportation \nintermediaries of an advantage of a free market, you are telling them \nthey are in a terribly unfavored competitive situation as against the \nocean carriers themselves. You are forcing the small shipper in \nCheyenne, if he can possibly do so, to go directly to the ocean \ncarrier.\n  What kind of deal do you expect he is going to get under those \ncircumstances? He doesn't know anything about these transactions and he \ndoesn't have any expert working for him. He will pay far more than his \nlarge competitor will for the carriage of his goods. Or, of course, he \ncould still go to the intermediary, but the intermediary can't get as \ngood a deal for him as the large shipper can get.\n  You listened to the unanimous consent that preceded this debate, Mr. \nPresident, and you may have questioned the end of it. The end of it \nstates that if I win, the ball game is over. If my amendment is \nadopted, most of the members of the party that claims to be for the \nlittle guy will kill the bill, and they will kill it because the little \nguy gets equal advantages with the big guy. That is what the unanimous \nconsent is all about.\n  Mr. President, it is no more complicated and no less complicated than \njust that. If we are willing to put our votes where our mouths are when \nwe go home and talk about the virtues of small businesses, if we are \nwilling to carry out the kind of pledges we make in our election \ncampaigns and treat people equally, if we are willing to say that if a \ncompetitive market is good for the large, it is good for the small, we \nwill vote for the Gorton amendment and see whether or not the people on \nthe other side dare kill a procompetitive bill just because it doesn't \nadd to the monopoly of two unions at the expense of small businesses \nall across the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and other Members of this body consider \nthis matter in the 2\\1/2\\ weeks we are going to be away, and see \nwhether or not we don't want to treat people fairly and not ratify an \nagreement that was made behind closed doors, with the ocean carriers \npresent and the big shippers present and the unions present, but the \nsmall business people told: Get lost; we are not going to listen to you \nwhile we make this deal.\n  That is the wrong way to reach an agreement, and it is the wrong way \nto pass legislation. We can correct it by passing this amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Gorton \namendment, which would give non-vessel-operating common carriers, or \nNVOs, the right to offer service contracts to shippers--that is, the \nimporters and exporters--just as do vessel-operating ocean common \ncarriers. NVOs do not own or operate vessels. They are middlemen, who \nact as carriers in relation to their shipper customers, and who then \nact as shippers when they offer those cargoes to vessel-operating \ncarriers for transport. NVOs were first legislatively recognized as a \nlegal entity in the 1984 Shipping Act, in recognition that NVOs can \nprovide specialized attention and service to small shippers whose \nminimal cargo volumes are not always worth the time and attention of \nlarge vessel-operating carriers. No other nation has legally recognized \nthe concept of non-vessel-owner-common carriers.\n  Originally, NVOs consolidated the cargoes of several shippers into a \ncontainer and then took advantage of the full container rates offered \nby ocean carriers. There are thousands of NVOs doing business in the \nUnited States, all of whom are required to file their rates, to adhere \nto their rates, and to be bonded to establish their financial \nresponsibility to their customers. It should be noted that S. 414 will \nreduce the cost of tariff filing by eliminating the requirement that \nthe federal government collect and disseminate tariff information, and \nwould replace this system with a requirement that tariff information be \npublicly available through a private sector resource, such as the \ninternet or other private sector information system provider.\n  This system has been working well for 14 years. There is no reason to \nchange it. Small shippers--with only the occasional box or two of cargo \nto be transported--have come to depend on NVOs for the care and \npersonal attention that a larger carrier cannot offer. But some NVOs \nhave grown immeasurably in size, primarily those that are based in \nEurope, and are now competing directly for cargo with the major U.S. \nand foreign shipping lines. It is precisely these NVOs who are not \nsatisfied with their current status, and insist that despite the fact \nthat they have none of the expenses attendant to actually operating \nvessels, want to be treated like a vessel-operating common carrier in \nevery respect. They want to offer service contracts to shippers and \ngroups of shippers who can afford to promise large volumes of cargo in \nreturn for more favorable rates.\n  It is not fair to the vessel-operating common carriers serving our \ntrades, with their huge capital investments, that they be put on par \nwith entities taking advantage of the fiction of current law calling \nthem carriers. And it is especially not fair that the small ``mom and \npop'' NVOs, who are not in a position to compete with some of the NVO \ngiants that have emerged, may be swallowed up by them if the larger \nones are allowed to offer service contracts. Small NVOs, by virtue of \nthe modest cargoes they handle, will not be able to take advantage of \nthe Gorton amendment; only the mega-companies will. America's small \nbusinesses do not deserve this treatment. This amendment is not about \nprotecting the interests of small business, it is actually about \ntreating large multinational forwarding companies the same way that we \nwould ocean carriers. The end result would be to provide a disincentive \nto actually own and operate ships. Why actually own and operate ships \nif you could function in the same fashion as an ocean carrier without \nactually having to own or control any of the transportion functions or \nliabilities.\n  Moreover, S. 414, as revised by the Hutchison, Lott, Breaux \namendment, represents a delicately crafted compromise reflecting the \ninterests of all sectors of the shipping industry, including vessel- \nand non-vessel-operating common carriers, as well as shipper, \nforwarder, port and labor interests. The resulting documents cannot\n\n[[Page S3201]]\n\nbe altered in a piecemeal fashion without upsetting that balance. No \none in this compromise got exactly and completely what was wanted; \neveryone won a little and lost a little. That's what a compromise is.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against destroying several years of hard \nwork to come up with a fair and viable revision of our shipping laws. I \nwould like to thank my colleagues, Senators Hutchison, Lott and Gorton \nfor all of the work that they have put into this measure, and I urge \nyou to vote against the Gorton amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Washington \nhas made a very eloquent statement, and I am very glad that we agree on \n99 percent of this bill and that we agree that this is a very important \nimprovement for the whole shipping and carrier industry which will \npromote more business for U.S. ports.\n  I do not take issue with anything Senator Gorton has said, except to \nsay that in the balancing of competing interests, it is very difficult \nto have acceptance by all. And I can truthfully say that no one who is \naffected in this shipping industry is completely happy with this bill--\nno one--not the unions, not the shippers, not the carriers, and not the \nnon-vessel-operating common carriers of which Senator Gorton spoke. But \nin the main, the balance is better for all of these than in the present \nlaw.\n  This bill has some advantages above current law for these non-vessel-\noperating common carriers. They can take advantage of the tariff \nreforms. They will be able to privately publish tariffs, and they don't \nneed to file them with the Federal Maritime Commission. These NVOs, as \nshippers, can have confidential contracts with carriers, helping them \ncompete against each other. They will be able to benefit, of course, \nfrom the more competitive atmosphere among carriers when purchasing \nspace, and they have the current protections against discrimination \nagainst them by cartels maintained in this bill.\n  So while they are not completely happy with this bill--and I \ncertainly understand their concerns--there are important pro-\ncompetitive reforms they will benefit from.\n  I would point out that the other entities affected by this bill are \nalso not completely happy with it. But they too, recognize it as a \ncompromise that contains positive reforms. I think all would say that \nhaving this legislation does open competition, it does bring business \nto U.S. carriers, the competition will bring lower prices to shippers, \nand our ports will get the business.\n  That is good for everyone above and beyond the law as it stands \ntoday.\n  I hope, when we vote on Senator Gorton's amendment, people will \nunderstand this balancing, that they will opt in favor of the Hutchison \namendment to S. 414 unamended by the Gorton amendment and then let us \nkeep working on this issue, which I think certainly the non-vessel-\noperating common carriers are entitled to and which I pledge I will do \nand try to get a bill that is a balance, that creates more jobs and \nmore business for America. That should be our goal, and I believe it \nis. Let us just get there.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Now, according to the unanimous consent agreement, I will yield back \nthe time from the majority side. The minority side has agreed to also \nyield back time. If Senator Gorton does not wish to have further \ndebate, then I will yield the floor and the unanimous consent agreement \nis in effect.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Texas. We are about finished \nwith debate on this amendment, and it is the appropriate course of \naction for both of us to yield back our time. I will maybe take 2 \nminutes on it and then relieve the Chair for my assignment there, and \nwe can go on to something else.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courteous response of the Senator \nfrom Texas to my remarks. Again I have to say that she and I agree \nprofoundly on the goals of this legislation. I am proud that she has \nbeen able to build on what I started a decade and a half ago. She has \nworked as hard and almost as long on this bill as I did on the 1984 act \nitself. It certainly can be said they go in precisely the same \ndirection--more competition, better service, and a higher degree of \ncompetitiveness on the part of American business in that portion of the \nworld's merchant marine, including the U.S. flag merchant marine that \noperates out of the United States. She is certainly right when she says \nmany of the current rules disadvantage American businesses and cause \nsome shipments to go to Canada or Mexico that might otherwise come \ndirectly here.\n  The amendment that I have proposed, of course, moves another major \nstep in that direction. It is, as I emphasized, exactly what the \nSenator from Texas wanted when she wrote the bill in the committee and \nwas forced to retreat from by these large interests, particularly the \nmaritime unions. But it does disadvantage one group. If you have a \nsemicompetitive system and all American businesses, large and small, \noperate under the same rules, that is one thing. If you have a system \nthat says the big boys get to operate under much less restrictive \nrules, do not have to publish their fares and their tariffs, can enter \ninto any kind of agreements they want, but the little guys cannot, they \nare still subject to those old rules, you have created a fundamentally \nunfair situation. When that unfairness is directed at small shippers \nand small freight consolidaters, the difference, the discrimination, is \nparticularly egregious.\n  I agree with the Senator from Texas. However it ends up, this is not \nthe final form of the bill; it has not passed the House of \nRepresentatives yet. But, Mr. President, you and my colleagues should \nnot fool yourselves to think if we do not adopt this fairness \namendment, this small business amendment now, it is somehow going to \ncome back in later. I think if we do adopt it now, we have a far \ngreater opportunity to see to it that this bill is not only \nprocompetition and deregulatory but fair; that all the people, all the \ngroups in America who deserve that fairness, the small businesses, \nabout whom we talk so much on every one of our trips home, do deserve \nan equal opportunity to compete.\n  That is all this amendment is about. It allows the little guys to \ncontract the way the big guys contract. Often we will make a policy \nthat says the little people will have an advantage over the big ones \nbecause the big ones have the advantage of their bigness. Rarely do we \nsay, as we are asked to here, that we will give the big guys an \nadvantage and deprive their small competitors of that advantage. Equal \nthe playing field. If competition is good for the large shippers, it is \ngood for the small shippers. If it is good for the large carriers, it \nis good for the small carriers. That is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n\n  With that, I will yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think Senator Gorton has made a very \ngood statement. I think we will be able to work together for our common \ngoal.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that this vote \nwill not take place before April 21.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, under the \nprevious order, S. 414 will be laid aside until Tuesday, April 21, to \nbe considered at a time to be determined by the majority leader.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Ohio is recognized to \nspeak for up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to \nextend that to 75 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3202]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3192-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3202-S3209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues up to \ndate on the situation in Haiti. Two weeks ago, I traveled once again to \nthis troubled country. While I knew little about Haiti before becoming \na Senator, this was my fifth trip to Haiti in the last 3 years. So I \nhave had the opportunity to see what changes have taken place and the \ngeneral direction of events.\n  Later today, the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, will visit \nHaiti. She will find when she arrives a troubled country, but a country \nin which the United States does have a major national interest.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by pointing out that wile Haiti is not of \nstrategic importance to the United States, what happens there does have \na impact on our country and on our citizens.\n  Haiti's current political system is not stable. It is a struggling \ndemocracy in its infancy. If this unstable democracy descends into \noutright chaos, the result could be an exodus of boat people coming to \nour shores.\n  It has, of course, Mr. President, happened before. Remember, Haiti is \njust 700 miles from Florida. During the early 1990s, after President \nJean Bertrand Aristide was ousted from power, tens of thousands of \nHaitians risked their lives by boarding small boats, even rafts, hoping \nto reach the United States or other countries. Between 1991 and 1994, \n67,000 Haitians were interdicted at sea--67,000. Our Government was \nforced to house more than 25,000 Haitians in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, at \na cost of more than $400 million.\n  Historically, our countries have important ties. Haiti is the second \noldest republic in the hemisphere. Their defeat of Napoleon's army in \n1804 led the French to sell us the Louisiana Territory. In 1915, the \nUnited States intervened militarily to restore order to Haiti, and we \nremained there until a new government was installed in 1934. So our \ninterest in Haiti is not new--it is rooted in our history.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Haitians live in the United States. In fact, \nthere are more Haitians in the United States than any other country \noutside of Haiti, and thousands of U.S. citizens live in Haiti, either \npermanently or temporarily, for humanitarian purposes. I am amazed, as \nI travel throughout Haiti, at the number of Americans I meet. They can \nbe found all over that small country.\n  Haiti's troubles have a direct effect on the United States, and \nimpact. Haiti's current political power vacuum already is being filled \nby dangerous drug lords. Today, 8 percent of the drugs on our Nation's \nstreets come from Haiti or through Haiti. This is a clear example of \nhow the current crisis in Haiti has a clear and direct impact on the \npeople of my home State of Ohio, your home State of Washington, and the \nrest of this country.\n  Geographic proximity has dictated U.S. interest in Haiti over the \ncourse of this century. It will continue to do so. In September 1994, \nthe United States--in conjunction with the international community--\nsent over 20,000 troops, at a cost of over $1 billion, to restore \nPresident Aristide to power. This figure does not include the \nadditional $120 million the United States provided the United Nations \nfor peacekeeping operations. In addition, since then, the United States \nhas invested well over $2 billion in nonmilitary assistance to \nestablish and help sustain democracy in Haiti.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to update my colleagues on where \nthings stand in Haiti with regard to a number of specific topics. Let \nme first start with American civilian police presence there.\n  One cause for optimism in Haiti is the American civilian police, who \nparticipate in the United Nations civilian police presence. Their \nmandate recently shifted from mentoring the cops on the streets, the \nHaitian police officers on the streets, to mentoring the mid-level \nmanagement of the Haitian National Police.\n  I had the distinct pleasure, when I was in Haiti several weeks ago, \nof accompanying American civilian policemen on duty in Cite Soleil--a \nslum in Port-au-Prince with probably the highest degree of violence in \nthis whole country. Surprisingly, several of these American cops told \nme they had no problem moving through Cite Soleil both during the day \nand at night. We have, today, 31 dedicated U.S. police officers, \nHaitian-born U.S. citizen veteran U.S. cops, who are down in Haiti on a \ncontract basis, mentoring the Haitian police. These 31 dedicated police \nofficers from New York, New Jersey, Florida, L.A.--they are all creole \nspeakers. This enables them to communicate well with the Haitian \npopulation. In fact, the majority of these 31 Americans were born or \nhave relatives in Haiti. These U.S. police officers told me they feel \ntheir work with the Haitian police is helping. It is beneficial. It is \nimportant. Mr. President, I commend them and I support the efforts of \nthese fine Americans.\n\n  Let me turn now to the Haitian police. One of the main missions of \nthe United States after President Aristide was restored to power was to \nhelp train a brand new Haitian police force. This was a daunting, and \nremains a daunting, task. I don't know that it has ever been undertaken \nin the world at such a magnitude as we tried and have been doing in \nHaiti. We have trained over 5,000 new Haitian police recruits. Our men \nand women who travel to Haiti to do this did, and continue to do, an \nexcellent job.\n  The Haitian National Police, or HNP, are doing fairly well and have \ntaken strides to professionalize the institution. Continued concerns of \nsome human rights violations are being addressed in the newly formed \ninspector general's office. The United States has spent considerable \nmoney and effort in training the police force. In conjunction with \nother interested international donors, this training must continue. \nFurthermore, efforts should be made to address the lack of resources \nneeded by this police force.\n  When the international community restored Aristide to power in 1994, \nthe Haitian military and police were then totally dismantled. A new \npolice force was formed from scratch. Although a very young force, the \nHaitian National Police has been described as the only functioning \ninstitution in Haiti.\n  When the U.S. Government decided to train the new Haitian police \nthrough the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance \nProgram--this is our U.S. Government program known as ``ICITAP''--we \nlaid down three conditions: No. 1, that the old armed forces must be \nand were disbanded; No. 2, that the new police force must be civilian; \nand, No. 3, that the police must have reasonable means to overcome \ntheir historic corruption.\n  While the Haitian police are generally doing a good job, some \nHaitians continue to fear HNP, the Haitian National Police. These \nHaitians particularly fear the crowd control/riot squad unit. This \nunit, which dresses in all black uniforms, including reflective \nsunglasses, is extremely intimidating and reminiscent of the previous \nmilitary regime. Further, serious human rights abuses by the HNP \nofficials continue, tragically, to occur.\n  There is really only one solution, and that is to continue to work to \nhelp professionalize the police. That is what we are doing. A newly \ninstalled inspector general's office within the HNP is looking at these \nhuman rights violation cases. We will not see real progress in this \narea until and unless the IG moves these cases forward--and until and \nunless the judicial system successfully prosecutes policemen involved \nin these crimes.\n  Efforts are being made to start integrating the Haitian police into \nthe Haitian society. The concept of community policing is a concept \nthat our men and women are taking to Haiti. Haitian President Preval \nhas requested the HNP to engage in this community policing. American \ncivilian police personnel are mentoring their HNP counterparts in this \neffort. Though this effort is only in its initial stages, it is a \nchange in the right direction. The police are also attempting to change \nfrom a reactive force to become a more typically American proactive \nforce.\n  Our continued commitment to the professionalization of the Haitian \npolice is essential. As all Americans know, a strong and effective \npolice force is essential to any civil, democratic society. We must \ncontinue the ICITAP program, and urge the Haitian\n\n[[Page S3203]]\n\nGovernment to continue its own efforts to professionalize the police, \nfrom the officer on the street to the midlevel management at \nheadquarters.\n  To succeed, a quality police force needs quality resources. The fact \nis resources are, of course, lacking in Haiti. For example, in Cap \nHaitien, the second largest city in Haiti that we visited with over \n300,000 residents, 130 policemen have access to only six vehicles. This \nforce also lacks simple phones and two-way radios.\n  But perhaps most important is not the lack of physical resources, but \nthe lack of human resources.\n  The current police force--slightly over 6,000 for the whole country--\nis of course, too small. The Dominican Republic--Haiti's neighboring \ncountry--has roughly the same population and a national police force of \n29,000. I urge the administration to consult with the international \ndonor community--and together with the Haitian Government--discuss ways \nto (1) continue training; (2) continue mentoring this police force; (3) \nprovide necessary and better equipment; and (4) slowly but steadily \nincrease the size of the Haitian national police.\n  Let me turn now to the issue of judicial reform.\n  Mr. President, the police in Haiti is only one element of the \njudicial system. While we have made progress in police reform, there is \nnot now a functioning judicial system in Haiti. Reforming the entire \njudicial system--the courts, prosecutors and defense attorneys--should \nbe a priority for the Haitian Government. If any progress--economic or \npolitical--is going to happen, Haiti needs a working judicial system. \nTo get there, the Haitian Government needs to demonstrate a real \ncommitment--real political will--to make judicial reform a priority. We \nshould make clear that our Government is willing to make a commitment--\nan investment--to create an effective judicial system, but only--only--\nif it is clear that the Haitian Government itself is willing to lead \nthat effort.\n  Although the 1987 Haitian Constitution requires a separation of \npowers between the judicial and executive branches, the Minister of \nJustice--an executive branch official--currently has control over the \nentire law enforcement system: the police, prosecutors, defense \nattorneys and the courts! Not only are the courts not independent, to \nmake matters worse, I was informed by both U.S. and Haitian officials \nthat the current Minister of Justice in Haiti is not committed to any \nreal reform measures. The seriousness of this problem cannot be \noverstated.\n  The credibility of the Haitian legal system is undermined by the \nperception that it is awash in corruption--and that justice is for \nsale. Until the Haitian Government demonstrates the political will to \nbring murderers to justice, for instance, the Haitian people will lack \nconfidence in their own legal system, and vigilante-style justice will \ntragically continue.\n  True judicial reform cannot take place unless and until Haiti \npolitical leaders exercise the political will to solve the high profile \npolitical murders. There have been dozens of political murders in Haiti \nover the past several years. Unfortunately, to date, not a single one \nhas been solved. Despite the efforts of the Special Investigative Unit \ninside the Haitian national police, which has the specific mandate to \ninvestigate these high-profile murder cases, the Haitian Government has \ndone nothing to help resolve these cases. Some argue that one of the \nreasons behind this fact is that some senior Haitian Government \nofficials may be implicated in the crimes.\n  Having said that, I still believe we must continue to fund the \nSpecial Investigations Unit, because, as one high ranking U.S. official \ntold me when we were in Haiti: ``It keeps pressure on the Haitian \nGovernment and keeps them halfway honest.''\n  Mr. President, successfully solving and prosecuting even one of these \npolitical cases could serve as a turning point for reform of the \njudicial system. It could send the right signal. We need to do all we \ncan to put pressure on the Haitian Government to make this a top \npriority. For example, last year, Congress enacted legislation I \nproposed which denies visas to Haitians involved in extrajudicial and \npolitical killings. The identity of many of these people who committed \natrocities is well known. We should keep this law that we passed last \nyear in place as a way of pressuring the Haitian Government--and \nsending a signal to the Haitian population that the U.S. cares about \njustice, and that they themselves should demand it.\n  Any expressed commitment by the Haitian Government to judicial reform \ncannot be taken seriously without its cooperation in the \nidentification, capture and prosecution of political murderers. That \nkind of commitment will give the judicial system the credibility it \nneeds to be seen as a viable law enforcement agency for all Haitians.\n\n  Furthermore, currently the Haitian judicial system is a system in \nname only. Although the number of arrests has increased, those arrested \nare not being prosecuted. At this time, justice begins and ends with \nthe police. If this does not change, we can only imagine the negative \nimpact this will have on police morale. All our efforts to reform the \npolice could end up, in the long run, being in vain. Mr. President, \nwithout judicial reform, we cannot expect Haitian society--its \ngovernment, its economy--to move forward. On the contrary, it will move \nbackward.\n  Since the Minister of Justice currently is not committed to reform, \nthe U.S. Government has found ways to work around the Ministry by \nmentoring judges, for example. I was extremely impressed by our \nDepartment of Justice representative in Haiti who is helping train \njudges and prosecutors. He has found ways to work around the Ministry \nto start instituting positive change in that system.\n  But we cannot make serious long-term progress until the Haitian \nGovernment--starting with the Minister of Justice--agrees to reform. \nWorking around the Minister of Justice can only go so far. Serious \njudicial reform in Haiti begins with a commitment from the government's \nleaders. Therefore, I recommend the following:\n  First, the United States, along with the international donors, must \nurge President Preval to appoint a new Minister of Justice who will \ndemonstrate a commitment to work with the international donor community \nto together help create meaningful reforms in the judiciary.\n  Second, the United States and the other international donors must get \nfrom the Haitian Government a serious commitment to reform the entire \njudicial system. Amazingly, the list of official priorities the Haitian \nGovernment has presented to the U.S. Government does not include \njudicial reform! Unless that changes, I suggest we reconsider any \ncontinued U.S. assistance for judicial reform. Without such a \ncommitment, I am concerned that any money we send will simply be \nwasted.\n  A true commitment by the Haitian Government to reform the entire \njudiciary system must include action on the following basic elements:\n  An independent judiciary;\n  New legislative laws regarding the judiciary, including a judicial \ncareer system, and reform of the penal codes;\n  Increased budget for the national and local judiciary system; and\n  Establishment of an appropriate career and salary structure for the \njudiciary system, including salary increases for committed prosecutors \nand judges; and creation of a functioning disciplinary body to oversee \nthe entire judiciary, such as an inspector general's office within the \nMinistry of Justice.\n  We must make clear that we stand ready to assist the Haitian \nGovernment if they are serious about taking the actions I have just \ndescribed. We must make clear what that assistance would amount to. \nThis year, we provided $11 million for judicial reform. In next year's \nbudget request, the Clinton administration has proposed to reduce the \njudicial reform program from $11 million to $7 million and grant an \nadditional $4 million (which together would equal $11 million) for \nhuman rights initiatives. Now, there are some who will argue that human \nrights is part of a judicial reform. While providing assistance to \nthose who have suffered human rights abuses is a commendable effort, it \nshould not and cannot replace an effort to reform the system that \nencourages these abuses.\n  If the Haitian Government agrees to invest in judicial reform, we \nshould at least maintain our current annual investment in judicial \nreform--the $11 million figure--and we should increase it if possible. \nAfter all, the level of our investment should reflect the degree of\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nimportance we place on this kind of reform.\n  However, if the Haitian Government does not express and demonstrate a \ntrue political will to do these basic reforms, then the United States \nmust reconsider its assistance in this area.\n  Thus, Mr. President, we should set aside the same level of funding \nfor judicial reform in this year's budget. But we must make it clear \nthis money will not be spent, cannot be spent, until we have a \ncommitment, a demonstrated commitment in action, from the Haitian \nGovernment to achieve these important benchmarks.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude this section, let me tell my \ncolleagues a quick story about the benefits of judicial reform in \nanother country. During our recent visit to Haiti, we also visited the \nDominican Republic where we focused on their efforts to reform the \njudicial system. Speaking with the President of the Dominican Republic, \nI got a sense of the Government's true commitment to the judicial \nreform process. When I asked the President what finally got the process \nunderway, he said that first there had to be political will. Aside from \nthat, the people must also want, if not demand, it.\n  A well-known writer, Orlando Martinez, was murdered several years ago \nin the Dominican Republic. At the time, no one attempted to take on the \ncase. No one would. The reason was that no one had trust or faith in \nthe judicial system. Well, one courageous judge in early 1996 decided \nto take on that case. He made the case a priority and through the \nprocess did something unprecedented. He had a number of military \nofficials arrested and successfully prosecuted and sentenced.\n  Mr. President, to make a long story short, the prosecution of the \nindividuals involved in this murder was a turning point in moving \nforward with judicial reform in that country.\n  The case got tremendous media coverage, and the society was never the \nsame--the Dominican Republic was not the same. Soon after the civil \nsociety started demanding important judicial reforms, the business \ncommunity started demanding important judicial reforms. They felt \ninvigorated by the prosecution of this one, but highly important, case. \nIt gave them faith in the system.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, there have been a number of \nunsolved political murder cases in Haiti. The murder case in the \nDominican Republic serves as an important example of an important \ntransformation that took place in that society. We saw a similar \nscenario in El Salvador in the 1980s when high-profile murders were \ninvestigated and those responsible were successfully prosecuted and \nsentenced. That was something new in El Salvador and had an \nunbelievable effect on the society. Specifically, in El Salvador, high-\nranking military officers were sentenced for the killing of Jesuit \npriests. The solving of even one political murder--the solving of even \none political murder--in Haiti would do wonders to send a powerful \nsignal about justice and the rule of law in that troubled country.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to another topic in regard to Haiti \nthat is extremely troubling, and that is the drug situation.\n  The need for a stronger judiciary, Mr. President, and a professional \npolice force becomes readily apparent if you examine Haiti's situation \nwith regard to drugs. When it comes to the matter of illegal narcotics, \nI must report to the Senate that the situation in Haiti is grave and \neven approaching a crisis. Because of Haiti's weak political and \neconomic condition, this country is becoming increasingly attractive to \ninternational drug traffickers. The United States must pay close \nattention to this growing concern, for there is a threat that Haiti \ncould turn into a full-fledged narcostate. That means, and would mean, \nmore and more illegal drugs coming through Haiti into our country.\n\n  For that reason, the Clinton administration must direct more Drug \nEnforcement Administration and Coast Guard personnel to Haiti to better \ncombat the drug problem within the country and better control the drug \ntrafficking in international waters surrounding Haiti. We should also \nincrementally increase our counter-narcotics assistance to Haitian \nGovernment agencies responsible for counternarcotics in terms of \ntraining, as they become more efficient and professional.\n  According to a U.S. Government interagency assessment on cocaine \nmovement, in 1996, between 5 and 8 percent of the cocaine coming into \nthe United States passed through the country of Haiti. By the third \nquarter of 1997, the percentage jumped to 12 percent and increased to \n19 percent by the end of that year. One of the reasons cited for the \nincrease is the enhanced law enforcement effort that is being made in \nPuerto Rico, which has caused traffickers to move operations from there \nto Haiti.\n  Responding to this trend, the Clinton administration added Haiti to \nthe list of countries requiring annual certification in 1995, and \nthough it has been certified as cooperative in the war on drugs each \nyear since, the problem appears to be getting worse.\n  Mr. President, most people are aware that most of the cocaine coming \ninto our country is grown and processed in Colombia, but the transit \nroutes are always changing. The drug traffickers continue to move them. \nAs indicated on this map, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto \nRico are all located approximately halfway between Colombia and the \nUnited States.\n  Drug interdiction efforts have increased to combat direct shipment of \ndrugs from Colombia to Puerto Rico, forcing opportunistic drug lords to \nseek alternative routes. Thus Haiti, a mere 15 hours from Colombia by \nspeedboat, seems a perfect candidate, a mere overnight passage in a \nboat. Because commercial shipments from Haiti to the United States are \nscarce, illegal drugs are transported from Colombia into Haiti and \nacross Haiti into the Dominican Republic and then the short distance to \nPuerto Rico. Puerto Rico is only about 75 miles away at its closest \npoint to the Dominican Republic. These drugs go into Puerto Rico \ndisguised as legitimate commercial shipments. Once they are in Puerto \nRico, they are virtually home free into the United States.\n  Drug traffickers realize that once the drugs land in Puerto Rico, \nthey are virtually home free because of the special status of Puerto \nRico as a U.S. Commonwealth. That is the route. And it is increasing \nevery single day, the transshipment through Haiti.\n  Apart from the strategic location, Haiti has become increasingly \nattractive to international traffickers because drug interdiction \nefforts are minimal in that country. Haitian law enforcement \nauthorities present no threat to the drug traffickers. The Haitian \nCoast Guard consists of only a few boats, and it is simply outnumbered \nand outgunned by the Colombian professional drug lords.\n  The Haitian Coast Guard has had, with our help, a few successes. With \nthe assistance of the United States, in 1998 Haitian authorities have \nseized 1,000 pounds of cocaine, 500 pounds of marijuana, and 25 pounds \nof hashish oil. But serious problems remain that when Haitian law \nenforcement succeeds and actually makes a seizure, Haiti's slow and \nineffective criminal justice system does not act as a serious \ndeterrent.\n\n  In addition, the fledgling Haitian National Police has only 24 agents \ndevoted to the drug problem--24. Granted, this counternarcotics unit \nwas just established last year. I am told there are plans to slowly \nincrease the number of personnel. There is apparently a leadership \nproblem within the unit. Hence, more training is absolutely essential.\n  Sadly, some evidence also exists that those responsible for upholding \nthe law in Haiti are themselves part of the problem. Last year, the \nHaitian Government arrested 21 of its own policemen on narcocorruption \ncharges.\n  Money laundering appears to be on the rise as well. Until several \nyears ago, only a handful of banks existed in Haiti at all. That number \nis said to have more than doubled, or even tripled, in the last few \nyears.\n  The transit of drugs in Haiti represents a serious threat to an \nalready fragile democracy. The United States should pay close attention \nto this growing concern--for there is a threat that Haiti could turn \ninto a full-fledged narcostate, completely controlled by the drug lords \nwith institutionalized power. If Haiti's current political vacuum is \nfilled by these drug cartels, it will then be too late. We simply must \nnot allow that to happen.\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n  The Clinton administration's budget for next year in regard to drugs \ncalls for $166 million for international narcotics and law enforcement \naffairs for all of Latin America and the Caribbean. Of that $166 \nmillion, no assistance is earmarked specifically for Haiti. Rather, any \nassistance for Haiti comes from a general fund. Through this general \nfund, Mr. President, Haiti is expected to get a meager $400,000, up \nfrom an estimated $300,000 in 1998--this despite the fact that a \ncountry like Jamaica has a requested earmark at $800,000 and the \nBahamas have an earmark of $1 million.\n  I believe the President's proposed budget would not do very much to \nstem the tide of drugs flowing through Haiti. A better effort to seize \nthese shipments simply must be made. That means, of course, more \ninvestment in training the Haitian Coast Guard. We are doing some of \nthat, Mr. President. It means, further, the Haitian police \ncounternarcotics units must be professionalized.\n  It also means a U.S. law enforcement presence in Haiti and the \nDominican Republic. When I visited Haiti 2 weeks ago, there was one DEA \nagent in all of Haiti--one. I was told at the time that two more were \non the way. Next door, in the Dominican Republic, when I visited the \nDominican Republic, I found they have one permanent and one temporary \nDEA agent. That is three for the entire island. This is a very small \npresence considering the fact that Congress has authorized over 100 DEA \nagents for the Caribbean alone. I was disappointed to find the lack of \nserious counternarcotics plans for both of these countries. We do not \nhave a plan. I recommended that we do more.\n  I must say that I had the opportunity late yesterday afternoon to \ntalk on the phone to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about this \nissue. She informed me and assured me yesterday when I talked about \nthis that shortly the United States will be beefing up its DEA \npresence, the number of DEA agents in both Haiti and in the Dominican \nRepublic. I applaud that. We need to do it, and we need to do it \nimmediately.\n  Let me make today my specific recommendations in regard to this area. \nOne, we have to increase our DEA presence in Haiti. One is not enough. \nTwo, we must increase Coast Guard personnel and boats in international \nwaters around Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Three, we must slowly \nincrease our counternarcotics assistance resources for Haiti. The \nClinton administration's proposed fiscal year 1999 budget would provide \nforeign aid to Haiti in a total aggregate of over $182 million. That is \nthe proposal. Yet the proposed budget by the Clinton administration \nonly provides $400,000 in counternarcotics assistance. Clearly, we have \nto do more.\n  When we consider the top priorities in U.S. policy toward Haiti, \ncounternarcotics matters should be clearly at or near the top of the \nlist. Having said that, it is important to note that just giving more \nmoney to the weak and inefficient Haiti National Police \ncounternarcotics unit and to the Haitian Coast Guard won't solve the \nproblem. It won't solve the problem, because these institutions are \nweak, and because they are weak, we first need to focus on training. As \nthese institutions slowly become more professional and efficient, we \nmust incrementally, then, increase our counternarcotics assistance to \nthem.\n  Let me turn now to probably the most serious problem that Haiti \nfaces. That is the political impasse which has plagued this country for \n10 months. The political impasse means there is virtually no Government \nin existence. A political impasse stops any kind of progress that this \ncountry might see. When we look at the challenges I have already \ndescribed in regard to Haiti, challenges of social stability, law \nenforcement, and drug trafficking, all of these are symptomatic of a \nlarger problem. The larger problem is the political paralysis that \nexists within the Haitian Government itself.\n\n  Since the Prime Minister resigned from office last June, there has \nnot been a functioning Government. Charges of election fraud in the \nApril 1997 election still remain unresolved, halting any real \ndemocratic and economic progress. In conjunction with the international \ncommunity, the United States must pressure the Haitian Government to, \none, resolve the current crisis; and, two, allow for greater \ninternational administration and monitoring of the upcoming elections.\n  Mr. President, almost 10 months ago, then Prime Minister of Haiti, \nPrime Minister Rosny Smarth, stepped down from his position due to his \nfrustration with the Government's inability to resolve an electoral \ndispute and implement his economic modernization plan. Since then, a \nPrime Minister has not been confirmed by the Parliament. The Prime \nMinister is designed and designated as the Chief Executive of the \nGovernment. He appoints the Cabinet and basically runs the Government. \nWithout a Prime Minister, the country simply cannot function.\n  The current political impasse stems from pervasive fraud and improper \nvote tabulation in the April 6, 1997, elections. Not only have the \nopposition of the parties demanded that the April 1997 elections be \nannulled, the international community, including the United Nations, \nhas deemed the elections--which produced only a meager 5 percent turn \nout--fraudulent. The political parties, led by OPL, insist they will \nnot move forward on a Prime Minister candidate until the issues \nsurrounding the 1997 April elections are finally resolved.\n  This paralysis in Government is being felt everywhere. Economic \nreform efforts have stalled, the legislature has not passed a budget, \nit has not enacted structural reforms needed to free up over $100 \nmillion in foreign assistance, nor has it approved loans for millions \nof technical assistance.\n  The lack of a Government has halted the process of privatization and \nmade it difficult to implement civil downsizing. Finally, it has \ndiscouraged potential investors who could play a key role in economic \ndevelopment and in improving Haiti's image. Regardless of the countless \nvisits to Haiti in the last year alone by very senior U.S. Government \nadministration officials, up to and including Secretary Albright's \nvisit this weekend, there has not been a real movement toward a \nsolution to this crisis.\n  One thing that is clear to me after my recent visit is that the \nUnited States cannot do for Haiti what it will not do for itself. The \nHaitians first have to realize the need to solve their political \ncrisis. They have not yet hit rock bottom, and maybe that is what it \nwill take to create the political will to move forward. Unfortunately, \nI do not yet see the requisite political will and determination in \nHaiti.\n  What complicates matters even more is that there are upcoming \nnational and municipal elections slated for November of 1998 in Haiti. \nHundreds of seats are up, including the entire lower Chamber, up to \ntwo-thirds of the Senate, and all municipal seats. The problem is, \nthere hasn't been a resolution to the irregularities surrounding the \nprevious election, and as the clock continues to tick, we are getting \ncloser and closer to even more elections, including the Presidential \nelection scheduled for the year 2000.\n\n  During my visit, the Haitian political parties made very clear the \nimportance of this November's election. So far, however, the \ninternational community has not developed a united or current strategy \nfor this crucial election. I recommended that the administration--our \nadministration--work with the international community to take the \nfollowing measures:\n  One, we must pressure the Haitian Government to allow the \ninternational community to take a lead role in the upcoming election; \ntwo, we must insist on the establishment of a credible, nonpartisan, \ncompetent electoral commission to oversee that crucial election; three, \nwe must insist there be a fair, equitable, and transparent resolution \nto the numerous controversies resulting from the 1997 electoral fraud; \nfour, we must urge the Haitian Government to reform the electoral and \npolitical party laws to level the playing field; five, we must insist \non attention to several important technical matters, such as the voter \nregistration list, voter cards, access to state media, and access to \nstate financial resources as stipulated in the Constitution and in the \nelectoral law; six, we must ensure that the police do not become \npoliticized, favoring certain factions or parties at the expense of \nothers; seven, we\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\nmust encourage a visit by a high-visibility delegation of notable world \nleaders to go to Haiti and observe the election. This kind of high \nvisibility would help force the Haitian Government to agree to fair and \ntransparent standards for the election. And, finally, we must provide \nfunding for the International Republican Institute and the National \nDemocratic Institute to continue their political-party-building \nprograms in Haiti.\n  If the current election impasse is broken, the IRI and NDI will need \nmoney to help support the crucial institutional election programs that \nmake for open, democratic elections. Unfortunately, several political \nparties made it clear to me during my visit that they viewed the U.S. \nGovernment as strictly aligned with the ruling party of Preval and \nAristide, that they are not getting the attention they deserve \nregarding a resolution to the current crisis. I strongly believe that \nif we are going to help establish a true democracy in Haiti, we need to \nstress the importance of political party pluralism in that country.\n\n  Mr. President, in light of these benchmarks, I strongly urge that no \nU.S. assistance should be used to underwrite the November elections \nuntil and unless a settlement of the impasse of the April 6, 1997, \nelections is reached--and until a fair and independent electoral \ncouncil is established in accordance with the Haitian Constitution.\n  Since 1995, Mr. President, the United States has provided almost $17 \nmillion for elections in Haiti. Strangely, of $182 million requested \nfor fiscal year 1999, the Clinton administration has only asked for \n$900,000 for these upcoming elections. My first reaction to this is \nthat this specific assistance request is simply not enough for this \nimportant election. But before we consider ways to sustain and \nconsolidate democracy in Haiti, by building infrastructures and \ninstitutions, it is essential to have the first true element of any \ndemocracy; that is, the ability to have free and fair elections. Our \nadministration should make the upcoming election a priority and work \nwith the international community to pressure the Haitian Government to \nhave a fair and transparent election.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, if the Haitian Government is not \nwilling to make the election a priority and agree to these simple and \nobvious benchmarks, then there is no use for the United States to \nadminister this kind of assistance for any future election. The money \nwould simply be wasted. We must have a commitment first. We need to \nknow the Haitian Government is serious before we agree to get involved \nin the election. Our administration should coordinate with other \ninternational donors to develop a common front based on agreement to \nthis basic principle.\n  Let me turn to Haiti's economy. Haiti is an impoverished country that \nsimply cannot afford further political shenanigans.\n  The Haitian economy has experienced dismal growth while experiencing \nsome growth in the underground market--primarily, contraband and drugs. \nPrivate investment is absolutely critical if Haiti is going to create \nnew jobs and put an end to the cycle of poverty. Several key things the \nUnited States should pursue include: 1, extending trade preferences to \nthe CBI beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Trade \nEnhancement Act; 2, we should urge the Haitian Government to begin \nimplementation of its long-delayed plan to reduce the civil service; 3, \nwe should urge the Haitian Government to move forward with \nprivatization efforts; 4, we should find ways to empower the chamber of \ncommerce communities in Haiti, particularly those interested in \neconomic development. We must empower these chamber communities; they \nhave a tremendous potential.\n  Mr. President, last year the Haitian economy experienced tepid growth \nof only 1.1 percent in the formal sector--down from 2.7 percent in \n1996. The informal, or nontaxed, sector experienced slightly higher \ngrowth of 2.2 percent. It is important to note here that this growth is \nlargely due to the tremendous amount of foreign assistance provided by \nthe international donor community. The reality of the Haitian economy \ntoday is that but for the donor contributions to the economy, the \neconomy would have negative growth during the last several years.\n\n  This slow growth is causing problems for the Government, through \nincreased tax revenues--and the failure to meet Haitians' expectation \nthat Haiti would begin a period of sustained economic growth and job \ncreation in a country with chronically high unemployment and \nunderemployment. While economic growth is slow or nonexistent, it is \nwell known in Haiti that the underground market--primarily contraband \nand drugs--is on the rise.\n  The Preval administration in Haiti is faced with a difficult fiscal \nsituation, compounded by the lack of a fiscal year 1998 budget, \nsuspension of international donor disbursement, and an inability to \nsignificantly cut spending.\n  The Government has trouble cutting spending because the bulk of \nGovernment funds go to pay the large civil service. Other factors \ninclude the Central Bank's financing of deficit spending, which has \nincreased significantly in the first quarter of this year, and that is \na very scary thought, Mr. President. Further, preliminary Government \nstatistics indicate that tax revenues have dropped during the first \nquarter of this fiscal year, largely because of a strike in the tax \noffice.\n  The Government of Haiti is moving to implement a cash management \nprogram that would limit spending to expenditures. But President Preval \nwill face difficulty putting such a program in place, never mind \nsustaining it, if Government workers press for wage hikes to keep up \nwith inflation. Inflation was roughly 17 percent last year. Price hikes \nfor basic foodstuffs will further impoverish more Haitians and could \nspark demonstrations against the Preval government in the coming \nmonths.\n  Now let me turn to the important issue of privatization.\n  Though at an extremely low pace, the Government of Haiti has \ncompleted the privatization of the country's flour mill, and the \nprivatization of the cement mill will be completed as soon as the new \nPrime Minister is approved by the Senate. Three other high-priority \nprivatization projects are said to be on track to begin the bidding \nprocess later this year--the airport, the seaport, and the telephone \ncompany.\n  Resources have been made available by the international community to \nensure that the bidding process is open and transparent and fair to \nprospective purchasers. During my recent visit, both U.S. and Haitian \nofficials acknowledged the difficulty that can be expected in \nprivatizing these three projects. The main reason that they will have \ndifficulty, of course, is that these state-owned enterprises, \nparticularly the seaport, are a source of revenue for the Government of \nHaiti. Furthermore, former Government cronies are allegedly involved in \nthe telephone company. The U.S. Government needs to continue pressuring \nthe Haitians to privatize these facilities.\n  But budget balancing and privatization are just the beginning. \nPrivate investment is absolutely crucial if Haiti is going to create \nnew jobs and end the cycle of poverty. To attract new investments, I \npropose the following specific steps:\n  One, the United States should extend trade preferences to the CBI \nbeneficiary nations under the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. \nThis would tell investors the United States is prepared to help Haiti \nand other island nations diversify their economies through special \ntariff breaks.\n  Two, the Clinton administration should develop a new loan guarantee \ninitiative for Haiti through the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation. These loan guarantees would help make small to medium-\nsized loans available, $10,000 to $100,000, to businesses that are \nprepared to move to Haiti and start new enterprises. Each job in the \nassembly sector supports at least another 7 to 10 Haitians and also \ncreates secondary spinoff jobs.\n  Three, we must urge the Haitian government to move forward with the \nprivatization of the remaining state owned enterprises;\n  Four, we must urge the Government of Haiti to begin immediate \nimplementation of its long-delayed plan to reduce the size of the \nHaitian civil service. The necessary Haitian laws have been passed to \nbegin this process. Unfortunately, however, the Civil Service\n\n[[Page S3207]]\n\nReform Act, which mandates the reduction in the civil service, has a \nsunset provision which expires this fall. The U.S. Government and the \ninternational community need to pressure the Haitian government to \nimplement this important law. Further, $20 million in international \nassistance is available to underwrite this program. Implementation of \nthis program would be a tangible signal to investors that the Haitian \nGovernment wants to work more efficiently.\n  Five, we must work with the FAA and Department of Transportation to \nimprove airport facilities and ensure that the airport meets all \ninternational safety standards. The airport is a vital access point for \ntourists and promotes the free flow of Haitians to and from the \ncountry. These Haitians help the economy with their remittances, and \nprovide a healthy dialogue with on-island Haitians about the benefits \nof democracy. The FAA has a number of current concerns about the \nairport, and is currently addressing them. We must ensure that the \nairport is operated efficiently and safely, because it is the principal \nentry and exit point for Haiti.\n  Sixth, work with the government to ensure the privatization of the \nsea port. Mr. President, the sea port is plagued with inefficiency and \ncorruption. It is certainly the most expensive port in this hemisphere \nto ship into or out of. The port must be privatized and modernized for \nbetter efficiently and productivity. I also recommend that the Clinton \nAdministration urge the Haitian government to privatize other ports in \nHaiti as well.\n  Seven, find ways to empower the Chamber of Commerce communities in \nHaiti, particularly in the secondary cities. The Chamber of Commerce in \nCap Haitien, for example, is energized--and is working with the local \nmayor and government to further develop the city. Mr. President, \ncompared to Port-au-Prince, Cap Haitien almost felt like a different \ncountry. It's the attitude that was different. For instance, the \nbusiness community is eagerly seeking foreign investors, and in fact \nhave already been able to secure some investment. Currently, there are \ntwo cruise lines which occasionally visit Cap Haitien. The Haitians on \nthe street welcomed us. I remember one elderly woman who came up to our \ndelegation and said: ``God bless you. I am so happy you are here. You \ngive us hope.'' They want tourists. They want people to come in. \nFindings ways to work with and encourage Haitians in areas such as Cap \nHaitien, where their willingness is more visible than in Port au \nPrince, is something we should pursue.\n\n\n                              agriculture\n\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to one particular economic sector that \nis especially crucial to Haiti's future, and that is agriculture.\n  Amazingly, tragically Haiti imports two thirds of its food. Every \nday, thousands of Haitians leave rural areas where they are unable to \nprovide for themselves and flood into the cities which are unable to \nsustain the population pressures. Right now, approximately 20 percent \nof Haiti's population lives in Port au Prince. The rest live in \nsecondary cities and the countryside. If this trend continues \nunchecked, Haiti will not be able to alleviate poverty and starvation. \nIn the long run, agricultural and rural development is critical to the \ngoal of Haiti providing jobs, income and food for its population.\n  Agriculture production is extremely low for many reasons.\n  Topsoil has eroded because most of the trees are harvested for \ncharcoal--the major source of Haitian fuel.\n  Technical skills are lacking--skills as basic as soil conservation \ntechniques, tree planting, and caring for animals.\n  Basic technology is lacking--including soil and water conservation \ntechniques, tree grafting for higher quality products, crop improvement \nand improving the genetic base of crops.\n  Rural infrastructure is deficient. Farmers do not have access to \ncapital or credit, and little access to seeds, saplings and \nfertilizers.\n\n  Delivery mechanisms, including market access and techniques are \ninadequate and need to be developed.\n  During my visit, I was encouraged by the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development's Productive Land Use System Program or PLUS \nProgram. To increase output, PLUS works directly with farmers to \nimprove techniques in the fields. These activities are undertaken in \ncollaboration with Haitian farmers. The program deals with the \nenvironmental problem through the farmers' own self-interest. This kind \nof assistance is what works best. This partnership has been a success \nfor local Haitian farmers and should be continued.\n  In addition, I believe Haiti's strategies for development should \nfocus on the preservation and reclamation of the natural resource base. \nLinking production and income generation with resource conservation and \nmanagement activities is being done by field teams that reach farmers \nthrough the grass roots. This is similar to our own very successful \ncooperative extension program in the U.S. We do it better than anybody \nelse. We are now trying to export it and are exporting it to Haiti. \nThis is a good example of something that should be expanded throughout \nHaiti.\n  To further develop the rural and agricultural sectors of Haiti, \nattention needs to be given to a decentralized development strategy. I \nbelieve that continued focus on nongovernmental organizations is \nappropriate. I believe that we should be promoting regional development \nand that associations linking private sector interests with local \ngovernment need to be established. One way to do this is to link our \nown successful foundations and institutions of higher education such as \nOhio State University together with local Haitian interested in \npursuing this goal.\n  The Haitian farmers I met understood that the sound environmental \npractices and productive agricultural and marketing techniques led to \nan improved standard of living. If we can help them expand these \ntechniques, they can make the staying in the rural areas more \nattractive and stem the current tide of urban migration.\n  AID has also been working to help establish marketing cooperatives. \nOne such cooperative is Servi Coop. which has allowed some Haitian \ncocoa farmers to have a new market for their goods. Historically, \nHaitian farm prices have been keep down because farmers have only had \none ultimate export source to sell their products to. This AID program \nis attempting to change that and to create competition. When they have \ncompetition, they bid up the price and Haitian farmers have already \nbegun to see in certain areas that type of improvement in their prices.\n\n\n                              U.S. troops\n\n  Let me talk about the 475 that we have currently stationed in Haiti. \nTheir mission is twofold. First, to provide a visible presence for \nstabilization. Second, to receive real-life training for readiness--\ntraining that can prove extremely beneficial in wartime.\n  Through humanitarian and civil operations, our troops have built \ninfrastructure and have medically treated thousands of Haitians. Their \npresence has had a positive impact in Haiti. Their presence, their \nmission, should continue.\n  While in Haiti last week, I had the opportunity to visit with our \ntroops. As I said, there are currently 475 of them--down from \napproximately 2,000 troops in 1996. This year's troop levels will \nlikely range between 475 and 600 on any given day, depending on the \nnumber of military personnel at any given time temporarily deployed to \nHaiti to perform the various humanitarian and civic operations.\n  Our troops engage in a variety of operations. Just in the last two \nyears, U.S. troops have built or restored approximately 13 miles of \nroads, repaired or renovated 36 schools, dug 23 wells, and restored a \nUniversity Hospital. They have treated over 50,000 Haitians and have \ntrained over 200 Haitian health care providers.\n  The goals for our troop this year include: continued humanitarian and \ncivic operations, such as medical and infrastructure building; and port \ncall visits. One new project our military will undertake is building a \nmaritime operation center in Jacmel to be used by the Haitian Coast \nGuard. Because of Jacmel's strategic location as a potential drug \ntransit area, this facility will be very helpful for counter-narcotics \noperations. By the end of this fiscal year, U.S. troops will have \nrenovated or built two other schools, distributed over a million \ndollars in medical supplies, and treated over 18,000 Haitians.\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\n  Our military presence there has had a profound and positive impact. \nOur troops repeatedly told me, as I talked to them, that they feel \nuseful and generally feel safe. While significant violence is still \ntaking place among Haitians, the U.S. troops that I talked to told me \nthe Haitians understand their presence and, by and large, welcome them \nthere.\n  Further, the military officers that I talked to, our men and women, \ntold me they have generally found no substantiated evidence of \ntargeting of U.S. forces in Haiti. The vigilantes--those who take \njustice into their own hands and engage in serious violence through \ngangs--have apparently not targeted U.S. forces.\n  Because the conditions in Haiti are so bad, our troops say that the \nhumanitarian and civic work they do is having a tremendous impact, both \non Haiti and on their own training. I was told a story by a U.S. \nmilitary nurse in Haiti who recently treated a child who had \nconjunctivitis. The little girl was close to losing her eyesight. If it \nhad remained untreated for 2 weeks, the doctors told me, she would have \nlost her eyesight. The nurse in this case, U.S. military nurse, treated \nthis little girl with eyedrops which saved the girl's vision. The \nAmerican nurse told us: ``I feel useful every day. I feel like I'm \ndoing something.''\n  She is not alone. Thousands and thousands of U.S. citizens travel \nevery year to Haiti to provide humanitarian assistance. When I arrived \nin Haiti 2 weeks ago, the morning I arrived our troops informed me that \nseveral of their key personnel were at that very moment involved in a \nmedical emergency involving U.S. citizens. Three U.S. missionaries had \njust been in a very serious car accident. A U.S. civilian policeman \noverheard reports of the accident on his two-way radio and was able to \nget a helicopter to pick up the individuals and transport them to a \nmedical facility at the American base.\n  As I arrived that morning at the base, I saw one of the individuals \nliterally being carried into an ambulance to be taken to the operating \ntable. An hour later, during lunch that day, a soldier from Ohio, with \nwhom I was eating lunch, told me he had helped treat the Americans, \nthese American missionaries. He gave me an update on their condition. \nIt was abundantly clear that our troops had saved the lives of these \nmissionaries. This limited U.S. military presence is having a profound \npositive effect. If we maintain this limited mission then, in my view, \nour troops' presence should continue for the time being.\n  The best news in Haiti, though--in addition to our troops who are \nthere and the great work they are doing--the other good news in Haiti \ncomes from the good works of thousands of individuals who are working \nto make a difference in the daily lives of Haitians. I met many \ninnovative Haitians who were passionate about improving life in Haiti. \nThey are not part of the Government, they are private citizens. And \nthey have been joined by people from around the world who work in every \naspect of society. They help the poor, the orphaned, the starving, the \nelderly, and the sick. It has been an inspiration to visit these people \non my trips to Haiti and to visit their projects.\n  Let me just talk about a couple. In 1980, Dr. Guy Theodore, a retired \nU.S. Air Force colonel, founded a health clinic in Pignon to serve a \npoor rural Haitian community. Through Dr. Theodore's leadership, hard \nwork, and his determination, the clinic has now one of Haiti's most \nsuccessful comprehensive help and development programs. The hospital \nserves 150,000 people and provides health services, women's literacy \nprograms, credit programs, an innovative water and sanitation program, \nand environmental and community development programs.\n\n  It was here when we were traveling out in the country that we \nhappened to meet a group of doctors from Fargo, ND. The eight men and \nwomen who traveled there traveled at their own expense. They raised \n$20,000--enough money to send them and their equipment to Haiti for a \nweek of surgery and medical work. They were giving their time to make a \ndifference to many suffering people.\n  In Cap Haitien, we met three nurses from Georgia who were working \nthrough Emory University. They told me about the work they were doing, \ntraining local people about basic health and sanitation, and they \nencouraged me to urge other American universities to consider \ncooperative ventures to train more Haitians in these important works. \nOne nurse whom I talked to had been coming to Haiti and working in \nHaiti for 17 years.\n  On a previous trip, in the town of Lescayes, we met Father William \nKonicki, who gave us a tour of his home for the elderly. People who had \nnowhere to sleep, nothing to eat, people who were sick and disabled, \nthey all found a place to live and be safe with Father Konicki. Without \nFather Konicki's tremendous efforts to make something out of nothing, \nthese elderly people would have starved to death.\n  Some of the most difficult stories have to do with Haiti's orphans. \nBecause of extreme poverty, high premature death rates among adults, \nparents, and AIDS, thousands of Haiti's children have been orphaned or \nabandoned. Many end up in places that provide no more than shelter. The \nchildren come malnourished and diseased. Often the only food these \nchildren eat comes from the U.S. Public Law 480 title II feeding \nprogram. Last year, the administration announced a plan to phase out \nthe part of this program that served orphans, the elderly, and \nindividuals with AIDS.\n  Through legislation, I worked closely with appropriators in Congress \nto secure funding for fiscal year 1998 at the same level as fiscal year \n1997. I will continue to fight for this money for these children. It is \nthe only food many of them have. If this money is not approved, we will \nliterally be taking away the only food these children have to eat.\n  These are pictures of the food ration that our Public Law 480 \nactually provides. This may not look too appetizing to us in the United \nStates, but this is a meal that provides these children--they get one \nmeal a day--it provides them with a well balanced, nourishing meal. It \nallows them to be healthier, frankly, than most children are in Haiti. \nThat is what that Public Law 480 funds provide. There are tens of \nthousands of children like this in Haiti.\n  There are many caring adults who run the orphanages I have referred \nto. Mr. President, 67-year-old Sister Veronique, a Haitian-born nun \nwhom I have gotten to know and my wife has gotten to know over the last \nfew years, picks up abandoned babies from the hospital every time that \nshe has an open bed. These are children who are about ready to die. \nMany times they are not true orphans, they are brought into the \nhospital when people are so poor they bring the children in--they try \nto keep them at home, but then when they know they are about ready to \ndie or think they cannot keep them any longer or they will die, they \nbring them into the hospital. What Sister Veronique does is, she goes \nto the hospital every time she has an open bed, she picks up another \nbaby, and takes that baby back to her orphanage and tries to keep that \nbaby alive. There are many, many success stories. Many of these \nchildren do, in fact, make it because of what Sister Veronique does.\n\n  Another nun, Sister McGonagle, from San Diego, spends 6 months of \nevery year raising moneys for the Kenscoff Orphanage, where she works \nthe rest of the year. Father Stra, from Italy, a Salesian priest, \nprovides shelter for homeless boys and training programs for street \nchildren. We also met an American couple who bring Haitian orphans into \ntheir own home in Port au Prince, hoping to find permanent homes for \nthese children later in the United States.\n  I am pleased that our United States Agency for International \nDevelopment mission in Haiti is working to develop a local association \nof people to advocate for children and serve as a network for \norphanages, so as to be able to share ideas and resources. This is an \nimportant idea and one that we should encourage and continue.\n  Let me say that after five visits to Haiti, I can assure my \ncolleagues in the Congress that we have, working for the U.S. \nGovernment, a number of very dedicated people in AID, a number of very \ndedicated and talented people at our Embassy as well.\n  In conclusion, we should be clear. Haiti's democracy is not stable; \nit is in its infancy. As Americans, we find it hard to imagine a \ncountry that is not even able to hold elections. But the\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nelectoral fraud over Haiti's national and municipal elections last \nApril, that cloud over those elections in which only 5 percent of the \npopulation even bothered to cast ballots, has brought government there \nto a halt.\n  There has been a political impasse since last June, when President \nRosny Smarth resigned. In fact, it seems that all the key players, the \nHaitian Government and the other parties, have decided not to resolve \nthis crisis.\n  That is why this weekend's visit by Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright is so critical. I understand she intends to meet with the two \nLavalas parties, which I think is necessary. However, I am surprised to \nhear that she has no plans to meet with the other opposition parties. I \nthink that is a mistake. It is critical that she meet with the other \nparties as well. This will encourage their participation in the next \nelections, and keep them involved in the national political dialogue \nand will send a signal to the current Government of Haiti of what true \npolitical pluralism really means.\n  Until this political impasse has been resolved, we should not be \npledging any kind of financial support for future elections. Indeed, \nour Haiti policy must be something more than a blank check. Without \nspecific measurable goals, monetary aid to Haiti is an unguided \nassistance program in search of a policy. It seems to me that we must \nexport our ideas along with our aid. It will take more than just money \nto bring stability to Haiti; it will require a comprehensive plan and \nHaitian political will. Without these key elements, all the money in \nthe world will not do any good in Haiti.\n  I think it is clear that the United States needs to work with the \ninternational community, develop a coherent and well-planned strategy, \nand together pressure the Haitian Government to first resolve the \ncurrent political crisis. Furthermore, before Haiti can prosper--both \ndemocratically and economically--the government must address--and make \na commitment to--three key factors: (1) hold free and transparent \nelections; (2) combat the increasing threat of drugs; and (3) reform \nthe ``broken'' judiciary.\n  I have suggested that in these three key areas--which do not \ncurrently receive significant funding from the United States; it is a \nrelatively small amount of money that we put in Haiti--that increased \nfunding should be considered if certain benchmarks are met as I have \noutlined. Current budget request figures for these three areas do not \nexceed $10 million, a relatively small part of the total Haitian \ncommitment. These priority areas though are essential and our \nadministration should pay close attention. We must pay close attention \nto whether the Haitians are willing to address these three specific \nproblems: hold free and transparent elections; combat the increasing \nthreat of drugs; and reform the broken judiciary. Unless they are \naddressed, it is very hard to see how any real democratic progress and \neconomic development can possibly ever take hold in Haiti.\n  In two of these priority areas--politial and judicial reform--we must \nfind ways to work with the government. We have no choice. Simply, it \nwill take political will by the Haitian Government to achieve any \nprogress in this areas. Let me make it clear: The United States cannot \nand should not make an investment in these areas without a clear \ncommitment from the Haitian Government.\n  As I mentioned before, we can't do for the Haitians what they cannot \nand will not do for themselves. The political will must exist.\n  However, Mr. President, there are areas where we can't stand by and \nwait for the Haitian Government to act. There are ways that the United \nStates can work around the government to provide a semblance of hope \nfor the Haitian people and some stability to that country. These areas \ninclude agriculture reform, feeding programs, and other areas of \nhumanitarian support. With respect to drugs, here, too, we cannot \nwait--we must take action now to reduce the flow of drugs through \nHaiti. It is in our national self-interest. If we do not do that, we \nrisk the entire nation turning into a narcostate with tragic \nconsequences not only for Haiti but for the United States. No doubt, \nlong-term drug control will require greater cooperation with the \nHaitian Government, but our Government should devote its resources now \nto respond to the current threat.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues both in the Congress and \nin the administration to address these priorities, and help create a \nstrategic long-term vision for our policy toward Haiti.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I thank you personally for \nyour forbearance this morning and this afternoon. I appreciate it very, \nvery much.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3202-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3209-S3212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND UNIVERSAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a subject \ncalled universal service, and the threat it faces because of the \nFederal Communication Commission's--the FCC's-- policy regarding \nInternet service providers. When we passed the Telecommunications Act \nof 1996, a number of us--a bipartisan group called the Farm Team--\nfought hard to include Section 254, the section that ensures our \nnation's continued commitment to universal service. This section is the \nheart and soul of this new law, because without this fundamental \ncommitment, telecommunications service in rural areas would not be \naffordable. Without it, we will watch a new world of haves and have-\nnots when it comes to telecommunications and access to the Information \nAge.\n  When I deal with this issue, I am painfully reminded of another \nexample of deregulation: the airlines. West Virginia and other rural \nstates got the short end of the stick on airline deregulation, and we \ncontinue to pay the price for it. That's what made me and others so \ndetermined not to let this happen under the Telecommunications Act. We \nknew we had to make sure that the idea of universal service was not \nsimply expressed as a goal or listed in some weak section--we made sure \nit was a statutory obligation explicitly stated in the Act.\n  Maintaining universal service involves a number of issues. Senator \nStevens took on most of these by demanding a major report from the FCC \non their progress regarding universal service, in a provision in last \nyear's appropriations bill that funded the FCC. That report is due \nApril 10, and many of us are looking for serious answers from the FCC \nto the many questions we have about the direction they are heading with \nregard to universal service funding.\n  Two big concerns are, (1) the FCC's ill-advised decision to provide \nonly 25 percent of the costs of universal service, leaving the \nremaining 75 percent to the states; and (2) their decision to only fund \nthe FCC's portion of the high-cost fund from interstate revenues. I do \nnot believe that rural states can live with either of these proposals, \nbecause what we'll get are higher rates and dwindling investment in our \nlocal telecommunications networks. This simply does not square with the \nAct's promise of delivering comparable services at comparable rates. \nSection 254 was designed to ensure a national standard of affordability \nfor telecommunications services, and that is a standard we simply must \nlive up to.\n  In the 1996 law, we recognized that the maintenance of the nation's \ntelecommunications network is a shared responsibility--and one that \nprovides shared benefits. It is in our national interest that everyone \nbe able to affordably make calls from anywhere and to anywhere in the \nUnited States.\n  This isn't a radical concept. As a nation we share responsibility in \nmany areas. My colleague Senator Dorgan points out that land-locked \nstates like West Virginia, North Dakota and Montana all help pay for \nthe Coast Guard,\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\neven though our citizens use those services far less than others. I \ncertainly wouldn't advocate that we stop supporting the Coast Guard, \nand the same principle applies here. Shared Responsibility.\n  I will have more to say on these subjects as the FCC moves forward on \nimplementing universal service. Today I want to focus on the subject of \ninternet telephony, and how the FCC's current regulatory policy \nthreatens the promise of universal service.\n  The problem is that the FCC's current policy is basically a policy of \nletting so-called information service providers avoid paying for their \nfair share of universal service, even though these companies are \ndelivering services that are clearly telecommunications services and \nwhich burden the local network. Senator Stevens has been the most vocal \nleader on this issue, and I want to praise him. We both come from high-\ncost states, and we both know the importance of changing the FCC policy \nso that their mission to maintain universal service can be fulfilled.\n  Where this problem is most clear is in the current offerings of long \ndistance telephone service over the Internet. It's a very real trend \nand a rapidly rising trend. In fact, I will submit two articles for the \nRecord that tell this part of the story, one from Businessweek and one \nfrom the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                          The Newest Phone War\n\n                            (By Noelle Knox)\n\n       Consumers looking for the cheapest long-distance telephone \n     rates need only log onto the Internet, the newest arena of \n     intense competition, where companies are offering special \n     prices from 5 to 10 cents a minute.\n       Thsi week, the AT Corporation is expected to start \n     offering its Internet customers long-distance calls at just 9 \n     cents a minute, matching new rates introduced recently by MCI \n     Communications.\n       Both giants are scrambling to respond to the initiative of \n     a little player that had a big idea: Tel-Save Holdings, a \n     long-distance provider in New Hope, Pa., that caters \n     primarily to small and medium-sized businesses. Since Dec. \n     18, it has contracted with America Online to offer the 9-\n     cent-a-minute rate to the on-line service's 11 million \n     subscribers. With promotions on its main screen and in full-\n     page newspaper ads, America Online has signed up almost \n     400,000 customers so far, and expects to have a million by \n     the end of June.\n       Many industry experts call such programs the start of a \n     revolution that will lower all long-distance rates, a result \n     of making a connection in consumers' minds between the \n     Internet and phone service. Eventually, the experts say, the \n     Internet will become a major transmission vehicle for the \n     calls themselves and the line will blur between telephone and \n     Internet.\n       ``It's going to change the industry,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, \n     a telecommunications consultant and author of ``Winning \n     Communications Strategies'' (Aegis Publishing Group). The new \n     rates are just the beginning, he said, adding, ``The question \n     is: How low can they go?''\n       A long-distance company can offer a lower rate to Internet \n     customers because the company saves money. The customers \n     enter their own billing data when they sign up, and in most \n     cases must pay with a credit card, receiving their bill \n     through their computers. For the companies, that means no \n     paper bills and no postage costs, while the reliance on \n     credit cards also reduces the companies' exposure to bad \n     debt.\n       Not all the long-distance carriers are joining the Internet \n     price war. The Sprint Corporation, which offered the first \n     10-cent-a-minute plan, does not offer internet customers a \n     better rate. ``We think it's restrictive to say one kind of \n     customer can get one kind or rate and another customer can \n     get another kind of rate,'' said Robin Pence, a spokeswoman \n     for Sprint.\n       She also criticized the Internet-based marketing plans \n     because they usually provide customer service only on line.\n       Still, many telecommunications executives and analysts say \n     that this is only the beginning of a shift toward new kinds \n     of communication via the Internet. The current Internet plans \n     offer new rates for long-distance calls carried by \n     traditional phone lines, but AT plans to start a cheaper \n     service in May that will carry long-distance calls over an \n     Internet-style network.\n       That service, called AT World Net Voice, will start in \n     three cities, still to be announced, and expand to 16 by the \n     end of the year. AT will charge 7.5 to 9 cents a minute for \n     calls using Internet protocol.\n       Internet protocol, or Internet telephony, as it is also \n     known, uses a regular phone. But a separate transmission \n     switch digitizes and compresses the caller's voice into \n     packets of data that are moved through the Internet and \n     reassembled at the phone on the other end.\n       ``From AT's point of view, Internet protocol is critical \n     to our future success and growth,'' said Daniel H. Schulman, \n     a vice president at AT's World Net Service. ``In fact, we \n     think the Internet protocol is to the communications industry \n     what the personal computer was to the computing industry; \n     it's that fundamental a change.''\n       The technology, though, which is just two years old, is \n     still slow and cumbersome. Many people who use Internet \n     protocol for long-distance calls report frustrating time lags \n     between the speaker and the listener. AT says it has \n     reduced the delays, but callers must still dial a local \n     access number, wait for a prompt, enter an authorization code \n     and then dial the number they want.\n       But with improvements in quality in the next five years, \n     the Internet telephony business is expected to grow from less \n     than $1 billion a year today to $24 billion--about 17 percent \n     of the projected United States long-distance market, \n     according to the International Data Corporation.\n       About 25 million American homes are connected to the \n     Internet. And their occupants tend to be more affluent and \n     make more long-distance calls. In a survey last year, \n     International Data found that in homes with a personal \n     computer connected to the Internet, the average respondent \n     was 41 years old, had a household income of $70,400 a year \n     and spent an average of $58 a month on long-distance calls. \n     Among households without a computer, the average respondent \n     was 47 years old, had a household income of $38,700 and spent \n     an average of $30.50 a month on long-distance calls.\n       While it may make good business sense for long-distance \n     carriers to focus on the most profitable market segment, some \n     consumer advocates are not impressed.\n       ``What we've constantly seen here is benefits for volume \n     users at the high end of the market, while rates have \n     actually risen for consumers at the low end of the market, \n     unless government has intervened to put a lid on rates, or \n     forced them down,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director for \n     Consumers Union.\n       But Mr. Kagan, the telecommunications consultant, predicted \n     that as Internet telephony improved, it would push down all \n     long-distance rates. ``Within a year's time, we're going to \n     see traditional long distance down to the 5-cent mark,'' he \n     said.\n       As the long-distance industry changes, the line separating \n     telephone and Internet services may start to break down. \n     Customers might buy telephones with a screen, for example, \n     and dial into the Internet to place a call. Long-distance \n     companies may start focusing on other, more profitable \n     businesses, like cellular phone service, pagers, call \n     forwarding and electronic mail.\n       ``Long-distance companies will still make plenty of money, \n     but they will make it from these higher-margin services,'' \n     Mr. Kagan said.\n\n\n                   LONG-DISTANCE savings a click away\n\n       Long-distance phone deals are proliferating on line. Most \n     programs provide billing and customer service over the \n     Internet: payments must be made by credit card.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Rate                             Restrictions          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          TEL-SAVE--WWW.AOL.COM                         \n                                                                        \n9 cents a minute......................

Brull in Los Angeles, with Peter Elstrom in New York)\n\n       How can Qwest Communications Corp. get away with charging \n     just 7\\1/2\\ cents a minute any time for long-distance \n     calling--the ultra-aggressive pricing it announced on Dec. \n     15? For one thing, according to President and Chief Executive \n     Officer Joseph P. Nacchio, ``Long distance is still the most \n     profitable business in America, next to importing illegal \n     cocaine.'' As head of long-distance marketing for AT until \n     last year, he should know.\n       Actually, Qwest can make its audacious offer--and still \n     match AT's 17% to 20% net margins--because it sends its \n     traffic over a private fiber-optic network using Internet \n     technology. That method, says Nacchio, is far more efficient \n     than that of the conventional carriers. Indeed, if Qwest \n     makes its mark in long distance, it won't be for undercutting \n     AT's best all-day rate by 50%--it will be for proving that \n     Internet-based calling can steal significant amounts of \n     traffic from ordinary long-distance circuits.\n       Easy to use. Qwest's offer heralds the coming of age of \n     Internet telephony. Just a couple of years ago, making phone \n     calls over the\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n     Internet was a challenge reserved for computer whizzes. \n     Consumers still will have to dial a few extra digits to make \n     cheap calls. But now, improved PC-based software and routers \n     make it possible for Internet service providers to accept \n     standard telephone and fax calls and send them over the \n     Internet or private data networks and then back to the \n     conventional phone network.\n       As a mass market develops, companies such as AT could \n     lose millions of customers and billions in revenue to \n     Internet calling. ``In the next 24 months, we'll see a rapid \n     migration,'' predicts Nacchio. Between 1998 and 2001, as much \n     as $8 billion could be lost to Internet telephony, says Sim \n     Hall, vice-president of research at Action Information \n     Services of Falls Church, VA. ``Internet telephony is going \n     from novelty to mainstream next year,'' agrees Jeffrey Kagan \n     of consultants Kagan Telecom Associates.\n       Besides being more efficient than standard voice networks, \n     which consume bandwidth even when there is silence during a \n     call, the new networks also bypass conventional long-distance \n     carriers, who must pay local-access charges and taxes. Such \n     fees make up 40% of the typical long-distance charge, Hall \n     notes.\n       Unlike the pioneers of Internet telephony, bigger companies \n     like Qwest mostly route traffic over their own networks. That \n     lets them manage capacity to avoid the scratchy sound and \n     half-second delays of some Internet phone setups.\n       Qwest isn't the only company with big ambitions in Net \n     calling. WorldCom Inc.'s Internet division, UUNet, is taking \n     aim at the $92 billion fax market. Early next year, it will \n     offer nationwide faxing for 10 cents a minute, compared with \n     the typical business rate of 15 cents a minute. International \n     faxes to Britain will cost 19 cents a minute, half the \n     average rate now.\n       Denver-based Qwest, which is building a $2 billion \n     nationwide fiber-optic network, will offer its 7.5 cents rate \n     on calls anywhere in the continental U.S. starting in late \n     January in nine western cities. The network will expand to \n     125 markets in early 1999, when Qwest's national network is \n     scheduled to be completed. Qwest also plans fax, video-\n     conferencing, and other services.\n       Established long-distance providers are making their own \n     forays with the new technology. In August, AT began \n     offering domestic and long-distance calls from Japan at 40% \n     off normal rates. Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co. created a \n     subsidiary offering similar services worldwide on Dec. 16.\n       MCI Communications Corp. and Deutsche Telekom are running \n     trials.\n       While the data networks will help cut domestic long-\n     distance rates, the big impact will be on international \n     calls. The average long-distance call in the U.S. costs about \n     13 cents a minute, but the average international price is \n     89 cents, Hall says. The gap has little to do with the extra \n     cost of an international call, which is marginal. Rather, it \n     reflects the pricing power of a small group of suppliers.\n       Hall predicts that phone company revenues per minute on \n     international calls will fall more than 20% annually through \n     2001 and continue to decline. ``The wheel has been set into \n     motion,'' says Hall. Nobody knows how far it will spin, but \n     at this point, it looks as if consumers will be the winners.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFFELLER. These new long distance calls are offered at rates \nfar below that of ``traditional'' long distance calls, with some at 7 \ncents per minute. While cheaper service is a good thing, the problem is \nthat FCC policy has created a giant loophole that threatens universal \nservice. Because of this policy, service can be offered over the \nInternet more cheaply because Internet-based providers can avoid paying \naccess charges and universal service contributions. This is all because \nthey offer their service using packet-switched technology through an \nInternet Service Provider, which allows them to escape the FCC's \ncurrent definition of telecommunications carrier. The problem is that \naccess charges and universal service contributions are what help \nmaintain the local network, which is the most expensive part of the \nphone system. Without adequate support--and by allowing these companies \nto duck paying their fair share--we will let the local network wither \non the vine.\n  It is important to remember that, aside from their regulatory \ntreatment, the nature of both types of long distance calls are exactly \nthe same. They are both spoken voice calls that occur over regular \nphones. There is no quality distinction between them for the consumer. \nIt is also important to remember that both calls burden the local phone \nnetwork in essentially the same manner. The only difference is that the \nFCC has chosen to define one as a telecommunications service and the \nother as an information service-- even though any review of these calls \nin the real world would conclude that they are the same.\n  Further, we are already seeing evidence that this regulatory loophole \nis a multi-billion dollar incentive for all long distance carriers to \nmove their traffic from the traditional circuit switched network to the \nInternet. The March 8 New York Times article that I mentioned earlier \npoints out that the Internet will increasingly become a major \ntransmission vehicle for phone service, and that in the near future \n``the line will blur between telephone and Internet.''\n  It also points out plans by a number of companies to move more and \nmore traffic to the Internet, including AT, and that in the next five \nyears Internet telephony alone will grow from less than $1 billion a \nyear today to $24 billion annually. John Sidgemore, the CEO of UUNet, \ngoes further, and recently predicted that by 2008 traditional voice \ntransmissions will represent less than one percent of total \ncommunications traffic--and under the current policy that one percent \nwill be left to support universal service.\n  Senator Burns chaired a hearing in the Commerce Committee a week ago \nthat shed a lot of light on this important issue. We heard from Wall \nStreet analysts who were giving us their opinions about the \nimplementation of the Telecommunications Act. I asked them what they \nthought about this issue and the FCC's current policy regarding these \nso-called information service providers. The verdict was unanimous. The \nentire panel agreed that the FCC's current policy is flawed.\n  Tod Jacobs of Bernstein Research said, ``it is certainly our opinion \nthat the ISPs have been getting a free ride, and that there is no \nquestion that access charges, particularly once they get down to more \ncost-based rates, should be applied to those calls.''\n  Scott Cleland, managing director of the Precurser Group of Legg Mason \nWood Walker, said that ``people should know that the Internet and data \nright now is by far the most subsidized entity in the business, even \nmore so than the local monopoly.'' He added that, ``Congress should \nrealize that right now whether the Internet or whether data pays access \ncharges or pay into universal service is the most massively distorting \nissue facing Congress in telecommunications; that we are at a fulcrum \npoint.''\n  But the key point made by Mr. Cleland was when he discussed the \nperverse effect the FCC's current policy will certainly have--that the \nFCC's policy actively encourages companies to game the system so that \nthey do not have to pay access charges or contribute to universal \nservice. This is the real bottom line, and Mr. Cleland got it exactly \nright when he said: ``we are all just going to morph ourselves into a \nnew definition and leave universal service to anybody who is not smart \nenough to take advantage of the new definitions.''\n  Let me repeat that. The industry will ``leave universal service to \nanybody who is not smart enough to take advantage of the new \ndefinitions.''\n  That is a clear warning to all of us that care about keeping \ntelecommunications service affordable in rural areas. And it should be \na clear signal to the FCC. Many of us are looking to the April 10th \nreport from the FCC for serious answers on this issue. I urge Chairman \nKennard in the strongest possible terms not to try to defend the \nregulatory status quo with regard to Internet Service Providers. The \nTelecommunications Act includes specific language stressing that \n``universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications \nservices. . . .'' I believe the FCC's policy needs to evolve with it, \nparticularly since all forms of telecommunications will increasingly \nrely on packet-switching and other types of advanced technology. I am \nnot going to keep quiet about this issue. We fought too long and hard \nfor the universal service provisions of the act, and universal service \nitself is far too important to the country for us to ignore this very \nserious problem.\n  Let me also be clear that I am not advocating any kind of extensive \nregulation of the Internet in connection with this issue. I think the \ngrowth of the Internet would not have occurred as rapidly as it has if \nit were subject to extensive regulation. But those who argue against \nregulation ought to be equally in favor of eliminating the unfair \nadvantage the industry receives today as it avoids its universal \nservice obligations at the expense of rural America.\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\n  Universal service is a fundamental principle. It is a statutory \npromise that Congress and the President made to Americans. It is worth \nfighting to preserve and protect. And I urge everyone in this body to \ntake it very, very seriously.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, as we are heading out on the Easter recess, \nI want to wish all my colleagues godspeed and also make a small request \nof them while they are in their home States. That request is for them \nto thank the people that smoke for their contribution of $368.5 \nbillion, or perhaps $510 billion. I think a lot of people out there \nthink we are finally going to get to the big bad tobacco companies and \nget them to pay some money up front here and kick in for all the damage \nthat has been done. But, really, the smokers are going to wind up \npaying this. I don't know whether it will be for increased tobacco \ncosts, or whether it will be for an increased tobacco tax. At any rate, \nit is going to range from 50 cents to $1.10 or $1.50, or whatever they \nthink will make a difference.\n  Having said that, I ought to mention that I had not accepted any \nmoney from the tobacco companies during my campaign. It could have been \nvery critical, as I had a highly underfunded campaign. I was offered \nmoney from the tobacco companies, but I would not accept it. I could \nsee this sort of debate and discussion coming up later. I didn't want \nto be seen as favoring the tobacco companies and will not be favoring \nthe tobacco companies.\n  I have a lot of concerns, as we have gotten into this tobacco debate. \nIn fact, the concerns have gotten to be so many that I am kind of \ndepressed about whether or not there is any capability to do anything \nabout the problem. When I was growing up, my folks smoked. Both my mom \nand my dad smoked, and they smoked a lot. In fact, I had the feeling \nthat I didn't smoke because I could walk anywhere in the house, inhale, \nand get plenty of smoke. About the time I was a junior in high school, \nthough, my dad saw a program on television. As part of this program, \nsome kids visited a lab and they had a beaker about 6 inches in \ndiameter and about a foot tall, half filled with some liquid. That was \nthe amount of tar that the average smoker would have collected in their \nlungs. One of the kids reached into this beaker and pulled his fingers \nback up out of there and had strands of sticky tar hanging from it. At \nthat point, my dad quit smoking.\n  He and Mom had talked about smoking for as long as I could remember \nand about all of the money they would save if they quit smoking. But \nthey had not quit--well, they quit several times, but they had taken it \nback up again. My mom had always said that if my dad would quit \nsmoking, she would quit. My dad saw the picture of the stringy tar \ncoming out of the beaker, thought about his lungs, and quit. It wasn't \neasy, but he quit. After a couple of weeks of my dad having quit, my \nmom decided that she had to quit, too; that was part of the deal.\n  About a year later, I went for my annual athletic physical, and the \ndoctor asked me to sit in his office for a minute because he wanted to \ntalk to me, and I did; you always do what the doctor says. When he came \nin, he said, ``I am really glad to see that you quit smoking.'' I said, \n``I have never smoked.'' He said, ``Oh, yes, you have, take a look at \nthese x-rays.'' He put up the x-ray of a year before and showed me how \nclogged my lungs were the year before. So for years I have known about \nsecondary smoke. We didn't even know to call it ``secondary smoke'' \nproblems at that time. But they were there. It was evident on the x-\nrays. I also had a problem as I was growing up with hay fever. It \nwasn't seasonal, but I thought it had to do with molds, grass, and that \nsort of thing. Another benefit I had of my folks quitting smoking was \nthat I got over hay fever. Secondary smoke again.\n  About a year and a half ago, my mom had a heart attack. We found out \nat that time that she might still be smoking. It is a powerful \naddiction. So I do have some interest in smoking. I went to the George \nWashington University here in Washington, DC, when I went to college, \nand there used to be a medical museum on the mall right by the \nSmithsonian. It has been replaced by the Air and Space displays \nthere. I think it still exists somewhere in the District. But one of \nthe displays they had in there was parts of the human body cut up in \nthin slices, encased in plastic, and you could kind of page your way \nthrough a liver or a heart or lungs. They had lungs of smokers and \nnonsmokers. So there is a problem there, and it has been recognized for \na long time. I do not think there is anybody now who argues that \ncigarettes will not kill you if you use enough of them long enough. It \nwill have an effect on your health. I am very disturbed that there are \nstill young people who are starting to smoke. They know what the damage \nis, they know what the outcome is going to be, and they still smoke.\n\n  On behalf of all of these folks, we are going to look at a \nsettlement. We are going to try to figure out whether we have the right \nto settle on behalf of the whole country and, if we do, in what \ncategories we have that right to settle and what kind of a precedent we \nwill be setting in all kinds of other fields where people may be \ndamaged by things that at one point in time we did not know might \ndamage them but now might clearly know that, because this will be \nprecedent setting.\n  The biggest thing I wish to talk about today is the smokers \nthemselves, because I know as I travel around Wyoming--and I am in \nWyoming almost every weekend; it is a big State with a lot of small \ntowns, so it takes a lot of travel, and we get around regularly and \ntalk to folks. But I know from talking to the smokers, it has not hit \nhome yet that the smokers will pay the bill. Whether it is an increased \ntax or increased prices of cigarettes, the companies will collect it, \nthe companies will forward it to us, but the smokers will pay the tab.\n  Something that is happening back here that is disturbing me a little \nbit is, we have run into this $368.5 billion; that is a number that has \nbeen quoted for a long time. I noticed the tobacco settlement that came \nout of the Commerce Committee calls for about $510 billion. It doesn't \nmatter which of those figures you want to use; they are both huge \nnumbers. They are both probably too small a number to solve what we are \ntalking about solving. But we are not necessarily talking about using \nthat money to solve the problems of smoking, we are talking about it as \na new addiction. That is what I call the political addiction --if there \nis some money and it is not earmarked, it is an addiction.\n  I saw a cartoon. The cartoon essentially said: Don't give alcohol to \nan alcoholic; don't give drugs to a drug addict; and don't give money \nto a politician.\n  This is more money than we have looked at in quite some time. There \nhave always been constraints on the money we have had before. But this \nis pretty wide open. Oh, sure, we have said there are some things we \nwould do with it. In fact, it was the States that brought up this issue \noriginally. The States started some lawsuits against the tobacco \ncompanies, and they won. So now they have some money coming, and the \ntobacco companies can see that this could catch on, and it has. It has \nbeen to a number of States now. So the tobacco companies have said, \nlet's get together and talk about a settlement; let's see how we can \nrein in a little bit of this and do some damage control. Of course, \nthey are looking at damage control primarily for their companies, so \nthey have reached some agreements with folks. It is a varied group of \nfolks.\n  Again, I do not know if they have the right to do the kinds of \nnegotiations they say they are doing, but any way that you look at it, \nit is the States that started, the States that got agreements partly \nthrough the courts, now\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\npartly through negotiations and a settlement, and it seems to me that \nthose States expect that they are going to get some money to reimburse \nthemselves for the Medicaid they have spent to take care of smokers.\n\n  That is what the lawsuit was about. That is the basis on which they \nwon. So probably we ought to think about a little bit of that money \ngetting back to the States to do what we said would be done based on \nthe lawsuits and the settlement that came out of them.\n  Now, 57 percent of Medicaid is the Federal part of the cost. So do we \njust have the States collect their share? How much of the $368 billion \nor $510 billion ought to be ours? Well, that is something we ought to \nlegitimately address. But I am concerned that there is not money in \nthat settlement that deals with the cost of Medicare. Smokers are going \nto have bigger problems when they get into Medicare than nonsmokers. It \nworks that way with insurance; it works that way with Medicare. There \nisn't any money talked about in the settlement.\n  We have talked about taking the Federal portion of the money from \ntobacco and putting that into Medicare. Good idea. Part of it comes, \nthough, from reimbursing Medicaid, the Federal portion, the 57 percent. \nSo we ought to take some money and put it into Medicaid probably. But \nwe are talking about taking it--and this is for ease of talking about \nhow we are going to handle it. The Medicare system is in trouble partly \nbecause of smoking. We are going to take a portion, that portion that \nturns out to be the Federal portion, and put it into Medicare. Good \nidea. Good plan.\n  Medicare ought to have an additional contribution based on how much \nof it is caused by smoking--something that has been known by the \ncompanies for a long time that they have been causing, something they \ndidn't own up to completely, something they are now talking about. So \nwe need to be sure there is some Medicare money in there.\n  Now, one of the fascinating phases I have talked about in dealing \nwith the Medicare thing is a comment by some of the tobacco companies \nthat it really should not be a very big part of their expense, because \nmost smokers do not live long enough to be a part of the Medicare \nproblem. I do not know if that is justification or not. It does not \nseem to me that it would be.\n  We are also talking about using some of the money to compensate the \npeople who are growing the tobacco, and there probably is some \nobligation on our part--not necessarily out of the $368.5 billion--to \ncompensate the growers. The growers probably have seen the damage that \nsmoking has been causing over the years and have had some options on \nother things they could have done with their land, and so a total \ncompensation for losses probably is not in order.\n  There are vending machine owners, and they are small businessmen, and \nI think in the settlement we are talking about compensating them, \ncompensating them even for future loss of revenues. I am an advocate of \nthe small businessman. I have been a small businessman. I know what \nsome of those problems are. But I cannot go along with compensating \nthem both for the loss of the vending machine and the loss of their \nfuture revenues. That is the normal course of doing business--figuring \nout what the future is going to be, what changes there are going to be \nin the marketplace and how you will adjust. These changes are not \ncoming on that suddenly that they have to be compensated for future \nloss of revenues.\n  I am even interested, as the only accountant in the Senate, in how \nthey are coming up with the cost of the vending machines. It seems to \nme it ought to be the cost of the vending machines less what they have \nbeen allowed to depreciate under the tax system.\n  I suggest there ought to be another part to this, and that other part \nI call smokers' compensation. Since the smokers of this country are \ngoing to be paying the bill, at least a portion of the money that we \nare going to collect, whichever method we use, ought to go for some \nkind of a fund that is going to solve the future health problems of \nthese folks who are paying the bill. They ought to have some individual \nresponsibility. It is a decision they made on their own to smoke, it is \nsomething they have known about for a long time as causing their own \nproblems, but we are about to have one of the biggest court gluts that \nwe have ever seen. The tobacco settlement bill as it came out of the \nCommerce Committee, as I understand it, has some form of immunity in \nit. That is a cap for the tobacco companies, guaranteeing them they \nwill not be sued for more than $6.5 billion a year.\n  That's liability protection. That means it still goes through the \nnormal system of lawsuits. Somebody has to sue the tobacco companies to \nget compensation. They still have to win in court. But the companies \nwill not lose more than $6.5 billion in any way.\n  What we are going to have is thousands of lawsuits piled up in the \ncourts, lawsuits of people trying to get to be first to the money so \ntheir money will come within the $6.5 billion cap. It sounds like a lot \nof money. It is a lot of money. It is not enough money to take care of \nall of the problems caused by smoking out there. In fact, I am pretty \nsure that if we took the entire assets of every tobacco company in the \nUnited States, put them out of business and sold the assets, that that \nwould not be enough money to take care of the problems that have been \ncaused by smoking.\n  Unfortunately, the courts have become one of the biggest lotteries \nthat we have in the country. It is a legal lottery, but you have to \nhave a lawyer to scratch your card for you. That has become one of the \nbiggest attorney retirement funds there is. The attorneys typically get \nabout 40 percent of what they win for you. They don't have any pain. \nThey don't have any suffering. They don't have the problems with the \nsmoking. They just provide their legal expertise--and you need that to \ngo to court. In exchange for their legal expertise and the money that \nyou receive, they will get about 40 percent plus expenses. It has been \nanticipated that probably less than half of whatever money goes into \nthis legal fund will ever get to a smoker.\n  So we have the problem of how much is going to get to the smoker. We \nhave the courts jammed up now with everybody trying to be first in line \nto get his or her money. And I suspect, because we now know how bad the \ntobacco companies have been, that the first awards by the juries are \ngoing to be good ones. This is going to be truly the lottery. This is \ngoing to be a lot of money, and it will use up the $6.5 billion each \nand every year and leave some people without any compensation, or \nsharing in the lesser pool, or whatever.\n  I am trying to figure out how this could be handled and how we could \nsave some of that money so the smokers who are paying the bill could \nget some of their compensation back, could get some of their health \nproblems taken care of. I am suggesting that we set up a smokers' \ncompensation fund. A lot of people are familiar with Workers \nCompensation. That goes to the workers on the job. If a worker gets \nhurt, there is a set procedure already that he can get his medical \nbills paid and get some compensation for his loss of time and not have \nto go to court. That is to give him quicker treatment, which is \nessential, and make sure the doctors understand that they will be paid. \nIt's a system that has developed over more than half a century to try \nto help the worker. It does preserve some money there.\n  I am suggesting that same sort of system could be put in place so \nsmokers, when they have a problem, can be assured of immediate \ntreatment and immediate compensation, and the funds that they and the \ntobacco companies are paying in would be what provides this fund. So it \nnot only provides for the smokers but it also provides that the \nnonsmokers are not funding the problem also. That is what we are doing \nnow with Medicare. Medicare dollars from everybody go into the Medicare \nfunds and then Medicare funds go to take care of the extra costs that \ncome with the smoking.\n\n  I know that is not possible. It is too complicated. I cannot even do \nan adequate job, in a limited amount of time, of explaining how \nsmokers' compensation would work and how it would save the courts \nproblems, and how it would assure that everybody would have an equal \nshot at the money and how there would be enough money, provided we \nforce the companies and the smokers\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nto put that money into the fund. What I am suggesting is that we do put \nthe money from the settlement for tobacco into Medicare and at the same \ntime we begin to collect the statistics from the Medicare fund that \nshow how many of the illnesses that are going into that fund, that are \ndrawing money out of the fund, are smoking related.\n  I looked at targeting them, decided that we can keep track of what is \nsmoking related and what is not smoking related, so we will even have \nenough statistics that we would be able to establish a smokers' \ncompensation fund where the smoking money goes to take care of the \nsmoking problems and so there is money for the people who are there.\n  This is going to be a long process. I don't think we will reach a \nsettlement this year. When I was flying back on the plane last weekend, \nI started making a list of the complications that are going to keep a \ntobacco settlement from happening. It only takes 51 votes out of the \n100 here to stop anything. It is much harder to pass anything in a \nlegislative body than it is to stop it, because when you pass \nsomething, it has to go through a whole series of processes starting \nwith the committees, and at any one time in that process, if there is \nless than a majority vote, it is dead.\n  It will have to go through that process here, too. If 51 people don't \nlike the deal that's put together, it is not going to happen. When I \nwas listing those things, I got up to three pages, single spaced, of \noutline only, of the problems that look to me to be rather \ninsurmountable in dealing with the tobacco settlement. So I don't think \nanybody will get really excited about what is going to happen and \nwhether it will happen. But one thing they can be assured is we are \ngoing to raise prices on tobacco one way or another. So we ought to be \nboth thanking the smokers and asking how we can reduce smoking and how \nwe can take care of the people who are going to be paying the bill on \nthis, which is the smokers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. This legislation provides a \nmajor step forward in reforming America's public policy on maritime \nissues.\n  When the Senate adopts this legislation, it will make America's \nmaritime container shipping industry more competitive in the global \nmarketplace.\n  The bill is a fair and responsible balance for all the parties \naffected by this policy change.\n  This bill will increase competition in the ocean liner shipping \nindustry and it will help American exporters, from every state in the \nnation. Every American exporter and the American maritime industry will \nhave a better chance to compete in the world market.\n  Just last night I was working with Senator Harkin to address his \nconcern with the bill--Iowa farmers who export produce wanted to make \nsure we got the bill right. This is just another illustration that all \nstates have a stake in making sure this maritime reform is completed.\n  Maritime policy affects all Americans. If an American company \nexports, it is likely that its goods are sent overseas by container \nships. That is why it is especially important that the United States \nhave a shipping system that allows American carriers to compete on a \nlevel playing field.\n  S. 414 provides America that system.\n  This evolving legislative effort started back in the 104th Congress. \nWhile it has taken the Senate and all the stakeholders' time to develop \nan equitable solution, we have ultimately reached an historic balance \nbetween the needs of shippers, carriers, ports, and labor.\n  My colleagues, who helped get to this point, will all tell you the \nocean liner shipping world includes many different and difficult \ncompeting segments. But, every one of them genuinely wanted legislative \nreform.\n  In the end it meant all sides had to accept compromise. And, they \ndid.\n  These stakeholders' rolled-up their sleeves and worked to reach a \nconsensus.\n  I am proud of their efforts to look beyond their own self-interests. \nI am also proud of the leadership and support provided by my colleagues \nin the Senate for working in a bipartisan way to reach a consensus on \nthis important initiative.\n  Again, I think it is important to recognize that affected \nstakeholders are solidly behind the changes in maritime policy called \nfor by this Act.\n  The list of stakeholders included the National Industrial \nTransportation League, Sea-Land Service, APL Limited, Crowley Maritime, \nthe Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Association, \nthe Association of American Port Authorities, the International \nLongshoreman's Association, the International Longshoreman's and \nWarehouseman's Union, the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-\nCIO, among others.\n  This is a divergent group that normally does not hang out together. \nTheir interests often pit these groups at each other in adversarial \nrelationships. But, they came to the table in the search of a much \nneeded legislative solution. This is a signal of just how important \nOcean Shipping Reform Act is to correcting America's maritime policy.\n\n  Not only did the group find a solution; they strongly support this \nlegislative conclusion. It demonstrates that when they work together, \nthe maritime industry can accomplish meaningful reform. Reform that is \ngood for America.\n  I hope we can build on this effort and achieve additional reform.\n  Before I go further, I want to pause and salute my friend and \ncolleague Senator Gorton for his participation in this reform effort. \nMr. Gorton is the author of the 1984 Act which this legislation is \namending. He fully recognizes that maritime reform is an incremental \nprocess because of the complexity of the interacting segments. His \nguidance was essential.\n  Senator Gorton has an amendment that affects the balance and the \ncompromise achieved by the bill and its manager's amendment. I am \nopposed to this amendment. I feel it is in our best interest to proceed \nwith Senator Hutchison's bill\n  Senator Hutchison has done an excellent job of advancing this needed \nmaritime reform. She is a sponsor of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, and \nits amendments. She will provide a response to why Senator Gorton's \nproposal should not be adopted.\n  I want to end by congratulating all of my Senate colleagues, on both \nsides of the aisle, for their efforts to advance this real maritime \nreform. Their staff's also worked hard on the Ocean Shipping Reform Act \nof 1998, and they too are a part of this successful effort.\n  I want to specifically point out Mr. James Sartucci of the Senate's \nCommerce Committee for his professional diligence and honest brokerage \nrespected by all sides of the debate. He has kept faith with all the \ngroups over the past three years. He was instrumental in making sure \nthe policy changes were coherent and fair to everyone. He worked in a \ntruly bipartisan manner which is a hallmark of why the Commerce \nCommittee consistently produces successful legislative solutions.\n  Mr. President, I now call upon the House of Representatives to \ncomplete the legislative process on maritime reform this year so the \nnation's consumers, businesses, and shipping industry can reap the \nbenefits of a reformed ocean liner system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to \nthe Gorton amendment No. 2287 occur at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, April 21, \nwith 20 minutes under the previous consent agreement commencing at 9:40 \na.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, elected upon a promise to eliminate \n``waste, fraud and abuse,'' President Ronald Reagan appointed the Grace \nCommission to root through the government, eliminating obsolete \nprograms and those whose costs exceeded their benefits. At the \nconclusion of its crusade the Grace Commission published a thick book \nentitled ``War on Waste.'' Ironically at that very moment the biggest \nwaste of all was being created--a soaring debt and wasteful interest \ncosts. Everyone with a credit card realizes there is no free lunch. The \namount you borrow must be paid back--plus interest costs on the amount \nborrowed. Government is no different. As the national debt increases, \ninterest costs compound and must be paid annually. Historically, \ninterest costs have not been a burden. From the beginning of the \nRepublic until 1981, borrowing of the United States for all government \nincluding the cost of all the wars from the Revolution through World \nWar II, Korea and Vietnam was less than one trillion dollars. And \ninterest cost was less than $100 million. But in the past 17 years \nwithout the cost of a war (Desert Storm paid for by the Kuwaitis and \nSaudis), the national debt has quintupled to $5.6 trillion; and \ninterest costs on the debt have increased to $365 billion a year. \nSpending of a billion a day for interest is added to the debt, \nincreasing the debt and increasing the spending for interest. With a \ngas tax, we obtain highways; with this interest ``tax,'' we get \nnothing. Waste!\n  Tragically, this waste goes unnoticed. This is intended. The scam is \nknown as the ``unified budget.'' The ``unified budget'' is not the \nactual income and spending of government. Rather it is the spending by \ngovernment beyond its income while reporting a smaller deficit by \nborrowing from the special purposes funds. Of course, this doesn't \nreduce the deficit; it just moves the deficit out of sight from general \ngovernment into these trust funds. For example, the actual deficit for \nFY 1998 as reported by the Congressional Budget Office is $153 billion. \nBut the President and Congress report a ``unified'' deficit of $7.7 \nbillion by borrowing $161 billion from various trust funds. \nAccordingly, we have created deficits in the following trust funds: \nSocial Security--$732 billion; Medicare--$146 billion; Military \nRetirement--$133 billion; Civilian Retirement--$460 billion; \nUnemployment Compensation--$72 billion; Highways--$23 billion; \nAirports--$10 billion; Railroad Retirement--$20 billion; All Others--\n$55 billion.\n  It should be emphasized that for Social Security this is against the \nlaw. In 1983, the Greenspan Commission called for a high payroll tax \nwith the intent of not just balancing the Social Security budget but to \nbuild a surplus to pay for the retirement of the baby boomers in the \nnext century. Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report called for \nthe Social Security Trust to be removed from the ``unified budget'' so \nthat the fund could remain solvent to the year 2056. Accordingly, \nPresident Bush signed Section 13301 of the Budget Act prohibiting the \nPresident or Congress from reporting a budget using Social Security \ntrust funds. But the President and the Congress continue to ignore the \nlaw. They do so with the sanction of the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Alan Greenspan and the financial world. Corporate America would \nrather government incur these horrendous deficits than come into the \nbond market with its sharp elbows, crowding out corporate finance and \nraising interest rates.\n  There's a difference between the corporate economy and the country's \neconomy. The corporate economy has as its goal higher profits. The \ncountry's economy has as its goal the good of society. For example, the \ncorporate economy reaps higher profits by moving its manufacture \noffshore to a low wage country. But the country's economy suffers from \na loss of manufacturing jobs.\n  A nation's strength rests as if upon a three-legged stool. The one \nleg of values is unquestioned: the United States readily sacrifices to \nfeed the hungry in Somalia and bring democracy to Haiti and Bosnia. The \nsecond leg of military strength is unquestioned. The third leg of \neconomic strength has become fractured. For 50 years we sacrificed our \neconomy in order to keep the alliance together in the Cold War. We \nwillingly gave up markets and manufacture. While today's industry is \ncompetitive, valuable high-paying manufacturing jobs have become \ndepleted. In the past 10 years, the United States has gone from 26% of \nits work force in manufacture to 13%. At a forum of Third World \ncountries, the former head of Sony, Akio Morita stated that the \nemerging countries must develop a strong manufacturing sector in order \nto become a nation state. And then Morita admonished, ``That world \npower which loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world \npower.'' Perhaps Morita had in mind the materials of basic production \nor defense. But more importantly manufacture is the job of the middle \nclass. As you lose your middle class, you lose the strength of \ndemocracy. Sure, employment is at an all-time high. But service and \npart-time jobs are replacing the high-paid manufacturing jobs. The \ncorporate economy wins, the country economy loses.\n\n  The North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico was an instrument \nof the corporate economy. Europe had long since abandoned the free \ntrade approach for that of the common market. For a common market, \nthere first must be developed entities of a free market such as \nproperty rights, labor rights, rights of appeal, a respected judiciary, \netc. The Europeans taxed themselves some $5 billion over four years, \nbuilding up these institutions of a free market in Greece and Portugal \nbefore joining in a trade treaty. Mexico has not developed these \ninstitutions. Ignoring experience, the corporate economy bulled its way \nfor NAFTA approval and the results are well known. Promised an increase \nof 200,000 jobs, the United States has lost 400,000. Promised an \nincrease in our balance of trade, the $5 billion plus balance has been \nreplaced by a $17 billion negative balance. Promised an improvement in \nthe drug problem, the drug problem has worsened. Promised a diminution \nin immigration from Mexico, it has increased. Even the Mexican worker \nhas suffered a 20% loss in take-home pay. The $12 billion that the \nUnited States has paid out in bail-out--the monies that could have \ninstalled the institutions of a free market--have gone back to Wall \nStreet. The corporate economy has benefitted with cheaper production in \nMexico. But the country's economy is weakened. South Carolina, with all \nof its new industry, has suffered a net loss of 14,000 manufacturing \njobs since NAFTA.\n  The ``unified budget'' that projects surpluses is a loser. When the \ncountry borrows from its trust funds, it really doesn't borrow; it just \nmoves the deficit out of sight. Corporate America could care less. They \ndon't have to pay the bills. They don't have to worry about the future \nof America. But we in public office do. A day of reckoning is at hand. \nAlready the biggest spending item in our budget is interest costs on \nthe national debt. Bigger than defense. Bigger than Social Security. \nAll waste. Should interest costs return to their normal rate of 10 \nyears ago, then by 2003, we will have to spend in excess of $500 \nbillion on interest charges--an annual waste of $500 billion. At that \ntime, we will owe Social Security and the pension funds over $2 \ntrillion. Forced to raise money for these obligations, Congress will be \nscrambling to find enough money for entitlements and a limited defense \nmuch less obligations. There will be little money left for general \ngovernment. At present, foreigners have been willing to buy the bonds, \nand lend the money to finance our deficits. In fact, they use their \nsubstantial holdings to leverage prevalence in trade negotiations by \nthreatening from time to time to sell. Fearful that this will increase \nrates, our negotiators give in. Now with the Pacific Rim economy in \nshambles, it shouldn't surprise anyone if they don't show up at the \nnext bond sales. Immediately, we would have higher interest rates. \nToday we have a foreign debt of $1.2 trillion. Already we have gone \nfrom the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor.\n  According to the CBO, the FY 1998 budget is in deficit $184.1 \nbillion. Instead of surpluses, CBO projects deficits for the next five \nyears for the sum total of $905 billion. But all across the land one \nhears shouts of ``Balanced Budgets'' and ``Surpluses as far as the eye \ncan see.'' We are wasting with fiscal cancer, But the American people \ndon't know. The media have put them to sleep with the ``unified \nbudget.''\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the passing of \nanother milestone by our esteemed Vice President and my good friend, Al \nGore. On March 31, the Vice President celebrated his fiftieth \nbirthday--in excellent humor and high spirits, I might add. Welcome to \nthe ``Over 50'' club, Mr. Vice President.\n  The passage of half a century of life is not a milestone everyone \nlikes to celebrate. I know, having passed my fiftieth six years ago. \nBut then again, I understand my colleague Senator Thurmond sent the \nVice President a birthday greeting in which Senator Thurmond pointed \nout that he was running for president when Al Gore was born. Senator \nThurmond will celebrate his 98th birthday in December.\n  Al Gore has always been a man of exceptional accomplishment and \ncharacter. His sense of wonder and enthusiasm for life is just as \npalpable today as it was years ago when we first met. There's no doubt \nhe has been one of the most effective Vice Presidents in the history of \nour nation and I have no doubt he will be equally as effective in \nwhatever future endeavors he chooses to pursue. I look forward to the \n21st century knowing the Vice President will be leading us there.\n  Trudie Feldman of the Free Press has penned a worthy tribute to the \nVice President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         [From the Free Press]\n\n               At 50, Al Gore Looks Forward To Year 2000\n\n                         (By Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       Albert Gore Jr.'s 1965 yearbook at St. Albans Episcopal \n     School for Boys in Washington, D.C., notes: ``It probably \n     won't be long before the popular and well-respected Al Gore \n     reaches the top . . . When he does, his classmates will \n     remark, `I knew that guy was going somewhere.' ''\n       Now, 33 years later, Mr. Gore is the 45th Vice President of \n     the United States, and in the year 2000, he expects to seek \n     the presidency.\n       On Tuesday, Mr. Gore will be 50 years old, and in a \n     birthday interview, he told me, ``I feel no sense of dread \n     about turning 50--at least, not yet. Each decade of my life \n     has been better than the previous one. As time goes on, I \n     enjoy life more. I'm amazed at how much I learn each day.''\n       What motivates the vice president?\n       ``The job itself motivates me, and there is much \n     satisfaction in it,'' he reflects. ``What the president and I \n     do now has tremendous potential to help bring about a better \n     world for our children and grandchildren.''\n       Sitting in his White House office for the 45-minute \n     exclusive interview, Mr. Gore, whose youthful zest for life \n     belies his chronological age, is hearty and fit.\n       His voice grows softer and he looks back on his 50 years.\n       ``I have the same enthusiasm for life that I had 25 years \n     ago,'' he says. ``Meaningful, hard work has always been an \n     important part of my life. I try to maximize the use of every \n     minute, and I'm frustrated by inefficiencies that waste \n     time.''\n       Because of his ever-demanding schedule, he admits to \n     irritation when there isn't sufficient time or preparation \n     for the day's agenda. The key to his energy and strength of \n     purpose, he says, is that he takes good care of himself, \n     nurtures his family and maintains a healthful perspective and \n     positive outlook.\n       How has the vice presidency matured Mr. Gore?\n       ``Maturity results from attending to the level of \n     difficulty demanded by the decisions that must be made in the \n     White House--by the president, and often by me and others,'' \n     he responds. ``That level exceeds by several orders of \n     magnitude the decisions that need to be made in nearly any \n     other setting.\n\n\n                         far-reaching decisions\n\n       ``For instance, life and death may sometimes hang in the \n     balance in the decisions we make in the White House--and \n     possibly on a grand scale, profoundly affecting the future of \n     the United States as well as the world. On any given day, \n     there may be several far-reaching and complex decisions to be \n     made. The burden falls primarily on the president, but when \n     he asks me for advice and analyses, I share that burden. \n     These conflicting and sensitive issues test a persons' mental \n     and physical stamina.''\n       What most surprises Mr. Gore is the multiplicity of issues \n     which he and the president must tackle simultaneously.\n       ``Before working at the White House, I imagined that one \n     would have the luxury of resolving a world-class problem \n     before going on to the next one,'' he says. ``But the reality \n     is that the problems come in twos, threes, fours and fives. \n     It is an arduous, but invaluable, maturing experience.''\n       Mr. Gore and the president eat lunch in the Oval Office \n     once a week when only the two discuss the vast array of \n     matters.\n       ``We have a unique relationship,'' Mr. Gore says. ``Each \n     day we talk frequently, and on particular problems, I give \n     him my candid judgment. The president's stamina, \n     extraordinary capacity for work, and insightfulness inspire \n     me. I see, up close, his dedication to the job, and I marvel \n     at his ability to articulate--with practical policies--his \n     understanding of our citizenry.''\n       As for the impact the campaign finance hearings are having \n     on Mr. Gore, he says, ``Going through this sometimes trying \n     period has matured me as a leader. It has called upon my \n     ability to focus on the people's business, even while being \n     subjected to sharp, often unwarranted attacks. As a result, I \n     have developed a thicker skin.''\n       Given the relentless attempts at character assassination, \n     why does Mr. Gore want to remain in public life?\n       ``Public service is the path I've chosen, and I am \n     committed to it,'' he says, ``Accepting the downside is as \n     necessary as accepting the enormous satisfactions in helping \n     to move American in the right direction.\n       ``As for handling personal attacks, I draw from experience \n     in journalism, and I try to avoid taking the criticism \n     personally. Reporters and editors have jobs to do. Some do \n     them well, some less well. After three national campaigns, 16 \n     years in Congress and five years in the White House, I \n     recognize the ebb and flow of criticism and know how to keep \n     it all in perspective. What endures is who you really are, \n     what you really believe in, and what and how you apply your \n     efforts. As the president and I move toward our goals, we \n     expect to make a dent in the prevalent cynicism regarding its \n     leaders.\n       The vice president is convinced that the international \n     community is hungry for both civility and spiritual revival.\n       Asksed whether he is concerned about the present decline in \n     the civility, he responds, ``Yes, I think there is an \n     increase in factionalism and a new intensity of acrimony in \n     many of the critiques aimed at the president and me. Perhaps, \n     from their perspective, Republicans feel the same. In \n     previous periods of American history, there might have been \n     times when partisan bitterness was even greater. For the \n     modern era, the current level of vitriol seems \n     unprecedented.''\n\n\n                        dangers of factionalism\n\n       He adds: ``Our founders, particularly James Madison, warned \n     against the dangers of factionalism. In some ways, the impact \n     of television and the Internet on the news media may make our \n     system more vulnerable to this poison. Political leaders need \n     to tone down the level of antipathy that has been creeping \n     into our national debates. In fact, I'm now working on how to \n     address this problem.''\n       If the vice president could relive his 50 years, he says he \n     would not change anything in his personal life, except for \n     the year 1989. While many people consider reaching 50 the \n     turning point in their lives, for Al Gore, that turning point \n     was in April 1989, when his then 7-year-old son, Albert III, \n     was struck by a car while leaving a Baltimore Orioles \n     baseball game. (He sustained a broken leg, broken ribs and \n     damage to his internal organs.)\n       Mr. Gore recalls ``The accident, which almost claimed my \n     son's life, brought home to me in a sudden, overwhelming way \n     the sense of temporality one associates with life's turning \n     points.\n       Now 15, Albert is fully recovered, and one of his fathers \n     greatest joys is attending athletic events in which his son \n     participates.\n       Mr. Gore, whose controlled demeanor is often interpreted as \n     aloofness, is actually friendly and compassionate. He even \n     admits to a sentimental streak, and he was recently moved by \n     the movie Titanic and its reminder of the uncertainties and \n     brevity of life.\n       Mr. Gore runs or jogs some 20 to 25 miles a week, when he \n     is not training for longer races. In addition to running laps \n     around his residence, he often jobs when he travels. Walking, \n     jogging, hiking, bicycling and swimming, he says, have \n     replaced more risky exercise such as full-court basketball, \n     which led to a torn Achilles tendon three years ago.\n       ``My long recuperation on crutches,'' he adds, ``taught me \n     to leave the slam dunks to younger people.''\n       Nevertheless, in the recent Marine Corps Marathon--in a \n     steady rain--he ran the entire 26 miles with two of his \n     daughters, Karenna, 24, and Kristin, 20.\n       ``It was a first-time marathon for the three of us,'' he \n     notes. ``We'll never forget that rich experience, and I \n     consider it a personal milestone. As exhausted as I was at \n     the finish--over four hours later--I had a tremendous sense \n     of accomplishment. And as a father, it was a delight to have \n     my daughters each slow down, to run alongside me, encouraging \n     me to finish. I might have missed the marathon but for their \n     insistence that I train for, and enter it.''\n       Perhaps the only American vice president to run in and \n     complete a marathon, Mr. Gore points to the connection \n     between good physical and mental health.\n       ``Jogging helps me to cope with the pressures of my job,'' \n     he says. ``If I'm able to run for some two hours, I use the \n     time to think through whatever is on my mind.''\n       Citing one example, Mr. Gore says that when he addressed \n     congregants at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on Dr. \n     Martin Luther King's birthday in January, he was able, while \n     jogging earlier, to clarify his message. And during his \n     remarks that day, he proposed--as part of the President's \n     Initiative on Race--the largest single increase in the \n     enforcement of civil rights laws in 20 years.\n       Al Gore was born in Washington, D.C.'s Columbia Hospital \n     for Women, and he grew up\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\n     in the nation's capital, where he cut his political teeth. He \n     can remember sitting on then-Vice President Richard Nixon's \n     lap during a Senate session he attended with his father, then \n     a U.S. Senator from Tennessee.\n       Mr. Gore also spent some of his formative years on the \n     family farm in Carthage, Tenn., where his chores included \n     grooming cattle and feeding chickens. (That farm is where he \n     will join his parents for a birthday get-together Tuesday \n     morning. Later, he will return to Washington for a festive \n     celebration with other family members and friends.)\n       Mr. Gore began a career in journalism in the U.S. Army when \n     he was stationed near Saigon, South Vietnam, and wrote for \n     The Brigade. Back home, he was a general assignment writer \n     for The Tennessean in Nashville. During some six years there, \n     he covered the police beat; wrote obituaries, features and \n     editorials; and was an investigator reporter.\n       The unusual actions of politicians, who were the subject of \n     his investigations, stimulated his curiosity, and soon the \n     dynamics of how politicians make decisions became of interest \n     to him.\n       ``In journalism, I learned how to gather information and \n     communicate it,'' he says. ``I soon became confident that I \n     could better serve the country in the political arena. Rather \n     than reporting on the need for change, I wanted to help bring \n     it about. So in 1976, after intense but brief consideration, \n     I ran for Congress from Tennessee's Fourth District.''\n       Elected at age 28, Rep. Gore soon emerged as a forceful \n     proponent of consumer rights. He was also involved in \n     groundbreaking investigative hearings. But he was most proud \n     of his work in bringing about legislation requiring that \n     infant formula sold in the United States meet certain \n     nutritional and safety standards.\n       When Tennessee's Sen. Howard Baker retired in 1984, Rep. \n     Gore won Sen. Baker's seat and became active in science, \n     technology and defense issues. He led a six-year effort to \n     link school and research centers with America's most powerful \n     computers on a high-speed ``Information Superhighway'' and is \n     credited with coining that phrase.\n       While Mr. Gore has had few regrets over the past 50 years, \n     he allows that there have been some harsh words he'd like to \n     retract.\n       ``When I think if the unkind words that have passed my \n     lips, with few exceptions, I wish I could take them back,'' \n     he says. ``On the other hand, I feel I've had more than my \n     share of blessings. I'm blessed with a wonderful wife who has \n     been a salvation for me in many ways. Tipper and I have known \n     each other since we were teen-agers. We have grown, learned \n     and changed as we matured together, and she has taught me \n     more about life than anyone else.\n       ``If people think I'm stiff now, they should have seen me \n     before she worked me over--evidently, not enough yet.''\n       (Mrs. Gore recently led the U.S. presidential delegation to \n     the Winter Olympics in Japan, accompanied by Albert III and \n     Karenna. Daughter Sarah 19, was unable to miss her classes at \n     Harvard.)\n\n\n                             Joy of family\n\n       Mr. Gore went on to describe their four children as a \n     source of joy for Tipper and him. ``Each child is a blessing \n     beyond measure,'' he says. ``I'm also blessed with caring \n     parents who provided me with a generous set of opportunities \n     and the encouragement and confidence . . . that I could \n     achieve on my own.''\n       He credits his mother, Pauline, a former attorney; and his \n     father Albert Sr., with instilling in him a respect for \n     principles and values that still motivates him.\n       ``My parents were wise and firm in raising me and my older \n     sister, Nancy,'' he remembers. ``They endowed us with \n     spiritual strength and the kind of security that comes with \n     steady parental affection and guidance. The way they treated \n     us and each other had a profound influence on me.''\n       Mr. Gore also recalls that his parents taught, by deed as \n     well as by word, that discrimination and prejudice are sins \n     that should not be condoned.\n       He vividly recalls that, as an 8-year-old, he lived in a \n     small house, halfway up a hill, near a mansion. On the day \n     that property changed hands, the neighbors were invited to an \n     ``open house.''\n       ``In the mansion's basement, my father pointed to the dark, \n     dank stone walls, and the cold metal rings in a row, and \n     explained that they had been used as slave rings,'' Mr. Gore \n     remembers.\n\n\n                           horror of slavery\n\n       ``To this day, I have an image of the horror those rings \n     represented,'' he says. ``That experience helped shape my \n     sensitivities to the extremes of racism.\n       ``Now, we must work harder to banish racist behavior. It \n     diminishes those who practice it as well as those who suffer \n     from it.''\n       Spirituality is an integral part of Mr. Gore's makeup. \n     After graduating from Harvard university, he was ``open to \n     the call'' of becoming a minister, and he enrolled in \n     Vanderbilt University's School of Divinity.\n       ``I was eager,'' he recalls, ``to study in a structured, \n     disciplined way the questions--`What is the purpose of life? \n     What are our duties to God? What is the nature of humankind?'\n       ``I didn't find all the answers I sought, but I continued \n     to study. While my own Christian tradition has been the \n     bedrock of answers for me, I studied other traditions and \n     felt enriched by them as well.''\n       Asked to describe the difference he made in the past five \n     years, Mr. Gore puts it this way:\n       ``The closeness of my partnership with the president serves \n     the people in many ways. Because I retain his confidence, I \n     am able to advise him on virtually every policy matter, and \n     at his request, to take the lead in some of the \n     initiatives.''\n       For example, Mr. Gore is involved in improving the \n     management of the Internal Revenue Service, and he says the \n     new IRS commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, selected for his \n     management and systems analysis skills, will make the IRS \n     more people-oriented and bring the computers up to date.\n       According to Sheldon S. Cohen, IRS commissioner in the \n     Johnson administration, Mr. Gore is working for a more \n     ``user-friendly'' government and supports Commissioner \n     Rossotti's two priorities: to modernize the computer system \n     and to enhance the taxpayers' rights.\n       Mr. Rossotti says that in the five years Mr. Gore has been \n     at the helm of reinventing government, he steered a course \n     that will help renew the people's faith in government to \n     provide quality services.\n       ``The vice president's visions and goals are woven \n     throughout our new report on the IRS,'' Mr. Rossotti adds. \n     ``He wants every taxpayer treated with fairness, and to \n     ensure that the IRS provides services that are consistently \n     as good as those in the private sector.''\n\n\n                           women's well-being\n\n       Turning to the needs of women and their well-being, Mr. \n     Gore says that they are major consumers of health care and \n     decision-makers for their families.\n       ``Yet,'' he adds, ``there is evidence of unequal treatment \n     of women in our health care system. Women are less likely to \n     be referred to specialists, and three times as likely to be \n     told their medical condition is `all in their head.'\n       ``I have started to address these issues through the \n     `Patient's Bill of Rights' and with the American Medical \n     Association.''\n       He says that now that the AMA has a woman as president, she \n     will undoubtedly help raise awareness of health issues of \n     particular concern to women.\n       (Dr. Nancy Dickey is the first female president of the AMA \n     in its 151-year history.)\n       Al Gore often demonstrates that he places more value in the \n     power of knowledge than in the knowledge of power. This, he \n     maintains, is the cornerstone of his leadership philosophy.\n       ``I follow this approach whether the issue is nuclear \n     disarmament, organ transplants, global warming or \n     telecommunications,'' he adds. ``I study a subject until I \n     thoroughly master it. Only then do I begin to formulate \n     appropriate policy initiatives.''\n       Mr. Gore's diligence was attested to by President Clinton \n     when he recently disclosed to a Florida audience that he and \n     the vice president do not always agree, but that their \n     disagreements are among the most thought-provoking of his \n     presidency.\n       ``And when I disagree with him,'' the president remarked, \n     ``I make sure I have my facts straight.''\n       How will Mr. Gore's 50-year milestone affect the way he \n     lives the remainder of his life?\n       ``I don't imagine it will have any significant impact in \n     and of itself,'' he said. ``But any time you pause and take \n     stock of your life, you are able to clarify the vision you \n     have for the future.''\n       That vision is apparent in what Al Gore wishes for this \n     milestone.\n       ``As I reach my 50th year, I am content,'' the vice \n     president said. ``So my birthday wish is that every person be \n     blessed with a renewed spirit of goodwill and that we all \n     work together for freedom and peace in a world where kindness \n     and justice prevail.''\n       Asked how he wants to be remembered, Mr. Gore told me, \n     ``I'd like to be remembered as someone who made a very \n     positive difference for our country and as one who helped \n     create a brighter future for humanity.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3215-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3217-S3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. ROTH:\n       S. 1931.

By temporarily suspending the imposition of \nduties, these bills will reduce significantly the cost of coloring \nmaterials that are used in a wide variety of finished products, \nincluding automotive parts, vinyl flooring, carpet fibers and utensils.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, together with my California colleague, \nSenator Barbara Boxer, I rise today to introduce legislation to \neliminate tariffs for twenty-one chemical compounds. These compounds \nare components of certain AIDS and cancer drugs. For the benefit of my \ncolleagues who may be called upon to consider the legislation, I want \nto describe our concerns and urge their support.\n\n  The AIDS and cancer drug chemical compounds will be entitled to \nreceive a zero tariff when a revised international agreement \neliminating tariffs for pharmaceutical products goes into effect in \nJanuary 2000.\n  Until then, however, the compounds could face a tariff of between six \nand twelve percent, raising costs for patients and their families and \ndiscouraging the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical products in this \ncountry. The legislation we introduce today would eliminate the tariff, \nproviding the same zero tariff provided by the WTO agreement.\n  The list of specific pharmaceutical products which are entitled to \nreceive the zero tariff is only updated every three years through the \nWTO negotiations. Drugs which are not approved by an agency of a \nfederal government, like the FDA in the United States, cannot be \nincluded in the negotiations. Without formal federal approval by one of \nthe governments, the drug cannot be included in the negotiations until \nthe next round of negotiations, perhaps as much as three years later. \nThis is unfair for those pharmaceutical products experiencing delays in \nthe FDA approval process or whose approval does not match up with the \nnegotiating timeline.\n  The international community, through the World Trade Organization, \ncommitted to eliminate tariffs for pharmaceutical products. This \nagreement will help ensure that individuals around the world get the \nmedicine they need, reducing drug costs by eliminating the tariff. \nOtherwise, the pharmaceutical products would be subject to a 6-12% \ntariff before they could be brought into the United States.\n  In 1996, the administration agreed to treat certain chemical \ncompounds as if they were an approved pharmaceutical product, in order \nto provide the zero tariff for an AIDS drug produced by a San Diego \npharmaceutical company which was awaiting FDA ``fast track'' approval. \nThis drug later received its formal FDA approval, becoming the first \nAIDS drug approved for children's use. However, as a result of changes \nto the manufacturing process, a different set of chemical compounds are \nnow used, which are not eligible for the zero tariff. This tariff \nlegislation would extend the zero tariff for these replacement chemical \ncompounds as well.\n  Last year, the administration completed negotiations for the update \nround, revising the list of drugs eligible to claim the zero tariff. \nThe administration agreed to incorporate twenty-one chemical compounds, \nwhich are constituents of an AIDS or cancer drugs, into agreement. As a \nresult, these chemical compounds will receive a zero tariff when the \nWTO agreement goes into effect in January 2000. Until then, however, \nthe AIDS and cancer chemicals remain subject to US tariffs.\n  The legislation we introduce would suspend the tariff until the \ninternational agreement goes into effect in 2000. These chemical \ncompounds have been added to the zero tariff international agreement, \nbut we should take off the tariff now to speed up the development of \nthe AIDS and cancer drugs.\n  These chemicals are not available in the United States from domestic \nmanufacturers and are not used for other products. Consequently, the \nzero tariff does not undermine domestic chemical manufacturers. In \nfact, these chemicals\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\neligibility for the zero tariff has been reviewed and approved by the \nchemical industry advisory committee, which advises the administration \non trade policy.\n\n  This legislation only reduces the tariff for these chemical compounds \nthat will receive a zero tariff under the international agreement. The \nzero tariff for these chemical compounds has, literally, been approved \nby both the United States and the international negotiators.\n  In 1996, the administration completed negotiations to confer \neligibility for the zero tariff adopt a zero tariff for pharmaceutical \nproducts. At the time, the administration agreed to add certain \nchemicals, used to prepare an AIDS drug which was awaiting approval by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. The administration's decision treats \nthe chemicals as if they were a fully approved product.\n  We must do everything we can to find a cure for HIV/AIDS and cancer. \nHowever, until we have a cure for this urgent health priority, we need \nto find effective treatments and put them in the hands of people with \nneeds. By eliminating the tariff, we eliminate one more hurdle in \ngetting the product to the patients and their families. These \nprovisions will help accelerate the manufacturing and final testing for \nnew drugs and deserves the full support of Congress.\n  Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are \nentitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero \ntariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their \nchemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals would be ineligible \nfor the pharmaceutical zero tariff.\n  The administration indicate the chemicals present no risk for law \nenforcement or anti-narcotics enforcement. The chemical industry \nadvisory committee, an industry group which advises the US Trade \nRepresentative on trade issues, has also reviewed and supported the \nzero tariff.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky and the Administration deserve tremendous \ncredit for extending the zero tariff for these chemical components \nthrough international negotiations. As a matter of public policy, we \nshould do everything in our power to develop effective AIDS and cancer \ndrugs and treatments and ensure that drugs are made available as \nswiftly and at as low a cost as possible. We simply cannot delay or \nwaste time in providing drugs, treatments or materials needed to fight \nthese diseases. This tariff legislation represents a modest, but \nimportant, step.\n  The Senate Finance Committee is currently developing miscellaneous \ntariff legislation, a bill which will include a variety of non-\ncontroversial tariff measures introduced by Finance Committee members. \nI would like to have this legislation incorporated by the Finance \nCommittee, which would permit the acceleration of drug production, \nproviding more timely relief for the public. The legislation is \nexpected to have only a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. However, \nfor AIDS and cancer patients, their families and those at risk, the \nimpact may be profound. Congress should take this opportunity to reduce \ntariffs for these chemical compounds.\n  Without this legislation to remove the tariff, we will be tolerating \nneedless hurdles and delay, rather than expediting relief. Patients and \ntheir families do not have time to wait for the next round of drugs to \nbe approved and added to the zero-tariff list. By importing the \nchemical compounds without a tariff, we can accelerate the drug \ndevelopment process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation introduced today be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1936\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide regulatory assistance to small business \nconcerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                small business regulatory assistance act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Small Business \nRegulatory Assistance Act. Joining me as co-sponsors of this \nlegislation are Senators Dorgan, Chafee, Leahy, Kerrey, D'Amato, \nMurkowski, Roberts, and Helms.\n  Complying with complex and overlapping federal regulations is time-\nconsuming and costly for any business, but small businesses bear a \ndisproportionate burden. Given their limited resources, small \nbusinesses need all the help they can get when it comes to complying \nwith environmental, tax, and workplace safety regulations. Yet small \nbusinesses rarely turn to the regulatory agencies for assistance, \neither out of fear of punishment or because help isn't available.\n  This legislation would use the existing network of Small Business \nDevelopment Centers (SBDCs)--over 950 nationwide and serving 600,000 \nbusinesses annually--to provide small businesses with non-punitive, \nconfidential regulatory information and assistance. The SBDC network \ncurrently offers business expertise to growing firms, yet information \nand assistance needed to comply with EPA, OSHA, and IRS rules is often \nunavailable to these small firms.\n  The legislation authorizes SBDCs to develop compliance guidelines in \nconjunction with these federal agencies and then use that information \nto educate small businesses on regulatory compliance. With this \ninformation, businesses will be able to follow important environmental, \nsafety, and tax laws, and the government will spend fewer resources on \ncostly enforcement measures.\n  This bill is pro-small business and pro-compliance. It will help \nsmall firms develop practical business solutions to regulatory \ncompliance problems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3218-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3222-S3223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 40\n\n  At the request of Mr. Faircloth, the name of the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) was added as a cosponsor of S. 40, a bill to \nprovide Federal sanctions for practitioners who administer, dispense, \nor recommend the use of marihuana, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1031\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hutchinson) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1031, a bill to protect \nFederal law enforcement officers who intervene in certain situations to \nprotect life or prevent bodily injury.\n\n\n                                S. 1251\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Reed) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1251, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount of private \nactivity bonds which may be issued in each State, and to index such \namount for inflation.\n\n\n                                S. 1252\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1252, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the amount of low-income \nhousing credits which may be allocated in each State, and to index such \namount for inflation.\n\n\n                                S. 1254\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Oregon (Mr. \nWyden) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1254, a bill to provide a \nprocedure for the submission to Congress of proposals for, and permit \nupon subsequent enactment of law, assumption of management authority \nover certain federal lands by States and nonprofit organizations;

Con. Res. 89\n\n         \n       Whereas the future of our Nation and world will be \n     determined by the young people of today;\n       Whereas record levels of youth crime, violence, teenage \n     pregnancy, and substance abuse indicate a growing moral \n     crisis in our society;\n       Whereas a recent poll of teachers found that 45 percent of \n     all students cheat on tests;\n       Whereas character development is the long-term process of \n     helping young people to know, care about, and act upon such \n     basic values as trustworthiness, respect for self and others, \n     responsibility, fairness, compassion, and citizenship;\n       Whereas these values are universal, reaching across \n     cultural and religious differences;\n       Whereas a recent poll found that 90 percent of Americans \n     support the teaching of core moral and civic values;\n       Whereas parents will always be children's primary character \n     educators;\n       Whereas good moral character is developed best in the \n     context of the family;\n       Whereas parents, community leaders, and school officials \n     are establishing successful partnerships across the Nation to \n     implement character education programs;\n       Whereas character education programs also ask parents, \n     faculty, and staff to serve as role models of core values, to \n     provide opportunities for young people to apply these values, \n     and to establish high academic standards that challenge \n     students to set high goals, work to achieve them, and \n     persevere in spite of difficulty;\n       Whereas the development of virtue and moral character, \n     those habits of mind, heart, and spirit that help young \n     people to know, desire, and do what is right, has \n     historically been a primary mission of colleges and \n     universities;\n       Whereas in recent years the emphasis on developing the \n     moral character of students has steadily declined in our \n     colleges and universities as students are increasingly viewed \n     as consumers in the marketplace rather than citizens \n     participating in a democracy;\n       Whereas print resources that recognize colleges and \n     universities according to emphasis of character development \n     as an essential component of higher education are available \n     to students, parents, and high school counselors;\n       Whereas many of these resources are available in public \n     libraries and in public and private high schools across the \n     Nation; and\n       Whereas the Congress encourages parents, faculty, and staff \n     across the Nation to emphasize character development in the \n     home, in the community, in our schools, and in our colleges \n     and universities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress supports and encourages \n     character building initiatives in schools across America and \n     urges colleges and universities to affirm that the \n     development of character is one of the primary goals of \n     higher education.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe it is important that we put \ncharacter back into our vocabulary. The American people are crying out \nfor virtue and values--character is critical and we must focus our \nefforts in extending this message.\n  I have been a faithful co-sponsor of the Character Counts movement, \nwhich seeks to teach the core elements of good character to our \nnation's young people.\n  I am pleased to submit a resolution in the Senate to expand this \nmessage to our nation's institutions of higher education. Specifically, \nI am submitting a concurrent resolution expressing that it is the sense \nof the Congress that the Nation must place greater emphasis on helping \nyoung Americans to develop habits of good character that are essential \nto their own well-being and to that of our communities.\n  I believe that we should encourage parents, faculty, and staff across \nthe Nation to emphasize character development in our homes, in our \ncommunities, in our schools, and in our colleges and universities. \nCongress should support and encourage character building initiatives in \nschools across American and urge colleges and universities to affirm \nthat the development of character is one of the primary goals of higher \neducation.\n  This concurrent resolution has already been submitted in the House of \nRepresentatives by a member of the Tennessee congressional delegation, \nCongressman Bob Clement. I am proud to note that it has received \nbipartisan support. It is a privilege for me to submit this concurrent \nresolution in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3223-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GORTON AMENDMENT NO. 2287\n\n  Mr. GORTON proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1689 proposed by \nMrs. Hutchison to the bill, S. 414, to amend the Shipping Act of 1984 \nto encourage competition in international shipping and growth of United \nStates imports and exports, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 10, strike ``ocean''.\n       On page 5, line 15, strike ``ocean''.\n       On page 11, line 16, strike ``ocean''.\n       On page 12, line 8, strike ``ocean''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3223-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3223-S3224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COVERDELL AMENDMENT NO. 2269\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to commend my friend \nfrom Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for offering this excellent amendment \nlast evening.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to curb wasteful military spending. I \nam a co-sponsor.\n  This amendment contains a very important message. It sends this \nsignal: Pay a fair market value for what you buy. We hope the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) will be guided by this common sense \nprinciple in the coming year when it starts spending all the money \nprovided for in this resolution. Unfortunately, that may not happen.\n  Two recent reports issued by the Inspector General at the Defense \nDepartment undermine our confidence in DOD's ability to get a handle on \nthe problem. These two reports provide details on the latest round of \nspare parts ``horror stories'' at the Pentagon. They were presented by \nthe Inspector General (IG), Ms. Eleanor Hill, at a hearing before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on March 18, 1998.\n  The IG's testimony and reports are the motivating force behind our \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the story presented by the Inspector General on March \n18th was not new. In fact, it's the same old story about spare parts \noverpricing that we have heard so many times before. It's a carbon copy \nof what we witnessed back in the 1980's. First came the revelations \nabout the $450.00 hammer and the $640.09 toilet seat. Then came the \nassurances from all the Pentagon bureaucrats: ``Don't worry,'' they \nsaid. ``We already have a fix in place.''\n  History has repeatedly proven that those promises were worthless. \nThey were empty promises. And history is about to repeat itself--again. \nThere's no reform in sight.\n  The IG has brought new spare parts horror stories to light, and the \nbureaucrats are already promising that ``corrective actions'' are in \nplace. Problem solved, right? Wrong! Unless DOD's corrective action has \nsome teeth--and\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\nthere is some accountability for the mess, there will be more horror \nstories somewhere down the road. I guarantee it.\n  Mr. President, the only way to stop these kinds of waste procurement \npractices is with accountability. Some heads should roll at the \nPentagon. Those responsible for the policies governing spare parts \npurchases should be identified and disciplined.\n  I wrote to Secretary of Defense Cohen on March 20th, asking him to \nconsider the need for accountability in the latest round of spare parts \nhorror stories. I am still waiting for a response.\n  This amendment sends a message over to the Pentagon. It's only a \nmessage but a very important message: This kind of waste must be \nbrought to a screeching halt. We must find a way to fix it for good.\n  And it sets the stage for the debate over the Defense Reform \nInitiative that will take place later this year. That measure will be \nconsidered when we take up the defense authorization bill for FY 1999. \nI am hoping there will be some specific proposals offered--at that \ntime--to bring some lasting reform to the way DOD buys spare parts.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia \nfor sending the right message to the Pentagon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3223-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH P. KENNEDY II UPON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, several days ago, our colleague in \nthe other body, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, announced his \nretirement after 12 years of service. Representative Kennedy has been a \ntremendous advocate on behalf of the nation's working families, and I \nwant to take this opportunity to say a few words about my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Joe Kennedy has brought an uncommon enthusiasm and an intensity to \nhis work here in the Congress. As a member of the Committee on Banking \nand Financial Services, he mastered the arcane details of banking, \ninsurance, securities, and housing law to achieve great success in \nreforming our nation's financial institutions to be more responsive to \nthe needs of working families.\n  In 1989, he authored amendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act \nand the Community Reinvestment Act. These amendments have been \nresponsible for leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to \nhelp people of modest means purchase a home.\n  As the Chairman of the former Subcommittee on Consumer Credit and \nInsurance, he worked on legislation to reform the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct, so that consumers will be better protected from unwarranted uses \nof their most private financial information and will have a greater \nability to safeguard the confidentiality and accuracy of that \ninformation.\n  More recently, as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Housing and \nCommunity Opportunity, he has continued to champion affordable housing \nfor the elderly and others on fixed incomes. Thanks to his efforts, \nmany more Americans own a home and have a decent, affordable place to \nlive.\n  Congressman Kennedy has distinguished himself in other ways, as well. \nHe has been a consistent and articulate voice for peace and justice in \nplaces like Northern Ireland, Haiti, and the Mexican state of Chiapas. \nHe has been a staunch supporter of civil rights for women, the \ndisabled, and minorities. He has also worked hard to balance our \nnation's budget without compromising our commitment to protect our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  Prior to his election to the House, Congressman Kennedy built a \nsuccessful company that provides low-cost heating oil and other \nservices to low and moderate income Americans. It is to that company \nthat he will soon return.\n  I have no doubt that although he is leaving public office, Joe \nKennedy will continue to serve the public interest. I know I speak for \nmany of my colleagues in wishing him and his family well in this new \nendeavor, and in saying that, we in the Congress will miss his vitality \nand vision of a more just and prosperous America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3224-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL GEORGE R. STERNER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Vice Admiral \nGeorge R. Sterner, United States Navy, who will retire on May 1st upon \ncompleting 36 years of faithful service to our nation.\n  During his distinguished career, Vice Admiral Sterner played a \nsignificant role in reshaping the way the Navy develops, acquires, \nmodernizes, and maintains its ships and systems so that our Sailors and \nMarines have the best equipment in the world at an affordable price.\n  Vice Admiral Sterner's career began in 1962 upon his commissioning as \nan Ensign in the United States Navy. During the years that followed, he \nserved aboard four submarines and commanded two others. His shore \nassignments included duty on the staff of the Commander in Chief, \nUnited States Atlantic Fleet; Branch Head for submarine tactical \nweapons on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations; Program Manager \nfor the Mark 48 Advanced Capability Torpedo; and Program Executive \nOfficer for Submarine Combat and Weapons Systems.\n  After serving in two senior Naval Sea Systems Command positions, Vice \nAdmiral Sterner took charge of this organization on April 25, 1994. As \nCommander of the largest of the five Navy Systems Commands, Vice \nAdmiral Sterner re-energized an agency in turmoil as a result the \nlargest restructuring since World War II. Managing a budget of \napproximately $14 billion annually and managing more than 180 \nacquisition programs, he has been a responsible steward of taxpayer \ndollars while insuring that we have technically-superb, world-class \nnaval fleet.\n  As a testament to his dynamic leadership, the National Performance \nReview chose to honor him and his command with 27 Hammer Awards for \ncontributions to create a government that works better and costs less.\n  Closer to home, Vice Admiral Sterner has been a friend to the \ndedicated men and women who works at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. \nThanks in part to his vision, the Shipyard retains its important \nmilitary-industrial capabilities and continues to provide critical jobs \nfor the region.\n  Vice Admiral George Sterner's innovation has positioned the Naval Sea \nSystems Command for the 21st Century. He is an individual of uncommon \ncharacter and his professionalism will be sincerely missed. I am proud, \nMr. President, to thank him for his honorable service in the United \nStates Navy, and to wish him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he \ncloses his distinguished military career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3224-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3224-S3226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL POW RECOGNITION DAY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, April 9 is National POW \nRecognition Day, and I rise today to pay tribute to all those U.S. \nservice persons who guarded their country in past wars, who have been \nlisted as POWs or MIA, and to their families. I especially want to pay \ntribute to Col. Richard A. Walsh III, an Air force pilot from Minnesota \nlisted as missing-in-action in Laos. We must never forget Richard and \nthe other MIAs for their courageous service and sacrifices. In \naddition, we must never forget the sacrifices made by their families.\n  That is why I also want to recognize Richard's wife and a constituent \nof mine, Ms. Sharon Walsh. As the executive director of the Minnesota \nLeague of POW/MIA Families, Sharon has worked hard over the years on \nbehalf of our POW/MIAs and their families, and I commend her. I can't \nimagine how difficult and painful it has been for Sharon and her family \nnot knowing exacting what happened to Richard in Southeast Asia.\n  Ms. Walsh asked me to enter into the Congressional Record a document \noutlining some of her concerns and questions regarding the issue of \nsatellite imagery and American POW/MIAs during the war in Southeast \nAsia. She, along with a small group of my constituents, are frustrated \nwith certain federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. \nThese agencies are responsible for maintaining and publicly disclosing \ninformation about reported U.S. satellite imagery of possible pilot \ndistress symbols, associated with American service personnel who are \nunaccounted for in Southeast Asia.\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\nThe statement contains serious allegations about U.S. government \nmishandling of these matters. My constituents claim that since the war \nhas ended U.S. satellite imagery has detected pilot distress symbols on \nthe ground in Southeast Asia, and the U.S. government has willfully \nignored key evidence in this matter. The Department of Defense POW/MIA \noffice has repeatedly indicated to me, and in the media, that they have \nfully and carefully investigated these claims and found them baseless, \nattributing the reported symbols to unrelated, largely natural causes, \nand to mistakes in photographic interpretation of satellite imagery.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the material from Ms. Walsh be printed in \nthe Record. I know this issue has been addressed by Pentagon officials \nfor years, and was carefully studied by the now-defunct Senate Select \nCommittee on POW/MIA Affairs. Nonetheless, I promised my constituents \nto share this information with my colleagues, for the record, at an \nappropriate time. I believe POW Recognition Day is an appropriate \noccasion for us to consider these issues, and I hope it will contribute \nto any further discussion of these matters in the Senate.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                           Minnesota League of\n\n                                                 POW/MIA Families.\n       I am Sharon Walsh, Minneapolis, Minnesota, the wife of \n     Richard A. Walsh III Colonel, USAF, a pilot who is or was \n     missing in action in Laos. I represent the League of \n     Minnesota Families of Missing and Prisoners in Southeast \n     Asia.\n       This letter and the enclosed referenced documents document \n     the betrayal of branches of the U.S. government toward \n     America's missing personnel in the war in Southeast Asia. In \n     my lifetime, I cannot recall such disregard and callous \n     behavior toward young men who thought they represented an \n     honorable government. Actually it is criminal felonious \n     purposeful malfeasance in government that many of us find \n     shocking.\n       In 1992, U.S. satellites recorded symbols on the ground in \n     Southeast Asia exactly matched rescue codes assigned to \n     pilots missing in the Vietnam War. Other symbols exactly \n     matched names of POW/MIA pilots.\n       The official U.S. government explanation is these symbols \n     were created by vegetation and shadows and it is a \n     coincidence they match names and classified codes of MIAs. It \n     does not take a mathematical probability expert to realize \n     the absurdity of the government story.\n       Government officials have committed both unethical and \n     illegal acts to misinform the nation about the satellite \n     imagery. However, the existence of enough of these rescue \n     symbols are verified in government documents to show the U.S. \n     is now an accomplice to slavery and torture of human beings. \n     The documents Senator Wellstone is introducing into the \n     Congressional Record show exactly how the government has lied \n     and mislead the public, the press, and the Congress.\n       I urge every member of Congress who believes in the \n     principles of liberty and justice to carefully examine these \n     documents. The precedents of the POW/MIA issue--rewarding the \n     corrupt and punishing the truthful, must be reversed if we \n     are to survive as a free and democratic society. In the name \n     of justice, please act swiftly to remove and prosecute those \n     government officials who have betrayed both the missing men \n     and our nation.\n       Thank You,\n                                                     Sharon Walsh,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Chronological Table Illustrating Fraudulent U.S. Government Imagery \n                                Stories\n\n       Below is a table showing various government stories about \n     pilot distress symbols found in satellite imagery. GX2527, \n     SEREX, and 72TA88 were symbols recorded by U.S. satellites \n     taking pictures of the field next to Dong Vai Prison, Vietnam \n     on June 5, 1992. Dong Vai Prison is the site of seventeen \n     live sighting reports of American POWs.\n       POW/MIA officials lie to the press and Congress in order to \n     prevent further investigation. These corrupt officials may \n     eventually admit the truth to a few individuals, but only \n     after millions have read the fraudulent story in the press or \n     after serious Congressional inquiry has been stopped cold. \n     They have a record of making up any story to hide the truth. \n     No U.S. government POW/MIA official has been prosecuted for \n     perjury or even reprimanded for putting out false \n     information.\n       ``SEREX'' is the last name of MIA Henry Serex, lost in \n     south Vietnam in 1972. ``GX2527'' contains the E and E codes \n     and personal authenticator codes assigned to MIA Peter \n     Marthes, lost in Laos in November 1969. The letters ``TA'' \n     were, with other symbols, letters found just below the 1992 \n     ``SEREX'' letters and also possibly in 1973 photography. The \n     ``USA'' letters were photographed over Laos in late 1988 and \n     early 1989.\n       Examples in the table below include perjury before the \n     Senate Select POW/MIA Committee (SSC), lies intended to \n     prevent an investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, \n     and lies to the press. Quotes are represented by Italics. The \n     POW/MIA office is the source of correspondence unless \n     otherwise noted.\n\n\n                                 serex\n\n       October 8, 1992 Deposition of Air Force JSSA Deputy Chief \n     Robert Dussault before the SSC: . . . very clearly to me \n     there was the name S-E-R-E-X.\n       August 29, 1994, to the chairman House Intelligence: the \n     individual who identified the symbol he thought was made by \n     Major Serex never identified the letters ``SEREX.'' He \n     identified what he thought was ``SER.'' Only after examining \n     an alphabetically arranged listing of missing Americans did \n     he match ``SER'' to ``SEREX.''\n       December 6, 1994 to Star Tribune: No member of the Defense \n     Department has ever observed the word ``SEREX'' on any \n     satellite imagery or photography maintained by the US \n     government.\n       October 10, 1996 to Wellstone: Mr. Dussault testified \n     before Congress that he had observed the letters ``SEREX'' on \n     satellite imagery. Mr. Dussault is not a professional imagery \n     analyst; he was testifying as a Department of Defense \n     employee.\n\n\n                                   TA\n\n       October 15, 1992 Andrews sworn testimony to Senate: The \n     first symbol of interest is a 1973 TH. This symbol was imaged \n     on May 20, 1973 and again on July 10, 1973 on the Plain of \n     Jars in Laos . . . It has been interpreted as either a 1573 \n     or 1973 and either TA or TH. None of the four possible \n     combination of these symbols correlate to a classic \n     distress symbol or to the escape and evasion symbols that \n     our crews were trained to use.\n       December 6, 1994 to Star Tribune: To our knowledge, the \n     letters ``TA'' were never used as an official evasion and \n     escape symbol during the war in Southeast Asia.\n       January 6, 1995 letter from Air Force JSSA: According to \n     PACOM documents covering the Vietnam war period, GX and TA \n     were issued as classified E coded letter pair distress \n     symbols.\n       May 1, 1996 to Wellstone: No one questions the fact that T \n     and A, along with many letters of the alphabet were used \n     during the Vietnam War as evader symbols.\n       October 10, 1996 to Wellstone: Available records from the \n     period indicate the combination of ``T'' as the primary \n     evasion and escape (E) letter and ``A'' as the backup E \n     letter were used from October 1972 to 10 April 1973.\n\n\n                                 GX2527\n\n       December 6, 1994 to Star Tribune: The combination of \n     letters and numbers in the so-called ``GX2527'' symbol is not \n     a valid evader symbol.\n       January 6, 1995 letter from Air Force JSSA: According to \n     PACOM documents covering the Vietnam war period, GX and TA \n     were issued as classified E coded letter pair distress \n     symbols.\n       August 1995 POW/MIA office report provided to Wellstone: \n     The letters ``GX'' have no known correlation to any American \n     missing in Southeast Asia.'' and ``Additionally, the \n     combination GX2527'' is not a valid evader symbol.\n       May 1, 1996 to Wellstone: Whether the alleged symbol \n     ``GX2527'' is a valid E symbol is not relevant . . .\n       October 10, 1996 to Wellstone: Accordingly to the JSSA, \n     available records from the period indicate the combination of \n     ``G'' as the primary E letter and ``X'' as the backup E \n     letter were employed during September 1971. The loss incident \n     of the individual linked to these letters had occurred almost \n     two years before.\n\n\n                                  USA\n\n       December 6, 1988 CIA analysis: The letters form water \n     filled depressions in the otherwise dry fields.\n       December 6, 1994 to Wellstone: The ``USA'' and ``KO'' \n     symbols referred to in the Star Tribune article were created \n     by two Lao youths who shaped the letters out of rice straw \n     they set ablaze.\n       May 1, 1996 to Wellstone: When imagery analyst first \n     reviewed the photography containing ``USA, their initial \n     analytic findings was that the letters were depressions that \n     when filled with water would form the dark images observed on \n     the imagery. They based their initial analytic finding on the \n     basis that since the surrounding rice field was much lighter \n     in color, the darkness of the letters was probably caused by \n     water filled depressions. This initial photographic analysis \n     was in error.\n       October 10, 1996 Same as May, 1996 statement.\n\n\n                    examination of above statements\n\n       These are only examples--the POW/MIA office commonly \n     changes stories. True statements were obtained by confronting \n     the POW/MIA office with declassified documents. Confrontation \n     with irrefutable documents sometimes works. However, in the \n     case of ``GX2527'' POW/MIA officials still try to discredit \n     the validity of these symbols. This is not hard to \n     understand, given that no one with any common sense can \n     believe the official government story that vegetation and \n     shadows created a classified six-character valid distress \n     symbol. Despite years of challenges, and numerous promises \n     from DPMO officials to provided documentation, not one \n     document has been provided to support the DPMO position that \n     ``GX2527'' is not a valid evader symbol.\n       Discussion of SEREX. In response to a story in the Star \n     Tribune that stated that\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\n     the Air Force JSSA deputy chief saw the letters SEREX, the \n     head of the POW/MIA office (General Wold) wrote the Star \n     Tribune claiming no Defense Department employee ever saw the \n     letters ``SEREX.'' In October 1996 the POW/MIA office \n     confessed their statement was false. The only excuse for this \n     offered is a vague statement open to many interpretations. \n     DPMO has refused to elaborate.\n       The August 29, 1994 statement by the POW/MIA office to the \n     head of the House Intelligence committee is a pure \n     fabrication--with invented details to give it apparent \n     credibility. This is an outrageous attempt to obstruct \n     justice and prevent a potential investigation by the House \n     Intelligence Committee. No excuse for this statement has been \n     forthcoming by the POW/MIA office to date.\n       Discussion of TA. The POW/MIA office now confesses that the \n     letters ``TA'' were used during the war as E codes. Their \n     office previously claimed to the best of their knowledge they \n     were not. It turns out the codes were not used just for one \n     month, but from October 1972 to April 10, 1973!\n       Note the previous dates relate to May 1973 symbols \n     discussed in the October 15, 1992 testimony of Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense Duane Andrews. Andrews was sworn to tell \n     the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and \n     did not do so. Had the Senate Select POW/MIA committee \n     been told that TA were active escape and evasion symbols \n     for those missing from October 1972 to April 10, 1973, \n     they may have concluded that the symbols photographed in \n     May 1973 were made by an American. Again, the government \n     is entitled to take any position it desires. However, the \n     law does not allow government officials to lie, mislead, \n     or conceal information to support their position. Doing so \n     under sworn oath is called ``perjury.''\n       Discussion of GX2527. The POW/MIA office has been \n     confronted with the statement from the SSC final report: \n     ``This consultant had detected, with ``100 percent \n     confidence'' a faint ``GX2527'' in a photograph of a prison \n     facility in Vietnam taken in June, 1992. This number \n     correlates to the primary and back-up distress symbols and \n     authenticator number of a pilot lost in Laos in 1969.'' Their \n     office has also been confronted with expert testimony from \n     the Air Force JSSA stating GX2527 is a valid pilot distress \n     symbol. JSSA is the very agency that teaches pilots the \n     rescue symbols. The POW/MIA office on one occasion said \n     whether GX2527 is a valid distress symbol is not relevant. \n     They still have not admitted GX2527 is a valid distress \n     symbol, indeed, they often deny it.\n       On a second point, the POW/MIA office previously stated \n     ``The letters ``GX'' have no known correlation to any \n     American missing Southeast Asia.'' They now say GX were valid \n     for the months of September, 1971 and point out this is two \n     years after MIA Peter Matthes was shot down. Clearly, they \n     lied when they said GX correlated to no known missing \n     American--there are multiple Americans missing in September \n     1971. The POW/MIA office has refused to respond to numerous \n     inquiries asking what rescue letters they claim were valid \n     for November 1969.\n       Discussion of USA. The POW/MIA office, the same office that \n     has refused to follow recommendations of the SSC regarding \n     imagery because they say they are so positive of their \n     findings, now claims an imagery analyst made a mistake. It \n     stretches the imagination to believe an imagery analyst could \n     not tell land from water. The POW/MIA office claims new \n     analysis showed the unnamed imagery analyst was mistaken. Yet \n     in my FOIA request, which asked for all documents relating to \n     the USA letters, I received not one document to support the \n     POW/MIA office's latest story.\n\n\n                               references\n\n       December 6, 1988--CIA analysis of USA letters, provided by \n     DPMO in FOIA request.\n       October 15, 1992--statement to SSC from Assistant Secretary \n     Defense Duane Andrews.\n       August 29, 1994--POW/MIA office letter to House \n     Intelligence Committee Chairman.\n       December 6, 1994--letter from General James Wold to \n     Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n       August 1995--POW/MIA office report ``Satellite imagery and \n     Ground Distress Symbols.''\n       May 1, 1996--letter from POW/MIA office to Senator \n     Wellstone.\n       October 10, 1996--letter from POW/MIA office to Senator \n     Wellstone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3224-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3226-S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL CHARLES R. LARSON, UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize and say farewell to an outstanding naval officer and dear \nfriend, Admiral Charles R. Larson. It is an honor and a privilege for \nme to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him \nfor the superb service he has provided the United States Navy and our \ngreat nation during a truly distinguished military career. Admiral \nLarson's achievements over his 40-year career are unparalleled in our \nmodern Navy. In addition to being a superb naval officer and my well-\nrespected classmate at the United States Naval Academy, Admiral Larson \nwas the youngest officer in the history of our Navy to be promoted to \nAdmiral. Upon retirement in June, he will have served in 11 positions \nspanning more than 19 years as a flag officer.\n  Admiral Charles R. Larson assumed duties as the 55th Superintendent \nof the United States Naval Academy on 1 August 1994. Prior to his \narrival, Admiral Lawson served from March 1991-July 1994 as Commander \nin Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC) located in Honolulu, \nHawaii. As the senior U.S. military commander in the Pacific and Indian \nOcean areas, he led the largest of the unified commands and directed \nall Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force operations across 103 \nmillion square miles--more than 50 percent of the Earth's surface. In \nhis position as Commander of CINCPAC, Admiral Larson had primary \nresponsibility for 350,000 personnel and the readiness of all U.S. \nforces in the theater, and was accountable to the President and the \nSecretary of the Defense. He was also the U.S. Military representative \nfor collective defense arrangements in the Pacific and worked with 44 \ncountries in the Pacific Rim.\n  Admiral Larson was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A graduate of \nNorth High School in Omaha, Nebraska, he graduated from the United \nStates Naval Academy with distinction in 1958. After being commissioned \nin the U.S. Navy, he reported to flight training in Pensacola, Florida, \nand was designated a naval aviator in May 1960. He then reported to \nAttack Squadron 176, where he flew missions from the aircraft carrier \nUSS Shangri-La (CVA 38).\n  In April 1963, he volunteered and was accepted for nuclear power \ntraining. Upon completion, he served in two fleet ballistic submarines, \nUSS Nathan Hale and USS Nathanael Greene, before reporting as executive \nofficer of the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Bergal.\n  Admiral Larson was the first naval officer selected as a White House \nFellow, serving in 1968 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the \nInterior. From January 1969 to April 1971, he served as Naval Aide to \nthe President of the United States. He reported back to sea duty as \nexecutive officer of the nuclear-powered submarine USS Sculpin. From \nAugust 1973 to July 1976, he served as commanding officer of the \nnuclear submarine USS Halibut. In August 1976, Admiral Larson assumed \nduties as Commander, Submarine Development Group ONE, in San Diego, \nCalifornia. In this assignment, he headed the Navy's worldwide deep \nsubmergence program with a variety of submarines, surface ships, deep \nsubmersibles, and diving systems under his command.\n\n  As a Flag Officer, Admiral Larson has served in nine assignments both \nashore and afloat subsequent to his promotion to Rear Admiral in March \n1979. These include: Director of the Strategic Submarine Division and \nTrident Coordinator on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations; \nDirector, Long Range Planning Group, an organization he established to \nassist the Chief of Naval Operations identify and prioritize long-range \nNaval objectives for planning the Navy of the early 21st century; \nCommander, Submarine Group EIGHT; Commander, Area Anti-Submarine \nWarfare Forces, SIXTH Fleet; and Commander, Submarines Mediterranean \n(NATO) in Naples, Italy.\n  From August 1983 to August 1986, he served as the 51st Superintendent \nof the United States Naval Academy. In August 1986, Admiral Larson was \npromoted to Vice Admiral prior to reporting as Commander, Striking \nFleet Atlantic/Commander, SECOND FLEET. In August 1988, he reported as \nDeputy Chief of Naval Operations for Plans, Policy and Operations.\n  Admiral Larson was promoted to four-star rank in February 1990 upon \nbeing assigned as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet the Navy \ncomponent commander in the Pacific theater. After one year in this \nposition, Admiral Larson was nominated by the President and assumed \nduties as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command.\n  Admiral Laron's decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service \nMedal, six Navy Distinguished Service Medals, three Legions of Merit, \nBronze Star Medal, Navy Commendation Medal, and Navy Achievement Medal.\n  For the past four years, Admiral Larson has served as the 55th \nSuperintendent of the United States Naval Academy. Admiral Larson was \nasked to assume the duties as Superintendent to\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\nreturn honor, discipline, and a sense of commitment to the 4,000 \nmidshipmen, in the wake of the most trying scandals that the Naval \nAcademy has faced in its 152-year history. As background, on September \n27, 1993, the Naval Academy Board of Visitors created the Honor Review \nCommittee, known as the Armitage Committee, named after the Chairman, \nAmbassador Richard L. Armitage. The Armitage Committee was charged with \nreviewing the concept, process, and effectiveness of the Naval Academy \nHonor Concept, particularly in light of the December 1992 compromising \nof an Electric Engineering exam at the Academy. One significant \nrecommendation of the Amitage Committee was to increase the \nSuperintendent's Academy tour length to four years and make the \nSuperintendent a more senior flag officer than the two-star admirals \nwho had previously served in that position. Admiral Larson was the top \nchoice among several stellar candidates given his maturity, four-star \nrank, experience, academic background, outstanding character and \nintegrity, and his known ability to reach out and unify all Academy \nefforts aimed at improving character development: administration, \nacademic departments, athletic department (including varsity \nathletics), extra-curricular activities, the Office of Chaplains, and \nthe Brigade Honor Committee.\n\n  As a member of the Naval Academy's Board of Visitors, I can report \nthat we recently conducted a comprehensive investigation of every \naspect of the Naval Academy. We concluded that the Naval Academy is \nfundamentally sound and on the right track for the 21st century. For \nthat positive endorsement, we have Admiral Larson to thank. I would \nlike to cite a few of the significant changes that Admiral Larson has \ninstituted at the Naval Academy, which I believe will have positive \neffects for the future of our service academies:\n  Established a New Leadership Curriculum. The leadership curriculum \nhas been completely revamped, emphasizing a continuum of leadership \nboth in the classroom and in the fleet.\n  Established a New Ethics Course. A three-credit course, ``Moral \nReasoning for Naval Leaders,'' provides a weekly lecture by a faculty \nphilosopher and seminars taught by senior officers with extensive fleet \nexperience.\n  Instituted Integrity Development Seminars. During these monthly \nsessions, midshipmen work to define and clarify their basic moral \nvalues, and to determine the importance of those values and their \nsignificance to a career as a military officer.\n  Established Distinguished Chair of Ethics. A world-renowned ethicist \nhas been appointed, who adds considerable expertise to all of the Naval \nAcademy's character development efforts.\n  Established a Distinguished Professor of Leadership. The current \nProfessor of Leadership is focusing efforts on improving how leadership \nis taught and practiced, both in the Division of Professional \nDevelopment and in Bancroft Hall.\n  Reaffirmed Honor Concept and Education. Midshipmen ownership of the \nNaval Academy's Honor Concept has been reaffirmed, and efforts to \neducate all midshipmen about the history, significance, and value of \nthe Naval Academy Honor Concept have been strengthened.\n  Returned to a Traditional Plebe Summer. With an emphasis on \nleadership by example, Admiral Larson returned the Naval Academy to a \nmore traditional summer training period for new midshipmen, challenging \nthem to reach new heights in physical, intellectual, and moral \nperformance, and emphasizing the importance of respect for the dignity \nof others.\n  Established a Masters Program for Company Officers. This program \nallows exceptional junior officers from the fleet to spend their first \nyear in an intense academic environment where they will earn a master's \ndegree in leadership. After being awarded an academic degree, the \nofficers would then use this knowledge, combined with their fleet \nexperience, to become more effective leaders and models for the \nmidshipmen.\n\n  Instituted Company Chief Petty Officers. Each Company has been \nassigned a senior chief petty officer or a Marine Corps gunnery \nsergeant who provides considerable first-hand fleet experience to the \nyoung officers-in-training.\n  Renewed Accreditation of Academic Program. Under Admiral Larson's \nleadership, the Naval Academy received renewed academic accreditation \nin 1986 and 1996. His direction of the academic program for the long \nterm engendered laudatory comments by the inspection teams.\n  Key Brigade Accomplishments in Academic Year 1996-1997:\n  74 Midshipmen from the Class of '97 were selected or nominated for \ngraduate education programs, 10 of whom were women--a record number of \nfemale participants.\n  Midshipmen participated in over 16,000 hours of community service, a \nnew record. This effort represents the exponential growth of community \nservice in the Brigade.\n  Fifteen varsity athletes were named All-Americans for '96-'97. Two of \n15 were also GTE Academic All-Americans.\n  Mr. President, my good friend Chuck Larson, his wife Sally, and \ndaughters Sigrid, Erica, and Kirsten have made many sacrifices during \nhis 40-year naval career, and have contributed significantly to the \noutstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. \nAdmiral Larson is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so \nproudly serves. As this truly history-making officer now departs for \nanother career, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nto wish him fair winds and following seas. He will be greatly missed. \n'58 is great! \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3226-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3227-S3228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ALARM INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just over two years ago I stood on \nthis floor as the Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of a historic \nrewrite of the 1934 telecommunications act. We were told at that time \nthat the act would bring the benefits of competition in local telephone \nexchange service--better service and lower prices for the American \nconsumer.\n  One part of that legislation in which I had a personal interest were \nthe provisions concerning the burglar and fire alarm industry--a highly \ncompetitive industry still dominated by small businesses. Many of us, \nboth in the House and the Senate, feared that allowing the Regional \nBells to enter the market prior to real competition in the local \ntelephone exchanges would result in the Bells using their business \nmonopolies and vast financial resources to drive small alarm dealers \nout of business.\n  That is why Congress adopted a five year transitional waiting period \nbefore the Bells could enter the alarm monitoring business. The bill \nmade an exception for Ameritech.\n  The Ameritech exception was included because Ameritech had already \npurchased two large alarm companies--before the bill was passed. \nHowever, these acquisitions were quite controversial because they were \nmade during a time when all of the Bells had agreed not to enter this \nline of business until the legislative rules had been established. Only \nAmeritech broke that understanding. Nonetheless, the Congress felt it \nwas better to grandfather those acquisitions rather than to force a \ndivestiture.\n  However, in order to insure that we were not granting a five year \ncompetitive advantage to Ameritech over the other Bells, who had kept \ntheir pledge not to enter the business, we specifically prohibited \nfurther growth by acquisition during the five year transition period. \nWe, in effect, told Ameritech that it could stay in the alarm \nmonitoring business, but that its growth would be restricted to direct \nmarketing to customers.\n  And, to make our intentions crystal clear, several Senators, \nincluding then Majority Leader Bob Dole, engaged in a floor colloquy on \nthe subject when the bill was being considered. At one point I said:\n\n        There is one issue which deserves some additional \n     clarification. The bill and the report language clearly \n     prohibit any Bell company already in the industry from \n     purchasing another alarm company for 5 years from date of \n     enactment. However, it is not entirely clear whether such a \n     Bell could circumvent the prohibition by purchasing the \n     underlying customer accounts and assets of an alarm company, \n     but not the company itself. It was my understanding that the \n     conferees intended to prohibit for 5 years the acquisition of \n     other alarm companies in any form, including the purchases of \n     customer accounts and assets.\n\n  The two managers of the bill, Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nand Ranking member Hollings, both agreed on the record that my \nunderstanding was correct.\n  Despite that clarification in the formal proceedings, Ameritech \ndisregarded Congressional intent. Soon after passage of the bill, \nAmeritech went out and purchased the customer accounts and assets of \nCircuit City's alarm monitoring division.\n  When the alarm industry challenged Ameritech's action, a divided FCC \nCommittee supported Ameritech. For reasons I don't understand, all the \ncommissioners--except for Susan Ness in a vehement dissent--said that \npurchasing the customer accounts and assets was permissible so long as \nAmeritech did not purchase any of the stock.\n  This opened the flood gate. During the next 16 months, Ameritech \npurchased over 550,000 customers by acquiring the assets and customer \naccounts of: Republic Industries alarm division, the 7th largest \ncompany in the alarm industry; Rollins, the 10th largest company in the \nindustry; Masada, the 20th largest company in the industry; Central \nControl and Alarm, the 40th largest company in the industry; and \nNorman, the 46th largest company in the industry.\n  This acquisition binge was exactly what Congress wanted to avoid when \nit created the five year transitional waiting period. The industry's \nfears of market domination by those companies which control the local \ntelephone exchanges--the alarm industry's lifeline--have proven to be \njustified.\n  In the late 1980's and early 1990's, just before Congress embarked on \nits effort to transform the telecommunications industry, there were \napproximately 13,000 alarm companies in this country employing over \n120,000 workers. By 1997, that number had dropped dramatically to \n10,750 companies and 90,000 workers--according to an industry source, \nFreeman & Associates.\n  At the same time, there was significant consolidation among the top \n100 alarm companies. Most industry experts agree that several top 100 \ncompanies have concluded that they would have to consolidate to compete \nwith the rapidly expanding Ameritech. This hastened the demise of many \nsmall alarm companies, driven out of business by having to compete with \nthe new giants in the industry, especially Ameritech.\n  At the same time that small companies were being driven out of \nbusiness, there have been dramatic layoffs in the companies Ameritech \nacquired. Just last year, Ameritech's SecurityLink alarm division \nannounced layoffs of over 1,500 workers out of a workforce of 8,000.\n  One example of this can be found in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. About 20 \nyears ago, my friend Patrick Egan started his own small alarm company, \nCommonwealth Security Systems, Inc. He built his company into a \nsignificant regional player with 11 offices and a central monitoring \nstation in Lancaster. He employed over 200 people in Lancaster alone.\n  In January of 1997, believing that he had won the battle against \nAmeritech purchasing alarm monitoring companies, Patrick sold his \nbusiness to Republic Industries. He sold with the understanding that \nall of his employees would be retained, monitoring would continue in \nLancaster, and he would remain on as President of Republic Industries' \nMid-Atlantic operations. During the short period Republic owned \nCommonwealth Security Systems, they significantly expanded operations \nand doubled the size of its workforce from 200 to 400.\n  However, thirty four weeks later, Ameritech's SecurityLink came in \nand purchased all the customer accounts and assets of Republic's alarm \ndivision. That day, Ameritech chose to let Patrick go. Then, it \nproceeded to layoff nearly 100 of the Lancaster-based employees. More \nlayoffs are expected as SecurityLink eliminates its Lancaster \nmonitoring station as well as 22 others across North America. Not only \nare jobs lost, but also the industry is convinced that safety is \ncompromised.\n  Last December 30, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit stepped in and vacated the FCC's ruling \nthat precipitated the buying binge in the first place.\n  In its ruling, the Court said, ``When the purported (by the \nCommission) `plain meaning' of a statute's word or phrase happens to \nrender the statue senseless, we encountering ambiguity rather than \nclarity. . . So [it is] here.'' The Court continued: ``The Commission's \ninterpretation means that although Section 275 (a) (2) precluded \nAmeritech from acquiring even one share of Circuit City's stock, \nAmeritech was free to acquire the company's entire alarm monitoring \nservices division--lock, stock, and barrel. We asked the Commission \ncounsel at oral argument what possible rationale Congress could have \nhad in mind if this is what it intended.'' The FCC's counsel has not \nprovided a cogent answer to the court's question.\n  I share the court's confusion. I know what we meant when we adopted \nSection 275 and Ameritech certainly knew what we meant. But that did \nnot stop Ameritech's management. It has been their intention all along \nto push as far and as hard as they could while they had their unique \nadvantage over the other Bells. They would hope that either the FCC or \nthe courts would sustain their position. They have deep financial \npockets which they have relied upon in the hope that they could drive \nthe alarm industry into submission.\n  But that's not going to happen. The Court has signaled that an \ninterpretation of Section 275 which circumvents the prohibition on \npurchases by specifying the method of purchase does not adhere with \nwhat Congress intended. The Court has directed the FCC to issue an \ninterpretation of Section 275 which makes sense. It is my hope that the \nCommission in its next ruling will send a clear and unambiguous message \nto Ameritech that it must cease and desist from flaunting the law and \nshould be ordered to divest itself of any customer accounts or assets \nit acquired after the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  Congress clearly intended to prohibit Ameritech from acquiring all or \nany part of an alarm monitoring company in any form. It's time for \nAmeritech to realize that. The only way they will, though, is if the \nFCC forces them to follow the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3227-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3228-S3229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO FIRST LADY OF VIRGINIA ROXANNE GILMORE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nFirst Lady of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Mrs. Roxanne Gilmore. I had \nthe distinct pleasure of joining Mrs. Gilmore for a luncheon honoring \nher prior to the Governor's Inauguration. Mrs. Gilmore is a remarkable \nwoman of uncommon character and an accomplished education professional. \nShe is setting a wonderful example for all Virginians and bringing \ntremendous talent, energy, and leadership to the position of First \nLady.\n  Mr. President, I ask that First Lady Gilmore's remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                    Remarks of Mrs. Roxanne Gilmore\n\n       I want to thank each of you for being here today, \n     especially with the weather having taken a turn for the \n     worse. It means a lot to Jim and me that you all would choose \n     to be a part of our inaugural festivities--we wanted to share \n     this experience with as many Virginians as possible. That's \n     why we have traveled to so many wonderful places in the \n     Commonwealth this week--to revisit the beautiful places that \n     we saw during the campaign, and most importantly, to see so \n     many of our friends who sustained us over the last several \n     months.\n       It's with many differing emotions that I address you this \n     afternoon. I am deeply honored that a man of the stature of \n     Senator John Warner would host this event today. He is truly \n     one of Virginia's finest sons, and his service and commitment \n     to the people of Virginia overshadows what small service I \n     hope to give the people over the next four years.\n       I am thankful that so many of our close friends and family \n     are here and that they were able to weather the roads to make \n     it to Richmond today. You all have understood when we had to \n     say No, we can't come this time, and you sustained us during \n     the rough times. I particularly want to thank Bessie Scott of \n     the VFRW for their tireless efforts on our part during this \n     campaign. There was not a time when they refused to help, and \n     I am proud that I can claim a long-standing membership in \n     such a worthwhile group. I also want to thank the Mills E. \n     Godwin High School Chorus for providing special music for our \n     enjoyment. Our son, Jay, has enjoyed being a ``Godwin Eagle'' \n     this year, and I appreciate the warmth that the Godwin \n     student body has extended to us all.\n       Then, indeed, I am somewhat terrified of giving this speech \n     since I see some of my\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\n     UVA professors and my RMC colleagues in the audience. I hope \n     they left their grade books at home, and focus instead on how \n     much I appreciate their support here today.\n       I have often thought it appropriate that as Jim and I \n     embarked on this course in the political world, that a large \n     part of my teaching at RMC included epic poetry--the Odyssey \n     of Homer, and the Aeneid of Virgil. For our course has surely \n     been an Odyssey. On my journey I have seen rosy fingered Dawn \n     on early morning campaign trips--I have seen the wine-dark \n     sea of the Chesapeake Bay--and even some of the political \n     meetings were reminiscent of the great quarrel between \n     Achilles and Agamemnon.\n       But just as the journey of Odysseus didn't really end when \n     he reached Ithaca, nor the journey of Aeneas end with his \n     arrival in Italy, our journey is not over, but just \n     beginning. The work of accomplishment will start this \n     Saturday. And while Jim has the legacy of Virginia's great \n     Governors to follow and well-defined Constitutional \n     responsibility to uphold, there are no guidebooks or defined \n     rules to mark the path of a First Lady. Today I want to share \n     with you some of my plans for the next four years.\n       Much news has been made of the fact that I will continue to \n     work part-time as a professor of classics. The attention has \n     quite frankly surprised me. During our 20 years of marriage, \n     I have worked full-time, sometimes not at all, and part-time. \n     I now work part-time and will continue to teach while Jim is \n     Governor.\n       I never viewed the fact that I would teach as a decision. \n     To both Jim and me, my continuing to teach was never a \n     question. He realizes that teaching is not really a job to \n     me, it is my passion. It is an important part of my life, and \n     Jim's understanding this and supporting it have meant much to \n     me over these past years.\n       We of course will continue to be partners in our \n     responsibilities of parenthood. On many occasions Jim has \n     been the one who got up early and prepared Jay and Ashton for \n     school as I traveled or left for school early. We support \n     each other in our goals. And in doing this we are just a \n     typical Virginia family, and we will continue on this path. \n     We will approach life in the Governor's mansion in the same \n     manner we have approached life throughout our marriage. We \n     will draw strength from each other and put a priority on time \n     to spend with Jay and Ashton.\n       But I also approach this new period in my life as an \n     opportunity. A First Lady has a public platform that can put \n     the spotlight on ideas and efforts deserving greater \n     awareness. Many Virginians are engaged in innovative \n     approaches to problems and their successes go unnoticed. As \n     First Lady I can help bring attention to these innovations \n     and share these ideas with the rest of Virginia.\n       But my roll will not be that of making policy. Jim has that \n     burden on his shoulders. My time and energy outside of being \n     a wife, mother, part-time teacher will be focused on \n     education, history, and tourism.\n       As a teacher it will not surprise anyone that I have many \n     ideas about ways to enhance education in Virginia. For \n     example, I would like to encourage schools to utilize the \n     incredible knowledge and experience that our experienced \n     professionals can share with our young people. We have many \n     Virginians who travel the nation and the world sharing their \n     life experiences with various audiences. These same \n     Virginians would gladly spend time in Virginia classrooms \n     where their practical, real-world knowledge would give an \n     added dimension to the educational experience of our youth. I \n     hope to inspire our schools of higher education and our \n     Virginia professional workforce to join in partnership with \n     our secondary schools for the benefit of young people across \n     the state. Programs of cooperation similar to that I \n     witnessed at Randolph-Macon where students from Hanover \n     schools who perhaps had no experience with a college or \n     higher education, were invited to RMC to visit classrooms and \n     laboratories and the cafeteria to see fist hand activities \n     that some of us take for granted. As we enter the 21st \n     century inspiring our youth to reach their full potential \n     should be our first goal.\n       Though my degrees are in ancient history, I have always had \n     a fascination and love of Virginia's rich history, and both \n     Jim and I believe that the unmatched historic offerings of \n     Virginia should be the cornerstone of promoting tourism in \n     Virginia. While many states try to compete with Virginia's \n     incredible beaches, golf courses, mountains and parks, no \n     other state can rival the historic jewels that the \n     Commonwealth offers. Studies show that parents try to plan \n     vacations that are both educational and fun--what better \n     place to visit than Virginia where both abound. We should \n     also encourage more Virginians to vacation in Virginia, and \n     then, as they travel outside of the Commonwealth, they can be \n     ambassadors for our own unique treasures.\n       These are just a few of the plans that I have considered \n     for our ongoing Odyssey. But I know also from my studies that \n     life brings unexpected adventures and opportunities, and I \n     hope that I can use these unexpected opportunities to serve \n     all Virginians.\n       Jim and I will work hard for the families of Virginia and \n     will continue to recognize the honor that it is to serve the \n     people of Virginia. We have the same hopes and dreams that \n     you have for your children. It is our dream that this Odyssey \n     will bring them a Virginia even better than it is today.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3228-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BELLA ABZUG\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to sadly acknowledge the \npassing of a friend, former colleague, and one of the most passionate, \ncommitted, and colorful individuals that the Congress and this country \nhas ever known: Bella Abzug.\n  Many people view 1920 as one of the most important years in the \nhistory of women in America, not only because it was the year that \nwomen finally gained the right to vote, but also because it's the year \nthat Bella Abzug was born.\n  When we think of the struggle for women's equality in this country, \none of the first images that comes to mind is that of Bella Abzug's \nwide-brimmed hat bobbing up and down at some march or rally. Through \nher flamboyant personality, she truly became an icon and a giant in the \nAmerican and worldwide political landscape.\n  Bella Abzug was a trailblazer. She graduated from law school at a \ntime when only 2 percent of all lawyers were women. She was the first \nJewish woman ever elected to Congress and one of only 12 women in the \nHouse when she was elected.\n  She helped pave the way for other women in Congress and in all walks \nof life. In fact, just the other day, my good friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, Barbara Kennelly, spoke on the House floor about how Bella \nAbzug inspired her to run for Congress. One can only imagine how many \nother women took a chance and sought to achieve great things because \nthey were inspired by Bella Abzug.\n  An important thing to note about Bella is that her work was by no \nmeans limited to the cause of women's equality. Her titles ranged from \ncivil rights lawyer to anti-war activist, just to name a few. Just \nthree years out of law school, she went to Mississippi and weathered \nthreats from white-supremacist groups to defend a black man in a highly \ncontentious trial. In the 1950s, she shouted down former Senator Joseph \nMcCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts. On her first day as a \nCongresswoman, she introduced a resolution to withdraw all U.S. troops \nfrom Southeast Asia. In 1975, she introduced legislation in Congress to \nprohibit discrimination against homosexuals. Bella Abzug was committed \nto eradicating all forms of injustice in this country and around the \nworld. Hers was not solely the cause of women; hers was the cause she \nbelieved to be right and believed to be just.\n  I was fortunate to see a side of Bella Abzug that most people never \nsaw. I served in the House with Bella during her last term, and I came \nto know her as a person of great kindness. Beneath the persona of a \nblustery and irascible New York City politician was a woman of great \ndecency and warmth. While we only served together for one term, I have \nhad numerous occasions over the years to visit with Bella, and I truly \nappreciated her kindness and her friendship. Bella Abzug was truly one \nof a kind, and she will be dearly missed by friends, family, and those \nwhose causes she championed over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3229-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3229-S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EMORY L. MELTON\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Sunday, April 19, 1998, a new \nmath, science and business classroom building on the campus of \nSouthwest Missouri State University-West Plains campus (SMSU), will be \ndedicated to former State Senator Emory L. Melton. Emory, a long time \nfriend, has done much to help my home State of Missouri.\n  Elected to the State Senate in 1972, Emory had no opposition five of \nthe six times he ran, which is a State record. Originally, he involved \nhimself in politics because of a strong feeling that the State \ngovernment was growing much too quickly. As a Senator, he was known for \nreading every bill that came to the Senate floor and could point out \neven the slightest of errors. Many of his colleagues felt him to be one \nof the truest fiscal conservatives ever to serve in the Senate. I had \nthe pleasure of witnessing his great leadership while serving my two \nterms as Governor.\n  Before his service to the State Senate, Emory was the Barry County \nprosecuting attorney and a newspaper publisher in Cassville, Missouri. \nHe served as Missouri Tourism Commission chair for many years. Emory \nreceived the St. Louis Globe-Democrat award for public\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\nservice and was named one of the top ten legislators by Capitol press \ncorps.\n  With so many impressive accomplishments, it is no wonder the new \ncampus building is named in his honor. I am extremely pleased to see \nEmory recognized for his great service to the State of Missouri. \nCongratulations Senator Emory Melton on a tribute well \ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3229-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DR. RICHARD KASTNER TURNS 75\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a milestone will occur on \nSaturday, April 18, while the Senate is in recess, which I do not want \nto go unacknowledged: Dr. Richard Hermann Kastner of Clarksburg, \nMaryland, will celebrate his 75th birthday.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, ``. . . to leave the world a bit better \nwhether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social \ncondition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have \nlived. This is to have succeeded.'' I imagine it would be nearly \nimpossible to count how many lives have ``breathed easier'' because of \nRichard Kastner. For nearly 45 years, he has helped individuals and \nfamilies cope with drug and alcohol dependency, abuse, discord, illness \nand death, and seemingly inconsolable grief as a psychiatrist and \ntherapist, and as a friend. He has devoted his life to helping others \nfind meaning in their lives.\n  Richard Kastner is a native New Yorker. He received a bachelor's \ndegree in psychology and biology from New York University, a master's \ndegree in psychology from the City College of New York, his M.D. from \nJefferson Medical College, and his doctorate in psychology from New \nYork University. He then went to the University of Minnesota for post-\ngraduate medical training and for his psychiatric residency, which he \nthen continued at St. Elizabeth's Hospital here in Washington.\n  Richard Kastner achieved glittering academic success and then \nembarked on his career to achieve glittering professional success. He \nwas a captain in the Medical Corps and served as a military \npsychiatrist at Andrews Air Force Base. He has been a senior \npsychiatric consultant for the National Security Agency, chief \npsychiatrist of the Employees Health Service at the National Institutes \nof Health, and a consulting senior psychiatrist and lecturer at the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. He also served as an \ninstructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard University's \nSchool of Medicine, and is a Fellow in the Royal Society of Medicine. \nHe is a pilot, husband, and father of three children.\n  Even now, as he turns 75, he maintains a robust private practice, \nundeterred by age, ailment, or surgery. I suppose the animating force \nis an unquenchable desire to help others. I want to take this \nopportunity to congratulate him on his 75th birthday and wish him many \nmore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3230-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO TRACE DIE CAST: 1997 BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY INDUSTRY OF THE \n                                  YEAR\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nrecognition of Trace Die Cast of Bowling Green, Kentucky as the 1997 \nIndustry of the Year by the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce.\n  When Trace Die Cast started operations in 1987, it employed 24 \nKentuckians. In the 12 years since, the company has undertaken two \nmajor plant expansions and now employs 170 individuals, with an annual \npayroll of $4.6 million. They continue to be well-positioned for future \ngrowth in Warren County.\n  In the last decade, Trace Die Cast has become a major supplier of \nparts for some of America's favorite automobiles, including the Ford \nExplorer.\n  Trace Die Cast's role as a community leader is also well-known, \nespecially their enterprising approach to employee education. They have \nimportant partnerships with local vocational schools to train their \nemployees. They also provide scholarships for their employees who want \nto continue their education. Throughout their existence in Bowling \nGreen, Trace Die Cast has contributed both time and money unselfishly \nand generously to local charities and civic organizations.\n  Mr. President, local leaders in Bowling Green have described Trace \nDie Cast as a community's dream company. I could not agree more. They \nare a tribute to the American spirit, and I am proud to have such a \ncompany in my state. I congratulate them on this honor and ask all my \ncolleagues to join me in celebrating their accomplishments.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3230-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KATI SASSERVILLE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity \nto highlight the many achievements of Kati Sasserville on her \nretirement this week. Kati is ending her eleven years of service at \nOtter Tail Power Company headquartered in Fergus Falls Minnesota, just \nacross the border from my home state of North Dakota. Otter Tail also \nserves many customers in my state.\n  Kati is a trailblazer and a source of inspiration from many young \nwomen in the upper Midwest. Her years at Otter Power put her in the \nforefront of the debate on electric utility restructuring. A 1973 law \nschool graduate of the University of Minnesota, Kati started her \ndistinguished 23 year career as a trial attorney in the Office of \nGeneral Counsel for the U.S. Navy. She served as a Minnesota Public \nUtilities Commissioner from 1975 to 1981.\n  Kati has a professional and civic membership roster second to none. \nShe won Harper's Bazaar Diamond Superwoman Award back in 1980. The \nFergus Falls Daily Journal named her one of the City's ``Eight Most \nInfluential'' citizens in 1987. In addition, Kati managed to balance \nher active professional career with the needs of her family. She \nmanaged to raise six wonderful children and now enjoys the company of \nsix grandchildren. She is an example of someone who persevered and made \nit on the merits.\n  Kati's a formidable advocate, and I will fondly remember debating the \nenergy issues of the day. Her sense of fair play was always \nappreciated.\n  Kati is the only person I know who would wake up in the morning and \nthank God for the Global Warming phenomenon. Any possibility of \ntemperatures warming up in Fergus Falls is something to hope for in the \nfuture.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in wishing Kati well in her \nretirement and in fulfilling her life-long dream of running a bed and \nbreakfast in Fergus Falls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3230-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ADOLPH KOEPPEL\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on April 11, 1923, nearly seventy-\nfive years ago, Adolph Koeppel was born in Brooklyn, New York.\n  He attended PS92 and New Utrecht High School. He went on to attend \nBrooklyn College for two years; but his studies were interrupted by the \nadvent of World War II.\n  Mr. Koeppel served America with great distinction in the Navy from \n1942 to 1945, where the ship on which he served, the USS Barton, came \nunder attack at Okinawa and the Philippines.\n  Following his wartime military service, Mr. Koeppel attended New York \nUniversity Law School, where he completed his LLB in 1948 and received \nan LLM in 1953. He has achieved great heights in the legal community, \nand to this day remains a true pioneer in the fields of condemnation \nand real estate tax appeals.\n  In addition, Mr. Koeppel is known for his achievements as a \nphilatelist, having been awarded the Earl of Crawford Medal by the \nRoyal Philatelic Society.\n  On April 11, he will celebrate his 75th birthday along with his wife \nof 54 years, Rhoda, his daughters Pamela and Leslie, and his \ngranddaughters Melissa, Jennifer, and Tara.\n  Beyond all of his personal and professional achievements, Adolph \nKoeppel is a great humanitarian and community servant.

Mr. President, when many think of Iowa, they \nthink of people with spirit, discipline, and a good old-fashioned work \nethic. When sports enthusiasts think of Iowa, they think of superior \ncollege wrestling.\n  Two weekends ago in Cleveland, Ohio, for the fourth consecutive year, \nfor the 7th time in the past 8 years, and for the 16th time in the last \n21 years, the University of Iowa won the college wrestling national \nchampionship. Two weeks prior, for the 25th consecutive year, Iowa won \nthe Big Ten Conference Championships. Individual titles were won by \nMark Ironside, Jeff McGinness and Joe Williams and three other Iowans \nbecame All-Americans by placing second.\n  Imagine the attention a school would get if it won two, three or four \nconsecutive NCAA basketball tournaments. Yet the University of Iowa's \ndominance in NCAA wrestling has become almost routine. Nevertheless, \nthis year's victory was anything but routine. Because this year, Iowa \nwon without its legendary coach, Dan Gable, who took the season off and \nis contemplating retirement.\n  As many know, Dan Gable is the world's most notable ambassador for \nthe sport of wrestling. Gable grew up in Iowa and compiled a 64-0 high \nschool record. He attended Iowa State, where he was 118-1, and went on \nto win the Gold Medal at the Olympics in Munich in 1972. He won the \nOlympic tournament without allowing an opponent to score a single point \nagainst him.\n  Gable then went on to coach at the University of Iowa and win 15 \nnational championships in his 21 years as coach. In doing so, he \ncoached 9 consecutive national championships from 1978-1986 which is an \nNCAA record for all sports. Incidently, that streak was broken by Iowa \nState University who placed 6th this year in Cleveland.\n  Though he is largely unheralded outside of amateur athletics, his \nformula for success is as simple as it is difficult--hard work. Gable \nonce said, ``Like anything in life, it's not hard to be the best. It is \nas simple as outworking the opponent.'' His motto is ``Hard work solves \nanything.'' But Gable didn't just say the words, he lived them. And he \ndemanded his wrestlers live them as well.\n  Following Gable's 1971 Gold Medal victory in the World Championships \nin Bulgaria, he celebrated by taking a long run. For most, that was a \ntime to relax, to enjoy your success. For Dan Gable it was an \nopportunity to get one practice ahead of any opponent he might face in \nthe upcoming 1972 Olympic Games.\n  The notion of work and preparation is almost second nature in an \nagricultural state such as Iowa, where folks understand that you cannot \nharvest what you do not sow. That's why the other secret to the success \nof Iowa wrestling is that most of its wrestlers are Iowans. Seven out \nof the ten wrestlers that Iowa qualified for nationals are from the \nstate of Iowa.\n  Furthermore the second-place team, Minnesota, a suburb of Iowa in \nwrestling terms, is coached by a former product of Iowa wrestling. And \nthe coaches of Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana are former Iowa \nwrestlers. Iowa's new coaches, Jim Zalesky, Lincoln McIlravy, Tom \nBrands and twin-brother Terry Brands collectively won 10 NCAA \nindividual titles while wrestling for Dan Gable.\n  Gable once said the biggest benefit of sports is that ``* * * it \nteaches an athlete to deal with adversity and adversity builds \ncharacter.'' Perhaps, the greatest testament to Iowa's character is \nthat they won a National Championship without Dan Gable. No one would \nhave wanted that more than Gable himself.\n  Former NFL-great Frank Gifford commented, ``Dan Gable is the most \ndedicated athlete I have ever known.'' The impact of his dedication \nprevails even in his absence, as the tradition of Iowa's wrestling \ndominance marches forward. Old-fashioned hard work still lives in Iowas \nand it still works for Iowa.\n  My congratulations to Iowa wrestling--the National Champions again!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3231-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3231-S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FISCAL YEAR 1999 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on \nthe budget resolution. I commend the Budget Committee on the job it has \ndone. Chairman Domenici and Senator Lautenberg should be praised for \ntheir efforts to bring a bill to the floor that balances the budget for \nthe first time in 30 years. And yet, this resolution fails to \nadequately address some of our nation's most pressing priorities, \nincluding child care, education, and health care.\n  First, however, I would like to take a moment to discuss how we \nreached this historic moment when, for the first time since 1969, we \npresent the American people with a budget that is in balance. The \nbalanced budget we have today is a result of the hard work and progress \nwe have made over the past few years to reduce the deficit. The effort \ndates back to 1990 when President Bush--despite strong opposition from \nhis own party--boldly endorsed a plan that lowered the deficit by $500 \nbillion and started us down the road to fiscal responsibility.\n  This effort was then continued by President Clinton in 1993 when he \nproposed a far-reaching economic plan, which is more appropriately \ncalled the Balanced Budget Plan of 1993. This balanced budget plan, \nwhich I supported, was enacted into law without a single Republican \nvote and has helped to reduce the deficit from $290 billion at the \nbeginning of 1993 to an anticipated surplus this year. Despite the \nclaims by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that President \nClinton's plan would doom our economy, this economic plan has put us on \na road to solid recovery. It has reduced deficits by more than $1 \ntrillion, led us to the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, created \n15 million new jobs, and resulted in the greatest number of Americans \nowning homes ever.\n  Most recently, Mr. President, we finished the job of balancing the \nbudget when we enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, which I supported, not only reduced spending, but \nalso cut taxes for the first time in 16 years, providing much-needed \ntax relief for working families. I was very pleased to support the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 because it protected our priorities such as \nfiscal discipline, child care, education, health care, and the \nenvironment.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the resolution before us today fails to \nprotect these priorities and turns its back on America's families and \nchildren. It fails to recognize many initiatives important to our \nchildren and families including quality child care, reducing class \nsizes, renovating and modernizing our children's schools, and promoting \nafter-school learning.\n  The resolution provides no mandatory funding for either child care or \nearly childhood education. Moreover, it explicitly excludes President \nClinton's proposals to use any revenues from comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation to pay for initiatives for children, including child care, \nanti-smoking education, children's health care, and improvements in \neducation.\n  Clearly, the resolution before us shortchanges children, and that is \nwhy\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nI offered an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund \nwhich could be used to fund legislation designed to improve the \naffordability, availability and quality of child care, and to support \nfamilies' choices in caring for their children. I was disappointed, \nobviously, when my amendment was defeated, but was pleased that the \namendment had the support of fifty of my colleagues.\n  The resolution also reduces funding for the Administration's \neducation priorities by $2 billion, and as a result, about 450,000 \nstudents could be denied safe after-school care in 1999, some 30,000 \nnew children could be denied access to the Head Start program, and \n6,500 middle schools would not have drug and violence prevention \ncoordinators. And yet, while Republican budget increases funding above \nthe President's request for Impact Aid, Special Education, and the \ntitle VI block grant, these increases come at the expense of many other \npriorities that also strengthen our commitment to children and \neducation.\n  Mr. President, this budget as a whole ill-serves children and \nfamilies, and that is why I was pleased to support the Democratic \nalternative budget offered by Senator Lautenberg. The Democratic \nalternative would strengthen our commitment to our priorities by \nproviding funding for key initiatives such as hiring an additional \n100,000 teachers, creating more after-school programs, and doubling the \nnumber of children who receive child care assistance. Further, the \nDemocratic alternative moves us toward our goal of one million children \nin Head Start by 2002, doubles the number of children in early Head \nStart, and places up to 500,000 children in after school learning \ncenters.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative maintains our \ncommitment to other Democratic priorities such as cleaning up the \nenvironment and investing in our transportation infrastructure. \nMoreover, it would expand Medicare coverage to Americans ages 55-65. \nAnd not least, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative strengthens \nSocial Security by reserving the entire unified budget surplus, while \nmaintaining strict fiscal discipline by meeting the discretionary caps \nin all years.\n  I regret, Mr. President, that the Democratic alternative was \ndefeated. And I regret that the resolution before us today is not one \nthat I, in good conscience, can support. In my view, the Republican \nbudget shortchanges America's working families. I am, however, hopeful \nthat as we move forward in the budget process, we will craft \nlegislation that focuses on priorities like child care, education, \nhealth care, and the environment. Finally, Mr. President, in our \nefforts to craft a budget that targets the needs of working families, \nit is imperative that we remain vigilant in our efforts to maintain \nfiscal responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3231-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO RICHARD A.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps.\n  In March 1933, there were approximately 13,689,000 Americans \nunemployed. Millions were standing in bread lines, or desperately \npleading with community volunteer organizations for help. Thousands \nwere making homes out of abandoned farm buildings, or just roaming \naround the land with no home at all.\n  At this time, my home state of Georgia had already known \n``depression'' for some time. An economic recession had begun in \nGeorgia 10 years before the stock market crashed in 1929. Farmers had \nalready faced a century of troubles including erosion problems, and a \nboll weevil epidemic that wiped out cotton crops across the state.\n  Who would have thought that Georgians' great hope would come in the \nform of a New Yorker, stricken by polio, who had sought out the healing \nWarm Springs of Georgia nearly ten years earlier. It was the frequent \nGeorgia visitor President Franklin D. Roosevelt who looked out on \nAmerica and said he saw ``one third of a nation ill-clad, ill-housed \nand ill-nourished.'' In response, he offered the people of a suffering \nnation a sweeping bundle of proposals--a New Deal.\n  A cornerstone of FDR's initiative was the Civilian Conservation Corps \n(CCC), which was signed into law on April 5, 1933.\n  Conceived as an employment catalyst for young men, Roosevelt said his \nidea was ``to create a civilian conservation corps, to be used in \nsimple work, not interfering with normal employment, but confining \nitself to forestry, the prevention of soil erosion, flood control and \nsimilar projects.''\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\n  By the summer of 1933, the CCC had more than 300,000 young men, ages \n18 to 24, in camps across the country prepared to embark on what would \nbe the largest public works and job creation project this country has \never known. In a radio address that summer, President Roosevelt called \non the CCC to be the vanguard of the new spirit of the American \nfuture--a spirit of responsibility and opportunity.\n  My father was one of the young men who heard that call. A year later, \nin the summer of 1934, my father was a ``CCC boy'' based in a Clayton \nCounty camp as a truck driver, running supplies to camps in North \nGeorgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The CCC boys earned $30 per \nmonth running supplies like my father, planting trees, building roads \nand trails, making dams and walls and shelters.\n  Roosevelt's Corps was dedicated to several purposes. First, FDR \ncreated the CCC to relieve the massive unemployment problem our nation \nwas facing. Second, FDR recognized the real work the CCC could do--\nrebuilding the country's depleted resources of forest and soil--would \nbe at least as vital a purpose as job creation.\n  The third objective of the CCC, whose significance has perhaps become \neven more apparent as years have passed, was generally envisioned by \nFDR in his 1933 message to Congress:\n\n       More important, however, than material gains, will be the \n     moral and spiritual value of such work. We can take a vast \n     army of the unemployed out into healthful surroundings. We \n     can eliminate to some extent at least the threat that \n     enforced idleness brings to spiritual and moral stability.\n\n  In other words, in a nearly inadvertent way, the CCC had the effect \nof not only rebuilding roads, trees and dams, but also of rebuilding \nmen. While the challenges our country faces today are vastly different \nthan those of 1933, and the makeup of our corps of volunteers has \nbecome much more diverse than the young ``CCC boys,'' the spirit of \nnational service remains strong.\n  For example, the work of the more than 40,000 citizens now serving as \npart of the Corporation for National Service's AmeriCorps program is \npowerful proof that national service is as important now as it was for \nmy father's generation.\n  A group of Georgians who recognize FDR's legacy of hope, opportunity \nand spirit of service are working to erect a statue honoring the \nCivilian Conservation Corps in Warm Springs, GA. How appropriate such a \nrecognition would be. Roosevelt's CCC is an important piece of our \nnation's and our state's history, and something that should serve as an \nexample for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3232-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY BETTERMENT COMMITTEE OF MT.

Mr. President, the Senate has just passed H.R. \n629, legislation granting congressional consent to the Texas/Maine/\nVermont Compact. I have often been asked why I--a senator from \nMinnesota--should have such a deep and abiding interest in this \nlegislation, which appears to involve only those three states. Until \nthis week, I had not agreed to a time limit for debate, and this held \nup consideration of the bill for more than year. I think I owe it to my \ncolleagues to explain why I was insisting on a full and thorough \ndebate, and why I think this discussion is so important.\n  What has troubled me from the very beginning is that this legislation \nwould result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, \npoor, majority-Latino community in rural West Texas--a town called \nSierra Blanca. In this respect, the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact is \ndifferent from other Compacts the Senate has considered. We know \nbeforehand where this waste will be dumped. The Texas legislation in \n1991 identified the area where the dump will be located. The Texas \nWaste Authority designated the site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft \nlicense was issued in 1996.\n  Whether we like it or not, this knowledge makes us responsible for \nwhat happens to Sierra Blanca. I'll be the first to acknowledge that \nthis is a terrible responsibility. The fate of the people who live \nthere ultimately rests in our hands. Their livelihoods, their \ncommunity, their property, their health, their safety, and in many \nrespects their lives, all depend on how we choose to proceed on this \nbill.\n  I believe very strongly that the Compact raises important and \ntroubling issues of what has variously been described as \n``environmental justice,'' ``environmental equity,'' ``environmental \ndiscrimination,'' or ``environmental racism.'' And a diverse array of \ncivic organizations agree with me about this. The Texas NAACP, The \nSierra Club, the League of United Latin American Citizens (or \n``LULAC''), Greenpeace, the Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, \nthe House Hispanic Caucus, Friends of the Earth, and Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility, to name just a few.\n  As a very basic proposition, I think we can all agree that it's wrong \nfor poor, politically powerless, minority communities to be singled out \nfor the siting of unwanted hazardous waste dumps. It's wrong when that \nhappens in Sierra Blanca, and it's wrong when it happens in hundreds of \nother poor minority communities all across this country. I want to do \nwhatever I can to stop it, and I don't see why every one of us should \nnot want to do the same. I don't understand why it should be considered \nunusual for a senator to care about these things. On the contrary, I \nthink it should be unusual for a senator not to care about these \nthings.\n  Let me tell you something about Sierra Blanca. It's a small town in \none of the poorest parts of Texas, an area with one of the highest \npercentages of Latino residents. The average income of people who live \nthere is less than $8,000. Thirty-nine percent live below the poverty \nline. Over 66 percent are Latino, and many of them speak only Spanish. \nIt's a town that has already been saddled with one of the largest \nsewage sludge projects in the world. Every week Sierra Blanca receives \n250 tons of partially treated sewage sludge from across country. And \ndepending on what action Congress decides to take, this small town with \nminimal political clout may also become the national repository for \nlow-level radioactive waste.\n\n  Supporters of the Compact would have us believe that the designation \nof Sierra Blanca had nothing to do with the income or ethnic \ncharacteristics of its residents. That it had nothing to do with the \nhigh percentage of Latinos in Sierra Blanca and the surrounding \nHudspeth County--at least 2.6 times higher than the state average. That \nthe percentage of people living in poverty--at least 2.1 times higher \nthan the state average--was completely irrelevant. They would have us \nbelieve that Sierra Blanca was simply the unfortunate finalist in a \nrigorous and deliberate screening process that fairly considered \npotential sites from all over the state. That the outcome was based on \nscience and objective criteria. I don't believe any of this is true.\n  Let me be clear. I'm not saying science played no role whatsoever in \nthe process. It did. Indeed, based on the initial criteria coupled with \nthe scientific findings, Sierra Blanca was disqualified as a potential \ndump site. It wasn't until politics entered the picture that Sierra \nBlanca was even considered.\n  I think its worth taking a moment to review how we get to where we \nare\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\ntoday. The selection criteria for the dump were established in 1981, \nand the Texas Waste Authority hired engineering consultants to screen \nthe entire state for suitable sites. In March 1985, consultants Dames & \nMoore delivered their report to the Authority. Using ``exclusionary'' \ncriteria established by the Authority, Dames & Moore ruled out Sierra \nBlanca and the surrounding area, due primarily to its complex geology.\n  Let me quote from that report. Features ``applied as exclusionary as \nrelated to the Authority's Siting Criteria'' included ``the clearly \nexclusionary features of: complex geology; tectonic fault zones,'' et \ncetera. ``The application of exclusionary geological criteria has had a \nsubstantial impact'' in screening potential sites, the report observed. \nIn its final composite, the report explained, ``Complex geology and \nmountainous areas in West, West-Central, and the Panhandle of Texas \nwere excluded,'' including the Sierra Blanca dump site. The report also \nfound, ``Many tectonic faults occur in West Texas within massive blocks \nof mountain ranges. This area includes El Paso [and] Hudspeth'' \ncounties ``and has undergone several phases or episodes of tectonic \ndisturbances.'' Finally, it went on to observe that, ``Although not \nexcluded, the remainder of Hudspeth County does not appear to offer \ngood siting potential.''\n  So much for the science. Repeatedly since the early 1980s, the Waste \nAuthority has come back again and again to this politically powerless \narea. It has designated four potential sites in all, and--with one \nrevealing exception--all of them were in Hudspeth County. There are \nonly three communities in the entire County, all of them poor and \nheavily Latino, and all of them targeted by the Authority.\n  The one exception to the pattern was in 1985, after completion of the \nengineering consultants' report, Dames & Moore concluded that the \n``best'' sites were in McMullen and Dimmit Counties, and the Waste \nAuthority settled on a site in McMullen County. But this decision met \nwith fierce opposition. Politically influential individuals demanded \nthat the Authority move the dump to Hudspeth County.\n\n  At this point any pretense of objectivity was abandoned. The \nselection criteria were changed in 1985 so as to rule out the two \n``best'' sites identified by Dames & Moore. The new criteria gave \npreference to sites located on state-owned land. This change had the \neffect of virtually guaranteeing selection of a site somewhere in \nHudspeth County, large portions of which are owned by the state of \nTexas.\n  So the Waste Authority proceeded to designate, based on an informal \nand cursory process, five sites in Hudspeth County. Its clear choice, \nhowever, was Fort Hancock, one of the County's three poor Latino \ncommunities. Unfortunately for the Authority, the more politically \npowerful city of El Paso next door decided to fight back. Together with \nHudspeth County, El Paso filed suit against the site selection. They \nargued that the Fort Hancock site was located in an area of complex \ngeology--like Sierra Blanca, incidentally--and lay on a 100-year flood \nplain. The amazing thing is that they won. In 1991 U.S. District Court \nJudge Moody ruled in their favor and ordered that no dump could be \nbuilt in Fort Hancock, Hudspeth County.\n  But the County's court victory was short-lived. The Waste Authority \nwas clearly not about to give up. The Authority went back to the state \nlegislature to get around Judge Moody's decision by once again changing \nthe rules. A legislator from Houston, far to the East where the big \nutilities are based, proposed a bill that ignored all previous \nselection criteria and designated Fort Hancock once and for all. \nInterestingly enough, this maneuver aroused a great deal of public \nindignation, precisely because of the Authority's perceived \ndiscriminatory practice of dumping on Latino communities.\n  There was an impressive show of force against discrimination, but the \noutcome was not exactly what Hudspeth County had in mind. After Judge \nMoody's remarkable decision, lawyers for El Paso and the Waste \nAuthority worked out a compromise. Fort Hancock would be saved, but a \n400 square mile area further north in Hudspeth County would take its \nplace. This oblong rectangle imposed on the map--an area that included \nSierra Blanca--was subsequently dubbed ``The Box.'' The Texas \nlegislature passed the so-called ``Box Law'' by voice vote only days \nbefore the end of session in May 1991.\n  Once again, the previous site selection procedures were stripped \naway. The Box Law repealed the requirement that the dump had to be on \npublic land, the very requirement that had pointed the Authority \ntowards Hudspeth County in the first place. This was necessary because, \nat that time, the Sierra Blanca site was not public land at all. Most \nimportantly, to prevent another troublesome lawsuit like the Fort \nHancock debacle, the Box Law essentially stripped local citizens of the \nright to sue. It denied them all judicial relief other than an \ninjunction by the Texas Supreme Court itself, and for this unlikely \nprospect citizens would be required to drive 500 miles to Austin.\n  This story is depressingly familiar. A similar scenario unfolds over \nand over again in different parts of the country, with different names \nand faces in every case. Sometimes there is no intention by anyone to \ndiscriminate. But pervasive inequalities of race, income, and access to \nthe levers of political power exercise a controlling influence over the \nsiting of undesirable waste dumps. The people who make these decisions \nsometimes are only following the path of least resistance, but in far \ntoo many instances the result is a targeting of poor, politically \nmarginalized minority communities who lack the political muscle to do \nanything about it.\n\n  The remarkable thing about this story is that some people in Hudspeth \nCounty did fight back. Dell City fought back and won in the early \n1980s. Fort Hancock fought back and won their court case in 1991. And \nmake no mistake, the people of Sierra Blanca are fighting back, too. \nMany of them have been here on the Hill. Father Ralph Solis, the parish \npriest for Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County, was here in February, and \nhis delegation may have visited your office. These people know that the \nodds are stacked against them, but they are persevering just the same.\n  One of the amendments I included in this bill is intended to give \nthem a fighting chance. It gives them their day in court--the right to \nchallenge this site selection on grounds of environmental justice. It \nsays that the Compact cannot be implemented in any way--and that would \ninclude the siting process, the licensing process, or the shipment of \nwaste to the site--that discriminates against communities because of \ntheir race, national origin, or income level. If local residents can \nprove discrimination in court, then they can stop the Compact \nCommission from operating the dump. They don't have to prove intent, by \nthe way, although that certainly would be sufficient. All they have to \nshow is disparate treatment or disparate impact.\n  I know some of my colleagues don't believe issues of environmental \njustice are implicated here. Or they may think this is not a question \nfor the Senate to decide. I believe this amendment meets the concerns \nof those colleagues. All my amendment does is give local residents the \nright to make their case in court. There is no guarantee they will win. \nAfter all, it is extremely difficult to prove environmental \ndiscrimination. But I'm glad this amendment has been accepted as part \nof H.R. 629, and I certainly will insist that it be included in any \nfinal legislation passed by this body. I do not see how anyone would \nwant to deny these people a chance to make their case.\n  Short of defeating the bill outright, I believe passing this \namendment is the only way for us to do right by the people of Sierra \nBlanca. Yet, as amazing as it sounds, Compact proponents also claim to \nhave the best interests of Sierra Blanca at heart. They claim the \nCompact will protect local residents because it keeps out waste from \nstates other than Maine and Vermont. They have used this argument again \nand again, in Sierra Blanca, in the Texas legislature, in the House of \nRepresentatives, and they're using it again in the United States \nSenate. But this argument makes no sense. The dump does not have to be \nbuilt, it is indeed unlikely to be built without congressional consent \nto this Compact, and the Compact would not protect Sierra Blanca in any \nevent.\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\n  The point that keeps getting lost here is there's no compelling \nreason why the Sierra Blanca dump must be built. Some of you might have \nseen the headline in the New York Times on December 7 of last year: \n``Warning of Excess Capacity in Nation's Nuclear Dumps--New Technology \nand Recycling Sharply Reduce the Volume of Nuclear Waste.'' The article \ndiscusses a study by Dr. Gregory Hayden, the Nebraska Commissioner for \nthe Central Interstate Compact Commission. Dr. Hayden found that \n``there is currently an excess capacity for low-level radioactive waste \ndisposal in the US without any change to current law or practice.'' He \nwent on to explain, ``These disposal sites have had low utilization due \nto falling volumes since 1980. Thus, a high capacity remains for the \nfuture, without any change to the current configuration of which states \nmay ship to which disposal site.'' Let me repeat the essential point: \nthere is no compelling need for any new low-level radioactive waste \ndumps in this country. And if no new dump is built, nobody can argue \nthat the compact is needed to protect Sierra Blanca.\n\n  The most popular argument for building another dump involves disposal \nof medical waste. I'm sure all of you have heard it. It's claimed that \nwaste from medical facilities and research labs is getting backed up--\nthat it has to go somewhere. But let me emphasize one central and \nindisputable fact: over the last few years, over 99 percent of the \nwaste from Maine and Vermont has come from nuclear reactors. Less than \none percent has been from hospitals and universities. And from all \nthree states, 94 percent of the low-level waste between 1991 and 1994 \ncame from reactors. This dump is being built--first and foremost--to \ndispose of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors, not from hospitals.\n  So why are the nuclear utilities hiding behind hospitals and \nuniversities? It's not very hard to figure out. In 1984 the Texas Waste \nAuthority hired a public relations firm to increase the popularity of \nnuclear waste. The PR firm recommended, ``A more positive view of safe \ndisposal technologies should be engendered by the use of medical \ndoctors and university faculty scientists as public spokesmen for the \n[Texas Waste] Authority.'' ``Whenever possible,'' the report said, \n``the Authority should speak through these parties.'' Well, that advice \nhas been followed to the letter. We all have sympathies for hospital \nwork and university research. I know I do. But we cannot let those \nsympathies blind us to the existing excess capacity for disposal of \nlow-level waste.\n  Not only has there been no convincing demonstration of need for this \ndump, but odds are no dump will be built if the Compact fails. Let me \nquote from an article from the Texas Observer of last March: ``Texas \ngenerates nowhere near enough waste on its own to fill a three-million \ncubic feet dump, and by its own projections [the Texas Waste Authority] \ncould not survive without Maine and Vermont's waste.'' Moreover, there \nare indications the Texas legislature will not appropriate funding to \nbuild the dump if Congress rejects this Compact. Texas lawmakers \nrefused the Waste Authority's request for $37 million for construction \nmoney in FY 1998 and FY 1999. In fact, the Texas House initially zeroed \nout all funding for the Authority, but funding for licensing was later \nrestored in conference committee. My understanding is that construction \nfunding was made contingent on passage of the Compact, whereupon Maine \nand Vermont will each be required to pay Texas over $25 million.\n  Supporters of the Compact are trying to have it both ways. When \nchallenged about the environmental justice of targeting Sierra Blanca, \nthey respond that no site has been selected, and environmental justice \ncan only be addressed if and when that ever happens. Then in the \nsame breath they insist that the dump in Sierra Blanca is definitely \ngoing forward and the Compact is therefore necessary to protect local \nresidents from outside waste. So which is it? Either the Sierra Blanca \ndump is a done deal or it's not. The truth is, the most likely scenario \nis that the dump will be built in Sierra Blanca if Congress approves \nthis Compact, subject to any legal challenges, but the project will not \ngo forward if the Compact is rejected.\n\n  Even if the dump is built, however, the Compact does not protect \nSierra Blanca. The Compact Commission would be able to accept low-level \nradioactive waste from any person, state, regional body, or group of \nstates. All it would take is a majority vote of the Commissioners, who \nare appointed by the Compact state governors. Why should the people of \nSierra Blanca expect unelected commissioners to keep waste out of their \ncommunity? Is there anything in their recent experience that would \njustify such faith?\n  The fact is, the state will have every economic incentive to bring in \nmore waste. The November 1997 report by Dr. Hayden concluded that ``the \nsmall volume of waste available for any new site would not allow the \nfacility to take advantage of economies of scale. Thus, it would not \neven be able to operate at the low-cost portion of its own cost \nfunctions.'' The new dump will need high volume to stay profitable. The \nTexas Observer reports, ``A 1994 analysis by the Houston Business \nJournal suggests that the Authority would open the facility to other \nstates to keep it viable.''\n  We have here the potential for establishing a new national repository \nfor low-level nuclear waste. Not only will Texas have an incentive to \nbring in as much waste as possible, but the same will be true of \nnuclear utilities. The more waste goes to Sierra Blanca, the less they \nwill be charged for disposal. Rick Jacobi, General Manager of the Texas \nWaste Authority, told the Houston Business Journal: ``The site is \ndesigned for 100,000 cubic feet per year, which would be about $160 per \ncubic foot. But if only 60,000 cubic feet per year of waste arrives, \nthe price would be $250 per cubic foot.'' That's a big difference. As \nMolly Ivins says, ``That sure would drive up costs for Houston Lighting \nand Power and Texas Utilities.'' And the going rate at one existing \ndump is a whopping $450 per cubic foot. In the end, it will be in the \neconomic interest of everyone--from the nuclear utilities to the Waste \nAuthority--to ship as much waste to Sierra Blanca as they can.\n  My second amendment addresses this problem. Throughout the process of \napproving the Compact, supporters claimed the waste would be limited to \nthree states. I want to hold them to that promise. My amendment puts \nthat promise in writing. I doubt anyone would disagree that this \nunderstanding was shared by everyone who participated in the Compact \ndebate. If Compact supporters truly plan to limit waste to three \nstates, which has been everyone's understanding all along, they can \nhave no objection to my amendment. It's nothing but a protection \nclause. A nearly identical amendment--called the Doggett Amendment--was \nattached to the bill passed by the House. I am pleased that the Senate \nhas accepted my amendment, but I will insist that it be included in any \nfinal legislation passed by this Congress.\n  There are other issues I will not be able to address with amendments. \nI think there is a fundamental concern about whether this kind of \ndisposal is safe at all. The League of Conservation Voters warns that, \ndespite the hazards involved, waste will be buried in soil trenches \ndestined to leak, as have nuclear dumps in Kentucky, Illinois, and \nNevada. LCV did score the House vote on final passage, and has \nannounced that it may score Senate votes as well.\n\n  There is also an obvious concern about the unsuitability of Sierra \nBlanca's geology--the exclusionary criterion from the 1985 Dames & \nMoore report. Sierra Blanca is situated right in the middle of the \nstate's only earthquake zone. Its 1993 license application stated that \nthis is ``the most tectonically active area within the state of \nTexas.'' In April 1995 there was a 5.6 earthquake 100 miles away, in \nAlpine, Texas. And there have been two tremors in the area in the last \nfour years.\n  The concern about the environmental impact of this dump extends well \nbeyond the border. The Mexican equivalent of the EPA announced its \nopposition on March 5 on grounds that the Sierra Blanca dump poses an \nenvironmental risk to the border region. On February 11, the Mexican \nCongress, represented by its Permanent Commission, declared ``that the \nproject in Sierra Blanca in Texas, and all such dumping projects along \nthe border with\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nMexico, constitute an aggression against national dignity.'' Moreover, \nthe project apparently violates the 1983 La Paz Agreement between \nMexico and the U.S., which commits both countries to prevent pollution \naffecting the border area.\n  My paramount concern, however, and the reason I have resisted a time \nagreement on this bill, was that I could not stand by and watch while a \npoor, politically powerless, Latino community was targeted to become \nthe premier repository of low-level nuclear waste for the entire \ncountry. Much less give it my blessing. Not when I have the power to do \nsomething about it. At the very least, the amendments I included in \nthis bill will keep Sierra Blanca from becoming a national dump, and \nwill give local residents their day in court to seek elusive relief \nfrom environmental discrimination.\n  I hope my amendments accomplish something more than that, as well. I \nhope they keep alive the spirit of community this controversy has \nignited. The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins has written that ``this is \ncommunity action and local organizing at its very best.'' I couldn't \nagree more. We have to maintain grass-roots pressure on the House or \nthe conference committee, as case may be, to keep these amendments in \nthe bill. And I hope the residents of Sierra Blanca will continue this \nstruggle in every forum possible. I do believe they have right on their \nside, and I am still naive enough to hope and believe that right can \nbeat might, and that justice can prevail against the odds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3233-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a remarkable \nwoman who was hailed as the ``grand dame of community action'' by her \nlocal paper upon her passing: Willene Everett of Meriden, Connecticut. \nSadly, Mrs. Everett died this past summer at the age of 74.\n  For 31 years, Mrs. Everett worked at the Meriden Community Action \nAgency, where she headed the Elderly Nutrition Program for 15 years and \nthe children's Summer Lunch Program for 10 years. She packed a lifetime \nworth of achievement into her tenure at the Agency, but her life was \nfilled with many great experiences and accomplishments before she took \nthis job.\n  Her job experience ranged from working as a beautician to a \nmortician. And perhaps the most noteworthy of these was her experience \nin the military, where she served in France, Germany and England during \nWorld War II as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Army.\n  But most of us in Connecticut will always associate Willene Everett \nwith her work at the Community Action Center in Meriden. During her 31 \nyear tenure, she made countless contributions. She helped to feed 1,500 \npeople a day--both young and old. She also took the time to do the \nlittle things that brighten people's lives: sending birthday or get \nwell cards to patrons of the Center, setting up a recipe exchange at \nwork, traveling through snow storms to make sure that people at the \nCenter had their breakfast and coffee.\n  Her work extended far beyond the Senior Center. She was President of \n``The Laurel Club,'' a social club known for its charitable work and \nefforts to provide scholarship funds for young African-Americans in the \nMeriden area. She was also active in the local NAACP and YWCA.\n  Her efforts did not go unrecognized. She was invited to and attended \na White House Conference on Aging African-Americans during the Carter \nAdministration. Among her awards, she received the YWCA's ``Woman in \nLeadership Award,'' the ``Woman of the Year'' by the Girls' Club, and \nthe ``State of Connecticut General Assembly Award'' in recognition of \nher civic and charitable work. In addition, the dining hall at the \nSeniors Center in Meriden has been named ``Willene's Place'' and a \nscholarship fund bearing her name is being established in her honor.\n  By renaming the dining hall and creating this scholarship fund, \nWillene Everett's name will carry on. But for those who knew her, there \nis no need for any form of tribute to ensure her remembrance. She was a \ncaring and compassionate person, and she will never be forgotten by the \npeople of Meriden, whose lives she touched and brightened.\n  Willene Everett is survived by her husband Edward and her children \nJoAnn and Steven. She was a loving wife and mother, and this year would \nhave actually marked her 50th wedding anniversary. She is dearly \nmissed, and I offer my heartfelt condolences to her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3236-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2709\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for calling up \nthe nomination of Ivan Lemelle to the District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana.\n  Judge Lemelle's nomination has been pending over a year. When the \nChief Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana testified in May 1996 \nthat the vacancies on that Court should not be filled, it put this \nnomination on hold. I only wish that when the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States says that we need more judges, when Chief Judges in the \nSecond Circuit and other Circuits and Districts say that they need \ntheir vacancies filled without further delay, we would listen to them.\n  Judge Sear has recently written a letter to Senator Breaux that \nreports that his Court now unanimously votes to fill the two vacancies \nin that District. I know that as a Magistrate Judge Ivan Lemelle has \nalready contributed to the administration of justice in that District. \nIt is high time to provide him the opportunity to contribute more fully \nto handling the District's caseload.\n  I congratulate and thank Senator Breaux and Senator Landrieu for \ntheir effective advocacy in support of this nomination.\n  Before adjourning for a two-week recess, it is important for the \nSenate to clear its calendar of nominations to the maximum extent \npossible. We made some progress today. I have been urging the Majority \nLeader to move judicial nominations through the Senate and I thank him \nfor moving Judge Lemelle.\n  As the Senate recesses, seven judicial nominations still remain on \nthe calendar awaiting Senate action. With this additional confirmation, \nthe Senate will still have confirmed only 20 judges for the year in \nwhich the Federal courts have experienced 100 vacancies. So, while I \nthank the Senate for its actions today, I must note that we have not \nended the crisis of which the Chief Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court warned in his most recent year end report.\n  Most troubling to me are the continuing vacancies on the Second \nCircuit. I deeply regret the Senate's unwillingness to vote upon the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit or to provide \nhearings for Judge Rosemary Pooler, Robert Sack and Chester Straub. I \nlook forward to action on these and the other judicial nominees left \npending before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3237-5", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2843) directing the Administrator of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration to reevaluate the equipment \n     in medical kits carried on, and to make a decision regarding \n     automatic external defibrillators to be carried on, aircraft \n     operated by air carriers, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Commerce Committee has agreed to \ndischarge H.R. 2843, the Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998. The \ncompanion Senate bill, S. 1584, was introduced by Senators Frist and \nDorgan and was also referred to the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chairman. There is one point I want to make \nabout the bill. The report accompanying the House version of H.R. 2843, \nHouse Report 105-456, notes that the Federal Aviation Administration \n(FAA) has the discretion not to require defibrillators on aircraft with \na payload capacity of more than 7,500 pounds, or at small airports. The \nreport goes on to indicate that the smaller aircraft, less than the \nsize of major carrier jets, typically have ``relatively narrow aisles \nand limited open floor space at the entry door and in the service \nareas.'' Is it the Senator's understanding that the FAA has the \ndiscretion not to require defibrillators on small aircraft typically \nused by the regional airlines?\n  Senator McCAIN. That is my understanding.\n  Senator FORD. So for example, the FAA could require the use of \ndefibrillators on board a Boeing 747, but has the discretion not to do \nso for classes of aircraft, like regional jets or turbo prop aircraft. \nIs that correct?\n  Senator FRIST. If I could indicate to the Chairman and other members, \nit is the intention of the authors of the bill to provide the FAA with \nthe ability to make just that sort of determination. The bill clearly \ngives the\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nFAA the ability to use its judgement, to take into account many \nfactors, in determining the size and type of aircraft, subject to any \ndefibrillator requirement. For example, the report accompanying the \nHouse bill talks about the ability of smaller aircraft to land in the \nevent of an emergency more quickly than larger aircraft because they \nneed shorter runways. The report ``urges the FAA to consider these \nfactors in deciding where to draw the the line''.\n  Senator McCAIN. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues to clarify \nthe intent of the bill.\n  Senator FORD. I thank the Chairman and my colleagues.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When the Senate reconvenes from the Easter holidays, we \nthen will resume consideration of the Coverdell education A+ bill. In \naddition, it is hoped the Senate will be able to consider the NATO \nenlargement treaty the first week after the Senate reconvenes. I want \nto emphasize again that that will be done only after careful \nconsideration of the arguments of those who are for the treaty \nenlargement and also the arguments of those who are opposed. We want to \nmake sure we have ample time for all the arguments to be heard on both \nsides. So we will work early in the week to make sure we get a time \nagreement that is satisfactory.\n  We also hope to take up the State Department Reauthorization \nConference Report under a time agreement.\n  As earlier announced, there will be no rollcall votes on the Monday \nthat we return, so the next votes then will occur on Tuesday, April 21, \nat 10 a.m. The Senate could consider further votes on Tuesday morning \nas a result of debate on the Coverdell education bill, because we do \nhave 15 amendments that could be offered as well as second-degree \namendments to those. Senators should expect votes throughout the day of \nTuesday, April 21, and we will begin early in the morning and we will \ngo potentially late into the night that day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/03/senate-section/article/S3238-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1998, AT 11 A.M.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
