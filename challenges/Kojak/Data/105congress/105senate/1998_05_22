Mr. President, I rise today with a very heavy \nheart. Yesterday, Senator Wyden, my colleague from across the aisle, \nand I were confronted with news of a tragedy in our State that was, \nfrankly, in my mind, quite unimaginable.\n  The Willamette Valley of Oregon is perhaps one of the most beautiful \nplaces in the world. It is surrounded by mountains with snowcaps and \nclear streams running through it. It is filled with farmers and \nloggers, college professors and students, people working in State \ngovernment. It is truly an Eden on Earth.\n  But yesterday, a most mindless and senseless act was committed that \nleaves me, frankly, speechless. A young man, obviously very troubled, \non the way to school killed his parents and then took three weapons \ninto his school cafeteria at Thurston High School in Springfield, where \nhe opened up and killed 1 student and injured nearly 30 others. This \noccurred before a wounded student tackled him and held him to the \nground.\n  I don't have words to express the outrage I feel or the heartache \nthat I feel for the families, for the victims, for this community, for \nmy State, for my country, at this outrageous and despicable act.\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\n  Yesterday, Senator Wyden and I were asked to be on program after \nprogram, and we declined, because it was not a day for pontificating \nabout policy or political posturing. It was a day for grief and \nmourning. I reach out to my State. I cannot be there physically, but my \nheart is with you and I am in agony with you. It becomes all of us here \nand in any place in government not to pick a single issue and say that \nis why, but to look at the strings that run from Springfield to \nJonesboro or in any other community in this State and to find out what \nis happening with the youth of America whereby they solve their \nproblems by resorting to this kind of violence.\n  We must have the courage to face all of the possibilities. It isn't \njust the school. It isn't just the gun. It isn't just the family. It \nisn't any of these things in isolation, but it is all of them together.\n  I, for one, reach across to my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, \nand every other member of the Oregon delegation in this Congress, and \nto our Governor, and to school officials and to parents in Oregon and \nacross this country and say, let's figure it out and let's try to \nprevent it from occurring again. This does not belong in America. The \nanswers start with us.\n  The answers start in our hearts and in our homes, in our \nlegislatures, in this Capitol building, but it starts with us as \nindividuals to find out how to say no to this in the future and to \nprevent it. We are doing many things to punish, and those are \nappropriate things. It is time to do more to prevent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  As Senator Smith has said, the people of Oregon are grieving this \nmorning. Our hearts are out to them. This is a time when all of us from \nSpringfield, OR, to Springfield, MA, have to take a few moments out \nfrom our daily routine and reflect on what has happened in our home \nState. This is supposed to be a joyous time of year for kids in high \nschool. They think about summer vacations and plans, time with family. \nOnce again, however, our country has been rocked by unspeakable \nviolence. I think all of us know that young people get upset and they \ndo foolish things. But that is not what this is about.\n  In times past, when young people got angry, they might throw a rock, \nthey might throw a fist, but there was not this pattern of deadly gun \nviolence. And so now it is critically important as we grieve for the \npeople of our home State--my staff has been trying to help, giving \nblood, assisting others in the community, but it is especially \nimportant now to get beyond the kind of finger pointing and the sort of \nblame game that inevitably takes place here and look to how these \ntragedies can be prevented in the future.\n  I share Senator Smith's judgment that this is about what is in our \nheart. It is about taking every possible step in the schools, in the \nfamily, through the education and health programs and through law \nenforcement programs, to protect our citizens and to reach out to those \nyoung people in trouble. That way we have a chance to restore safety in \nour communities and peace of mind for parents who, right now across \nthis country, because of Springfield and the previous tragedies, are \ngoing to get up in the morning saying to themselves: What is going to \nhappen at my child's school today? We cannot have that. No Member of \nthe Senate can abide by that. And that, to me, is our central challenge \ntoday.\n  Oregonians have come together in the last 24 hours to do what we \nalways do best, and that is to help friends and neighbors in a time of \ngreat need. We have seen an extraordinary outpouring of concern in \nSpringfield towards families. It is not possible to find any real \ncomfort at a time like this, but if you can feel hopeful--we have got \nto get up every morning working to make this a better world and a safer \nworld--we can take some comfort in knowing that communities like \nSpringfield do work. They are getting up this morning and saying that \nthey are going to try to reach out to everybody in that community, to \ntry to do everything possible to heal in Springfield and our home State \nbut, even more importantly, to do everything they can to make sure that \ntragedies like this do not happen again in Oregon or anywhere else.\n  That is what we need to work for in this Chamber. Government policies \ncan help, and with the government being a better partner, and families \nand schools and communities rallying, as Springfield has, we can make a \ndifference and we can stop this carnage in our schools.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5359-6", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MOMENT OF SILENCE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on the \nconference report on H.R. 2400, the ISTEA reauthorization legislation. \nI regret that I am unable to be here to vote on this important piece of \nlegislation, but I must depart momentarily to speak to the 25th \nAnniversary Reunion of Vietnam-Era Prisoners of War in Dallas, Texas.\n  If I were able to record my vote, however, I would vote against this \nconference agreement. This legislation is likely the most pork-laden \nlegislation ever to be considered by Congress in the 20th Century. This \nconference report should be defeated, despite the inclusion of many \nimportant and commendable provisions.\n  I cannot support this conference report despite the fact that it does \ninclude significant motor carrier, highway and boating safety \ninitiatives developed by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation. The Commerce Committee conferees, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Stevens, and I, worked diligently and responsibly to ensure \nthat effective truck safety inspection and enforcement activities are \ncontinued, that safety initiatives on motor vehicle occupant protection \nare created, and that recreational boating activities are advanced.\n  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation portion of the \nconference report also requires the National Highway Traffic and Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA) to change existing passenger car air bag \nstandards so that the risks air bags pose to infants, children, and \nother individuals are minimized. I also want to take this opportunity \nto express my personal thanks to Senator Kempthorne. Without his \ninvolvement, I doubt our efforts to improve passenger car air bags \nwould have succeeded as they did.\n  Yet despite these notable achievements, I regret I cannot support the \nISTEA reauthorization conference report. I object for several key \nreasons: the budgetary offsets, donor state inequity, and pork barrel \nspending.\n  On April 2nd, I reluctantly voted for an amendment sponsored by \nSenators Domenici, Lott, and Craig on the Balanced Budget Act which \nproposed to transfer approximately $10.5 billion over five years from \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans' tobacco-related \ndiseases to pay for the transportation reauthorization legislation. In \npart, I did this because I believe that the tobacco companies, rather \nthan the taxpayers, should bear the burden for veterans' tobacco-\nrelated diseases caused partially by smoking and using other tobacco \nproducts while they were in military service.\n  Military service did not force servicemembers to smoke, but I do \nacknowledge that for morale reasons, the services made cigarettes \navailable for free or at inexpensive prices. The services also give \nservicemembers condoms and birth control pills at no cost to military \npersonnel, but that does not mean that they want our men and women in \nuniform to be promiscuous.\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\n  As a conferee on this multi-year highway funding reauthorization \nbill, I have refused to support or sign the ISTEA conference report. As \nI mentioned earlier, of the three reasons for my opposition, the \nshifting of critical veterans funding to perpetuate donor state \ninequity and support the pork barrel spending in this massive highway \nbill is egregious.\n  Additionally, I will seek to ensure that any tobacco bill that passes \nthe Senate includes money for the veterans health care system to help \nreimburse the costs of treating veterans with tobacco-related diseases. \nOur nation's veterans should not be excluded from payments by tobacco \ncompanies for health care costs associated with tobacco-related \ndiseases. The failure to address the tobacco-related health care needs \nof our men and women who faithfully served their country in uniform \nwould be wrong.\n  Congress cannot continue to rob from veterans, whose programs have \nbeen seriously underfunded for years, to pay for a bill that ranks as \nthe largest pork-barrel spending bill ever written.\n  Two months ago during the debate on the McCain/Mack/Graham/ Thurmond/\nCoats/Brownback/Kyl amendment, I discussed the history of highway bill \ndemonstration projects. Those remarks are as relevant today as they \nwere two months ago, because if we adopt this conference report as \npresently written, we will shatter all pork-barrel spending records.\n  In 1982, the highway bill had 10 demonstration projects, costing a \ntotal of $362 million. In 1987, 152 demonstration projects were \ncreated, costing a total of $1.4 billion. In 1991, what was then felt \nto be the mother lode of all demo project bills, the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation and Efficiency Act (ISTEA), 538 location-specific \nprojects totaling $6.23 billion were created.\n  Where are we today? H.R. 2400 doesn't just double the number of \nlocation-specific project, but it more than triples the number of \nearmarked projects. The bill individually targets more than 1,850 \nprojects. The costs have risen as well. H.R. 2400 sets aside more than \n$9 billion to pay for these 1,850 specified highway projects. That is \n$9 billion of highway funding that Congress is mandating the states \nallocate to carry out whimsical projects. That is $9 billion that \nstates cannot allocate to those infrastructure projects they deem most \nappropriate. Scores of other projects are listed in other sections of \nthe legislation.\n  A new name has even been created. We used to hear about \n``demonstration'' projects and ``innovative'' projects. Under H.R. \n2400, we now have ``high priority projects.'' Just what is a ``high \npriority'' project? Let me mention just a few examples of the type of \nproject that the conferees believe are definitive projects.\n  Funds are included to initiate ``traffic calming projects'' in West \nPalm Beach, Florida and Fauquier County, Virginia. Money is included to \nbuild a coal heritage trail in West Virginia. Millions of dollars are \nset aside in selected towns throughout the country to construct \nlocation-specific bike paths. If traffic calming activities and \nconstructing boardwalks fail in some minds to qualify as a ``high \npriority'' project, there's always the funding set aside to produce a \ndocumentary film on infrastructure.\n  I fail to see how items like these can seriously be considered \n``high'' transportation priorities.\n  Priorities are traditionally established after thorough review and \ndiscussion. While our colleagues in the other body maintain that their \nprojects were selected after a review process, I do know that the \nprocess in the Senate was not.\n  At 5:30 last night, Senate transportation aides received an e-mail \nmessage announcing that a limited number of Senate high priority \nprojects were about to be added to the conference report. \nTransportation aides were advised to inform the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee if their members wanted any projects earmarked. Staff \nwas advised that no more than half of the proposed State allocation \namount should be earmarked. Explicit direction was provided on how a \nMember might make such a request, including that it must be in writing \nand the description of the project must not exceed 216 characters. In \naddition, a name and phone number was provided where staff could call \nto find out just how much extra money had been set aside for their \nstate.\n  Mr. President, this borders on the absurd. What ever happened to \nfunding projects based on legitimate needs?\n  Mr. President, this reauthorization would be comical if it weren't \nsuch an abrogation of our responsibilities to the American taxpayer.\n  I am not alone in my disdain for this raid on the highway trust fund. \nPublic interest groups have strongly criticized projects like these. \nThe Heritage Foundation recently called on Congress to eliminate the \nHouse earmarks and to ``instead allow each state to use its share of \nthe highway trust fund for projects that meet locally and state \ndetermined needs and priorities.'' Citizens Against Government Waste \nstates that the House-passed legislation ``guarantees that federal \nhighway dollars will continue to be doled out to regions with political \nmuscle, rather than to areas that truly need it.''\n  Two of the originally-stated goals in ISTEA's reauthorization were to \npromote state highway funding flexibility and to utilize limited \nresources responsibly. Rather than perpetuate Congressional earmarks, \nwe should place our confidence in our elected Governors' and Mayors' \ndecision-making capabilities. Local- and state-elected officials should \nmake the final decisions on local and state roads.\n  Lastly, I remain concerned over donor state equity. Currently, \ntaxpayers living in donor states are forced to subsidize transportation \nprojects in donee states. Arizona, for example, receives only about 85 \ncents for every gas-tax dollar it contributes to the highway trust \nfund. The 85-cent return ratio is reality despite the fact that the \noriginal ISTEA legislation ``guaranteed,'' and I stress the word \nguaranteed, donor states a 90-cent return by 1997. The 1991 \n``guarantee'' simply was never fulfilled.\n  Now donor states are being told the new funding formula will \nguarantee they'll receive 90.5 cents back for every gas tax dollar sent \nto Washington. That's a mere half-penny increase over the 1991 \nguarantee that was never realized.\n  Today, many of our colleagues will announce that the conference \nreport provides critical funding to meet the transportation needs ``for \nthe 21st Century.'' The conferees have gone so far as to entitle the \nbill ``the Transportation Equity Act'' yet nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. We will be told the dramatic increase in highway \nspending--a portion of which I remind my colleagues comes at the \nexpense of veterans programs and other domestic activities--will fill a \ncritical gap in transportation spending. Yet I ask my colleagues, how \ncan anyone realistically believe that a half-penny hike will meet the \ntransportation needs for the fastest growing states in the nation. \nStates like Arizona and Nevada are not being treated fairly or \nreasonably.\n  Mr. President, the only guarantee that donor states should expect \nfrom this legislation is that they will continue to subsidize road \nprojects in other states for the next six years.\n  Mr. President, I also want to mention a purely procedural matter \nwhich deeply concerns me. When staff of the Senate conferees first met \non the legislation, the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation was told specifically that several projects designated \nin the House-passed bill were squarely within our jurisdiction. The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in essence gave those projects \nover to the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee never resolved \nthose issues, so I was quite surprised to see that the projects that \nEPW specifically gave over to Commerce Committee to handle quietly \nfound their way into the conference report we debate today.\n  I also formally protest the Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee and Environment and Public Works Committee conferees' \ninclusion of a provision which is squarely within the Commerce \nCommittee's jurisdiction. Those conferees included language to exempt \nwinter home heating oil delivery drivers from hours of service \nregulations for the next two years.\n  Let me be very clear. The Environment and Public Works Committee has \nno jurisdiction over federal motor carrier safety regulations governing \nhours\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\nof service. Federal hours of service regulations are the primary \nprotection for the traveling public against truck drivers being forced \nto drive excessive hours in a fatigued condition. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee has sole jurisdiction over hours of service and the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee not only didn't ask for our \ninput in the issue, but surreptitiously snuck it into the bill.\n  As a conferee on the legislation I find this action reprehensible. As \nthe Chairman of the Commerce Committee I find action inexcusable. And I \nassure my colleagues that this Senator will not let this action stand \nand I pledge that I will do all that I can to have this provision \nstripped from the legislation.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is a sham. The so-called \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century is a fraud. We should \nnot fool taxpayers into believing that this legislation is anything \nmore than a raid on gasoline tax dollars at the expense of veterans \nbenefits. I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5360-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5362-S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, when we return a week from Monday, from \nthe Memorial Day recess, we will revisit the tobacco debate, and at \nthat point I, along with my colleague from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and my \ncolleague from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, will offer an amendment to the \ntobacco bill that would create a new section. The section we will be \noffering as suggested additional legislation for the tobacco bill will \nbe a section on drug abuse and addiction.\n  Mr. President, to me it is illogical--and I have been puzzled \nthroughout the debate--that we would be talking about teenage addiction \nin the context of tobacco only. It is not good policy to talk about \nteenage addiction and leave out the single, most important crisis that \nteenagers face today, which is drug addiction, drug abuse, and the \nswirling epidemic that has engulfed our Nation. If we are going to talk \nabout addiction, we must include a component that deals with the \nNation's No. 1 teenage problem.\n  Mr. President, in the last 7 years teenage drug abuse has increased \nby 135 percent--135 percent. Tobacco usage has increased as well--40 \npercent. That is significant, and we must attack that but not by being \nsilent on a new drug epidemic in the United States. In 1979, 14.1 \npercent of the population age 12 to 17 were involved in drug use--that \nis 3.3 million. The Nation got serious and it said we cannot accept \nthis. And by the year 1992, drug use had been driven down by two-\nthirds, from 14.1 percent down to 5.3 percent. This is important on a \ncouple of points. First, it demonstrates to the Nation that you can do \nsomething about this. There are many in our community who would argue, \nwell, we have just been fighting this forever and it doesn't do any \ngood. That is totally wrong.\n\n  We have demonstrated as a Nation if we get focused on this problem, \npay attention to it, and if we do the right things, we will keep people \nfrom being entrapped by drug use. We went from 14.1 percent down to 5.3 \npercent. In other words, instead of 3.3 million children getting caught \nup in this, we have taken it down to 1 million--a two-thirds reduction. \nAnd then we got lazy. We quit talking about it. We made light of it. \nThe interdiction was reduced. The drug czar's office was closed, for \nall practical purposes. We mothballed Coast Guard ships in the \nCaribbean. We turned our back on this problem. And what happened? Well, \nwe should not be surprised. We are moving right back to 1979. You quit \ntalking about it, you reduce the effort on the border, you shrink up \nthe resources, and our youngsters get the idea that it is not \ndangerous. In the meantime, the cartels have become ever more \nsophisticated, generating ever more resources. They have as good a \ndistribution system in this country as some of our most famous brands.\n  At a hearing recently, we had representation from Customs, from the \nJustice Department, and from the FBI. I asked them at the end of the \nhearing, ``How recently have you been to a school?'' Well, none of them \nhad been recently. I said, ``You ought to do it.'' Mr. President, if \nyou want to know what is going on, go into any school and 12-years-olds \ncan tell you the whole story. They can tell you how few minutes it \ntakes to buy them. They can tell you that they are prevalent \neverywhere. They can tell you the name brands of all of them. And when \nyou ask them what the most serious problem is, a few will hold up their \nhands on various issues--alcohol, cigarettes--but they all hold up \ntheir hands in unison when you say, ``Are drugs the most serious \nproblem you face?'' All the hands go up. I challenge anybody to do it. \nThey will get the same answer.\n  Those kids, I think, are wondering what we are doing about it, what \nis this Nation doing about it? It is time for a bold response. And \nthroughout this entire debate, there has been silence on this massive \nproblem. One in four students in high school today in the United States \nis using drugs regularly. One in nine in junior high is using drugs \nregularly. Eight out of ten prisoners in any jail in America, anywhere \nin America, are there on a drug-related charge--direct or indirect. \nThis is fueling crime in our country, with enormous cost consequences, \nand we are taking millions of casualties. If this evil force wore a \nuniform, we would have declared war on it.\n  What else would take down a million kids--a million, and it is \nincreasing--that would produce 100,000 crack babies every year and \nthousands of deaths--14,000 a year?\n  The silence has been deafening, just deafening. We have been in a \nstruggle with the administration over this, asking them to step \nforward. We are finally just moving on our own. The plan that they have \ngiven us says we are going to have an accountability period in the year \n2006. The first measurement would occur in 2002. That is 2 years into \nthe next Presidency. We need to be aggressive now. My colleague, in a \nmoment, will describe in his 10-minute period the bold response.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, why have we spent the last 3 days on the \nfloor talking about tobacco? Nearly everyone who has come to the floor \nto talk about tobacco has said we have to get it out of the hands of \nteenagers. There are two reasons we are on the floor talking about \ntobacco. First of all, it is darn good politics, and, secondly, we are \nmad at the tobacco companies and we are going to act in a very punitive \nfashion because they lied to us. They withheld information as to the \naddictiveness of nicotine, and we are angry as a public, angry as a \ngoverning body. We are going to inflict upon them a very punitive \naction, and we are going to do it in the name of teenagers--thousands \nof young people every day picking up a cigarette.\n  I am not belittling it, I am recognizing it. We need to try to get \ntobacco and the substance within it, nicotine, out of the hands of our \nteenagers. But thousands of teenagers today who start smoking today \nwill not die tomorrow. Let me repeat that. The thousands of teenagers \nthat we are all talking about--and, boy, have we heard it on the floor \nin the last few days--who pick up a cigarette today will not die \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, young people who engage in the use of drugs can die \ntomorrow. As my colleague from Georgia said, thousands are dying each \nyear in violent actions and crimes related to drug use and drug \nassociations. Yet, we stand silently by. The administration dropped the \nball and walked away, and, finally, my colleague from Georgia rose up \nand said, wait a moment here, what in the heck are we doing as a \ncountry and as a policymaking body? If we are going to do all these \ngreat things for kids to get the cigarette out of their hand, why in \nthe heck don't we get crack cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamines out of \ntheir hands because it kills them--not 30 years down the road.\n  By the way, if you start smoking today, you have a chance to live, \nbecause you can quit down the road. But if you start crack cocaine \ntoday, you will probably die on the street in a month or two for one \nreason or another, because you are stealing the money to get the crap \nthat is called crack, or you are shot in some transaction that went \nbad.\n  That is how teenagers in America are dying today. The statistics that \nwere just given by my colleague from Georgia about seventh graders and \neighth\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\ngraders is real. I have done the same thing that Paul Coverdell has \ndone. I have gone to the schools of Idaho. I go to them regularly \nanyway. I spend a lot of time talking with teenagers, kids, and when I \nask the question, ``What is your problem?'' the hands go up with drugs. \nMost of the hands go up.\n  The Senator from Georgia is right. They know who sells it, and where \nyou can get them. If they had a brand name on them, they would know the \nbrand. Most importantly, if they had a brand name on them and they were \nbeing trafficked in the market today, we would be here going after the \ncompanies that were selling them because it would be killing our kids.\n  But today we are angry. We are mad. We are going to be vindictive. We \nare after the tobacco companies. We are after their big money to fuel \nbig government. I am not going to vote for a big tobacco bill. I am \ngoing to vote to get cigarettes out of the hands of teenagers. It is \nthe right thing to do.\n  But if we stand silently by and let what is described by my colleague \nfrom Georgia as the most significant epidemic amongst our youngsters go \nunspoken to and uncorrected, then we have erred grievously; we have \nerred grievously as policymakers.\n  New polls are out. When you ask parents what they are worried about, \nhere is what they say: Thirty-nine percent, using illegal drugs. \nThirty-nine percent of the American public say that is the No. 1 \nproblem. Sixteen percent say joining a gang. Nine percent say drinking \nalcohol. Why? You get drunk, you get in the car, and you kill somebody, \nand you kill yourself.\n  Why then are we on the floor to spend weeks and millions of dollars \ntrying to reach out and get billions of dollars out of tobacco? I will \ntell you why. Because it is good politics. Yet only 3 percent of the \nAmerican people say they worry about it when they worry about their \nkids.\n  It is time we speak out. That is what my colleague from Georgia, my \ncolleague from Michigan, and I are doing. We will have an amendment on \nthe tobacco bill that will deal with this issue, or there will be no \ntobacco bill.\n  We must wake up the White House, wake up our Government, and wake up \nthis policy body to what we are about to do. Here is what we want to \ndo. We want to attach legislation that deals with this issue in a most \nsignificant way targeting three primary areas: Attacking the supply of \ndrugs by strengthening our ability to stop them at the border; pull the \nmothballed Coast Guard fleet out and put it back in the water. Bill \nClinton put it there. The heck with Bill Clinton. Put the money back \nin. Get them out in the water, and stop by interdiction. That is what \nour amendment does.\n  Second, we want to provide additional resources to fight drugs that \nreach our neighborhoods. Give the tools to the law enforcement \ncommunities and the schools and the communities at large to join \ntogether to block grant and create their own initiative along with our \ndirected initiatives to get at the problem at the local level.\n  Then the third thing is to create disincentives for teen use of \nillegal drugs.\n  Those are the three major areas that will be involved in what we are \nabout to do. We are going to spend a lot of time on the floor week \nafter next until this proposal, this amendment, is part of the overall \nbill that will move, I believe, out of here.\n  So what do we have to do? When it comes to the supply side, we have \nto go straight at it. We have to deal with interdiction. We have to \nstrengthen the borders. We have to stop slashing Coast Guard budgets \nand put some money back in it.\n  We talked about a 53-percent decline from 1992 to 1995 in the ability \nof the Coast Guard to reach out and interdict. That simply has to stop. \nOur amendment does exactly that.\n\n  Our amendment also includes the Border-Free Drug Act, which attacks \n70 percent of the illegal drugs that enter the United States across the \nUnited States-Mexican border--70 percent of the drugs that are killing \nour kids on the street today, not 20 years down the road--today coming \nacross the border from Mexico to the United States.\n  So why not put more people on the borders? I think we ought to. We \nought to strengthen the Immigration and Naturalization Service to hire \nBorder Patrol agents to deal with the trafficking and get at the \nbusiness of going at it. For example, our amendment increases the \nresources available to DEA and the FBI.\n  An additional section of our amendment is the Money Laundering \nPrevention Act.\n  Finally, last week this administration announced a major break in \ndrug laundering with Mexican banks. We have arrested a few people. And \nwe are trying to get the cooperation of the Mexican Government now \nbecause the money is big. How big? We are trying to get $800 billion \naway from the tobacco companies to spend on big government and some \nadvertising that we think will convince our teenagers to quit smoking. \nBut $100 billion a year in the drug business kills thousands of \nteenagers. And we have not spoken to that. Why don't we go after that? \nI hope we can. We should. That is our goal.\n  While we deal with it in a national and an international way, we have \nto turn to our parents and we have to turn to our communities. The kids \nknow who the drug dealers are. We ought to start asking them and \ninvolving them a little bit and recognizing the importance of that. We \ndo that. We go after the demand side along with the supply side.\n  I think the Clinton administration's green light to subsidize needle \nexchange and programs like that doesn't make a lot of sense. That is an \nencouragement. We want to stop that.\n  Our legislation is comprehensive. The amendment that we will talk \nabout over the recess and will offer as soon as we get back is going to \nbe critical. Pieces of what we are doing have already passed the \nCongress in one way or another.\n  We want to bring them together to create the focus to do the same \nthing against drugs as we have done against alcohol. You get caught as \na teenage drunk driver you lose your driver's license. You get caught \nusing drugs as a teenager you drive on. We will encourage the States to \ntake the driver's license away.\n  Let me say in closing, Mr. President, that if we are really worried \nabout kids, yes. I agree. Let's get the cigarettes out of their hands. \nBut let's stop them from their access to drugs of all forms. It kills \nthem tomorrow. It killed thousands last year. It will kill thousands \nthis year. As a policy-making body, we would be remiss not to deal with \nthis issue now and force this administration to get out of their \nsleepwalk and deal with the issue in cooperation with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Wyoming, under \nthe previous order, is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield so I might ask a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding of the unanimous consent \nrequest made by Senator Coverdell was that he wants to get two on the \nmajority side to use 10 minutes each. And we thought that was \nacceptable. Senator Enzi wanted to introduce a bill. I now understand \nthat Senator Enzi wishes to consume up to 10 minutes. The difficulty \nwith that is I must be somewhere downtown at 10:30. If I had understood \nthat Senator Coverdell was seeking 30 minutes on that side before \nanyone was recognized, I would have had a different view, although I \nrecognize that Senator Enzi came, in fact, before the previous two \nspeakers this morning. I understand that. But we did it as a matter of \ncourtesy to say it was acceptable to us to have two Republican speakers \nto go for 10 minutes each provided we then be recognized. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming, I understand, wants to introduce a bill.\n  Does the Senator from Wyoming intend to consume up to 10 minutes?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my request was both on behalf of myself and \nSenator Bingaman. I don't see Senator Bingaman. So we can do it in \nconsiderably less time than that providing, of course, that the \nunanimous consent is that all of our statements be in the Record. But I \nwould like to make a\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\nfew comments on something that is important to worker safety in this \ncountry. That is why I asked it to be in that order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think there has been a misunderstanding. I will, as \nmatter of courtesy, not object. But I would have objected earlier if \nthe request was that we had 30 minutes on the majority side \nuninterrupted, because Senator Wellstone is here and I was here. The \nSenator from Wyoming, I know, was here as well before the other \nspeakers. As a matter of courtesy I will not object. I regret that \nthere has been a misunderstanding.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for the purpose of a \nunanimous consent?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about two \nchallenges as we begin a break, now, for the Memorial Day recess here \nin Congress. We are talking about a wide range of things: Iran, missile \nsanctions, tobacco, appropriations bills, and a wide range of subjects. \nThere are two subjects on which there is deafening silence here in \nWashington, DC, and in the Congress, and I want to talk about both of \nthem because I think both are challenges for this country. One is our \nworsening trade deficit and the announcement 2 days ago that, once \nagain, our merchandise trade deficit for 1 month reached another record \n$20 billion in a month; and, second, the new wave of mergers in this \ncountry. I want to talk about both of them just briefly.\n  First, a chart. This chart shows in recent years the average monthly \ntrade deficit in this country, the average monthly merchandise trade \ndeficit. You can see what is happening--a month in 1991, $6 billion; it \nis now 1998, $20 billion, February through March, in a month. Some say \nthe trade deficit doesn't matter much. If it doesn't matter much, they \nmust be just ecstatic. If ignorance is bliss, those who think trade \ndeficits don't matter have to be just ecstatic. Look at what is \nhappening here. This red represents a flood of red ink in international \ntrade.\n  Our all-stars in international trade are our farmers. Yet, farm \nimports into this country are going up and farm exports are going down. \nI think today there is a ship docking in California with a load of \nbarley from the European Union. It is going to dock in Stockton, CA. It \nhas feed barley being sent into this country with a $1.10-a-bushel \nsubsidy. Shame on us for letting that ship dock. That is unfair trade \nno matter how you describe it, and it undercuts our producers, \nundercuts our farmers, takes money right out of American producers' \npockets, and it doesn't seem to matter much to anyone. It just seems \nthe trade deficits are OK, there are not problems, and nobody seems to \nwant to do much about it.\n  That unfair trade on that boat is just one small example. The flood \nof grain coming in from Canada, unfairly subsidized grain, in my \njudgment, being illegally dumped in this country--nothing is done about \nthat.\n  How about the closed markets, yes, in Japan and China? Take a look at \nthe figures this week and see what is happening with China. There is a \n$12 billion trade deficit in the first 3 months, $12 billion the first \n3 months with China. That is a $48 billion, nearly $50 billion yearly \ntrade deficit with China. Mr. President, $15 billion the first 3 months \nwith Japan, that is a $60 billion a year trade deficit with Japan. This \ndoesn't make any sense. This hurts our country. Trade deficits must be \nrepaid. It is not free money. And it must be repaid in the future by a \nlower standard of living in this country.\n  That is not a theory. That is real. These deficits must be repaid, \nand those who react with glee to this do not understand what this \nmeans. It means we are borrowing, and borrowing heavily, for a trade \nsystem that is out of balance.\n  With all due respect to all those who negotiate our trade agreements, \nI will say this: Will Rogers once said the United States has never lost \na war and never won a conference.\n  Why do we send trade negotiators overseas to lose in 3 weeks? And \nthey do. I can't think of a trade agreement negotiated recently that \nrepresented this country's national economic interest. We have \nincompetently negotiated trade agreements and trade agreements that are \nrarely enforced, and it is time for this country and this Congress to \nunderstand this is heading in the wrong direction.\n  I am not suggesting cutting off all imports. I am saying to our \ntrading partners, as a country it is in our economic interest that when \nwe take your goods, you be required to take ours. We need to get more \nwheat into China, more pork into China, more manufactured goods into \nChina and Japan, more beef into Japan.\n  I can spend an hour talking about these problems. Nobody works much \non them, because trade policy too often has become foreign policy, and \nthe State Department has its mitts in all of this. It worries that if \nwe get tough with Japan and say, ``You can't run a $60 billion trade \nsurplus with us every year,'' Japan will be miffed. Well, let Japan be \nmiffed. Let's talk about this country's interests. Let's talk about our \nlong-term interests.\n  Having gotten that off my chest, I hope the deafening silence on \ntrade deficits will no longer continue. I hope this Congress, in the \ncoming months, will consider the legislation that I, Senator Byrd, and \nSenator Stevens have introduced which talks about the creation of a \ncommission on an emergency basis to make recommendations to Congress to \ndeal with this trade deficit, to focus on it and respond to it.\n  Mr. President, I have one final item, and that is the wave of mergers \nin this country. In the last century, there have been five merger \nwaves. We are in the fifth. This is far, far in excess of any mergers \nin the past.\n  I want you to take a look at the line on this chart, going back to \n1983, on the number of merger deals, and it goes up like this, as you \ncan see. The projected dollar amount on mergers and acquisitions is up \nto $1.1 trillion for this year.\n  What does all this mean? Are mergers always bad? No. Can you get into \na merger wave that strangles our marketplace? Of course you can, and \nthat is what is happening in this country.\n  I want to go through some of the mergers. Some of these companies \ndecided to get married, and we didn't even know they were dating. All \nthese secret talks were going on, and two companies were so fond of \neach other that they decided to get married. We have Citicorp and \nTravelers Group at more than $70 billion. They were romancing for a \ncouple of weeks and announced to all of us, a huge bank and a huge \ninsurance company want to get hitched.\n  BankAmerica Corp., NationsBank, that is not surprising. We have banks \nthroughout this list. The big banks are getting bigger. Down at the \nFederal Reserve Board, they have a list. It used to be a list of 11 \nbanks. It is called ``Too Big to Fail.'' It means these banks will not \nfail because we cannot let them fail; the consequences to our country \nand economy will be too significant.\n  That list now is not 11, it is now 21 banks and growing. Twenty-one \nbanks\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\nare too big to fail. And that is what these mergers are giving us--\nbigger and bigger banks, too big to fail --while the little folks out \nthere, the family farmers and Main Street business enterprises, are \napparently too small to matter. These folks have their merger risks \nguaranteed by the taxpayer, and the rest of the folks find choked \nmarkets and higher prices.\n  Take a look at the banks. You are paying higher bank fees. Banks are \ngetting bigger and merging all over the country, and customers are \npaying higher bank fees. Take a look at the meatpacking industry. Three \nor four companies control the neck of the bottle on meatpacking. It \npushes down low prices on the backs of farmers and ranchers.\n\n  Take a look at the airlines. We deregulated the airlines. Now we have \nabout six major airlines in America that have retreated into what are \nlargely regional monopolies without regulation.\n  What about railroads? We've seen merger after merger after merger. \nNow we have just several major railroads left in America. What happens \nis the people on Main Street, the consumers, the farmers, and others \nare told by the railroads, ``Here is the way we are going to serve you. \nWe are going to bring our cars by here. You better have what you want \nput on there in time, or you lose out. We will tell you what you pay, \nand if you don't like it, tough luck.''\n  That is what a merger is. Concentration of markets means you injure \nthe marketplace. When you have two big companies merge and you have one \nbehemoth company, this country has lost something by diminishing the \nmarketplace because you have less competition.\n  Our marketplace works based on competition. When you have less \ncompetition and more concentration, it hurts our marketplace. I hope \nthere is energy in the Congress to help the Justice Department and \nothers who review these mergers to find out are they more than just \ngood for the companies, are they good for the country.\n  This list of the 25 largest corporate mergers completed or pending \nthrough May 11 is a fascinating list. There are a lot of banks, as you \nmight well know, and communications companies. This next list talks \nabout mergers and acquisitions over $1 billion involving U.S. companies \nbetween 1983-1998. In 1983, we had 10 deals over $1 billion. This year, \nthere were 143 separate merger deals over $1 billion each. Of course, \nthe largest ones are just behemoth, setting all kinds of records.\n  I am not saying all mergers are bad all the time. I know of \ncircumstances where two companies have merged and it was beneficial to \neverybody. I understand that. But we have an orgy of mega-mergers going \non in this country today that I think does threaten the marketplace. I \nsay to Joel Klein over in the Justice Department, and others, be \nactive, be aggressive. He recently testified before the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives that he needs some more resources in antitrust to deal \nwith these issues. I am somebody who says, let's give him the \nresources.\n  I want this marketplace to work. It works when we have robust, \naggressive competition. It chokes and clogs when we have concentration \nat the top. So I bring to my colleagues' attention these charts just to \nsay we have gone from 10 mergers over $1 billion in 1983 to 20, 26, 34, \n35, 47--it goes on up. Now we have 143 different merger propositions \nover $1 billion each, something we ought to care about.\n  There has not been anybody around this Congress for a long, long \nwhile to care about it. Senator Phil Hart, a great Senator for whom the \nHart Building was named, spent a lot of his career here worrying about \nthe issue of mergers and concentration. I hope, once again, we will see \nsome from this Justice Department and from some in this Congress who \nwill take a close look at all of these. That is not to say they are all \nbad, some might make sense, but to say there is more than one interest \ninvolved in these issues. There is more than one interest.\n  One interest might be the two companies who want to make more money \nand grab some markets. The other interest must be the interest of the \nAmerican people and a free-market system that will only remain free if \nwe have competition and only remain free if we don't have concentration \nand monopoly that chokes down markets.\n  I hope, perhaps in the coming months, that I can stimulate some \nadditional discussion about this issue with some of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I see my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, out of courtesy, I defer to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, and I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nfollow him for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5364-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5365-S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF JAMES CATHERWOOD HORMEL\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the senior Senator \nfrom Minnesota for his courtesy. We discussed this a few minutes ago \nand decided it might be better if I go first, because he might want to \nrespond to some things I might say.\n  Some statements were made on the floor yesterday concerning my hold \nthat I have on James Hormel to be the Ambassador to Luxembourg. It is \ntrue that I do have a hold on Mr. Hormel.\n  To clarify what a hold is, it is a courtesy. It is not a procedural \nmatter. It is something that is a courtesy to the leader so he will \nknow there is opposition.\n  There very well may be a vote on this individual, but I will oppose \nhis nomination, and I want to stand and tell you why.\n  The statement that was made on the floor was made by the senior \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. I will read excerpts of it:\n\n       Now, one of my colleagues, and I think it is extremely \n     unfortunate, one of my colleagues has compared Mr. Hormel, a \n     highly qualified public servant and nominee, to Mr. David \n     Duke, who, among other credentials, is a former grand wizard \n     of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I want to say to my colleagues, that given this kind of \n     statement made publicly by a United States Senator, this kind \n     of character assassination, it is more important now than \n     ever that this man, Mr. Hormel, be voted on.\n\n  In defense, really, of the senior Senator from Minnesota, I say that \nif I had said what he thought I said, he was certainly entitled and \njustified to make the statements that were made. But I think it is \nimportant to know that I did not make those statements in the context \nthat he believed I made them.\n  Let me, first of all, say that there probably are not two Members of \nthe U.S. Senate who are further apart philosophically than the senior \nSenator from Minnesota and myself. I would probably, in my own mind, \nbelieve him to be an extreme left-wing radical liberal and he believes \nme to be an extreme right-wing radical conservative. And I think maybe \nwe are both right.\n  But one thing I respect about Senator Wellstone is he is not a \nhypocrite. He is the same thing everywhere. He honestly, in his heart, \nbelieves the role of Government to be something different than I \nbelieve it to be. So we have these honest differences of opinion. One \nof the things I like about this body, the U.S. Senate, is that you can, \nin a spirit of love, talk about these things. And that is what we are \ndoing right now.\n  Let me just real quickly say that I like activists. The Senator from \nMinnesota is an activist. I am an activist. In fact, this is the \ncommencement season. I quite often give commencement talks. I talk to \nyoung people, and I say, ``Whatever you are, don't be a mushy middle. \nStand for something.'' I would far rather, even though I am a \nconservative, have one of these young people be a radical right-wing--\nor left-wing--either one--than just be in the mushy middle.\n  I quote Henry Ward Beecher now and then. He said,\n\n       I don't like these cold, precise, perfect people. In order \n     not to say wrong, say nothing; in order not to do wrong, do \n     nothing.\n\n  And the Lord had something to say about this, too. He said,\n\n       I know your works. You are neither hot nor cold. Because \n     you are neither hot nor cold, you are lukewarm. And because \n     you are lukewarm, I will spew thee out of my mouth.\n\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\n\n  He is saying the same thing I am saying. And I really believe this. \nAnd the young kids, they look at us as examples. In fact, when I was in \nthe other body and was first elected, I would take interns down to the \nintersection of New Jersey and Independence, and I would say as they \nwent across the street, I said, ``There are three kinds of Members of \nCongress. There are extreme liberals, extreme conservatives, and then \nthe mushy middle. And the goal of those in the mushy middle is to die \nin Washington, DC. And how do you die in Washington, DC? You take a \npoll, and you make statements that ingratiate yourself.''\n  The senior Senator from Minnesota cannot be accused of that, nor can \nI. Unfortunately, we do have too many appeasers around.\n  Hiram Mann said, ``No man survives when freedom fails. The best men \nrot in filthy jails. And those who cry ``appease'' are hanged by those \nthey try to please.''\n  Let me tell you quickly what I did say so that it will be clarified \nfor the Record.\n  I made the statement, when I was running for office--and I have been \nconsistent with that--that if I get to the U.S. Senate, where I have \nthe opportunity to participate in the confirmation process, that I will \nwork to keep a nominee from being confirmed if that individual has his \nown personal agenda and has made statements to the effect that he \nbelieves stronger in his personal agenda and will use that office to \nadvance his personal agenda more than he would the American agenda.\n  Now, in the case of James Hormel, he is a gay activist. He has made \nstatements in the past, which I will read in a moment, that have led me \nto believe that his agenda, his personal agenda is above the agenda of \nthe United States.\n  And I said the same thing would apply regardless of who \nthe individual is. I made the statement that David Duke, if he were \nnominated, I would oppose him because he has made statements that his \nmilitia extremist agenda is more important than the agenda of America. \nI said in the way of Patricia Ireland, if she were nominated, I would \nfeel the same way if she made statements saying that her feminist \nagenda was more important to her than the agenda of America.\n\n  And the same thing with one of my closest friends, Ralph Reed. I \nmean, Ralph Reed, who was the one who built the Christian Coalition, he \nis one with whom I agree. I agree with what he stands for. I spent the \nEaster recess in west Africa in the countries of Benin and Nigeria and \nCote d'Ivoire talking about Jesus Christ. So I agree with him. However, \nif he were nominated, and he said, ``I want this job so that I can \nadvance my personal agenda over that of America,'' I think it would be \nwrong and I would oppose it.\n  So let us just see real quickly. I am going to read a couple things, \nand then my time will expire, and I think I will be on the record as I \nwant to be.\n  During the course of the nomination process--I will read, first of \nall, the San Francisco Chronicle. This is on October 9 of 1997.\n\n       President Clinton's nomination of James Hormel . . . is the \n     latest sign that he is making good on his post-election \n     promise to reward gays and lesbians for their support, \n     national gay leaders said today . . .'' I think it's the \n     result of very hard work behind the scenes of national gay \n     and lesbian organizations that have been pushing and pushing \n     for these appointments to be made''. . . .\n\n  That was Kerry Lobel, the executive director of the National Gay and \nLesbian Task Force.\n  I would also like to quote someone I think who is familiar to all of \nus--we hold her in very high esteem--Faith Whittlesey, former U.S. \nAmbassador to Switzerland. She was talking about this trend of trying \nto put people with their own personal agendas in the various Embassies. \nShe made this statement. She said:\n\n       The United States is more socially radicalized than any \n     other country in the world on this issue (gay rights). \n     Ambassadorships may no longer be essential foreign policy \n     positions, but they are still symbolically important. \n     Starting with small countries to set a precedent for bigger \n     appointments, what they're trying to do is use the U.S. \n     diplomatic service to open deeply held religious convictions \n     and social mores in other countries. Ambassadorial \n     appointments should not be used for the purposes of social \n     engineering in the countries to which the ambassadors are \n     assigned.\n\n  One of the many statements that had been made previous about James \nHormel that led me to the conclusion that he wanted to use this \nposition to advance his agenda was the following statement he made on \nJune 16, 1996. He said:\n\n       I specifically asked to be Ambassador to Norway because, at \n     the time, they were about to pass legislation that would \n     acknowledge same-sex relationships, and they had indicated \n     their reception, their receptivity, to gay men and lesbians.\n\n  I think it is very difficult to put any interpretation on that other \nthan the fact that individual wanted to be ambassador to that country \nbecause of pending legislation in that country.\n  So, Mr. President, I stand by the statements I have made. I certainly \ndo not want anyone to say that I am comparing two individuals as \nindividual personalities. But I will continue to oppose the \nconfirmation of individuals who are nominated for various positions, if \nI believe, in my own heart, that that individual is not going to \nrepresent the best interests of America and has his own personal agenda \nin advance of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask the Chair to let me know when I have used \n5 minutes, because I have another matter I want to discuss?\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, let me say to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, I appreciate his gracious personal remarks. I \nam proud to have his friendship. And the respect is mutual. The respect \nis mutual.\n  Second of all, let me say to my colleague that I am pleased to find \nout that he did not say it exactly as it seemed to be reported in Roll \nCall. And I think his clarification is terribly important. I might not \nagree with his analogy, but I understand exactly what he is saying. And \nI think he has clarified the record.\n  Third, let me just simply say to my colleague, and to other \ncolleagues as well, that we have here a man, James Hormel, who has been \nnominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Mr. Hormel comes \nto the U.S. Senate with enormous qualifications: dean of the students \nof the University of Chicago Law School, on the boards of such diverse \ngroups as the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, Swarthmore College, a \ngenerous giver, committed to community, a dedicated public servant. \nFrankly, the list goes on and on.\n  On May 23, 1997, a year ago, this very Senate unanimously confirmed \nhim to serve as an alternative representative on the U.S. delegation to \nthe 51st U.N. General Assembly. He has done a lot of marvelous work in \nhuman rights as well.\n  Mr. President, the fact that there is an article in the paper that \nsays that the President nominated Mr. Hormel and believes that this was \nimportant to the gay community does not in any way, shape, or form \nsuggest that Mr. Hormel has a personal agenda.\n  The fact that Mr. Hormel talked about a country that seems to have \ndone a great job of moving away from discrimination against gays and \nlesbians as a very attractive country to him does not mean in any way, \nshape, or form that he would use this position to promote his own \npersonal agenda.\n  In fact, Jim Hormel has clearly and publicly stated that he would \n``not use the Office of the Ambassador to advocate any personal \nviews.''\n  Mr. President, I simply have to say to my colleagues there is a \npersonal part to this and a political part. For the personal part, here \nis a letter to Senator Lott:\n\n       I am writing to you to urge you to bring James C. Hormel's \n     nomination as Ambassador to Luxembourg to a vote on the floor \n     of the Senate. The stone-walling of this appointment reflects \n     a flagrant disregard to all that we hold precious in a \n     democratic society. If he is voted down then so be it, but \n     not to allow due process to take place is clearly an \n     indictment of the branch of our government that seems at \n     times to be inclined to exhibit its own peculiar form of \n     despotism. The President has nominated him and the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee has recommended him. Let the \n     process take place.\n       I am a sixty three year old retired counseling \n     psychologist. I am the mother of six children and the step-\n     mother of three. I have 17 grandchildren. Thirteen of those \n     grandchildren I share with James Hormel. I have\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\n     known Jim for 46 years and for ten of those years I was \n     married to him. During those ten years we had five children.\n\n  And she goes on to say,\n\n       For many of those years he tried his hardest to live what \n     was a lie. Of course, you might say I was the ``injured \n     party,'' but I grew to understand the terrible prejudice and \n     hatred that he knew he would have to face, that he has faced \n     and is facing as he goes through the difficult process that \n     this nomination and its opponents have put him through. James \n     Hormel is my dear friend. I care deeply about him and have \n     great admiration for his courage in being open about his \n     homosexuality and his willingness to put himself on the line \n     in accepting this nomination.\n       James Hormel's former wife.\n\n  Mr. President, let me simply say to my colleagues that this is really \nan outrage. I understand what my colleague from Oklahoma had to say, \nbut I will have an amendment when we come back that I will put on the \nfirst bill I can after the tobacco bill, which will say that the Senate \nought to bring this up. The majority leader, we owe it to him.\n  Now, my colleague from Oklahoma has been clear on his position. I \naccept that. But I say to my colleagues that this man is eminently \nqualified. That is crystal clear, I think, to many of us, the majority \nof us. This man should be able to serve. And if, in fact, the reason he \nis being stopped--and this is what I fear; and I am not speaking to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma--but if he is being stopped because of \ndiscrimination, because of the fact that he is gay, then let that come \nout on the Senate floor. Let us have the debate. And let's have \ncolleagues come out here, no more holds, and speak directly to this \nnomination.\n  If you oppose him, then oppose him on the floor of the Senate. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma has been clear about his position, but let's \nhave that debate. We owe James Hormel this. We owe the U.S. Senate \nthis.\n  This institution is on trial. If we don't bring this forward, I say \nto the majority leader, then I think we have to look at ourselves in \nthe mirror. We need to bring this nomination forward. We need to have \nthis debate. And we need to vote up or down. I believe elementary \ndecency dictates that we do that. I will start having amendments on \nbills that will call on the majority leader to bring this nomination to \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5365-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISTEA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we will vote on ISTEA today. I know a \nnumber of colleagues want a voice vote. I can feel the pressure \nbuilding. We are about to leave. I say to colleagues, we are not going \nto voice vote the bill. We can't have a voice vote. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation, and a whole lot has happened in \nconference committee. Frankly, all of us should be on record voting nay \nor yea, yea or nay.\n  For my own part, I want to talk about this piece of legislation. \nThere are two points I want to make. This is a very important piece of \nlegislation. I thank Minnesotans for all of their guidance. There is \nmuch about this legislation that I believe in, especially the important \ninvestment in infrastructure. I think it is a balanced approach.\n\n  However, I will not vote for this bill, and I will not vote for this \nbill for two reasons. First of all, I won't vote for this bill \nbecause--we still don't know what the offsets are, but it looks like \nmuch of it comes from VA. I say that because I believe it is an outrage \nthat the money that could have gone into veterans health care--and I \ncould go on for hours about what the gaps are in veterans health care--\nwill, instead, be used as an offset in this legislation. I also believe \nthat too much of this spending will take the place of other \ndiscretionary, affecting the most vulnerable citizens in this country.\n  The second reason that I cannot vote for this piece of legislation, \nas much as I believe in much of it, is the process. I think at the very \nend of this process there were several decisions made, one having to do \nwith a sensitive environmental land dispute issue in Minnesota, the \nBoundary Waters, and I respectfully disagree with the way this is being \ndone.\n  I will not do any bashing on the floor of the Senate. I don't want to \ndo that. But I will not support this piece of legislation, I want to go \non record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed from \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America. They say, ``Don't Rob America's \nVeterans Again.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Veterans and Tobacco-Related Illnesses\n\n       VA compensation benefits should not be taken away for \n     tobacco-related illnesses. Nicotine addiction is a medically \n     recognized disability. DOD was culpable in veterans becoming \n     addicted to cigarettes, and therefore these are bona fide \n     service-connected disabilities. Smoking was not ``willful \n     misconduct.''\n       Taking away tobacco-related VA compensation benefits \n     because it is inconvenient for VA to process them, because \n     they are costly, or because it is politically incorrect or \n     unpopular, is a very dangerous precedent to set. What will be \n     next, excluding benefits for bad diet or an unpopular war? \n     There is no sound legal or moral basis to take this benefit \n     away from veterans.\n       While some argue that veterans made the choice to smoke, no \n     veteran chose to become addicted to nicotine and tobacco \n     products. The tobacco companies, with the unwitting \n     assistance of a military which encouraged and subsidized \n     smoking, made the choice for veterans by getting them \n     addicted to cigarettes.\n       This is not a new benefit that will be eliminated for the \n     future. This is current law--benefits are already being \n     granted--and what Congress is considering is taking away a \n     veterans benefit.\n       Veterans are being singled out for unfair treatment. Other \n     federal beneficiaries will continue to receive disability \n     compensation for tobacco-related illnesses; no one is \n     proposing to abolish SSDI benefits. If passed, this will \n     create an inequitable, unjust and unconstitutional situation \n     under the equal protection clause for one class of \n     individuals--veterans.\n       Prohibiting compensation for tobacco-related illnesses will \n     have adverse effects on veterans seeking other benefits--\n     related compensation (such as cancer resulting from chemical \n     exposure), and certainly access to health care.\n       VA's projected savings for prohibiting tobacco-related \n     claims are highly exaggerated. Experience to date shows that \n     it is very difficult for veterans to prove these claims; \n     approximately 7,400 claims have been filed, of some 3,100 \n     that have been adjudicated thus far, fewer than 300 have been \n     granted.\n       Any effort to take the money away from veterans tobacco-\n     related compensation, in order to pay for pork-barrel \n     transportation projects is an absolute outrage. This is \n     election-year politics at its worst.\n       Congress must not support this outrageous proposal; Don't \n     Rob American's Veterans!\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Congress: Don't Rob America's Veterans Again!\n\n       Congress wants to take billions of dollars from veterans' \n     disability compensation in a money grab to increase overblown \n     spending for transportation and highways.\n       As a result, thousands of sick and disabled veterans will \n     be denied earned disability compensation.\n       Congress wants to exploit a veteran's use of tobacco as a \n     convenient excuse to stop paying benefits where tobacco use \n     may have had any role in a disability--even though the \n     Department of Defense encouraged, subsidized and promoted \n     tobacco use among servicemen and women.\n       Yet, Congress is not penalizing other Americans for their \n     use of tobacco. Social Security, for instance, will still pay \n     for tobacco-related disabilities.\n       Congress has already slashed billions from veterans' health \n     and benefits programs, only to spend the money elsewhere.\n       To those in Congress who support this outrageous proposal, \n     here's our advice: Quit your own bad habit of continually \n     robbing veterans' programs.\n       Don't Rob America's Veterans!\n       A message from: AMVETS; Blinded Veterans Association; \n     Disabled American Veterans; Jewish War Veterans of the \n     U.S.A., Inc.; Military Order of the Purple Heart of the \n     U.S.A., Inc.; Non Commissioned Officers Association of the \n     USA; Paralyzed Veterans of America; Veterans of Foreign Wars \n     of the United States; and Vietnam Veterans of America, Inc.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think they are right. There are too \nmany veterans out on the streets that shouldn't be. There are too many \nveterans that are struggling with PTSD that are not treated. There are \ntoo many veterans that, as they get older, are not clear what care \nthere will be.\n  We have a flat-line budget that is not going to work for veterans. I \nthink it is a big mistake to have taken this money out of what should \nhave been an investment in veterans health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5367-S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FOOD STAMPS AND ISTEA\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

In fact, there was a 77-23 \nvote on a Gramm of Texas motion to recommit--77-23.\n  Let me make another statement, Mr. President. If that action takes \nplace in the House, I can see no way that ISTEA could ever be passed \nhere this afternoon before we go home on break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5367-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5368-S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNIVERSAL TOBACCO SETTLEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate this morning \nwith respect to the national tobacco policy legislation that has been \non the floor this week. I hope in the final analysis we will be able to \ncome to a common agreement and find common ground on this critical \nissue and legislation. Clearly, the significance of this issue and the \npromise of related legislation cannot be overstated with respect to the \nfact that it certainly could improve the health of our Nation's \nchildren.\n  As a Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I had the opportunity \nto work on the original legislation that was reported out of the \ncommittee by a 19-1 vote. The committee voted overwhelmingly for the \nbill because we thought it was important and necessary to move the \ndebate forward on this critical issue. There is no question that the \nbill which is now on the floor of the Senate is very different from the \nlegislation that was considered in the Commerce Committee, where we \nbegan the process of defining and refining the issue, and knew full \nwell that amendments would be offered on the floor to improve it and to \nreflect the interests and the desires of the Members of this body.\n  Unfortunately, what ultimately occurred is that we had a total \nrewrite of the bill through the White House.\n  It is not unusual to have the White House involved and be an integral \npart of the discussion in terms of shaping legislation. But, \nultimately, the bill was significantly rewritten in most pieces. I \ncan't say it wasn't improved in some places, but other areas raise \nsignificant questions. It is one thing to amend a bill and change it on \nthe floor; it is quite another to have this issue altered in a way that \nis outside of the scope and purview of the committee, and which has now \nresulted in some of the problems that have contributed to the delay of \nthis legislation and its passage.\n  But be that as it may, I hope in the final analysis we don't overlook \nthe reason why this legislation is on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nwhat brought us to this point, why this legislation was crafted, and \nwhat we hope to accomplish from the passage, ultimately, of this \nlegislation.\n  First and foremost, we have to remember this legislation was the \nresult of a settlement reached by the tobacco industry and 40 states \nattorneys general across the country more than 11 months ago. And the \nbottom line is that the proposed settlement would not have been reached \nif it weren't for one simple truth: tobacco products have been killing \nand continue to kill 420,000 Americans each and every year--and every \nday, 3,000 children become addicted to tobacco and one-third will \neventually die as a result of tobacco-related disease.\n  If it weren't for this simple truth, the tobacco industry would not \nhave been subjected to years and years of lawsuits and litigation, and \nthis comprehensive settlement would not have been reached. And the fact \nis, if not for this simple truth, the industry would not have settled \nwith States such as Minnesota recently to the tune of $6 billion, and \nthree other States across this country. And that is why they were \ninterested in reaching this agreement, because they knew what the truth \nwas. And the most insidious aspect of this whole tobacco debate is the \nfact that this dangerous and addictive product was marketed to \nchildren.\n  In listening to the debate this past week and hearing the many \narguments that have been put forward from divergent points of view, I \nbelieve that we cannot afford to forget, nor can we overlook the fact, \nthat this product was deliberately, in a calculated fashion, targeted \nto young people and teens--even to children as young as 11-year-olds. \nThis product was marketed to individuals who were not old enough to \nvote, not old enough to drink, not old enough to enlist in the \nmilitary, not old enough to make any of the life-altering decisions \nthat should be made by adults, and not old enough, ironically, to even \npurchase this product legally. By the way, these facts aren't just \nbased on hypothetical views or assumptions or conjecture; these are \nbased on more than 40,000 documents that have been unveiled during the \ncourse of recent litigation and in crafting the proposed settlement.\n  When you look at the documents, it provides a disturbing glimpse into \nthe mindset and tactics of the tobacco industry. From this paper trail, \nwe have learned of repeated efforts by the industry to manipulate \nscientific research, racially stereotype minorities in marketing plans, \ncontrive the nicotine levels in cigarettes, and play down the risks of \nsmoking. They even demonstrated the manner in which they studied the \nsmoking habits of teenagers, to the extent that they would exploit the \nteen market so they would have the lifelong support of a group of \nAmericans. They even considered ways to make cigarettes taste better \nfor teens. So this was a very deliberate, calculated effort to hook \nkids on tobacco. The thousands and thousands of documents outline this \neffort.\n  That is the crux of this issue. This is not to say that Americans \ndidn't know that smoking cigarettes was harmful; of course, they did. \nThe question is, ``Did the industry deliberately contrive the nicotine \nlevels to make it addictive and then to attract young people so they \nwould smoke throughout their lifetime?''\n  For the answer, listen to some of the industry's own documents. ``The \nbasis of our business is the high school students,'' said one memo. \nAnother one said, ``It is a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet \nproducts. Honey might be considered.'' Another one said, ``If our \ncompany is to survive and prosper in the long run, we must get our \nshare of the youth market.'' Another memo said, ``. . . to ensure \nincreased and longer-term growth . . . the brand must increase its \nshare penetration among the 14-24 age group . . . which represents \ntomorrow's cigarette business.'' Another one said, ``Today's teenager \nis tomorrow's potential regular customer.''\n\n  So these are glaring demonstrations of unscrupulous and unethical \nconduct on the part of companies.\n  And that is what brings us to the floor of the Senate. The industry \ndiscovered and knew the truth, and they could not escape their past \npractices. And that is why they entered into a settlement with 40 \nattorneys general.\n  While last June's proposed settlement may have been the catalyst for \ncomprehensive tobacco legislation, it did not mean that Congress could \nnot change that settlement. We were not a party to those negotiations, \nbut we have a right to make changes, and it had to come to Congress.\n  And what has been the result of these industry documents and their \nintent to market an addictive product to young people in America? This \nhas been the result: More than 5 million children under the age of 18, \nalive today, will eventually die from smoking-related diseases unless \ncurrent rates are reversed. Approximately 4.1 million kids age 12 to 17 \nare current smokers. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers began at or \nbefore age 18. Among high school seniors who have ever used smokeless \ntobacco, almost three-fourths began by the ninth grade. And 3,000 of \nour children will become addicted to this deadly product every day.\n  That is what this is all about. That is the debate. That is the heart \nof this issue, Mr. President.\n  In my State of Maine, we have one of the highest rates of teen \nsmoking in\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\nAmerica and we have the highest rate of smoking for individuals between \nthe ages of 18 and 30. In fact, a full 38 percent of high school \nstudents in Maine currently smoke cigarettes, and 16 percent of high \nschool boys use smokeless tobacco. That is what has happened. Smoking \nis habit-forming and 35 percent of males between the ages of 18 to 34 \nreported smoking cigarettes in 1996. That is the result of what we are \ntalking about. That is why we are here in the U.S. Senate debating this \ncomprehensive framework.\n  If this habit was harmless, we would not be here today. But tobacco \nis not harmless, and we know it. Furthermore, this harm has been spread \nby an industry that has marketed to young people, which has resulted in \na senseless loss of life. Now, we have the responsibility to take \naction.\n  For those who oppose doing anything, regardless of what the content \nof this legislation is, I say to them: What is the alternative? What \nelse will we do here in the U.S. Senate? The bottom line is that this \nis our only chance. We only have one opportunity and it is before the \nU.S. Senate. It is a historic opportunity to bring to an end these past \npractices and, more importantly, to help young people in America so \nthey don't become addicted to this deadly tobacco product for the rest \nof their lives. That is what this debate is all about. I hope the \nessence of this issue doesn't get lost as we look at it from a variety \nof dimensions, because there is no possibility of ever dealing with \nthis kind of framework ever again. This is our chance once and forever.\n  So I hope that once we get to the point of having gone through all of \nthe amendments, the debate and discussion, it doesn't defeat the \nultimate passage of comprehensive tobacco legislation. Those objections \ncannot override this one important national interest, which is to \nchange the tobacco culture in America, and to hopefully stop young \npeople from smoking, or help them never to start in the first place.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement of April \n3, I now call up H.R. 2709, the Iran sanctions legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2709) to impose certain sanctions on foreign \n     persons who transfer items contributing to Iran's efforts to \n     acquire, develop or produce ballistic missiles, and to \n     implement the obligations of the United States under the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 90 minutes equally divided under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just want to clarify the procedural \nsituation. As the Chair just said, it is 90 minutes on the underlying \nmeasure, and then 90 minutes on the Levin amendment, if need be to use \nthat time. It is the intent that we go forward to completion of this \nact and that we have a recorded vote at the end of that time.\n  I am really pleased the Senate is finally completing action on this \nvery important piece of legislation. Senator Lieberman and I introduced \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act on October 23, 1997. It \nhas 84 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. This is not really a complicated \npiece of legislation. It is designed to address one of the most \npressing security issues we face in the world, Iran's determined drive \nto acquire ballistic missile production capability.\n  This legislation requires specific targeted sanctions against any \nforeign entities providing direct support to Iran's missile development \nefforts. The House passed companion legislation on November 12, 1997, \nwithout a single dissenting vote. House action modified certain \nprovisions of the legislation to meet concerns of the administration, \nmost notably--and I have made this point to the President in my \ndiscussions with him about this legislation--that he is granted a \nwaiver, and that was requested by the administration, and that was \nincluded in the bill when the House passed it.\n  The House also passed legislation adding the Chemical Weapons \nConvention to the package. Our legislation addresses a clear and \npresent danger. Iran is a terrorist state under U.S. law. Last year, a \nGerman court found Iranian intelligence directly responsible for murder \ncommitted on German soil. Earlier this very week, the Government of \nArgentina found Iran responsible for a terrorist bombing of a Jewish \nsynagogue. The same Iranian Government responsible for terrorist murder \naround the world is engaged in efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and \nthe means to deliver them. They already have chemical weapons. They are \nworking on biological weapons. This is a very serious matter.\n  Much of the knowledge that Senators and administration officials have \non this issue cannot be talked about here in the Senate because of \ntheir very sensitive intelligence issues. But every time I receive a \nbriefing, I become more alarmed about what Iran has and what additional \ncapability they are trying to acquire.\n  Their missile program has been advanced tremendously by the \nassistance from a wide range of Russian entities. The details, as I \nsaid, are classified, but it is comprehensive and it is ongoing. I urge \nevery Senator to review the intelligence information. A summary is \navailable right now in S-407 for Members' review. The intelligence \ncommunity will brief any Senator on the extent and impact of Russian \ncooperation. I have had that briefing and continue to review \nintelligence information. Let me assure the Senate, Russian cooperation \nis deeply disturbing. It is widespread. It has made the day Iran is \nable to target American forces and American allies closer by years. If \nI went into the details of the capability they have acquired and how \nsoon they could have the ability to use that, everybody in the Senate \nand the United States would be alarmed.\n  The basic facts are not in dispute. Iran wants ballistic missile \nproduction capability. Russian assistance has materially advanced \nIranian efforts. American diplomatic efforts to halt assistance have \nnot succeeded. That assistance continues today. That is why we have \nH.R. 2709 before us today in the Senate.\n  We have not rushed to judgment on this issue. Last November, we did \nnot act after the House sent us the legislation, and I received \nspecific calls from the President's National Security Adviser asking \nthat we not act. In the last week we were in session, this legislation \ncould have been passed, probably on a voice vote, immediately. But, in \nresponse to the administration's efforts and assurances that they were \ngoing to get some cooperation, we said all right, we will see if we get \nsome results by waiting.\n  In January, the administration asked for a 3-week delay to compare \nassessments with Israel, our ally most directly threatened by Iranian \nweapons of mass destruction. In February, the administration asked for \ndelay until\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\nVice President Gore's March meeting with then Russian Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin. In March, the administration asked us to wait until \nApril. In every instance, I consulted with Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, talked to Senator Lieberman, checked the intelligence \ninformation, listened to the requests from the President's National \nSecurity Adviser and the Vice President, and continued to make an \neffort to give them time to see if we could get some results, get some \naction. It did not happen. It did not happen again and again and again.\n  In April, though, we said there had to be an end to this or the \nSenate's credibility would be in doubt, if we continued to just hold \nthis out there and not act. And, also, if we do not act soon and this \ncontinues--the capabilities that they are acquiring are extremely \ndangerous, to say the least.\n  So we entered into the unanimous consent agreement in April, the \nmiddle of April, to consider this legislation today. We said we would \ndo it by or on May 22. For 6 entire months, we have tried to give more \ntime for this matter to be addressed, for there to be some indication \nthat Russia was in fact able to deal with these companies and these \nindividuals who were involved in this intelligence, scientific, and \nballistic missile capability exchange. It did not stop. Again, I cannot \ngo into details, but there were specific instances of things we were \nconcerned about. The overwhelming majority of them did not stop, did \nnot change.\n  We have had at least five delays that have been requested by the \nadministration and granted by the Senate. President Clinton has had \nample time to allow his diplomatic approach to work. I would point out, \nhowever, the administration has refused to make sanctions decisions \nwhich are required by law, and there clearly have been some instances \nwhere those sanctions could have and probably should have been \nimplemented. A number of Russian actions supporting Iran's missile \nprogram require U.S. sanctions under the Missile Technology Control \nAct. In fact, if the administration had acted last year, as called for \nunder that law, this legislation probably would not be necessary.\n  The administration often asks for bipartisanship regarding foreign \npolicy, and I think that is as it should be. I have tried more than \nonce to be cooperative and to make sure that we proceeded in a \nbipartisan way. We have done that. I have done it sometimes while \ncoming under heavy criticism from the media or members of my own party. \nBut I thought, and I think, it is the right thing to do. I try to \naccommodate whenever and however I can. This legislation, though, \nshould not be delayed further. It could not be more bipartisan. I \nreiterate, 84 Senators on both sides of the aisle are cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  I hope the administration will reconsider its opposition. I think it \nactually could be helpful. I think the fact we have had this \nlegislation pending has been helpful. It has given the administration \nleverage. Unfortunately, the leverage has not produced results.\n  I fear that the Russian Government does not have sufficient \ncapability to stop this exchange from occurring. They do not have the \nexport control laws that we do. They do not have the ability to go to a \ncompany in Russia as easily as we do and say, ``Do not be engaged in \nthis very dangerous process.'' Or if they do, they haven't been able to \ncarry it out so far.\n  There are those who are going to say, ``Well, there have been some \nchanges. We have a new government there. Chernomyrdin has been replaced \nby a new young Prime Minister. He is talking good.''\n  They have made some recommendations, but some of the things we have \nbeen told have happened we do not have the evidence of yet. Again, we \nare being told that within the last 10 days greater assurances have \nbeen given by Russian officials. This has been going on for months, \nreally years, and now all of a sudden they say, ``Well, wait, there is \na new leader on the block; he is going to make a difference.''\n  If we go forward today and accept the amendment of Senator Levin from \nMichigan and pass this legislation, it still has to go back to the \nHouse. It will probably be 10 days or so before the House can act. \nThere will be a little more time to see if, in fact, these new leaders \nin Russia can begin to make a difference. The President, I reiterate, \nhas waiver authority, and he may decide that this is such a sensitive \nnational security issue at this particular time that he needs to veto \nit. He can do that. But I think that the Senate should not delay any \nlonger.\n  There is beginning to be a pattern around the world of some of our \nfriends, supposedly, and allies, or countries that we are trying to \nwork with, contributing to very dangerous weapons proliferation and \nnuclear activity. Think about it. Do we want Iran to have this \nballistic missile capability? Not only chemical and biological weapons, \nbut they would like to have nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver \nthem in the region or in the world. I don't think so.\n  It is time the Senate delivered a clear message on this--a clear \nbipartisan message. I really think it will be helpful in getting this \nprocess, that Russia and others have been participating in, stopped now \nbefore it is too late.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the Senator from Kansas 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate the \nSenator from Arizona recognizing me to speak on this very important \nact.\n  The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is more important now \nthan ever. I chair the subcommittee in the Foreign Relations Committee \nwhich deals with Iran. We have had a number of hearings on this \nparticular issue. We just had a hearing last week on what all Iran is \ndoing around the world.\n\n  It might be of interest for many people in this body to know that, \naccording to the State Department's last report, Iran is operating in \nsome 21 countries around the world with either terroristic actions \ntaking place or building the base for further expansion of their \nactivities and interests and terroristic actions to happen.\n  I am sure a number of people have already noted as well the recent \nfinding by the Argentine Government of Iranian-backed terrorists \ninvolved with the horrendous bombings that took place in that country \nearlier this decade. The recent nuclear test by the Indians drives this \npoint home even more. It is more urgent now than it was even 10 days \nago to alert the world, and Iran in particular, that the United States \nwill not tolerate an Iranian nuclear program, period.\n  The administration has already shown lack of resolve in its recent \ndecisions to waive the sanctions on Total and Gazprom under the Iran-\nLibya Sanctions Act. This, in my estimation, was a grave mistake, as \nthe world has now received the message that it is once again free to \nfill the Iranian coffers and help it pay for the development of its \nnuclear capability, as well as fund its terrorism activities overseas.\n  In the most recent State Department report that was out less than a \nmonth ago, Iran is the leading nation around the world sponsoring \nterrorism as a state. In the State Department's most recent report, \nIran is the leader in this most ignoble category.\n  We need to make the world understand that Iranian development of an \nindigenous missile capability, combined with nuclear capability, is \ndangerous to everyone. While Iran has been quite open in its calls to \nannihilate Israel, a nuclear-capable Iran will threaten countries far \nbeyond its borders. The very countries which are now planning to refill \nIran's coffers are the countries which will be at risk in the future.\n  The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is not a country-wide \nsanction. What we are proposing here is intended to sanction specific \nentities known to be providing Iran with missile technology. This bill \nis an effort to stem this dangerous flow to Iran and is\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\ndesigned to impose certain sanctions on foreign persons who transfer \nitems contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce \nballistic missiles.\n  There is good intelligence about which Russian entities are involved. \nSome of them are involved in joint space cooperation with the United \nStates. These companies should know that there will be costs if they \nengage in behavior which so obviously threatens our security interests, \nthe security interests of the region, and the security interests of the \nentire world, from the leading sponsor of terrorism around the world, \nwhich is the Iranian regime.\n  The administration claims it is making progress with the Russian \nGovernment on this matter, that we need to give them time to implement \nthe relatively new decree tightening the export of dual-use technology.\n  We keep hearing about the progress we are making with the Russians, \nbut we do not see it. I might note as well, there were recent bills \npassed in the House of Representatives going at the administration in \nthis country about the sharing of dual-use technology with China and \nsaying that this was wrong what the administration has been supporting.\n  How can we believe them that they are going to be able to stop the \nRussians when they are providing some of this in a questionable dual-\nuse area to the Chinese?\n  Mr. President, we do not undervalue what the Russian Government is \ntrying to do. We are all encouraged by the progress that is being made. \nBut the fact remains that the transfers continue.\n  Just 2 weeks ago--2 weeks ago--the Government of Azerbaijan \nintercepted a transfer of materials going from Russia to Iran which \nwould have significantly enhanced Iran's ability to produce missiles \nindigenously.\n  If the Russians are working so diligently on this program, this bill \nposes no threats and in fact really would help them in these efforts. \nThe bill would not sanction the Russian Government. That is a very \nimportant point to make. It does not sanction the Russian Government.\n  In fact, if the Russian Government is serious about stemming the flow \nof this technology, this bill only helps them. After all, it is going \nafter companies which are now breaking Russian laws.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason why the U.S. taxpayer should be \nproviding any taxpayer dollars to companies that are colluding with \nIran to make that country an even greater danger to the United States, \nthe leading country sponsoring terrorism around the world that is \nseeking to get this technology.\n  We cannot allow this river of technology and assistance without doing \neverything possible to stop it. This bill works towards that goal. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for it. I encourage the administration \nto sign it and to help us stop the flow of this technology to the \nleading terrorist regime around the world that seeks to get these \nweapons that can strike at U.S. interests. This bill is clearly in the \nUnited States' best interests.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding time to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if others do not wish to speak at this time, \nI will. And at any time that a Member of the minority would like to \nmake a presentation, that will certainly be all right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters \nthat pertain to the chemical weapons treaty implementation portion of \nthis legislation, a letter from the Chemical Manufacturers Association \nand a letter from the American Forest & Paper Association.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Chemical Manufacturers\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                       Arlington, VA, May 7, 1998.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the Senate is scheduled to \n     take up H.R. 2709 later this month. This legislation contains \n     provisions necessary to assure full implementation of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in the United States. The \n     Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) is committed to \n     timely implementation of the CWC, and urges you and your \n     colleagues to pass the CWC implementing provisions as quickly \n     as possible.\n       CMA and its member companies strongly support the \n     Convention. We have a long history of involvement in the CWC, \n     from the early stages of negotiation, to Senate debate on \n     ratification to international implementation. Throughout the \n     CWC's history, we have held the view that it should be \n     implemented as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n       The CWC imposes on the U.S. government an obligation to \n     make a full declaration of affected government and commercial \n     facilities. Absent the implementing legislation, however, \n     there is no statutory basis to compel commercial facilities \n     to declare their CWC-related activities. CMA believes that \n     the CWC-related provisions of H.R. 2709 is the only route \n     available for the orderly implementation of the Convention.\n       The CWC-related provisions of H.R. 2709 are identical to S. \n     610, which passed the Senate on May 23, 1997. Thus, both \n     Houses of Congress have already approved these provisions. \n     CMA supported S. 610 as a reasonable approach to meet U.S. \n     obligations under the CWC and protect industry's interests. \n     We continue to support the CWC implementing provisions \n     contained in H.R. 2709.\n       If CMA can provide any additional information on its \n     position regarding implementation of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, please have your staff contact Claude Boudrias, \n     CMA's Associate Director of Federal Legislative Affairs, at \n     703/741-5915, or Marybeth Kelliher, Senior Manager for \n     International Trade, at 703/741-5923.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Frederick L. Webber,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Forest &\n\n\n                                            Paper Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing with regard to the \n     upcoming mark-up of S. 610, the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1997. Upon review of bill, the American \n     Forest & Paper Association (AF) would like to offer its \n     support, in general, of many of the bill's provisions. While \n     we believe it is unfortunate that the scope of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (``CWC'' or ``treaty'') is overly broad, \n     S. 610 contains a number of provisions that the forest \n     products industry believes are crucial to ensuring that \n     implementation of the CWC is reasonable and meets the stated \n     purposes of the treaty.\n       Among some of the provisions of importance to the forest \n     products industry are the following.\n       Section 403. We strongly support the prohibition of \n     requirements under the treaty for chemical byproducts that \n     are coincidently manufactured. Due to the broad nature of the \n     category of ``discrete organic chemicals,'' as defined by the \n     treaty, it is critical to recognize that inclusion of \n     coincidental byproducts of manufacturing processes that are \n     not captured or isolated for use or sale would exceed the \n     stated purposes of the CWC.\n       Section 3(11), (12) and (13). We strongly support the \n     listing of covered ``chemical agents'' in the bill. It is our \n     understanding that additions or deletions from the list would \n     only be permitted by legislative amendment, and not through \n     the administrative regulatory process. We believe maintaining \n     congressional authority for any list modifications is \n     necessary to ensure that any such modifications adhere \n     strictly to the intent and purposes of the treaty, as \n     ratified.\n       Section 303(b)(2)(B). We also support the provision \n     prohibiting employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration from participating on inspections conducted \n     under the treaty. The treaty should not be used as an omnibus \n     vehicle for regulatory inspections unrelated to its intended \n     purpose. We believe that it would be inappropriate to include \n     such government officials on an international inspection team \n     formed for the purposes set out in the CWC, and would merely \n     serve to detract from the intent of the inspection.\n       I would be happy to discuss these points with you further, \n     and appreciate the opportunity to provide this information on \n     behalf of AF's members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Josephine S. Cooper,\n                               Vice President, Regulatory Affairs.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I just noted, there are actually two parts \nof this legislation. One of them has to do with the implementation of \nthe chemical weapons treaty which was ratified in the Senate last year.\n  The legislation passed about a year ago. It was finally dealt with by \nthe House, and comes back to us. I do not know of any objection to it. \nAnd I will not take the time to summarize it except to say that in \ngeneral terms it\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\nmakes it a crime for Americans to produce or use or manufacture these \nchemical weapons.\n  It provides protections for American citizens and businesses in terms \nof search and seizure and takings, so that with respect to the \ninspection regime that is established under the treaty, there is \nprotection of American citizens' constitutional rights, and if anyone \nhas a question about that legislation, I am prepared to try to answer \nthat today.\n  But by far and away the issue that is before us today of most \ninterest to Members is, of course, the Russian missile assistance to \nIran. The majority leader spoke eloquently on the patience that the \nSenate has exercised in withholding action on this important \nlegislation until this time.\n  But there does come a time when, as the majority leader said, the \nSenate does have to finally act here. We believe that by passing this \nlegislation, it will actually have a positive impact on the leadership \nof Russia which has had a very difficult time ensuring that the \nassistance provided to Iran is stopped.\n  Now, one might say, ``Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense if it is \nthe policy of the Russian Government that this assistance not be \ntransferred to Iran.'' But the fact of the matter is, it is difficult \nfor the Russian Government, as the majority leader said, to ensure that \nthere is no transfer of technology or material to the Iranian missile \nprogram.\n  When confronted with evidence that this has occurred, in some cases \nthe Russian Government appears to have tried to take action against it; \nin other cases, as the majority leader said, that has not happened. So \nthis legislation should provide a basis not only for the United States \nto specifically direct attention to the matter, but also for the \nRussian Government to have a very specific basis for enforcing its laws \nand policies against the providing of such technology to Iran.\n  Mr. President, let me just outline in very brief terms some of the \nopen-source information about the kind of technology and other \nassistance that has been provided by Russian firms, individuals, and \nother entities to the Iranian program.\n  One of the Russian ICBM missiles--or at least intermediate-range \nmissile--is called an SS-4 in our terminology. And important missile \ncomponents and instructions of how to build that missile have been sent \nto the Iranians.\n  This is important because this missile has a much greater capability \nthan the one that is most likely to be produced soon. This missile, in \nthe Iranian term, is called the Shahab-4. It would have the capability \nof reaching cities in Europe, Mr. President. So it is not just a \nregional weapon, but a weapon that will challenge countries in Europe \nas well as in the Middle East. That weapon, according to open-source \nmaterial, could be deployable within as little as 3 years.\n  In addition to that, construction of a wind tunnel for missile design \nand manufacture of missile models, and even the sale of missile design \nsoftware has occurred.\n  Moreover, missile guidance and propulsion components, as well as the \nnecessary advice and equipment to produce these components in Iran has \nbeen provided. In that sense, Mr. President, let me note that it is not \nRussians who are actually building these missiles for the Iranians, it \nis Russians who are providing much of the material and the assistance \nand the technology for the Iranians to do it themselves. So they will \nhave an indigenous capability.\n  In addition, more than one special metal alloy which Iran can shape \ninto missile casings and even alloy foil in thin sheets used to shield \nguidance equipment had been provided, in one case, according to open-\nsource material, was stopped in another country after it left Russia.\n  Training of Iranian technicians at Russian institutes and the \nrecruitment of top Russian missile specialists to work with Iran has \nall occurred within the most recent months or years.\n  As I said, the Iranians are using this technology to produce two \nmissiles: One we call the Shahab-3, the other the Shahab-4. The Shahab-\n3 has a 1,300-kilometer range roughly, depending upon what kind of \nwarhead is included on it, and is capable of targeting Israel, as well \nas other targets in the Middle East. According to open-source material, \ndevelopment of this missile could be completed in 12 to 18 months.\n  I mentioned the Shahab-4, which is capable of reaching Central \nEurope, and the fact that development could be completed in 3 years.\n  Mr. President, since the Senator from Connecticut, I think, is \npreparing to speak, let me just summarize one other aspect of this \nassistance; that is the Russian nuclear assistance to Iran, not \nspecifically the target of this legislation, but of equal concern to \nus.\n  Russia has assisted Iran in a number of ways, including a contract to \nconstruct a nuclear reactor and a deal to provide nuclear fuel for the \nreactor for 20 years, and to take back spent fuel for reprocessing. It \nhas agreed to train Iranian nuclear technicians to operate the plant, \nto construct three additional reactors when the first contract is \ncomplete.\n  In 1995, in response to U.S. pressure, Russia agreed to limit the \nscope of nuclear cooperation with Iran and canceled plans to sell gas \ncentrifuge enrichment technology, and heavy water moderated reactors.\n  However, Russia has exceeded the limits it agreed to place on its \nnuclear cooperation with Iran. According to an article in July 1997 by \nThe Washington Post, the United States intelligence reports \n``document[ed] a series of high-level technical exchanges between \nRussia and Iranian engineers,'' which covered matters beyond the \nBushehr reactor, including advice on how to mine and process uranium.\n  Finally, Mr. President, just this month, The Washington Times \ndisclosed that U.S. intelligence reports indicate that Iranian nuclear \nofficials were negotiating to purchase tritium from Russia and were \nslated to view a demonstration of gas centrifuge technology used to \nenrich uranium for nuclear weapons during a visit to Moscow later this \nmonth.\n  At a meeting just last week, we specifically asked the Russian \nAmbassador if he would try to see to it that that demonstration project \nwas not held because its only purpose is to assist the uranium nuclear \nprogram. He indicated personally a desire not to see that meeting go \nforward, but we will see whether it does.\n  Tritium, which I mentioned, is, of course, important for the boosting \nof nuclear weapons and would be an important way for the Iranians to \nmake a nuclear technology more robust than it might be otherwise. These \nare serious matters.\n  The Russian Government, whether complicity or simply negligence, has \nnot been able to stop the transfer of these materials and this \ntechnology. The United States cannot simply sit by and hope for \ndiplomatic actions to work. In the Senate and the House, we recently \npassed money for a supplemental appropriations bill which will be \napplied to both Israeli theater missile defense systems and the U.S. \ntheater missile defense systems so we may at an earlier day be able to \nmeet the threat that the Iranian missiles might pose.\n  There may be a window of vulnerability. That is why it is important \nfor us to try to slow down and stop the assistance that Russia is \nproviding to Iran. This is very important legislation. I hope our \ncolleagues will support it strongly, sending a strong signal to Russia \nthat it should not be providing or allowing to be provided this \nimportant technology to Iran.\n  I yield whatever time the Senator from Connecticut desires.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Arizona not only for yielding but for his principal support of \nthis legislation and for his outstanding statement.\n  I rise to support the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act and to \nthank all of those in the Senate who have cosponsored it, principally \nthe distinguished majority leader of the Senate for his strong \nleadership in this effort. It has been purposeful. It has been \nbalanced. I think it has been quite realistic.\n  I think we have before the Senate a measured response to a real \nproblem. The real problem is the development by Iran of ballistic \nmissile capacity, longer-range ballistic missile capacity, which, when \ncombined with attempts within Iran to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction, holds the potential to change the balance of power within \nthe Middle East.\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\n  It is destabilizing. It is threatening to our troops and forces on \nthe waters within the Middle East region. It is threatening to our \nallies within the Arab world, moderate Arab nations. And it is \nthreatening to our ally, Israel. That is in the short run.\n  In the longer run, the development of longer-range ballistic missile \ncapacity by Iran could threaten our allies in Europe in a wider circle \naround Iran and, eventually, of course, could threaten us directly here \nin the United States of America. We are dealing here with a very, very \nserious and concrete challenge to world order and America's national \nsecurity.\n  This measure has been introduced and principally led by the majority \nleader. I am privileged to have joined with him in that. It is \ncosponsored by more than 80 Members of the U.S. Senate--84 is the \ntotal, I believe. It is in that sense a profoundly bipartisan response \nto this genuine national security problem.\n  I think one of the reasons this measure has gained the broad support \nthat it has is not only because the problem is real, the threat to \nsecurity from Iran having long-range ballistic missile capacity being \nreal, but because the approach taken in the bill is targeted.\n  I will go directly to the language of the bill. ``Sanctions shall be \napplied to every foreign person with respect to whom there is credible \ninformation indicating that person''--and of course ``person'' is given \na broad definition of a natural person --``is an alien or a \ncorporation, business, association, partnership, society, trust, or any \nother nongovernmental entity, organization, or group that is organized \nunder the laws of a foreign country or has its presence, people, or \nplace of business, in a foreign country or any foreign governmental \nentity operating as a business enterprise in any successor or \nsubsidiary of any entity.''\n  So this applies to any entity that comes within that category, that \nfirst transferred items on the MTCR, the missile technology control \nregime annex, or items that the United States opposed for addition to \nthat annex that contributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or \nproduce ballistic missiles.\n  We are talking here about entities that are helping Iran gain the \ncapacity that I have described, as the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenate majority leader have all described, ``to develop ballistic \nmissile capacity or provide technical assistance or facilities which \nthe President deems to be of concern, because of their direct \ncontribution to Iran's efforts.'' Again, to acquire or develop \nballistic missiles or attempt to transfer such items or attempted to \nprovide technical assistance or facilities.\n  That is very direct. Apply sanctions to entities that have actually \ndone something wrong, done something wrong in the judgment of the \nPresident of the United States as reported to Congress every year \nregarding any credible information that occurrences by these entities \nhave transpired to help Iran gain the capacity that we do not want them \nto gain.\n  That applies a series of sanctions in response to that evidence, and \ngives the President, incidentally, the authority to waive those \nsanctions if he either obtains additional information that diminishes \nthe content of the original finding or the President determines that \nthe waiver is required, is essential, to the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  So, it is very targeted and not the broad based, ``don't do any \nbusiness with this country or that country.'' But on a finding of \ncredible evidence by the President of the United States that a person, \na company, a governmental agency or institute has been assisting Iran \nin obtaining ballistic missile capacity, then these sanctions are \napplied and the President may use a waiver.\n  What are the sanctions? I will describe them generally: stopping arms \nsales under the Arms Export Control Act to these entities; stopping the \ntransfer or sale of dual-use items under the Export Administration Act; \nand the cessation of any U.S. grants or loans or other benefits to \nthese entities.\n  Why should we be helping companies or governmental agencies abroad \nthat are contributing to the development of this Iranian ballistic \nmissile capacity which will so threaten our security?\n  So it is a very measured approach which, again, I think is at the \nheart of why this bill before us has over 80 percent of the Senators \nsupporting it, a truly bipartisan measure.\n  Mr. President, there are those who will say that things are changing \nin Iran. So why pass this legislation? Well, from the best that I can \ndetermine, there are the beginnings of some changes in Iran. The \nchanges, certainly, have not gone far enough to alter the essential \ncharacter of the center of that regime, which is still fundamentally \nhostile and threatening to the United States and threatening to our \nsecurity. It is still the major sponsor, state sponsor of terrorism in \nthe world which, to the best of our knowledge, has resulted in the \ndeaths of many Americans and many citizens of other countries that are \nallies of America. Just the finding by the Argentinian security, law \nenforcement forces earlier this week announced--these are tough cases \nto investigate--they have traced two attacks, two bombings on Jewish \ninstitutions in Argentina directly back, by their judgment, just \nrepeating what I have read in the newspapers, back to Iran. And so it \ngoes.\n  So the election of the new President, President Khatami, of Iran, who \nhas been making statements that are more moderate, more open, both in \nterms of Iran's domestic policy and even international, who gave the \nimportant interview to CNN in which he suggested the possibility of \nopening informal contacts with the United States of America, he still \nmade some statements that are extremely hostile and negative toward us \nand some of our allies. But, nonetheless, I take these to be \nencouraging signs. But what remains the fact, as best any of us can \ndetermine, is that the much more radical elements within the Iranian \nGovernment are still in control of the apparatus of that government--\nthe military, the intelligence, the foreign policy--and, in fact, there \nis no indication that any of the sponsorship of terrorism has stopped.\n  In the meantime, the Senator from Arizona has suggested, as we have \nheard in classified briefings which cannot be discussed in detail here, \nthe Iranians get ever closer to developing, in a headlong thrust, full \nforce, full-throttle thrust, to developing long-range ballistic \nmissiles. Maybe it is going to be hard to stop him from doing this. But \nthe intention of this bill, it seems to me, is an exercise in common \nsense, the exercise of traditional principles of self-defense. This \nlegislation will help us to delay the date on which Iran will achieve \nlong-range ballistic missile capacity with which it can deliver weapons \nof mass destruction on those it chooses as enemies, as targets.\n\n  Let's think about it optimistically. Perhaps in that period of time, \nwe will see a fruition of some of the obvious interests, obvious \nconcerns of the people of Iran as expressed in the election of Mr. \nKhatami for a change. I hope so.\n  The people of Iran have no inherent reason--let me put it another \nway, Mr. President. There is no inherent conflict of interest, \nstrategic interest between the people of Iran and the people of the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, since the revolution that occurred in \nIran in the late 1970s, we have been set on a confrontational course \nwhich threatens the stability of the region and the world and does \nnothing good for the people of Iran --a gifted people with a proud \nhistory.\n  So I am hopeful about the changes that are possible within Iran, but, \nby any reasoned judgment, we have a long way to go yet. These missiles \nare being developed rapidly and they are going to be aimed at us and \nour allies. Therefore, this proposal still seems to me to be extremely \nimportant and, as I say, very measured and targeted.\n  Mr. President, there are those who say, well, OK, you are right, \nthere is a threat from Iran. But this measure is really targeted at \nRussia. Not only is there hope of change within Iran, but there is \neven, of course, more substantial change that has occurred, and the \nhope of change, within the Russian Government, particularly on this \nissue. So why provoke the Russians? It is the threat of these sanctions \nfrom Congress that matters, not the realization of it.\n  Let me say first, Mr. President, that on the face of the bill, there \nis no mention of Russia. This is a piece of legislation that is \ntargeted at any people,\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\nany entities, any government, anywhere on the globe that the President \nhas reason to believe is contributing to Iran's development and \nacquisition of ballistic missile capacity. It could apply to, and might \nin the past have applied to, companies in allied countries of ours in \nWestern Europe who, in one way or another, may have attempted to sell \nor sold items to the Iranians, which they have now used or are using in \nthe development of a ballistic missile capacity, or even in the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Certainly, some evidence suggests that there may be entities within \nthe People's Republic of China who have transferred items, sold items \nto the Iranians that are used in the development of these threatening \nprograms. North Korea, our relations with them are much more limited; \nnonetheless, that is another possibility. But it is true, to the best \nof our knowledge today and in recent years--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time controlled by the Senator from \nArizona has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes remain to the Senator from \nDelaware and an additional 90 minutes on any amendment proposed by the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time does my friend need?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thought we had more time available. I am glad to \nfinish up within 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator, who \ndisagrees with my position, as well as I will yield time at the \nappropriate time from our time to my friend from North Carolina as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for his extraordinary \ngraciousness, since we are in disagreement on this particular question. \nLet me summarize the remainder of my argument.\n\n  We know from intelligence sources, some of which had been reported in \nthe press and referred to by the Senator from Arizona, that in recent \nyears, as best we can determine, a number of companies, institutes, and \nsubdivisions within Russia have been involved in transactions, usually \nfor business purposes, with Iran, which are of material technical \nassistance to Iran, to help in their ballistic missile development \nprogram. So, yes, this legislation will apply to Russia.\n  We know this has been raised from the highest level of our \nGovernment--the Vice President, the National Security Adviser, and \nothers, like Ambassador Frank Wisner and Mr. Gallucci, with the \nRussians to end this cooperation with Iran. Progress is being made.\n  On January 22, which I believe is the exact date, former Prime \nMinister Chernomyrdin issued an Executive order in which he stated the \nintention of the government to begin to set some policies for trying to \ncontrol this activity. Within the last week, although I don't believe \nwe have seen the details of it in this country, the Russian Government \nhas promulgated a detailed series of regulations to carry out \nChernomyrdin's order of January of this year. So there is a good-faith \neffort being made at the governmental level.\n  Yet, our intelligence sources--to speak as broadly as I must in these \ncases--tell us there is still evidence that there are entities within \nRussia that are continuing to cooperate with Iran in the development of \nballistic missile capacity. That is why I think we have to go ahead \nwith this legislation today. But why? I think it is very important to \nsay that it is not directed at the Russian Government. In fact, unless \nthere is clear evidence of complicity by the Russian Government in one \nof these transfers, sanctions will not go to the Russian Government. \nThey will go to companies, institutes, or subdivisions. I hope our \nfriends, in return--particularly the new government of Mr. Kiriyenko, \nthe National Security Adviser--to give him a title he may not \nofficially have--and the deputy defense minister, Mr. Kokoshin--will \nclearly understand that this is not directed at them. In fact, when we \nadopt the amendment to be offered by the Senator from Michigan, which \nwill put the effective date of the gathering of relevant evidence to \nthe date of the Chernomyrdin order in January, then, I think, we will \nhave a law that basically says that America will sanction entities \nwithin Russia that are not complying with the clear policy of the \nRussian Government.\n  In that sense, I think this is a very important measure, one that \nwill contribute to our security, one that should not affect our \nbilateral relations with Russia, and one that could be the basis, I \nhope in fact, for us going forward to build a bilateral policy with \nRussia that understands that the strategic reality of the world has \nchanged after the cold war, and that we are no longer in a situation of \na bipolar world where each of the great powers, the Soviet Union and \nUnited States, are facing each other with intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles and nuclear warheads, and that we are working well together to \nbuild down in our weapons through the nuclear weapons, START I and \nSTART II; but that each of us, Russia and the United States, faces \nthreats from the proliferation of the possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the world-changing capacity to deliver those weapons \nwith ballistic missiles.\n\n  So we ought to work together to try to limit the spread of that \ntechnology and the danger it will represent not only to the United \nStates and their allies but to Russia and their allies.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill and for giving \nme the opportunity to speak to it today. I hope that we will adopt it \nunanimously. I look forward to seeing its implementation and the \nincrease in our security in one of those areas that we know will \nrepresent the greatest threat in the generation ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nJanuary 1998 Reader's Digest be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Reader's Digest, June 1998]\n\n                        Missle Threat From Iran\n\n                       (By Kenneth R. Timmerman)\n\n       Last August an American spy satellite spotted a scar of \n     fire on the out-skirts of Iran's capital, Teheran. It was the \n     unmistakable signature of a rocket-engine test. On the \n     ground, engineers and technicians watched a powerful liquid-\n     fueled missile engine bolted to a test stand shoot a plume of \n     fire.\n       The engine firing, conducted at the secrecy-shrouded Shahid \n     Hemat Industrial Group research facility, sent tremors \n     through Western intelligence agencies:\n       First, the successful test marked an ominous advance for \n     the anti-Western Islamic government of Iran. New-generation \n     ballistic missiles could give the regime a decisive military \n     edge in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n       Second, the new missile program bears the fingerprints of \n     an old adversary that is now supposed to be an American \n     ally--Russia. Iran's rocket engines, originally acquired from \n     North Korea, were upgraded in Russia. Technicians at Iran's \n     test facility included engineers from NP. Trud, a prestigious \n     Russian rocket-motor plant that helped develop the missiles \n     that targeted the West during the Cold War. And Iran's new \n     missiles are based in part on Soviet SS-4 strategic rockets.\n       Iran, whose leaders have chanted ``Death to America,'' is \n     believed to be less than a year away from test-firing a \n     ballistic missile, the Shahab-3, and is developing more \n     powerful versions. ``The deployment of these missiles, using \n     just conventional warheads with modern guidance, adds a giant \n     measure to Iran's ability to blackmail allies of the United \n     States,'' says former CIA director R. James Woolsey.\n       But the threat goes even further. The CIA states that Iran \n     is also developing chemical, biological and even nuclear \n     weapons. This, from a regime that the State Department has \n     labeled a terrorist threat.\n\n\n                         A Growing Partnership\n\n       After Islamic radicals overthrew the Shah of Iran and \n     seized the U.S. embassy in 1979, Washington slapped an arms \n     embargo on Iran. Undaunted, Iran conducted an international \n     campaign of assassinations and terrorism, pursued a \n     clandestine nuclear-weapons program and waged a bitter war \n     with neighboring Iraq (1980-88).\n       In that war, Iran launched missiles bought from North Korea \n     or assembled from parts made in China. When the U.S.S.R. \n     collapsed, Teheran began shopping in the huge arms \n     supermarket of the fledgling Russian Federation.\n       In a confidential meeting in Germany, Reader's Digest \n     interviewed an Iranian former intelligence officer who \n     confirmed Western intelligence reports that Russians began \n     working on Iran's long-range-missile projects in 1994. At \n     that time, Russian technicians visited the top-secret Iranian \n     Defense Technology and Science Research Center near Karaj, \n     50 miles northwest of Teheran, Iran subsequently began \n     receiving assistance from Russia's state-run missile\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\n     plants and technical universities. Russian advisers worked \n     at Iran's missile plants in Esfahan and Semnan, as well as \n     at design centers in Sultanatabad, Lavizan and Kuh-e Bagh-\n     e-Melli on the outskirts of the capital.\n       ``After that, Iran's missile program jelled,'' says Patrick \n     Clawson, an Iran analyst at the National Defense University \n     in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n                       the United States in range\n\n       With Russian help, Iran is working to field two families of \n     missiles in the near future. The Shahab-3 is the closest to \n     deployment. It will carry 1,650 pounds of explosives at least \n     800 miles--allowing Iran, for the first time, to hit every \n     major city in Israel, including Jerusalem. It would also \n     reach vital Persian Gulf oil fields--and the bases in Saudi \n     Arabia and Turkey where American forces are serving. A \n     Shahab-3 carrying the anthrax germ could kill millions.\n       Intelligence sources say that a number of engine tests for \n     the Shahab-3 have been observed, and that development will be \n     completed in early 1999, with production soon after. A senior \n     White House official told Reader's Digest that the United \n     States now believes Iran has most of what it needs to mass-\n     produce the Shahab-3. ``It may already be too late to stop \n     them,'' he said.\n       An even more powerful missile in development, the Shahab-4, \n     will carry a one-ton warhead 1,250 miles--making it capable \n     of devastating cities in countries as distance as Egypt. The \n     Russians are also helping a solid-fuel design team at the \n     Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group in Teheran develop a 2,800-\n     mile missile, capable of reaching London and Paris, and a \n     6,300-mile missile that could strike cities in the eastern \n     United States.\n\n\n                          diplomatic stonewall\n\n       At high-level meetings with Russian officials, including \n     President Yeltsin himself, the United States has repeatedly \n     expressed concern over Russian arms sales to rogue nations \n     such as Iran. But when Vice President Al Gore pressed Russian \n     Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on February 6, 1997, Gore \n     received a categorical denial.\n       Two months later, in April, Iran tested a new missile \n     engine. After analyzing the evidence, U.S. officials \n     concluded that the Russians had transferred technology from \n     SS-4 rockets to Iran--a clear violation of the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime that Russia signed in 1995. It also \n     violates the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, \n     in which the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to \n     destroy all such missiles, including the SS-4.\n       Yet each time the United States presented new evidence of \n     Russian assistance to Iran's long-range-missile program, \n     Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials \n     denied that this was Russia's policy, ``While we appreciate \n     such assurances,'' State Department official Robert \n     Einhorn told the Senate last June, ``we remain disturbed \n     by the discrepancy between them and what reportedly is \n     occurring,''\n       In fact, U.S. and Western intelligence sources have \n     confirmed that several hundred Russian engineers and \n     technicians travel regularly to missile facilities outside \n     Teheran helping the Iranians draw up missile-production \n     blueprints. Russia may have transferred to Iran a \n     supercomputer made by a U.S. company to complete the work. \n     And when the Iranians run into technical snags, they fly to \n     top-secret military institutes in Russia to see how the \n     Russians solved similar problems.\n       ``This is not a private operation by some crazy \n     engineers,'' an Israeli official told Reader's Digest in an \n     interview in Tel Aviv. ``The contracts [to assist Iran's \n     missile program] have been signed by companies that are at \n     least partially owned by the Russian government.''\n       Last July President Clinton assigned veteran diplomat Frank \n     Wisner to conduct a joint investigation with the Russians \n     into the missile allegations. His Russian counterpart was \n     Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, which \n     intelligence sources say is aiding in Iran's missile program. \n     (Koptev denies such involvement.)\n       Talks on Russian-technology transfers to Iran continue. \n     Meanwhile, Russian technicians still travel to Iran, and \n     shipments of missile components continue to reach Iran.\n       ``It must be made clear that doing business with our \n     enemies will cost them if they want to do business with us,'' \n     former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz says of \n     the Russians.\n       U.S. laws require the President to impose sanctions on \n     countries that assist certain nations in building ballistic \n     missiles and nuclear weapons. But the Administration has \n     refused to invoke sanctions, including those in a law co-\n     authored in 1992 by then-Senator Gore and Sen. John McCain \n     (R., Ariz.). Now Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.) and Trent \n     Lott (R., Miss.) have introduced new legislation with \n     sanctions that could involve:\n       Russia's space program. The United States is pumping $140 \n     million a year and invaluable expertise into Russia's space \n     program. This aid could be stopped.\n       U.S. contracts. Russian companies working in Iran have some \n     $2.5 billion in contracts with the U.S. government and U.S. \n     defense contractors. The United States could bar them from \n     American business.\n       High-tech exports. Russian firms in Iran have been buying \n     advanced U.S. technology. Such high-tech exports could be \n     barred.\n       In addition to these sanctions, the United States could \n     step up assistance to Israel's Arrow antimissile program to \n     ensure that Israel will have adequate defenses by the time \n     the Iranian missile go into production, possibly in 1999.\n       The United States could also increase pressure on Teheran. \n     Instead, the Clinton Administration has been seeking to open \n     a ``dialogue'' with the Iranians, a gesture interpreted by \n     some of Teheran's ruling clerics as a sign of American \n     weakness.\n       Some American leaders are determined to send a different, \n     stronger message, not only to Teheran but to Moscow as well. \n     ``Russia's transfer of missile technology to Iran is an issue \n     of enormous national security importance to the United States \n     and its allies,'' warns Senator McCain. ``It threatens to \n     further destabilize the region--and risks undercutting U.S.-\n     Russian relations.''\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friend from Michigan has 90 minutes on \nhis amendment. I wonder, in order that we can--we have been able to \nallocate time and I want to make sure that everyone who speaks to our \nposition gets a chance to--whether or not he would be willing to yield \noff the 90 minutes 4 minutes to our friend from North Carolina.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from North Carolina requested 6 minutes. I \nwould be happy to yield 6 minutes to my friend from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senators from Michigan \nand Delaware. I will stay within the 6 minutes.\n  Madam President, I strongly support H.R. 2709. I come to the floor, \nhowever, rather worried about the administration's decision last week \nto waive sanctions against a French energy company that is doing a \nmassive billion-dollar oil deal with Iran. The President's decision to \nwaive imposed sanctions on the French energy company was done under the \nguise of national security. I have to wonder, and we all wonder, whose \nnational security is he referring to when he chooses to waive the \nsanctions? Certainly, it is not the national security interests of the \nUnited States for Iran to improve its oil-exporting capability so that \nit can turn around and then use the same money to fund missile \ndevelopment. I certainly can't believe it is in the best interests of \nthe State of Israel to have Iran improving its foreign cash reserves \nfor the very same reasons.\n  Iran is improving its cash reserves, and they are improving their \nmissile technology. Just in January of this year, the CIA told the \nSenate that Iran would be able to target ballistic missiles at Israel \nmuch sooner than the 10 years that we had previously been led to \nbelieve. So, therefore, I have to conclude that he made this decision \nin the national interest of France and Russia. I think that is a very \npoor reason to make a decision of this magnitude.\n  Here we go again. We are passing a good bill to impose sanctions on \nindividuals who transfer missile technology to Iran. But section 105 of \nthe bill permits a waiver based on the national security interests of \nthe United States. The part that concerns me is the waiver. I am \nconcerned about how the President has interpreted this in the other \nIranian sanction bills. I think there should be no waiver. I do not \ntrust the President's decision on waivers. Given that Israel was the \nonly sovereign state, outside Kuwait, that was attacked by Iraq during \nthe gulf war as they were attacked by missiles, I think there should be \nlanguage in this bill and in the Iranian-Libyan section that mandates \nconsultation with Israel before we choose to waive any sanctions for \nmissile production or oil production. I think we owe it to our \nfriends--the true friends in the Mideast--the Israelis.\n  I hope that such legislation wouldn't be necessary and that the \nPresident would be more frugal in his actions.\n  So I plan to introduce this as freestanding legislation. I hope we \ncould consider this sometime in the very near future. We should be \nconsulting with Israel before making decisions affecting their \ninterests, just as much so, and more so, than we should be with Russia \nand France. Israel is a country that is most threatened by missile \nproduction by rogue states like Iran and Libya.\n  I know there are some who think the Iranian regime is moderating \nitself. I personally don't think they are. But even if they are, I \ndon't think that we should be lulled into a sense that we\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\nhave turned the corner in our relations with Iran. They only respect \nthe United States for its power. They simply laugh at us when we are \nweak. They take the President's waiver as a sign of weakness--not as a \ngesture of improved relations.\n  The Mideast is still an extremely volatile area. The United States is \nat its best when we stand behind our true ally, the Israelis, as they \nhave been our true ally. They have been our sea anchor in a turbulent \npart of the world. We should negotiate from a position of strength--not \nwhen we accommodate murderers and terrorists who pretend to be \ngovernment figures. We should be supporting our true ally in the \nMideast. Again, I strongly support the legislation.\n\n  I yield the remainder of the time, and I thank the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, up to the time I have allotted to me.\n  I was asked by someone yesterday after a meeting at the White House \non this issue, What did I think about this sanctions act? And I said: \n``Good act, bad timing.'' Good act, bad timing.\n  The extent to which this act that we are about to vote on, this \nsanctions bill, is of value is a little like nuclear weapons: Their \nvalue is in their nonuse; their value is in their threat of use.\n  The administration has made significant progress over the 6 months we \ngave them with the threat of this bill in place. It has had the best of \nall worlds. It has allowed those in Russia who very desperately want to \ncut off this program and this relationship with Iran the ability to \nsay, ``we must do this or we will lose much more than we will gain,'' \nwithout having to put themselves in a position politically in their own \ncountry in which they appear to be publicly buckling to the pressure \napplied by the United States.\n  So, although I have no disagreement with the principle of H.R. 2709, \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997, and I have no \ndoubt that it addresses an urgent concern we cannot ignore, I have a \ngreat deal of doubt about whether we should be voting for it now and \nsending it to the President now.\n  Madam President, to state the obvious, the cold war is over. One of \nthe great wonders of it is that the world was spared any use of nuclear \nweapons during that cold war, and almost--almost--any use of chemical \nor biological weapons. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand the means to deliver them, however, could bring about the very \nholocaust that we have managed to avoid over the past 50 years.\n  So, everyone here is united in one objective: to stop, inhibit, \ncurtail the proliferation of weapons or the means of delivering those \nweapons. How do we best do that? Is the best way to do that, relative \nto Iran's missile program, to impose these sanctions now? Will this \nbill, by its passage, finally turn off the last few drops of water \ncoming out of that spigot? Or will it enhance the prospect that the \ncooperation with Iran--which began years ago and has continued in \ndiminishing amounts up to now--will be increased, reversing the \nmomentum of the last 6 months?\n  It seems to me, as rational persons--and we all are, obviously, on \nthis--we have to examine that question. For me, the instinct to punish \nRussia for what they did in the past is overtaken by my fear that the \nproliferation will increase. To the extent that I have a disagreement \nwith my friend from Connecticut or my friend from Arizona, two of the \nbrightest people in this body, it relates to how I come down on that \nquestion.\n  One or another country may think it needs these weapons to protect it \nfrom its neighbors or gain the attention of the great powers. The fact \nis, however, that weapons of mass destruction threaten us all, \nespecially when the countries that seek them are ruled by murderous \ndespots or inflamed by ethnic or ideological causes.\n  Today, two sets of neighboring countries--India and Pakistan, and \nIran and Iraq--pose the greatest threat that weapons of mass \ndestruction might actually be used. India and Pakistan have to be \nrestrained from using such weapons against each other. I was reminded \nby someone today, we are talking about a response time of 3 minutes--3 \nminutes; a pretty short leash, quite a hair trigger--when we are \ntalking about Pakistan and India. The same would apply to Iraq and \nIran, who have managed over the last decades to kill hundreds of \nthousands of each other's citizens. So these two sets of neighbors--\nIndia and Pakistan, Iran and Iraq--it seems to me, are most likely to \nget the world in trouble. Iran and Iraq have to be prevented from \nobtaining such weapons and from using them, not only against each other \nbut also against the whole Middle East region, if not the world.\n  Some foreign entities, notably Russia, have continued to assist \nIran's ballistic missile program intended to give Iran long-range \nability to deliver weapons of mass destruction. This assistance must \nstop, and it must stop now.\n  Since early last year, U.S. officials from the Clinton \nadministration, including the President and the Vice President, have \nraised the matter with their Russian counterparts, Yeltsin, \nChernomyrdin, and Kiriyenko. They have all agreed it is hardly in \nRussia's interests to give Iran the capacity to fire long-range \nmissiles with weapons of mass destruction. Special envoys Frank Wisner \nand Robert Gallucci have worked with Russian Space Agency chief Yuri \nKoptev to help Russia determine what it must do to stem this \nassistance.\n  Let us get a little background here, because we all kind of mentioned \nit. Here you have a former empire that has crumbled around the ears of \nRussian leaders. They are left with a number of the old apparatchiks in \ncharge of huge, bureaucratic entities, departments, who have, off and \non for the last 9 years, been free agents to some degree or another.\n  The idea that Yeltsin has his finger on, and knowledge about, and the \nability to control every one of his disparate agencies out there is, I \nthink we would all acknowledge, not nearly, nearly a reality. So, since \nearly last year, American officials have been working very hard, \npressuring, cajoling, and educating the Russian leadership as to why \nthis is against the Russian leaders' own interests and how to gain \ncontrol, how to gain control of their own entities.\n  There is an irony here. If we said to our constituents that there is \nthis outfit in Russia that doesn't control what is happening in a \ndepartment in one of the six nuclear cities in Russia, or doesn't have \ncontrol over a department in Moscow, they would say: ``Wait a minute, \nisn't this the same outfit that ruled with the iron fist, so that they \nwould be able to not only have a command economy, but to command \neverything?'' But the fact is, the Russian leaders do not have that \nability any more. And they do not know how to gain it.\n  So I start off with the proposition that this is a very different \ncircumstance than if we were dealing with the U.S.S.R. and this program \nwere going on. If I were to have turned to even Gorbachev, or any of \nhis predecessors, and said, ``you are transferring this technology to \nIran,'' and had them say, ``we didn't know that, or were unaware of the \nextent of it,'' having been here 25 years and dealt with them on that \nissue for 15 years, I would have said unequivocally on this floor, \n``that is flatout a lie; they cannot not know that.''\n  But it is clear that, although much was known in some quarters, a lot \nwas not known. So you actually have the Russian leadership saying, \n``How do we set up export controls? How do we gain control? You have \nbeen doing this. How do you all do it?'' --we have not done it \nperfectly, by the way, but--``How do you do it?''\n  The fact is that troubling aspects of the Russian assistance to Iran \nprogram continue to this very day. I know that. All of us on this floor \nhave gotten a briefing. We know that. And with each passing day, Iran \ncomes closer to obtaining the ability to have long-range missiles that \ncan rain down chemical or biological destruction on Israel, Saudi \nArabia, and U.S. Armed Forces in the region, and, obviously, to \nunderstate it, that is a real problem.\n  So, what do you do about this? The executive branch, in my view, has \nmade real progress, important progress, that this bill before us, I \nbelieve, will sacrifice. Let me give you a few examples.\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\n  Last year, Russia expelled an Iranian Embassy employee who was \ninvolved in seeking assistance for Iran's missile program. Russia's \nFederal Security Service, the FSB, says that Russia also deported a \nmember of an Iranian military delegation.\n  The FSB adds, in a statement of May 15, that two officials at a \nRussian research center were arrested, convicted, and sentenced to \nprison for trying to ``enter into an agreement with a foreign firm to \ndesign homing electronic devices for missiles.''\n  They also foiled an effort by Iran's SANAM industry group, to get \nmissile parts from a Russian firm, NPO Trud. The FSB statement also \nadds that, ``All the activities of the SANAM group on the territory of \nRussia have been terminated and prohibited.''\n  On January 22, Russia issued Order No. 57 establishing what are \ncalled ``catch-all controls'' over the export of any material or \ntechnology that might contribute to Iran's programs to develop weapons \nof mass destruction or long-range missiles.\n  Last week, Russia promulgated implementing directives for that order \nrequiring that each entity involved in high-tech material or technology \nexports set up a review committee to screen proposals and specifying \n``red flags'' that would require referral of proposals to high-level \nofficials for approval. Those ``red flags'' are precisely the sort of \ncriteria that we would want Russia to use. For example, they name \ncertain Iranian entities that are automatically suspect no matter what \nthey want to buy. That is a take-no-chances approach that suggests the \nseriousness on the part of Russia.\n  The pace of diplomacy is slow, Madam President, and so is the pace of \nRussian bureaucracy, and so is the pace of putting together a Russian \nGovernment that can control Russia. I understand and share the \nfrustration that my colleagues feel in this regard. But, as the kids \nsay, let's get real. When was the last time we turned Russian policy \ncompletely around, and how long did it take?\n  When we didn't like the Soviet Union deploying SS-20 intermediate-\nrange missiles in the European theater, we had to build and deploy \nPershing missiles in response before they would sign the Intermediate \nNuclear Forces Treaty. The process took 10 years. It took a similar \nperiod of time for the Soviet Union, later Russia, to admit it was \nviolating the ABM Treaty in building a large phased-array radar near \nKrasnoyarsk. And there are a lot of other examples of how long this \ntakes.\n  My colleagues will say the assistance continues, that these \ninstitutions and firms are just looking for ways to get around Order \nNo. 57, and that there are still bureaucracies that oppose Yeltsin and \nKiriyenko on this issue; and I will reply, ``Yup, you're right, that's \nexactly what has happened.''\n  What on Earth does anybody expect? Do my colleagues expect Russian \nofficials to be grateful when we catch them doing something stupid and \ncall them on it? Do they expect the institutes, that cannot pay for \ntheir personnel, or their factories that pay their workers in goods to \nbarter on the market, to be happy when we tell them that they have to \nturn down hard currency from Iran?\n  Look, we have a satellite industry that is apoplectic today--an \nAmerican satellite industry that is apoplectic today--because the House \ntook action and the Senate may take action curtailing their ability to \nlaunch these satellites into space from other launch systems around the \nworld. Why? They are going to lose billions of dollars. Mark my word, \nyou are going to start hearing from their employees saying, ``What have \nyou done to my job?'' Right? We all know that. We shouldn't yield to \nthe company or the employee if it is against the national interest, but \nwe are going to hear it.\n  What would happen, do you think, if all of a sudden we were to say, \n``By the way, stop doing'' such and such, which is the only thing that \nallows you to make any money at all, to even be given goods you can \nbarter on the street to keep your apartment? I don't say this by way of \njustifying anything Russia is doing, but there is a report from an \norganization I have great respect for, the American Jewish Committee. \nThe American Jewish Committee had a report written called ``The Russian \nConnection: Russia, Iran, the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction.'' It is a very good report. I recommend it to everyone.\n  They point to an article that was written in Russia about missile \nspecialists who worked in Iran during the past few years. It says that \nspecialists were recruited by Iranians in collaboration with the \nFederal Security Service--which is now going to be part of stopping \nthis.\n  Then the article goes on to say that the policy of assisting the \nmissile program began in 1994, when the then-chief of Yeltsin's \nbodyguard service was involved in export policymaking, and that it was \ndone--for what? For hard currency, for money.\n  Now we have convinced Yeltsin and a new government in Russia--which \nis probably the most pro-American government that has existed in the \nlast 90 years in Russia, maybe in Russian history--we have them taking \nall these steps to cut this off. OK? So far, so good.\n  The American Jewish Committee report points out that the reason they \ndid this was for money. Now we go ahead and we cut off any money that \nwe are going to send these Russian entities in existing bilateral \narrangements we have. What do we think Russian leaders are going to do? \nAre they going to say, ``You know, we now lost the American support \nthat we, the new Government in Russia, want, and we don't want to be \nselling this missile technology anyway because it is against our \ninterest, so at least we could have told the folks in those departments \nthat there was something coming, but the Americans are going to cut off \nthat money, we're not going to get that, but, by the way, still don't \nfollow through on this Iranian program?''\n  It is lose-lose. They not only lose the money that encouraged them to \nenter into these arrangements in 1994, because of our efforts to stop \nit and because they were not quick enough and thorough enough in \nstopping it, they have now lost any other aid they have.\n  Again, I am not approaching this from an ideological point of view. I \nam not approaching this from a point of view of who is right or who is \nwrong, whether they did the right thing or the wrong thing. I am trying \nto approach this from a practical point of view: How do we assure that \nwhat was going on doesn't continue? How do we stop proliferation?\n  This same report published by the American Jewish Committee makes a \nvery, very important point in a section entitled ``American Policy \nOptions.''\n  It says:\n\n       The United States faces tough choices in addressing the \n     issue of Russian-Iranian missile cooperation. Both the \n     Clinton administration and its critics confront the fact that \n     American leverage is probably limited.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       However, the threat of sanctions will not in itself be \n     sufficient. The threat of missile proliferation is serious \n     enough to warrant offering improved carrots.\n\n  Let's get this straight. Everybody has kind of figured this out--\nlet's review the bidding.\n  The Russians were bad guys. They sold technologies to people who were \neven worse guys. The combination of that is against the interests of \nthe United States, and particularly against the interests of Israel. We \nhave to turn it around and stop it.\n  We went ahead, and after the last couple years--with great pressure \nduring this year, thanks to congressional leadership having the \nsanctions sitting out on the table--convinced Yeltsin, and now the \nfriendliest government that ever existed in Russian history toward the \nUnited States, the two new young guys in positions of power, not only \nthat it is against their interests, but also that they better stop. And \nthere is some evidence they are stopping it.\n  They are finding where at least some of the technology leaks are and \nthey are turning them off. And now here we are after they had begun the \nprocess saying, ``Aha, but you did do it.'' Of course they did it. And \nwhat we're going to do is to say, ``we're going to cut your water off \nfrom this end of the spigot. We're going to cut it off.''\n  And if the objective is America's interest and indirectly Israel's \ninterest, which is an American interest, how does that make sense? Let \nme add one other dimension here.\n  I said: ``This is a good act, bad timing.'' Let us review the bidding \nand\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\nwhat is going on in the Asian subcontinent right now. Regarding India \nand Pakistan, we are breaking our neck, some of us on this floor \npersonally, the President, Democrats, Republicans, pleading, cajoling, \ndoing everything we can with Pakistan not to up the ante. We are doing \neverything we can to take an Indian Government that has overstepped its \nbounds against its good judgment, in my view, and say, ``Tone down what \nyou're doing.'' We are trying to put a lid on this.\n  So what are we doing? Some of us, as well as the administration, are \ndoing everything from picking up the phone and calling Sharif in \nPakistan, to saying, through the administration, to Yeltsin, ``You, \nYeltsin, have a relationship with India. Call them. Tell them. \nCooperate with us.''\n  Every Republican and Democrat who has any contact in China is trying \nto get China to put pressure on Pakistan. And in the middle of this \ngigantic effort, that is literally worldwide, at a moment when every \nnation in the world, particularly the nuclear powers, fully understands \nthe potential consequence of Pakistan's nuclear testing now and India's \nheated rhetoric--now, when all this is going on--what are we doing?\n  In fairness to the leader, this was under a unanimous consent \nagreement, and put off from back in November, but what are we doing? We \nare coming along invoking a sanction potentially that is going to make \nit more difficult by anybody's standard to get worldwide cooperation.\n  Who are the nations that can most influence Pakistan or most \ninfluence India right now, beyond the United States? I will bet that if \nwe ask all the staff in the back who are experts on this--whether they \nare for these sanctions or against them--I bet that if we asked \neverybody in this Chamber, and I put a list on the board saying, \n``Which are the most likely countries to be able to influence \nPakistan,'' and put Russia, France, Germany, England and China--I bet \nyou would all pass the test and say, ``China.'' And why would you say \nthat? Because China has been selling them missile technology.\n  Now, I wonder who would have the most influence on India. The answer \nis Russia, for similar reasons. So thus it seems to me, Madam \nPresident, that this is a good idea at a very bad moment.\n  We also have a new government in Russia. We have two young people--\nand every analyst to whom I have spoken, conservative or liberal, \nDemocrat or Republican, or who has testified before the committee or \nspoken to my staff has said, ``These two new guys are keepers. They're \nthe best shot we have.'' They are the best shot we have. Now they have \ngone out and put their new, fragile reputations on the line in that new \ngovernment, and said, with regard to assistance to Iran's missile \nprogram, ``Shut it down.'' And the first bit of reward we are going to \ngive them is sanctions against entities in their country.\n\n  Now, look, some former President, whom I will not name, once said, \n``Life is not fair.'' I am not suggesting to anybody that it would not \nbe fair to impose these sanctions. By any measure, it is fair, because \nthey did not play by the rules. They broke the agreements. So it is \nfair; but is it smart? Is it in our interests? Is it a good idea? In my \nhumble opinion, the answer is no, it is not smart, it is not a good \nidea, it is not in our interest. The sanctions we mandate will be \nresented and they will be resisted and, in my sincere view, they will \nfail where diplomacy is succeeding.\n  Some aspects of this bill seem calculated to anger Russia rather than \nto secure compliance. One is the ``credible evidence'' standard for \nsanctions. According to the report on this bill, the standard is meant \nto require sanctions when information is merely ``sufficiently \nbelievable as to raise a serious question * * * as to whether a foreign \nperson may have transferred or attempted to transfer'' sanctionable \nitems of technology.\n  This is kind of the ``shoot first, ask questions later'' approach to \ninternational relations. This is cold-war posturing in a warmer \nenvironment, with the friendliest government we have ever had an \nopportunity to work with, and it will likely fail.\n  Fortunately, our action today is not the end of the process. The \nPresident is very likely--very likely--to veto this bill. And if we \nhave the amendment of the Senator from Michigan accepted, which I \nexpect it to be, we will have to go back to conference.\n  And I say to you, Madam President, and to my colleagues, that I hope \nRussian officials and firms that follow this debate will hear the \nmessage my colleagues are sending. If Russian assistance to the Iranian \nmissile program does not cease within a matter of weeks, I truly \nbelieve that this body will override the President's veto and set in \nstone this counterproductive sanctions bill.\n  I also say to my friends who believe that this sanctions bill is \nwarranted on the merits, if you just do it based on weighing the \nscales, that you are giving up nothing by delaying here. Can anyone \nshow me that there has not been real progress over the last 6 months?\n  So if in 2 weeks or 6 weeks or 8 weeks this progress has not \ncontinued, this sanctions bill can be brought back up. But to pass it \nnow, I honestly believe, will be counterproductive.\n  Russia's legal and administrative actions so far, while insufficient, \nshow their good intent. There is also a strong foundation on which to \nbuild. But the edifice of enforcement must be built quickly. Only \nspeedy Russian action is likely to avert the sanctions regime mandated \nin this bill.\n  In closing, let me note my deep objection to the other body's \ninsistence upon attaching the Chemical Weapons Convention \nImplementation Act to this measure. This is a practice that has to \nstop. It is irresponsible, absolutely irresponsible, in my view. \nCombining the two bills, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation \nAct and the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, both of which \nshould be sent over here-- I am not suggesting that they shouldn't do \nthat--to tie them together in the hope that it will force the President \nto sign the bill is holding hostages that relate to our national \ninterest as Americans.\n\n  They did the same thing with the IMF. They did the same thing with \nthe United Nations arrearages by attaching abortion language. Each of \nthese issues warrants debate, but not tied to one another. Attaching \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act to this bill serves \nmerely to delay for many months and to put at risk a bill that is \nimportant to our national interests. That was an irresponsible action, \nin my view, that ill-befits a coequal branch of government, the House \nof Representatives.\n\n\n          Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation--at Last\n\n  Mr. President, title two of the measure that we are passing today--\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1997--deserves \nsome attention. Final passage of this bill is long overdue. Its \nenactment, despite its flaws, will serve the national interest in very \nreal ways.\n  U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention last year was \nnot easily achieved. In the end, however, all the Democrats in this \nbody and most of our Republican colleagues joined to fashion a 74-26 \nmajority for ratification. Nearly one year ago, this body passed the \nimplementation bill that is once again before us.\n  Final passage of that act will serve our national interest in several \nways. First, it will enable the U.S. Government to require industry to \ncomply with the data declaration provisions of the convention. In \naddition, this law will provide protection to confidential business \ninformation that U.S. firms may be required to submit.\n  The filing of a complete national data declaration will finally put \nour country in compliance with this convention. That is no small \nmatter. Until then, the United States cannot exercise effective \nleadership in the organization for the prevention of chemical weapons--\nthe implementing body for the convention. And make no mistake: It will \nbe U.S. leadership that guides the organization toward effective \nverification and enforcement of compliance with this convention.\n  The United States has a tremendous stake in enforcement of the \nChemical Weapons Convention. Our interests are world-wide, and U.S. \ntroops are often stationed in far-flung locations. Wherever U.S. forces \ngo, they will be far safer if chemical weapons are removed as a \nmilitary threat.\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\n  In its first half year since entering into force, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention has already had some successes. China, India, and \nseveral other countries have admitted for the first time to having \nchemical weapons programs. The weapons and weapons facilities that they \ndeclared have been inspected and will eventually be destroyed. The \ninformation that they have provided will enhance our ability, moreover, \nto monitor their chemical establishments and to search out any \nsuspicious activities.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention has also taken some important steps \ntoward universality. Both India and Pakistan have joined; China has \njoined; Russia has joined; and even Iran has joined.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act embodies \ncompromises between treaty supporters and treaty opponents. I supported \nthis compromise bill last year because it was important then--as it is \nnow--to facilitate U.S. compliance with the convention. I support it \ntoday for that reason and because the administration has assured us \nthat it is more important to enact this measure than to spend more time \ncorrecting the faults in it.\n  Let me make clear, however, that I still have very serious concerns \nabout the impact of some of this bill's provisions on implementation of \nthe convention.\n  In particular, I do not believe we should be granting the President \ndiscretionary authority to deny an inspection based on national \nsecurity grounds, as would be done by section 237. By signing and \nratifying this treaty, the United States--with the advice and consent \nof 74 members of this body--agreed to allow certain inspections, \nsubject to our constitutional requirements. With few exceptions, denial \nof a duly authorized inspection would violate the convention.\n\n  Even if the President never exercises this authority, the mere \ninclusion of this provision in the legislation will encourage other \ncountries to deny inspections on national security grounds. If we \nshould enact the so-called ``national security exception,'' we can be \nsure that China, Iran, and other countries will seize upon the \nprecedent we set and use it to undermine the effectiveness of the \nverification regime.\n  I have similar concerns regarding section 253, which would exempt \nfrom reporting and routine inspection requirements unscheduled discrete \norganic chemicals that are coincidental byproducts and are not isolated \nor captured for use or sale. While waste streams are not, in \nthemselves, a threat to the object and purpose of the chemical weapons \nconvention regime, monitoring of such streams does afford one of the \nmost convenient and non-intrusive means of determining whether a \nfacility is worthy of concern in the first place.\n  I am also troubled by:\n  The broad compensation scheme in section 213 that does not even \nrequire a plaintiff to prove its case by a preponderance of the \nevidence in order to receive taxpayer funded compensation for the loss \nof trade secrets; and the limitation in sections 212 and 238 on the \nGovernment's power to require contractors to submit to inspections.\n  Finally, I regret that this legislation does not undo the damage to \nour national security that I fear will be caused by condition 18 to the \nresolution of ratification for the convention. That condition provides \nthat no chemical sample taken by the international inspectors may be \nremoved from the United States for analysis. While it may offer some \nfurther protection to U.S. manufacturers against possible industrial \nespionage, it also opens a huge loophole for countries that may violate \nthis convention.\n  I firmly believe that the convention's provisions and the other \nconditions to our resolution of ratification provide sufficient \nprotection for the confidential business information of U.S. firms. \nIndeed, insistence upon U.S.-based analysis of U.S. samples will \nactually make it easier for foreign spies to obtain that information, \nby effectively specifying the laboratories for them to target. And I \ndread the stain upon our collective conscience if a future violator of \nthis treaty should ever make use of the exemption we are carving out, \nand then use those illegal chemical weapons against U.S. forces or \ninnocent civilians.\n  Opponents of the convention insisted upon condition 18, arguing that \nno good would ever come from on-site inspections anyway. I hope and \nbelieve that they will come to realize the error of their ways and will \naccept the need to make this treaty as effective an instrument as \npossible. Strict verification is crucial to making sure that Iran, \nChina, and other countries with undeclared or formerly undeclared \nchemical weapons programs are given as little an opportunity as \npossible to hide illegal weapons stocks or production.\n  That said, however, final passage of this act is still an important \naccomplishment. By facilitating U.S. compliance and leadership, it \nopens the door to further success in the campaign to rid the world of \none of its most heinous inventions.\n  Mr. President, I now close with a statement that addresses the \n``carrots'' that the American Jewish Committee report calls for and \nthat sets forth some proposals in that area.\n\n\n        Non-Proliferation: An Ounce of Prevention Is Not Enough\n\n  As we near the end of the 1990's, there can be no doubt that future \nhistorians will highlight this time as the decade in which the Cold War \nwas ended and the Soviet Union was dissolved. Even so far-reaching an \naction as the enlargement of NATO, to which this body recently gave its \nconsent, will be seen largely as an outgrowth of the cataclysmic \nchanges in Moscow that upended the bipolar structure of post-World War \nII international relations.\n  How else will historians characterize this decade? Will we be seen as \nhaving turned to peace? Or will historians say that we turned merely to \nfurther war in a new context?\n  The Good Friday Agreement offers hope for peace in Northern Ireland. \nThe Oslo Agreement and related efforts in the Middle East offer hope \nfor peace in that region as well, despite the many obstacles that still \nlitter that path. The Dayton Accords offer similar hope for Bosnia and, \nindeed, for the Balkans as a whole.\n  The wars and massacres in Africa are another matter. We are trying to \ncreate new structures to prevent or control such conflict, but our \nfailure to avert millions of deaths in central Africa will lead future \ngenerations to remark on how poorly we had learned the lessons of the \nfirst holocaust.\n\n\n               The Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n  The final judgment on this decade may well hinge, however, on how we \nhandle the threat of other holocausts--those made possible by weapons \nof mass destruction. The potential for such horrific acts may well have \nbeen increased by the end of the Cold War. And a failure to contain \nthat risk could radically alter the judgment of history, assuming that \nanyone survives to write it.\n  Weapons of mass destruction pre-date the Cold War. In the 1760's, \nEngland used primitive biological warfare to kill American Indians in \nPontiac's Rebellion. Chemical weapons were used in World War I. And the \ntwo atomic bombs that helped to end World War II demonstrated mankind's \nability to bring about the apocalypse in the blink of an eye.\n  During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union amassed \nby far the largest stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction ever seen. \nExperts will argue over whether the use of all those weapons would have \ncaused a ``nuclear winter'' that would end all human existence. There \nis little doubt, however, that the resulting human, economic and \nenvironmental devastation would have destroyed our modern civilization.\n  The great irony of the Cold War, however, was that the tight \nleadership of two blocs by the United States and the Soviet Union kept \nnearly all of this Armageddon arsenal under their firm control. There \nwere a few cases in which chemical weapons were used. By and large, \nhowever, the terror of ``Mutually Assured Destruction'' kept the \nnations of the world inline and prevented any descent into the abyss of \nall-out war.\n  The end of the Cold War has reduced dramatically the risk of a \nnuclear holocaust sparked by war between the United States and Russia. \nStrategic arms reductions under the START Treaty have begun the process \nof stepping back from the brink. Russia will\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\neventually ratify START II, and I think we can look forward, in the \ncoming years, at least to START III as well. The CFE Treaty continues \nto regulate conventional weapons in Europe, moreover, so as to limit \nthe risk of hostilities that could spark a larger conflict.\n  There has also been progress on chemical and biological weapons. \nRussia has joined us as a State Party to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and will destroy at least 40,000 metric tons of \nchemical agent. President Yeltsin admitted that Russia had violated the \nBiological Weapons Convention and ordered an end to Russia s offensive \nbiological weapons program. We still lack confidence that Russia is not \nhiding some illegal chemical or biological weapons or weapons \ncapabilities, but the trend is toward a day in which no massive \ncapability of that sort will remain.\n\n  The greatest risk that is not yet contained is that some other \ncountry, or even a terrorist group, might use these horrendous weapons. \nWhile such countries and groups are unlikely to unleash a holocaust, \nthe scale of destruction they could cause would still be astounding--\nand our own cities or bases could well be their targets.\n  Rogue states and criminals have tried to get Russian and former \nSoviet nuclear weapons material and technology during this decade, \nalthough with little success. Countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria \nhave had better success gaining Russian and/or Chinese chemical weapons \ntechnology and material (including equipment and precursor chemicals), \nbiological weapons material (including production equipment), and \nballistic missiles or missile technology.\n  These transfers of weapons and technology have taken a toll on \nregional stability. India and Pakistan now threaten each other with \nballistic missiles, and India's recent nuclear tests could lead \nPakistan to test as well. It was hard enough to maintain the ``balance \nof terror'' between the United States and the Soviet Union. Can India \nand Pakistan maintain that balance without descending into war, with \ntheir history of border wars and bloody terrorist incidents? I hope \nthey can avoid a regional holocaust; but clearly, the risk of that is \nreal.\n  Russia, China, North Korea, and various Western companies have \ncontributed to India and Pakistan's missile and nuclear weapon \nprograms. There has been a profit motive in those deals, as well as \nsupposed security interests on the part of China and Russia.\n  But how valuable are company profits, or foreign exchange for North \nKorea, if the result is nuclear war? Where is the security for China if \nradioactive clouds should pass over its territory as its neighbors \ndescend into chaos?\n  The same questions apply to those who would assist Iran or Iraq to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. Will the paltry profits in \nassisting Iran's ballistic missile programs really matter if Iran can \nattack Russia and its neighbors with chemical weapons? Do the Russians \nreally think that Saddam Hussein can be trusted with fermenters that \ncould be used to produce biological weapons? Will China really benefit \nif its assistance to Iran should put weapons of mass destruction in the \nhands of a regime that sympathizes less with Beijing than with Islamic \nethnic groups in western China?\n  Russia and China are both great powers. But you have to wonder, \nsometimes, what they are thinking. And you really have to wonder when \nNorth Korea will realize that ballistic missile exports to unstable \ncountries won't do much for a people already reduced to eating tree \nbark.\n\n\n                  An Ounce of Prevention Is Not Enough\n\n  What should the United States be doing to stop the spread of long-\nrange missiles and weapons of mass destruction? The short answer is: a \nlot more than we're doing now.\n  I don t say that to denigrate current U.S. programs or the U.S. \ncommitment to non-proliferation. No great power is as active as we in \ntrying to prevent proliferation. Nobody has as many programs as we do \nto detect proliferation activities, to stop them, to pressure illegal \nbuyers and sellers, to develop military weapons and tactics for \noperations against sites with weapons of mass destruction, and to \nassist the former Soviet states, in particular, in safeguarding and \ndestroying dangerous material and in reorienting their military \nindustry to the civilian economy. We spend over $600 million a year on \nthe assistance programs alone.\n\n  But the fact is, my friends, that we are failing to do all that we \ncan to stop proliferation. Some of our failures are understandable. No \nintelligence system can detect everything, and we risk the loss of \nsensitive sources whenever we demarche a supplier country or let \nclassified information leak to the press. U.S. diplomacy cannot move \nevery supplier to stop every unwise shipment, and economic sanctions \nare a tool that succeeds only occasionally. India's recent nuclear \ntests, in the face of U.S. law that forced the President to impose \nmultiple sanctions, underscore the difficulty of stopping a state once \nit has substantial indigenous capabilities.\n  What ought to embarrass us, however, is that we are failing also to \ntake actions that we know are workable. Thus, we combined the threat of \nsanctions with a promise of economic incentives to freeze North Korea's \nnuclear weapons program. Can we not offer similar multi-national \nincentives to North Korea to stop exporting ballistic missile equipment \nand technology? Won't that be cheaper than battling No Dong missiles \naround the world?\n  Similarly, we are failing to reach most of the highly-trained \nscientists and technicians who developed weapons of mass destruction \nand ballistic missiles for the former Soviet Union. And that is no \nsmall problem! There are well over a hundred thousand such skilled \npersonnel who served the Soviet death machine at its peak. Anywhere \nfrom ten to fifty thousand personnel still have skills that a rogue \nstate or terrorist group would like to obtain, and are underpaid or \nunemployed today. That is not just a problem for those personnel. That \nis a powderkeg just waiting to explode!\n  What should we be doing about this? We should plug the holes in our \ncurrent non-proliferation assistance programs. We should endorse and \nbuild on the ``nuclear cities'' initiative that Vice President Gore and \nthen-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin began in March. We should make a \nspecial effort to assist Russia's biological warfare specialists who \nwant to cease working with dangerous pathogens. And we should consider \noutright subsidies to keep Russian arms experts busy on socially useful \nprojects.\n\n\n                      Improving Existing Programs\n\n  What are the holes in our current non-proliferation assistance \nprograms? Several non-proliferation assistance programs are managed by \nthe Departments of State, Defense and Energy. They provide vital \nassistance to help safeguard Russian nuclear weapons material, to \ndismantle Ukrainian long-range bombers, to support projects that could \nprovide commercial job opportunities for former weapons specialists, \nand occasionally for a one-time operation like purchasing Kazakhstan's \nnuclear material or Moldova's bombers.\n  One program that supports commercial initiatives in the former Soviet \nUnion is the Department of Energy's Initiatives for Proliferation \nPrevention (or IPP). The President's proposed Fiscal Year 1999 budget \nwould reduce that program's budget from $30 million to only $15 \nmillion. This is a short-sighted step at precisely the wrong time. \nUnder its new program manager, IPP is finally bringing projects to the \npoint of commercialization. Fifteen projects have achieved completely \ncommercial funding and 77 now have major private co-funding.\n  If the IPP budget for FY 1999 is reduced by $15 million, IPP will \nhave to cut back its new projects to find socially useful employment \nfor Russian chemical and biological weapons experts. Those weapons are \nwell within the reach of rogue states, as UNSCOM has documented in \nIraq. Do we really want to leave hundreds or thousands of Russian \nexperts underemployed, and thus vulnerable to offers from the likes of \nIran, Iraq, or Libya?\n\n  We must not cut back one of the few programs to combat the risk that \nRussian experts will sell critical material or expertise to those \nstates. Given its important objective and the increasing success of the \nIPP program, restoring the $15 million cut is truly the least we can \ndo.\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\n  Another important non-proliferation tool is the Nonproliferation and \nDisarmament Fund, which is managed by the State Department. This fund \nhas been used for several urgent and sensitive non-proliferation \noperations over the years, including the purchase of unsecured highly \nenriched uranium from Kazakhstan. The flexibility that it affords \npolicy makers to take advantage of non-proliferation opportunities is a \nvital resource.\n  Recent operations have taken their toll, however, on the \nNonproliferation and Disarmament Fund's reserve. The Fund had a $12 \nmillion reserve at the beginning of Fiscal Year 1997, but only about $4 \nmillion by the beginning of FY 1998. Annual appropriations of $15 \nmillion, while welcome, give the Fund insufficient flexibility to truly \nfulfill its mission.\n  We need to increase our investment in the Nonproliferation and \nDisarmament Fund, either by establishing a higher annual funding level \nor at least by replenishing the Fund's reserve. Our nation has received \ngood value from the Fund in the past, and we should do what it takes to \nkeep the Fund healthy.\n  A third important program is the Energy Department's Material \nProtection, Control and Accounting (or MPC & A) program, which has been \nupgrading security at Russia's nuclear sites. This program uses a lab-\nto-lab approach that builds trust and cooperation. It has forged ties \nwith every single Russian nuclear facility of concern. This program not \nonly improves security, but also encourages transparency regarding \nRussian operations and helps to build ties that can lead to projects \nunder other non-proliferation assistance programs.\n  The time is ripe to apply the same lab-to-lab approach to Russia's \nchemical weapons sites. Russia has declared some 40,000 metric tons of \nchemical weapons stocks that must be destroyed under the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. Physical security for those toxic chemicals is only \nrudimentary: guards, fences, and single-key padlocks that are sometimes \nfalling apart. While a rogue state might have to steal and transport a \nton of this material to gain a militarily useful amount, a terrorist \ngroup could wreak havoc with much smaller quantities.\n  We should encourage the MPC & A program to help Russia slam the door \non that risk. A $10 million start in Fiscal Year 1999 would be money \nwell invested.\n  I have written to the Armed Services Committee and the relevant \nappropriations subcommittees regarding these programs, which I hope \nwill be addressed in their bills. If they are not, I will work with \nother concerned colleagues to raise these issues on the floor.\n\n\n             Weaning Russians Away from Biological Weapons\n\n  Revelations regarding Iraq's biological weapons, along with defector \naccounts of Russia's massive biological weapons program, are making \ntheir mark on our psyche. We are beginning to accept that, whether U.S. \nmilitary planners wanted biological weapons or not, other countries and \nterrorist groups might be all too happy to try them out. Thousands of \nRussian scientists and technicians have biological weapons experience, \nand a rogue state assisted by such personnel could cause unspeakable \nharm.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, using Nunn-Lugar money from the \nDepartment of Defense, is working with the International Science and \nTechnology Center in Moscow--a multi-country program managed by the \nState Department--to support cooperative research projects with \nRussia's civilian biological weapons experts. This is an interesting \nprogram which encourages those experts to find socially useful outlets \nfor their biological weapons expertise.\n  But the National Academy's program also keeps these experts working \nwith dangerous pathogens, rather than applying their skills in less \ndangerous areas of work. So if you're a Russian biological weapons \nexpert who wants to get out of that nasty business, you may find \nyourself unemployed--or recruited by rogues. But if you want to stay on \nthe fringes of it, the United States will help you.\n  Does that make sense? I don't think so, although it's true that this \nprogram will give us useful windows into the work of these personnel--\nand perhaps some lines into Russia's Ministry of Defense labs that we \nfear may be engaged in illegal biological weapons work--for about $8 \nmillion per year.\n  Don't blame the National Academy of Sciences, however, or even the \nDepartment of Defense. The original 1996 contract between those \norganizations called for the Nunn-Lugar money to be used ``to support \nthe conversion of former Soviet BW research personnel to work on \ninternational public health issues.''\n  But that changed after we passed a law to prevent Nunn-Lugar money \nfrom being used for defense conversion. That law is section 1503 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. I suppose it \nwas adopted because defense conversion is difficult and costly. That's \ntrue. But here we are, with a law that lets us keep several hundred \nexperts working with diseases that Russia developed as weapons. But it \nwon't let us help those experts--or a few thousand others who used to \nwork on those weapons--to move into really useful work on the many \nother diseases that afflict mankind.\n  We can understand why that law was adopted. But as Mr. Bumble says \n(in Charles Dickens's ``The Pickwick Papers''), sometimes ``the law is \na ass, an idiot.'' That law needs to be changed, to allow the National \nAcademy's original concept to go forward. We need a much larger program \nto encourage Russia's biological weapons experts to apply their \nknowledge in safer areas of research and development, as well as the \nsmall program for those Russian experts who continue to work with \ndangerous pathogens. I will introduce legislation to remove any legal \nroadblock and create that larger program.\n\n\n                   The ``Nuclear Cities'' Initiative\n\n  On April 27, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy announced plans to \nsharply reduce the number of institutions involved in nuclear weapons \nresearch and production. The cuts will begin this year, and in five to \nseven years Russia may close a dozen nuclear weapons research and \nproduction facilities.\n  This is big news. The Russian Federation is finally admitting--\npublicly--that its nuclear establishment is far too large. From the \nstandpoint of our strategic arms relationship with Russia, downsizing \nof the ``nuclear cities'' is a welcome step.\n  But what will become of the scientists and technicians who do not \nstay in the downsized Russian nuclear establishment? There are over \n100,000 personnel in those ``nuclear cities.'' Let's say that 25,000 \nstay with the consolidated Russian labs, and that only a quarter of the \nrest have skills that a rogue state or terrorist group would like to \nbuy. That would still leave 20,000 underpaid or unemployed experts on \nthe market. What will be done to reduce the risks posed by that large \npool of desperate people?\n\n  One answer is the Nuclear Cities Initiative. In March, Vice President \nGore and then-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin agreed to develop a new \ninitiative for Russia's vast complex of ``nuclear cities,'' each the \nequivalent of our Los Alamos or Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Last \nmonth, Energy Secretary Pena and Russia's new Minister of Atomic \nEnergy, Yevgeny Adamov, signed an agreement to begin this initiative.\n  The ``Nuclear Cities Initiative'' is a major step that deserves our \nwholehearted support. It would include business training for Russian \npersonnel and a major effort to find commercially viable projects to \nprovide jobs for former nuclear weapons experts. Fiscal Year 1999 \nfunding of $30 million, say, would get that initiative off to a good \nstart and might be matched by some of the money that Russia receives \nfor its weapons-grade material sold to the United States.\n  But I doubt that even this initiative will be enough. For one thing, \nthe obstacles to finding commercial funding for viable civilian \nprojects are really substantial. Personnel in the ``nuclear cities'' \nwere isolated for decades from even the Soviet Russian economy, to say \nnothing of market economics. Russian legal and political structures are \nstill unresponsive, moreover, to the needs of foreign investors.\n  Russian officials often ask for an ``investment conference'' to put \nthem directly in touch with prospective investors. I propose a more \nuseful jump-\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\nstart of the commercialization process: a presidential commission with \nsubstantial representation from U.S. industry. Most U.S. firms will not \nyet risk real money on new technology from Russia's isolated \nlaboratories. But 50 years ago, an automobile company president showed \nWestern Europe how to recover from World War II. Our high-tech \nindustrialists might best be able to get Russia to create an inviting \nbusiness climate.\n\n\n                        Beyond Commercialization\n\n  Finally, we must ask ourselves whether our current non-proliferation \nprograms are ``penny wise and pound foolish.'' Does it really make \nsense to bar funding for defense conversion, except in programs that \nfind commercial sponsors? Maybe there will never be enough commercial \nsponsors to employ Russia's experts in ballistic missiles or weapons of \nmass destruction. That is a real possibility. So, do we just walk away? \nDo we tell them to pack their bags and move to Iraq, Iran, or Libya?\n  The law also bars using Nunn-Lugar funds for environmental clean-up \nefforts in the former Soviet Union. Such funds should not be used \nsimply for environmental objectives. But what if that's the safest way \nto use the talents of nuclear, chemical or biological arms experts? Why \nisn't any socially useful employment of those personnel worth \nsubsidizing, in order to keep them inside their own countries and away \nfrom their original areas of expertise?\n  The key to this puzzle is the word ``subsidizing.'' Is that what we \nwant to do? Not ideally. But is it a reasonable approach when others do \nnot suffice? Or is it our primary objective to make Russia's weapons \nexperts adapt to a capitalist economy, even if the result is to leave \nsome of them poverty-stricken and prey to offers from less squeamish \ncountries?\n  I am not afraid to subsidize Russian arms experts, if that's what it \ntakes to keep them out of their old trades. We spend billions of \ndollars on defense. We're already looking at over $700 million in non-\nproliferation assistance requested for next year. That may employ \n10,000 or 12,000 people. (Much of the money goes for equipment used in \nweapons security or dismantlement.) Why not add another $250 million \nper year--with Russia putting up some funds as well--to employ another \n20,000 or more Russian specialists on unrelated projects, so long as \nthey help their country and stay away from weapons work?\n\n  Does that sound too much like welfare? Call it welfare, if you wish. \nBut ten years of that welfare will purchase a lot of security for us. \nThose will be ten years of dramatically reduced risk that the fallout \nfrom the collapse of the Soviet Union will be radioactive. They will be \nten years in which many Russian experts will retire and no longer be of \nconcern, ten years for the Russian economy to recover and employ the \nrest of its skilled scientists and technicians, ten years for diplomats \nto solve some of the conflicts that tempt countries to amass and use \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Increased investment in non-proliferation assistance will not solve \nall our proliferation worries. But it will help--at a cost that we can \nafford. I plan to introduce legislation to do this.\n  Let me make clear that the deficiencies in our non-proliferation \nprograms do not reflect a lack of vision on the part of Congress or the \nexecutive branch. Rather, they stem from the daunting and multi-faceted \nnature of the challenge we face.\n  Helping Russia to reduce and reorient its vast defense complex is an \nunprecedented activity. The task requires multiple efforts; what works \nfor missile dismantlement under the START Treaty may not be appropriate \nto chemical weapons destruction or to offering new careers to \nbiological weapons experts.\n  We have had to start with small steps, moreover, and for good \nreasons. First, each program can succeed only once it gains the trust \nand cooperation of former Soviet experts and bureaucracies. Second, a \nmassive effort could become unbearably costly. And third, we must make \nsure that our programs support reorientation of defense facilities, \nrather than unwittingly underwriting the development or export of \nweapons of mass destruction. So we must see what works, adapt, and \nbuild upon the successes.\n  To truly succeed, however, we must not be afraid of building \nsomething big. We should seek international participation and \nfinancing. But even the most expensive programs, if well conceived and \nexecuted, will be bargains compared to the cost of even a single war in \nwhich weapons of mass destruction were used against our troops or our \ncities.\n  Let me return, then, to the question I posed at the beginning: How \nwill historians characterize this decade? Indeed, how will historians \ncharacterize the efforts of this body? Will we be seen as having seized \nthe opportunity of this decade? Or will historians say that we were \nstill too enamored with weapons, too cheap to pay the price of peace? \nIn the coming weeks and months, we will have a chance to put our money \nwhere our hopes are. I call on my colleagues to join together in taking \nat least the little steps, and perhaps some big ones as well, toward a \nmore comprehensive program of non-proliferation assistance. We will not \nonly feel good doing that, we will do some good, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I have been authorized by the Senator \nfrom Michigan to use up to 8 minutes of the time that he still has \nreserved. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I speak about the other part of this \nbill. The Senator from Delaware just made the point that this bill we \nare intending to vote on today contains two very different pieces of \nlegislation in it. Title I is of the Iran missile proliferation \nsanctions. That goes on for twelve pages. Title II is the Chemical \nWeapons Convention Implementation Act. That goes on for 82 pages.\n  I will speak about the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act \nfor just a few minutes. Much of what I want to say is good news. \nImplementation of the treaty is making important and significant \nprogress. It has been just over a year since the treaty entered into \nforce. As of May 14, 1998, 168 nations signed this historic treaty; 108 \nnations have ratified the treaty.\n  This is a landmark treaty that provides us with the means to rid the \nplanet of an entire type of lethal weapon that could threaten every one \nof our nations.\n  The threat has already been effective in identifying nations with \nchemical weapons capabilities. Among the Chemical Weapons Convention \nstates possessing chemical weapons capabilities are some of the \ncountries we have been talking about extensively here in the rest of \nthis debate: Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran. I point out that \nChina and India were among the states that previously denied having \nchemical weapons. So by opening their facilities to inspections \nrequired by this convention, those states were forced to demonstrate \ntheir ability to provide chemical weapons.\n  There is a lot of good news that I want to allude to here, but let me \npoint out three concerns that I have that people need to be aware of as \nwe go forward with this debate and the vote that is intended here.\n  The first of these concerns relates to the fact that the treaty \nrequires an initial declaration of capabilities of both government and \ncommercial entities for all states that are party to the treaty. So \nfar, there are 28 countries, including Iran, that have failed to submit \ntheir initial declarations. The Technical Secretariat for this \nconvention must ensure that those declarations are forthcoming, and \nother states' parties should take measures to ensure their compliance.\n  One of the unfortunate facts I want to point out is that the United \nStates is one of the states that is not in compliance. The U.S. \nGovernment has declared government-owned facilities related to its \nchemical weapons program, but we have yet to declare commercial \nindustrial facilities required for the treaty. This is an important \nmatter to which I hope the administration is devoting priority \nattention. If the treaty is to be an effective vehicle as we intend it \nto be, our leadership in implementation efforts will be critical to its \nultimate success.\n  There are two other matters I want to mention here. The first \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\nsection 234(f) of this treaty, of this implementing language in H.R. \n2709 regarding the analysis of chemical samples that may be taken \nduring an inspection. The provision contained in the legislation before \nthe Senate, though perhaps desirable for our purposes, our limited \npurposes, could result in a circumstance that we would not want to see \nhappen.\n  Let me explain. Provisions in the treaty regarding permissible \nequipment to be brought in by an inspector restrict their qualitative \nanalytical capabilities. These restrictions could quite feasibly lead \nto ambiguities in analysis. It could require that a sample receive \nadditional examination. Under the treaty's provisions, the analysis \nshould be conducted at three laboratories designated by the Technical \nSecretariat. Only one of those laboratories is located in the United \nStates and the other two lie outside our borders.\n\n  Section 234(f) in this implementing legislation would require that no \nsample taken in the United States is allowed to be examined out of our \nborders. So clearly we are putting in law here a provision which \ncontravenes the terms of the treaty. It is evident to me this is a \nproblem that needs to be addressed at some stage in some way.\n  The second matter that I want to bring to people's attention is the \nright to refuse challenge inspections. During the early days of \nnegotiating the Chemical Weapons Convention, members of President \nReagan's team insisted that all countries must allow challenge \ninspections to occur at any time in any place. They did so in order to \nensure that this very difficult treaty could have some real teeth in \nit. Unfortunately, the legislation that we have before the Senate today \nwould give the President the power to deny a request for a challenge \ninspection if he determines that the inspection could pose a threat to \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  The problem with this provision is that assigning ourselves the right \nto refuse a challenge inspection obviously raises the prospect that \nothers may also choose to refuse a challenge inspection, and that guts \na key provision of the treaty that we intended to see enforced.\n  I hope that these are matters that can be corrected. I think it is \nunfortunate that this legislation has come to us on the floor with \nthese particular two provisions in it. I hope very much that we can \nfind some solution to this either in future legislation or in some \naction by the administration.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is a very important treaty that we \nhave entered into. We have every reason to want to see it be effective. \nThese two provisions that I have pointed to undermine the effectiveness \nof it and also undermine our credibility in trying to urge other states \nto comply with the treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 8 \nminutes on the Iran Missile Proliferation Act and have that time \ncharged to Senator Levin who will be offering an amendment. That is \npursuant to Senator Levin's desire, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it is hard to imagine a greater threat to \ninternational stability than the rogue nation of Iran coming into \npossession of weapons of mass destruction.\n  There are three important reasons why the Iran missile proliferation \nact should be passed at this time.\n  First and foremost, the Iran missile proliferation act is, above all \nelse, a nonproliferation measure. It is intended to halt the spread of \nmissile technology to Iran. With the alarming news that India has \ntested nuclear weapons and, in reaction to this, Pakistan is now \nconsidering testing its own weapons, we see the prospect of a dangerous \nspread of nuclear technology that only underscores the need for further \nU.S. resolve in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The second reason this legislation is important now is because of the \nlack of cooperation on the part of the Russians. Generally, the United \nStates and the Russians have a clear, common interest in halting the \nspread of advanced weapons technology, including missiles. Although \nthere has been some movement within Russia to halt the spread of \nmissile technology to Iran, there is clearly not enough being done. \nCoupled with reports that Iran may be actively acquiring biological, \nchemical, and even nuclear weapons, the case for this legislation is \nclear.\n  Finally, this legislation is needed to bolster our Iran policy and to \nsend a clear signal that the United States will not tolerate the spread \nof missile technology to Iran. Earlier this week, President Clinton \ndecided to grant a waiver from the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act to a \nhuge energy project by a French firm and others. Many of my colleagues \nand I urged the President not to grant this waiver; yet, a decision was \nmade to do so. I believe that this sends the wrong signal to the \ninternational community with respect to investment in Iran.\n  Foreign investment could enable Iran to rebuild its energy sector and \nvastly increase its economic strength, allowing it to acquire vast \nassets that it could use to re-arm and acquire terrible weapons of mass \ndestruction. While I disagree with the President's decision to grant \nthe waiver for the French and Russian energy project, I feel even more \nstrongly about the transfer of missile technology to Iran.\n  Let us make no mistake about it, Iran has become the most serious \nthreat to stability in the Middle East. Israeli and American \nintelligence have recently discovered that, due largely to technology \nobtained from Russia, Iran may soon have the capability to begin \nassembling and testing ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel \nand other vital targets in the Middle East.\n  Russian companies are providing Iran with crucial technologies, \nincluding wind tunnels for the design of missiles, lasers, and special \nmaterials for missile construction. There are even reports of over \n9,000 Russian advisers working in Iran on a variety of military \nprojects, and Iran tested a Soviet-designed rocket engine last year.\n  Iran, one of America's foremost self-proclaimed enemies, has been \nlinked to numerous terrorist attacks, ranging from taking hostages and \nhijacking airlines to carrying out assassinations and bombings.\n  Now is the time to send a clear signal to the world community that \nselling missile technology to Iran is totally unacceptable. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this vital measure, which takes concrete steps to \nhalt the spread of ballistic missile technology to Iran and will act to \nsupport the preservation of peace and stability in the Middle East.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am informed the yeas and nays have not \nbeen requested.\n  At this time, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Senator Levin has time, and he is prepared \nto proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment that I will be sending to \nthe desk will change the trigger date for sanctionable activity from \nAugust 8, 1995, which is currently in the bill, to January 22, 1998. I \nwill explain why I am seeking to do that in the next few minutes.\n  The bill the Senate is debating requires the President to submit \nperiodic reports on foreign persons who, on or after August 8, 1995, \nhave provided or attempted to provide material, technology, technical \nassistance, or facilities that contributed to Iran's efforts to \nacquire, develop or produce ballistic missiles. Those who are \nidentified as assisting Iran's ballistic missile effort will be subject \nto sanctions for at least two years, preventing them from buying \nmilitary equipment and technology, and controlled dual-use goods and \ntechnology, and from receiving U.S. economic aid.\n  The bill includes two waiver provisions, one in case the President \nlearns of new information that shows that a foreign person did not \nprovide assistance initially included in one of the required reports, \nand one in case the\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\nPresident determines that imposing sanctions would not be in our \nnational security interest.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I strongly support the \nlegislation's goal, Mr. President--to stop assistance to Iran's \nballistic missile program by foreign entities.\n  I am concerned, however, about the bill's use of August 8, 1995 as \nthe trigger date for determining behavior to be sanctioned.\n  My amendment would change the trigger date in the bill for \ndetermining behavior to be sanctioned from August 8, 1995 to January \n22, 1998. This is the date on which the then-Prime Minister of Russia, \nViktor Chernomyrdin, signed a government decree to strengthen Russian \nexport controls on dual-use items that could be used either for weapons \nof mass destruction or for missiles to deliver such weapons.\n  Madam President, we need to strengthen the President's ability to \napply sanctions to foreign entities--whether individuals, companies or \neducational institutions--that provide assistance of any kind to the \ncurrent efforts of Iran to develop ballistic missiles that could \nthreaten their neighbors.\n  But I believe that the more appropriate trigger date for the behavior \nsubject to sanctions is January 22, 1998 rather than August 8, 1995 for \nthe following reasons:\n  The United States Government has been working with the Russian \nGovernment intensely for the last few years to encourage them to stop \nall assistance by any entity in Russia to Iran's efforts to develop a \nballistic missile. Our government has engaged the Russian Government at \nthe highest levels--President Clinton directly to President Yeltsin--\nand at numerous levels below the Presidents. Vice President Gore made \nthis a crucial and central issue in the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, \nand put this on then-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's agenda for immediate \nattention. In addition, the Administration appointed Ambassador Frank \nWisner to work with his specially appointed Russian counterpart, Yuri \nKoptev, the head of the Russian Space Agency, to seek progress in \nstopping assistance from Russian entities to Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram.\n  Ambassador Wisner was recently succeeded by Ambassador Robert \nGallucci, the diplomat who negotiated the North Korean Agreed Framework \nand led UNSCOM inspection teams in ferreting out Iraqi weapons of mass \ndestruction after the Gulf War. So our government has been highly \nenergized and motivated and they deserve credit for their efforts, \nwhich are continuing still.\n  These efforts have met with mixed success. In some cases, the \nactivities have stopped. In other cases, the activities have continued. \nAnd in other cases, the information is inconclusive as to whether or \nnot the activities that the Russian Government has said they are trying \nto stop and which we surely want stopped, and which the world needs \nstopped, in fact have stopped.\n  However, in January of this year, the Russian Government took an \nimportant step that we had been encouraging them to take for some time. \nOn January 22, then-Prime Minister of Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, \nissued a broad decree, known as the ``catch-all'' decree, to strengthen \nexport controls over all dual-use goods and services that could be used \nto proliferate either weapons of mass destruction or the missiles to \ndeliver them.\n  This decree states that Russian entities engaged in foreign trade \n``shall refrain from export transactions involving any dual-use goods \nor services not subject to Russian Federation export control \nregulations should such entities be aware that such goods and services \nwill be used to develop or employ nuclear, chemical or biological \nweapons or missile means of delivery . . .''. The decree goes on to \nstate that ``Should Russian entities engaged in foreign trade have \nreason to believe that such goods and services may be used for the \naforesaid purposes, they shall submit the pertinent application to the \nRussian Federation Governmental Commission on Export control.''\n  Madam President, this Russian decree is a broad and sweeping \nprohibition on the export of any goods and services, if there is reason \nto believe that those goods or services could be used to develop or \nemploy a weapon of mass destruction or the missiles to deliver them.\n  Our Government strongly encouraged the Russian Government to issue \nthat decree.\n  And of great significance, the January 22 decree is broader and \nstronger than the Missile Technology Control Regime. The Missile \nTechnology Control Regime deals only with the proliferation of missile \ntechnology for certain classes of missiles. The January 22 decree is an \neffort by the Russian Government to strengthen controls over the export \nof technology, goods, and services that can lead to the proliferation \nof all weapons of mass destruction as well as the missiles to deliver \nthem.\n  So this decree covers the weapons of mass destruction and their \ncomponents and the materials that go into them. It is much broader than \nthe Missile Control Technology Regime, which just relates to missiles. \nThe Missile Technology Control Regime, to state it more correctly, \ncovers just missiles, whereas the Chernomyrdin decree of January 22 \ncovers the weapons of mass destruction that we are trying to preserve \nand protect the world from, as well as the missiles that could deliver \nthem.\n  This is an important step by the Russian Government. That decree, \nwhich we pleaded with them to adopt and to publish, deserves to be \nsupported and deserves to be encouraged.\n  My amendment uses their decree as the basis for our action--their \ndecree--and that reinforces its effectiveness instead of ignoring its \nissuance.\n  Madam President, it is not clear to me that all the activities of the \nRussian entities that have or could contribute to Iran's ballistic \nmissile program would even be proscribed by the Missile Technology \nControl Regime that the Russians signed in August of 1995. But the \nJanuary 22 decree, being much broader, would prohibit those activities \nbecause they fit under the decree's broad category of ``export \ntransactions involving any dual use goods or services'' that ``may'' be \nused to develop or employ nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or \nthe missiles to deliver them.\n  So, summarizing the amendment, the amendment strengthens the original \nintent of the bill. It recognizes the efforts of the Russian Government \nto address the problem of assistance to Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram through the January 22, 1998, decree. By using that decree as \nthe trigger date for behavior that is sanctioned, the bill reinforces \nthat decree, both recognizing the action that the Russians took at our \nrequest and using the restrictions in that decree which are more \ncomprehensive than those entailed by the Missile Technology Control \nRegime.\n  Our Nation shares a common goal with Russia of trying to stop all \nassistance from Russian entities to Iran's missile program. Russia has \ntaken some steps, but more steps and more cooperation are needed. I \nbelieve that if we acknowledge the efforts they have taken and \nencourage them to continue, we can avoid a counterproductive result. \nThat result could make it harder for Russia to succeed in its efforts \nto stop such assistance. And our goal should be just that--to do what \nworks, to do what leads to a better result.\n  In all likelihood, if this legislation becomes law with my amendment, \nit will still require sanctions to be applied, because there is \nevidence that some Russian entities have provided assistance to Iran's \nballistic missile program since January 22, 1998.\n  Finally, I note that the bill before the Senate contains two \nPresidential waivers. They are there for important reasons. The more \nsignificant of the two waivers is a national security waiver which the \nPresident can use to waive the imposition of sanctions if doing so ``is \nessential to the national security of the United States.''\n  This legislation is not intended to force the President to impose a \nsanction if doing so would harm U.S. national security. If the \nPresident determines that it is necessary for him to waive the \nimposition of sanctions in the interest of national security, then \nunder this bill he may do so. That is in the bill itself. That is not \ntouched by my amendment. But that is why the waiver is included in the \nbill before us.\n  Madam President, I believe that the sponsors of the bill have \nindicated support for my amendment. Senator Kyl\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\nis on the floor. I will let him speak for himself in that regard.\n  I yield the floor. I appreciate their support.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the amendment is acceptable to everyone on \nthis side that I know of. Therefore, we can move the process along and \nhave it accepted formally and conclude the debate. I think our \ncolleagues would appreciate having the opportunity to vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2444\n\n(Purpose: To change the date of behavior subject to sanctions relating \n                     to Iran missile proliferation)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2444.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, beginning on line 15, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n       On page 6, beginning on line 24, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is a reason why this bill picks August \n8, 1995, as the date after which Russian companies should be sanctioned \nfor their proliferation behavior. The reason for this is very simple: \nAugust 8, 1995, was the date upon which Russia joined the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR). In so doing, the Russian Government \nundertook an international obligation to curtail its proliferation \nbehavior. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the Government has not lived \nup to that pledge.\n  At the time that the United States favored Russian membership in the \nMTCR, the Senate was assured by the Clinton Administration that Russia \nhad all of the necessary, effective export controls in place. Well, we \nsee just how accurate that claim proved to be. Two years later the \nUnited States began uncovering evidence of the degree to which Russian \nassistance has sped up Iran's missile program.\n  In retrospect, clearly the United States should have waited until an \neffective, Russian export control regime had been established before \nfavoring Russian membership in the MTCR. As an aside, I hope the \nClinton Administration will learn from this experience. There has been \na great deal of talk lately about encouraging China to join the MTCR. I \nwould hope that the United States would wait an appropriate period of \ntime to see whether China's export controls are truly effective enough \nto warrant membership in the MTCR.\n  Finally, I have reservations about the Levin amendment, because it \nseeks--at a minimum--to ``grandfather'' Russian missile proliferation \nactivities before January 22, 1998. But I will not oppose this \namendment because, among other things, proliferation on the part of \nthese companies has been so rampant even since January 22, 1998 that \nfew companies in Russia, if any, will benefit from this shift in dates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time so we can, \nhopefully, adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Michigan.\n  The amendment (No. 2444) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I rise in support of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act, H.R. \n2709.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make three important points regarding \nthis legislation.\n  First, the Administration's efforts to get Russia to stop assisting \nIran's ballistic missile program have been an abysmal failure.\n  Second, there is a broader failure of United States proliferation \npolicy--a failure of monumental and potentially deadly proportions.\n  Finally, the Senate must now take a greater role in addressing the \nproliferation crisis. Passage of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act is a \nfirst step.\n  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, many in the United States have \nbeen greatly concerned that Russian entities were providing assistance \nto other state's ballistic missile programs. As evidence mounted, the \nClinton Administration responded with diplomatic efforts from the \nworking level up through the high level Commission chaired by Vice \nPresident Gore. Diplomatic efforts were supplemented with economic \nincentives.\n  When additional reports of new and ongoing assistance emerged, \nincluding transfers to Iran in probable violation of the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime, Congress waited for the Administration to \nimpose the sanctions required. When sanctions were not imposed, some in \nCongress sought additional legislation to ``encourage'' the \nAdministration to impose sanctions.\n  The Administration again urged the Congress to wait--to give the \ndiplomatic process more time, to give the Russians time to get an \nenforcement mechanism in place. Administration officials have \nrepeatedly assured us that they have the problem under control.\n  They are wrong.\n  The Congressional Research Service summarizes the situation aptly \nwhen it reports that:\n\n       Despite official denials from Moscow through 1997, evidence \n     is growing of a pattern of missile technology transfers to \n     Iran by Russian enterprises, institutes, and individuals, \n     with direct and indirect Russian Government involvement, in \n     violation of Russian commitments under the Missile Technology \n     Control Regime (MTCR). Russian assistance could significantly \n     accelerate Iran's indigenous missile program . . .\n\n  There is ample intelligence information that supports this \nassessment, and I believe it is important for Senators to have the \nopportunity to review this information. Therefore, Senator Kerrey and I \ndirected the Select Committee on Intelligence staff to prepare a \ncompendium of the classified intelligence reporting on this subject and \nit is available for Senators to review in S-407.\n  My second point is that the Administration's failure to stop Russia \nfrom providing assistance to Iran's missile program is only part of the \nbroader failure of the Administration's non-proliferation policy.\n  There is an ongoing pattern of assistance by Russia, China, and North \nKorea to rogue states and to other states such as India and Pakistan. \nThere is also a pattern of weak Clinton Administration response to this \nproliferation. There is a connection. The Indians cited the weak \nClinton Administration response to China's proliferation of missiles \nand nuclear assistance to Pakistan as one of the reasons they decided \nto test nuclear weapons.\n  Some states seek weapons of mass destruction for prestige or in an \nattempt to enhance their global role. Countries like India and Pakistan \njustify their efforts by citing regional security concerns.\n  Others like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea seek these weapons to \nthreaten and intimidate their neighbors, in particular U.S. friends and \nallies, to threaten forward-deployed U.S. forces, and ultimately to \nthreaten the United States itself.\n  Such states do not wish to confront U.S. conventional military \nforces--the best in the world--with conventional weapons alone. They \nprefer to threaten our forces, or our cities, with asymmetric weapons \nof mass destruction to deter us from carrying out policies to protect \nour global interests.\n  If states believe they can change the calculation of risks and \nbenefits, they have a strong strategic incentive to acquire these \nmissiles. Our near-total vulnerability to the ballistic missile threat \nonly furthers their incentives.\n  Without stronger disincentives, other states will continue to seek \nthe financial, political, and strategic advantages that may be gained \nthrough proliferation, and through taking advantage of our patience and \nvulnerabilities.\n  They have repeatedly offered carrots without wielding or credibily \nthreatening the stick.\n  Indeed, in many disturbing ways, the Administration's policies toward \nRussia and China may have enabled or\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\neven encouraged proliferation. By failing to respond to dangerous \nproliferation acdtivities to the maximum extent possible under domestic \nand international law, they have led others to question the will and \nability of the United States to take strong measures to punish \nproliferators.\n  Unfortunately, the Executive Branch has not yet come to this \nrealization.\n  It appears to be difficult to get this Administration to act with \nresolve, either by adding backbone to its proliferation policies or by \nresponding to existing and future threats by developing additional \nmeans of deterrence and defense. It is difficult to persuade them to \nmake diplomacy and arms control agreements tools of policy rather than \npolicy objectives in-and-of themselves.\n  However, the Congress can not simply stand back and point our fingers \nat the White House. We must do all that we can do to demonstrate that \nAmerica has the will and the ability to respond.\n  We must provide adequate funding to the Intelligence Community and to \nour military forces to detect and deter, and to prevail when deterrence \nfails. We must put in place the legislative mechanisms to enforce a \nrobust counter-proliferation policy. We must continue to force the \nAdministration to disclose dangerous proliferation activities. And we \nmust make sanctions mandatory.\n  Challenging, deterring, and defending against proliferation won't be \neasy or cost free. But it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, American lives are at stake.\n  The Senate must act. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the bill \nbefore us.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to \nindicate my support for H.R. 2709, the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act.\n  The message this bill sends to the international community is clear. \nThe patience of the American people and their elected representatives \nis not infinite. If diplomacy fails to produce satisfactory results, \nthe United States is prepared to take decisive action to protect our \nsecurity and that of our allies by imposing sanctions on those who \nviolate international agreements restricting the transfer of ballistic \nmissile technology.\n  In my judgment, it is time for Congress to send this message. And it \nis long past time for those who violate international agreements to \nheed the message.\n  I appreciate that diplomacy has produced some positive results in \nthis area and may ultimately yield more progress. Nonetheless, these \nefforts fall short of what is needed to halt the illegal transfers. In \nthe absence of immediate and conclusive evidence of a dramatic reversal \nof Russian behavior, stronger measures are needed, and H.R. 2709 is an \nappropriate vehicle.\n  The end of the Cold War has affected our national security policies \nin many ways. It has reduced the likelihood of a large-scale \nconventional conflict on the European continent. It has made it much \nless likely that either the United States or Russia will intentionally \nuse nuclear weapons against the other. And it has allowed us to meet \nthe remaining threats to our security with slightly smaller defense \nbudgets. These are obviously positive developments.\n  On the other hand, the post-Cold War period has been marked by the \nemergence of a new threat--the spread of weapons of mass destruction \nand the means to deliver them. Let me run down the current state of \naffairs with regard to weapons of mass destruction.\n  First, at the end of the Cold War, five countries--the United States, \nRussia, China, Great Britain, and France--had declared themselves \nnuclear weapons states. Unfortunately, as proven by India's actions \njust last week, the true number in the nuclear club is much larger.\n  Second, the Pentagon suspects that as many as 20 countries have \nchemical weapons programs, and that a slightly smaller number have \nbiological weapons.\n  Third, the Defense Department believes that about 15 countries \ncurrently possess ballistic missiles, and that the number could grow to \nmore than 20 by 2000.\n  It is these disturbing trends that the United States and many other \nnations in the international community are trying to combat.\n  Reversing these trends is a daunting challenge. If there is to be any \nchance of even slowing the spread of this threatening technology, the \nUnited States must act decisively and firmly when confronted with \nactions that violate existing agreements designed to proscribe this \ntype of behavior. It is in this context that we must view efforts by \nseveral Russian entities and individuals to assist the Iranian \nballistic missile program.\n  The status of the Iranian missile program should be of particular \nconcern to U.S. security officials. Iran is located in a critical \nregion of the world. Vital U.S. economic, political and military \ninterests are at stake.\n  Tens of thousands of U.S. troops are within easy reach of the Iranian \nmissiles speeding through their development stage.\n  The entire state of Israel, a staunch ally and friend, would be well \nwithin range of the Iranian missiles.\n  Concern about Iran's intentions are further heightened by the fact \nthat many intelligence analysts believe the Iranian government has \nrepeatedly supported and sponsored terrorist activities.\n  Both supporters and opponents of H.R. 2709 agree on one fact: Russian \nentities and individuals have played an important, if not crucial, role \nin the Iranian ballistic missile program. Even Russian officials \nacknowledge the involvement of Russian companies in these illegal \nactivities. It has been publicly estimated that, largely as a result of \nthis assistance, Iran could soon field missiles with sufficient range \nto threaten the entire Middle East.\n  Where people differ is over what to do about this assistance.\n  Opponents of H.R. 2709 argue the bill's sanctions are a blunt \ninstrument that will not achieve the intended result of stopping \nRussian assistance. They prefer to allow more time for the \nAdministration's diplomatic efforts to bear fruit.\n  Mr. President, I take a back seat to no one in my appreciation for \nthe negotiations the President and his advisers have conducted with \ntheir Russian counterparts on this complex issue. These negotiations \nhave produced positive tangible results. Russian cooperation with Iran \nhas ended in a few specific cases. In addition, the Russian government \nhas issued and agreed to enforce decrees intended to stop the missile \ntrade.\n  Yet, despite the Administration's best efforts and the progress they \nhave engendered, and notwithstanding a score of Russian promises, the \nfact remains that Russian assistance to the Iranian missile program \ncontinues. After months of negotiation, it appears that talk alone is \nnot going to be sufficient to end Russia's involvement with Iran's \nballistic missile program.\n  If we are to convince Russia and the world that we intend to protect \nourselves and our allies, the time has come for more than talk. If we \nare to enforce international law prohibiting transfer of ballistic \nmissile technology, it is time for action.\n  Mr. President, passage of H.R. 2709 is the appropriate action to take \nat this time. However, Senate passage of H.R. 2709 need not be the \nfinal word on this critical issue. If we adopt the Levin amendment, the \nbill will go back to conference with the House. There is still a very \nlimited amount of time for the Russian Government to convince this \nCongress that it has heard our concerns and moved to end cooperation \nwith the Iranian missile program. Failing an immediate and dramatic \nreversal in Russian behavior, it is time to redefine the playing field \nfor those currently violating these laws and those contemplating future \ntransgressions.\n  To those parties, enactment of the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act will underscore that the United States stands ready to \ndefend its own security interests and those of our close allies; that \nthe United States will do all it can to stem illegal efforts to spread \nballistic missile technology; and that the United States will ensure \nthat violations of international law will not go unpunished.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting for H.R. 2709.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter and a \ncosponsor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997. This \nbill addresses the very serious concern of proliferation of ballistic \nmissiles. While this bill is directed at Iran, the problem of\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\nproliferation is one of the United States' most serious problems. The \nproblem must be addressed.\n  Iran has been actively pursuing better and more sophisticated \nballistic missiles. If the Iranians acquire more long range missiles \nwith a range of at least 1300 miles, then many of our troops and allies \nin the Gulf region will be seriously threatened. While we know that \nIran has already received some of the missile components, we must stop \nthem from receiving the critical support and know-how to move forward.\n  There have been many reports of technology transfers between Russia \nand Iran. Russia has been actively assisting the Iranians in their \nefforts in not only technology, but also in their research and \ndevelopment programs. While Russia has promised the Administration that \nthey are not doing this, even the Administration states that there is a \nreal disconnect between their words and their actions.\n  I believe that this bill is important to stop this disconnect and let \nthe world know that this activity can and should not be tolerated. If \nwe do nothing, then who will. I believe nobody will. And, if we do \nnothing, within a year Iran could be capable of being able to deploy \nmissiles that could deliver nuclear or chemical warheads about 850 \nmiles. These missiles could reach Tel Aviv Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia \nand many of the air bases where our Armed Forces are located.\n  But let me also address a problem that is not being discussed \nconcerning serious military activity between Russia and Iran, with the \nassistance of the United States. Last year, the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation became involved in an office complex project in \nSt. Petersburg, Russia, the Nevsky 25. This project is jointly owned by \na main U.S. investor in Golub & Company from Chicago with 10 percent \nownership, the St. Petersburg Property Fund with 10 percent, European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development with 40 percent, and the Rubin \nCentral Design Bureau for Marine Engineering with 40 percent.\n  My concern is that the Rubin Central Design Bureau is a Russian \nstate-controlled military company whose main product line is military \nsubmarines. Rubin is the builder of the Russian Kilo-class submarine \nand has sold 4 Kilo submarines to Iran, 4 Kilo submarines and 2 Project \n636 Kilo submarines to China, and counts Algeria as one of its \ncustomers.\n  Rubin got involved in commercial activities to supplement their \nsubmarine production. They have become active in the field of oil and \ngas, high-speed rolling stock, power generation, and marine ecology.\n  Igor Spassky, the Rubin Bureau head, is quoted as saying,\n\n       The main reason for these commercial ventures is to help us \n     survive. There is a major responsibility for the company to \n     preserve its intellectual potential and capability for the \n     design and development of submarines. (Janes Navy \n     International 11/1/96)\n\n  Even with these commercial interests, defense work still accounts for \n60-65 percent of Rubin's work.\n  OPIC has tried to assure me that Rubin does not have access to assets \nof the property until the OPIC loan is paid in full and that they are \nmonitoring the situation. The problem is even after the loan is paid, \nOPIC will have assisted in providing a flow of income for Rubin to \ncontinue to build its Kilo class and nuclear ballistic missile \nsubmarines. Also, knowing Russia's record in proliferation and this \nlegislation addresses this problem, I am afraid that this project can \nonly help Rubin in providing future funding for these submarines.\n  Also, OPIC has said that they are assured that only commercial \nactivity is taking place in this office complex. Again, while this may \nbe the case, the activity of concern is being used with the funds \nbecoming available to the company to engage in their military \nactivities.\n  OPIC did say that this is a concern and that they are monitoring it \nbut that this is not a high priority. I believe if this bill to stop \nmissile proliferation is important enough to vote on then sales of \nsubmarines which can deliver ballistic missiles, which may be assisted \nwith U.S. funds is just as important.\n  Mr. President, before I end I want to encourage all my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 \nand to take serious the problems of proliferation and the problems of \nbeing involved with state controlled military complexes who are \nengaging in commercial activity in order to supplement their military \nactivity and sales.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: I rise in strong support of the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  This legislation is very simple. It says you can have normal economic \nand political relations with the United States--or you can join \nAmerica's enemies in building weapons of mass destruction. You cannot \ndo both.\n  This bill applies sanctions to organizations that transfer missile \nhardware or technology to Iran. It would ban U.S. economic assistance \nand the export of technology to anyone who is helping Iran develop the \nmeans of using weapons of mass destruction.\n  Iran has a robust chemical and biological weapons program. As we \ndebate this legislation, Iran is building the Shihab 3 missile. This \nballistic missile could carry conventional, biological or chemical \nweapons to Israel, to the Gulf states or to American interests within \n800 miles of Iran.\n  Imagine these weapons in the hands of a country that is our sworn \nenemy. A country that supports the most radical, anti-American \nterrorist organizations on earth. A country that does everything it can \nto derail the Middle East peace process.\n  These missiles could destroy Tel Aviv. They could reach our NATO \nallies. They could threaten the thousands of American troops in the \nGulf.\n  Russia has played a central role in helping Iran to develop these \nweapons. Despite past assurances, Russian scientists and engineers are \nusing their skills to threaten America's national security.\n  The United States has done a lot to help Russia build a prosperous \ndemocracy. Since 1991, we have given Russia over four billion dollars \nin assistance. We have done a great deal to build a cooperative \npartnership with Russia.\n  As the ranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee that funds the space \nprogram, I have been a strong supporter of US-Russian cooperation with \nthe space station.\n  I supported Russia's participation in the space program for three \nreasons:\n  1. Their technical expertise\n  2. To build stronger links between the United States and Russia\n  3. To ensure that Russian scientists and engineers had civilian \nwork--so they would not sell their skills to rogue governments\n  Russia has failed to live up to their promises on the space station. \nI have no question of their technical competence. But I have strong \nconcerns about their failure to meet their end of the bargain. They \nhave not adequately funded their share of the space station, resulting \nin delays and a cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the entire \nprogram.\n  Even more troubling is Russia's role in the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. Russia has exported technology, material and \nexpertise to help Iran develop ballistic missiles. They can't do this--\nand expect to have business as usual with America on the space program.\n  Mr. President; our foreign policy must reflect our values. We cannot \nstand by while any country threatens our national security, or the very \nexistence of our closest allies. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Iran Missile \nProliferation Sanctions Act of 1997.\n  Last week, our nation's intelligence apparatus was surprised by the \nIndian government's decision to test a hydrogen bomb. Pakistan may \nfollow suit with a retaliatory test. The fact that last week's test \ncaught our intelligence community by surprise raises serious questions \nabout our ability to monitor such developments. However, while the \nprospect of a nuclear arms race on the Asian subcontinent could \nthreaten our long-term security interests, the United States enjoys \nproductive relations with the two regional adversaries.\n  Iran, however, is neither a democracy nor a friend. While the new \nPresident, Mohammed Khatemi, is seen by some as a ``moderate,'' his \ngovernment continues a twenty year tradition of bitter\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nhostility towards the United States. Iran remains opposed to the peace \nprocess, its role in the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \nin 1996 is still not known, and it is still vigorously pursuing efforts \nto acquire weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear capability. \nWe must not be caught off guard with Iran as we have been with India \nand Pakistan.\n  When this measure was introduced last fall, I had hoped that events \nwould prove it unnecessary. I furthermore remained optimistic that the \nmeetings of the Vice President with then Russian Prime Minister Viktor \nChernomyrdin would have convinced Russia of the seriousness of the \nissue of Iran's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  I had hoped the Administration would have done a better job of \nconvincing the Russians of the seriousness of this matter. I had hoped \nthat the Russian government would have realized that whatever financial \nbenefits they get from such help to Iran are far outweighed by the loss \nof investment from the United States. Even more importantly, I had \nhoped that Russia would realize that such assistance to Iran does not \ncontribute to political stability in such a turbulent part of the \nworld. Unfortunately, none of these developments have come to pass.\n  I was disturbed to learn that Iranian nuclear officials just visited \nMoscow to view a demonstration of gas centrifuge technology--which if \nsuccessfully mastered will provide Iran the easiest type of material to \nuse in a nuclear weapon. If such a sale occurs it would be a gross \nviolation of a promise made by President Yeltsin to the President in \nMay 1995 when the Russians agreed not to sell centrifuges to Iran. This \nfollows the sale of a radioactive gas called tritium which can be used \nto increase the size of nuclear warheads and that a second sale is \nbeing discussed.\n  In addition to this development, I was disturbed to learn how close \nIran came to obtaining some 22 tons of missile-grade stainless steel \nfrom Russia as reported in the April 25th edition of the New York \nTimes. While I do not believe Russia supports the further development \nof weapons of mass destruction, I am concerned about the Yeltsin \ngovernment's ability to stem the proliferation of dangerous weapons \ntechnology and equipment. When this shipment of steel can be halted by \ncustoms officers in Azerbaijan but not in Russia, we are entitled to \nask serious questions about Russia's ability to cooperate in limiting \nthe global spread of weapons components.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Iran has begun a program to build a \nmissile called the Shahab 3 which has an 800 mile range. This range is \ndouble the capacity of a SCUD missile and is long enough to reach \nIsrael and Saudi Arabia. This type of missile would give Iran more \npower with which to threaten the West's strategic interests in the \nMiddle East only seven years after we fought a war with Iraq--another \nstate that may still be trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction. \nWe cannot allow Iran, just as President Bush did not allow Iraq, to \nassert control over the majority of the world's oil supply.\n  Mr. President, we should not view this bill as an anti-Russian \nstatement. This bill does not detract from our support for Russian \ndemocracy or Moscow's efforts to build a strong free-market economy. \nHowever, it does reflect our concern over the actions of many firms in \nRussia that have an interest in trading with either rogue states or \nnations that are inclined to develop the ability to deploy weapons of \nmass destruction. Under this legislation, Russian firms will have to \nchoose with whom they want to do business--the United States or an \nIranian regime that has yet to show the moderation promised by the \nelection of President Khatemi. Since persuasion and shared intelligence \nwith Russia may not be sufficient to stop Iran from acquiring dangerous \nweaponry, this bill has become regrettable but necessary. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it today before this menacing military threat \nfrom Iran grows even larger tomorrow.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act, I cannot stress enough the \nimportance of this legislation and I am grateful that it is now being \nconsidered before the full Senate.\n  Iran's desire to obtain ballistic missiles is a direct threat to \npeace and security in the Middle East, and therefore, a clear threat to \nU.S. national security. Limiting the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction and ensuring stability in this strategic region must remain \namong the highest priorities for the U.S. and our allies.\n  Iran is a leading sponsor of international terrorism and has been \nlinked to numerous bombings, hijackings, and assassinations. This rogue \nnation provides financial support and political training for terrorist \ngroups such as the Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Just this week, \nthe Argentine government announced they have proof that Iran was behind \nthe 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy and the 1994 bombing of the \nJewish Community Center in Buenos Aires.\n  According to news reports, Iran is months away from developing \nmissiles that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia, or the frontiers of the \nNATO alliance. Considering that Iran is already suspected of possessing \nchemical and biological weapons and is trying to acquire nuclear \nweapons capability, the threat of Iran possessing missiles capable of \nreaching U.S. forces in the Middle East is truly frightening.\n  This legislation would require the President to report periodically \non individuals, companies, and research facilities who have provided \nmaterial, technology, or technical assistance that could help Iran \ndevelop ballistic missiles. Once these suppliers have been identified, \nthey would be subject to sanctions making them ineligible for export \nlicenses and U.S. aid.\n  I believe this legislation will be a valuable tool in slowing Iran's \nprogram to develop ballistic missiles. I hope that the Senate \noverwhelmingly passes this legislation, and I want to thank the \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott, for all his hard work on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Iran Missile \nSanctions Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I hope the \nSenate will approve it without delay.\n  This legislation will impose sanctions against entities--individuals, \ncompanies, and research facilities--that have provided Iran with the \ntechnology and materials required to develop ballistic missiles. Those \nidentified as assisting Iran --or as attempting to do so at least \nonce--will be subject to sanctions for two years. These entities will \nbe ineligible for export licenses for arms or controlled goods and \ntechnology. Additionally, they will not be eligible to receive U.S. \nassistance. The President would be authorized to waive sanctions if he \ndetermines that it would be in the U.S. national security interest to \ndo so or if additional information which demonstrates that the alleged \nacts were not committed by the sanctioned person is available.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. There is growing evidence \nthat Russian companies and research facilities continue to provide Iran \nwith the technological assistance and the materials necessary to \ndevelop ballistic missiles capable of reaching U.S. forces in the \nMiddle East and our stalwart ally Israel. According to public reports, \nwith the help of Russian entities, U.S. officials estimate that Iran \ncould deploy the medium range Shahab 3 missile within 12 to 18 months. \nThat missile is capable of targeting Israel, other Arab countries in \nthe Middle East, and U.S. troops in the region. According to public \nsources, Iran could also deploy the Shahab 4 missile within three \nyears. That missile reportedly would be able to reach targets in \nEurope.\n  The Russians are not building these missiles for the Iranians. \nRather, Mr. President, they are providing the material and training \nnecessary for the Iranians to develop an indigenous capability. Make no \nmistake about it. The development of these Iranian missiles will be \nvery destabilizing in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, to its credit, the Administration has made the \ntransfer of missile technology a very high priority in dealings with \nRussian officials, including the recent talks between Vice President \nGore and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Special Envoy \nWisner has worked on this issue aggressively, and the State \nDepartment's Robert Galluci has been doing the same. I commend them for \nthe attention they have focused on this very\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nsensitive matter and the effort they have made to persuade Russia to \nclamp down on exporters.\n  Clearly, some progress has been made. On January 22, Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin issued an Executive Order stating the Russian government's \nintention to set policies that will more effectively control the \nexports of technology to Iran. Nonetheless, public reports indicate \nthat the cooperation is ongoing and that the transfers continue.\n  Because the stakes are so high, we don't have the luxury of time. And \nwhile I hope the Administration's efforts will succeed in persuading \nthe Russians to clamp down on these technology transfers, this Senator \nbelieves time is running out. The missiles being developed by the \nIranians are capable of delivering chemical weapons throughout the \nMiddle East. They are lethal. They threaten U.S. troops. They threaten \nour ally Israel. And in the long run, they will threaten our European \nallies. America needs to use every appropriate tool in its arsenal to \nprevent the Iranians from developing these missiles which will threaten \nour interests in the region. And we need to use those tools now.\n  Mr. President, the sanctions in this legislation provide another \ntool. They are appropriately targeted against the entities--the \ncompanies, individuals, and institutes--that are cooperating with the \nIranians. They are not targeted at the Russian government. If used \neffectively, these sanctions--or the threat of these sanctions--can \nhelp the Administration in its efforts to clamp down on those entities \nthat are cooperating with the Iranian government.\n  For the stake of promoting stability in the Middle East, I urge my \ncolleagues to approve this legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Iran Missile \nProliferation Sanctions Act before us today. At the same time, I am \nuncomfortable about the implementing legislation for the Chemical \nWeapons Convention attached to it.\n  Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses the gravest risk \nto domestic and international security in the post-Cold War era. Based \non this assessment of U.S. security concerns, it makes sense for the \nSenate to pass legislation designed to prevent or, at a minimum, curb \nproliferation threats in every possible instance.\n  The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act will help to attain our \nnon-proliferation objectives. A very important national security \nobjective is to prevent Iran from obtaining and improving its weapons \nof mass destruction. A critical concern is Iranian acquisition of \nballistic missiles, especially those with a range of 1,300 kilometers \nor more. Such capability would pose an unacceptable threat to U.S. \nforces in that area, not to mention our allies throughout the region.\n  This Sanctions legislation is a careful and sound approach to non-\nproliferation. The legislation should offer the Administration \nadditional leverage in curtailing Russian assistance to Iran's missile \nprograms, and I applaud those objectives.\n  Ideally, the implementing legislation for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention would have similar objectives--stemming the threat of \nproliferation. The goal of the Chemical Weapons Convention is to create \na sufficient web of deterrence and detection capabilities so as to \nminimize the potential threat that chemical weapons pose to U.S. and \nglobal security. In order to attain this objective, the CWC relies on \nthe most stringent verification regime ever before codified in an \ninternational arms control instrument.\n  The verification measures set forth in the CWC were carefully crafted \nover many years to ensure that the attained transparency in no way \nimpedes private industry's ability to protect proprietary information.\n  In addition, measures for ``challenge inspections''--a verification \nmeasure initially proposed by the Reagan Administration in negotiations \nover a decade ago--allow for inspection at any time and in any place. \nOtherwise, the CWC is rendered incapable of ferreting out undeclared \nactivities. I remind you that this was a weakness of the nuclear \nnonproliferation regime that Iraq successfully exploited to hide a \ncovert weapons program.\n  The proposed CWC implementation legislation, attached to H.R. 2709 \n``Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997,'' seriously weaken \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention in such a manner as to pave the way for \nrogue nations to capitalize on U.S. short-sightedness.\n  There are several aspects of the proposed legislation that are \nproblematic. First, however, the following is clear: if the U.S. Senate \nratified an international ban on poisonous gases, it makes no sense for \nthe Administration to have negotiated legislation that renders the \nConvention impotent. Secondly, the U.S. Senate cannot ratify a treaty \nand then renege on its own commitment to provide effective and \nreasonable measures for implementation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes three provisions that are of \nconcern:\n  (1) First, there is a measure that allows for the President to refuse \na challenge inspection on the grounds that it ``may pose a threat'' to \nU.S. security interests. Presumably, Hussein did not want UNSCOM in his \nPresidential palaces for similar reasons. Other countries would no \ndoubt follow suit. The White House is claiming that this is \n``harmless,'' because they do not intend to invoke it. If there is no \nintention to use it, then including this provision merely opens the \ndoor for other nations to follow our lead and diminishes our capacity \nto catch cheaters.\n  The CWC provisions on challenge inspections preclude abuse of the \nchallenge inspection option. The treaty incorporates stringent measures \nto ensure that confidential or classified information remains secure. \nMoreover, the CWC provides penalties for any state that might opt to \ninvoke a frivolous challenge inspection.\n  (2) Another dangerous aspect of the legislation is found in the \nprovisions on routine inspections and sampling. Again, the verification \nmeasures and procedures of the CWC were painstakingly crafted to ensure \nprivacy and confidentiality. Also, the ability to detect cheating at \nboth declared and undeclared facilities is critical to the viability of \nthe regime.\n  The proposed implementing legislation before the Senate allows for \nonly one inspection per year at industrial plants. The treaty allows \nfor two. This is a critical point. Given the number of facilities \nworldwide that will require inspection by a relatively small, highly \nqualified cadre of inspectors, most facilities will only be inspected \nonce a year. However, the treaty allows for two routine inspections in \ncase something suspicious or inexplicable is unearthed in the results \nfrom the first inspection.\n  The persons drafting this legislation may have assumed that they \nwould be sparing U.S. chemical facilities from the tedious drill of \ncoping with more inspections than necessary. However, this view is \nshort-sighted and will hinder the inspectorate's ability to identify \ncheaters. Again, other countries will follow the U.S. lead.\n  Should inspectors come across suspicious evidence in another country \nand desire more information to clarify the activities at a foreign \nfacility, the only option at that point would be to wait a year OR \ninvoke a challenge inspection. A lot of deadly chemicals can be \nproduced in a year.\n  In addition, challenge inspections were thought to be necessary to \nunearth undeclared clandestine activities. In all likelihood, invoking \na challenge inspection will be fraught with tension. Do we want to \nescalate every unclear circumstance at any facility in any country to \nthe level of a challenge inspection, when the original provisions of \nthe CWC provide the means necessary to avoid this?\n  (3) One last provision within this legislation requires adjustment. I \nremind you, once again, CWC was carefully crafted to provide measures \nfor stringent and comprehensive verification. The redefinition found in \nthe implementing legislation would undoubtedly narrow the number of \nU.S. facilities required to make declarations. Please bear in mind, the \nU.S. cannot hold other countries to standards that we ourselves are not \nwilling to meet.\n  Most commercial products have a mixture of chemicals in them. For \nexample, a ballpoint pen contains a chemical that could be extracted \nand used to make poison mustard gas. Under CWC provisions, chemical \nmanufacturers are required to include in their initial and annual \ndeclarations the production of mixtures with a low\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nconcentration in so-called Schedule 3 chemicals. U.S. chemical industry \nrepresentatives and U.S. government officials agreed that 30% or less \nof a Schedule 3 chemical in a mixture constitutes a low concentration.\n  The U.S. implementing legislation changes that figure to 80%. In \nother words, substantially fewer U.S. facilities will be subject to \ncompleting annual declarations or inspections. The same will hold true \nfor other countries that follow our example of assuming that 80% is a \nlow concentration. We thereby increase the likelihood that \nproliferators will use industrial facilities to mask chemical weapons \nactivities, averting detection.\n  The Chemical Manufacturers Association was extensively involved in \ndesigning the CWC verification measures. Chemical Manufacturers in this \ncountry were a strong and vocal group in support of this treaty. They \nconsistently urged that stringent and comprehensive verification \nprovisions be included in the treaty. The U.S. chemical industry did \nnot ask for these provisions to protect their interests so who, then, \ndo these provisions protect? The answer is simple: The provisions in \nthe U.S. implementing legislation protect those who want to cheat on \nthis treaty.\n  These restrictions on routine and challenge inspections will \ninevitably backfire on U.S. security interests. Keeping in mind that \nthe U.S. is setting an example with its implementation of the treaty's \nprovisions, these restrictions provide a great deal more latitude \nwithin which a rogue nation can maneuver to hide a chemical weapons \nprogram.\n  Intelligence sources repeatedly identify over two dozen states that \neither already have or are attempting to attain chemical weapons \ncapability. In its first year, the CWC has begun to reverse that trend. \nIn view of our most recent experience in Iraq, there is little reason \nto assume that lax verification measures for detecting or deterring \nweapons of mass destruction designs or capabilities will serve U.S. \ninterests.\n  At this time, the U.S. itself is already in violation of the CWC, \nbecause it has failed to pass implementing legislation and commence \nwith declarations and inspections. The U.S. Administration has come \nunder intense pressure from Japan, China, Australia and the European \nUnion to proceed.\n  The U.S. chemical industry is confronting pressures from their \ntrading partners overseas, because it has not yet been subject to \ninspection. States that are complying fully with the CWC's reporting \nand inspection requirements are threatening to stop inspections on \ntheir territory if the United States, which has the world's largest \nchemical industry, does not soon allow inspections of that industry to \nproceed.\n  Due to these pressures, the U.S. chemical industry and the \nAdministration want action now. However, we cannot allow these \npressures to distract us from the fundamental problems with this \nimplementing legislation. Short-sightedness on issues of U.S. and \ninternational security can be very dangerous over the long haul.\n  Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem are the most serious threat to U.S. security today. The aims of \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act are laudable and I fully \nsupport them. I supported the Chemical Weapons Convention last year, \nand I would wholeheartedly support passage of reasonable and effective \nimplementing legislation for that treaty. Due to the pressures that our \nchemical industry is confronting and our current violation of the \nConvention, I will also support this legislation.\n  However, I will not do so without pointing to the hypocrisy of \nsanctioning entities who proliferate missile technology to Iran, and, \nat the same time, passing implementing legislation that opens the door \nfor chemical weapons proliferators.\n  It is essential that we impede the flow of missile technologies to \nIran. It is also critical that we pass implementing legislation and \njoin the international community in eliminating chemical weapons and \ndetecting defectors. However, it is critical that we do it right. This \nCWC legislation is all wrong. I would like to work with my colleagues \nto improve this implementation regime in the near future. Otherwise, \nour overzealous desire to shield ourselves will ultimately be used by \nthose we would like to protect ourselves against.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire, if all time has been yielded back, \nthe amendment has been accepted, are we not ready to proceed to the \nvote on final passage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time on the bill is also yielded back, \nwe are prepared to do exactly that.\n  Mr. KYL. There is no time on this side. I do not know about the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe the Senator from \nDelaware has 8 minutes remaining on the bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will, in a moment, yield back the time I \nhave left.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by suggesting, again, I think this is \nthe wrong time to do this. I think it has its greatest value held in \nabeyance, as long as significant progress is being made. I am fearful \nif this is signed into law by the President, in the near term it is \ngoing to have the exact opposite impact. But in the interests of \naccommodating people's schedules--although I am not sure how much we \nare going to accommodate because I am told there will be insistence \nthere be a vote on the highway bill, and if that is true, we are not \nbeing able to accommodate anybody's time. But I am delighted to yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Actually, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. We are \nprepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement of April \n3, I now call up H.R. 2709, the Iran sanctions legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2709) to impose certain sanctions on foreign \n     persons who transfer items contributing to Iran's efforts to \n     acquire, develop or produce ballistic missiles, and to \n     implement the obligations of the United States under the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 90 minutes equally divided under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just want to clarify the procedural \nsituation. As the Chair just said, it is 90 minutes on the underlying \nmeasure, and then 90 minutes on the Levin amendment, if need be to use \nthat time. It is the intent that we go forward to completion of this \nact and that we have a recorded vote at the end of that time.\n  I am really pleased the Senate is finally completing action on this \nvery important piece of legislation. Senator Lieberman and I introduced \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act on October 23, 1997. It \nhas 84 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. This is not really a complicated \npiece of legislation. It is designed to address one of the most \npressing security issues we face in the world, Iran's determined drive \nto acquire ballistic missile production capability.\n  This legislation requires specific targeted sanctions against any \nforeign entities providing direct support to Iran's missile development \nefforts. The House passed companion legislation on November 12, 1997, \nwithout a single dissenting vote. House action modified certain \nprovisions of the legislation to meet concerns of the administration, \nmost notably--and I have made this point to the President in my \ndiscussions with him about this legislation--that he is granted a \nwaiver, and that was requested by the administration, and that was \nincluded in the bill when the House passed it.\n  The House also passed legislation adding the Chemical Weapons \nConvention to the package. Our legislation addresses a clear and \npresent danger. Iran is a terrorist state under U.S. law. Last year, a \nGerman court found Iranian intelligence directly responsible for murder \ncommitted on German soil. Earlier this very week, the Government of \nArgentina found Iran responsible for a terrorist bombing of a Jewish \nsynagogue. The same Iranian Government responsible for terrorist murder \naround the world is engaged in efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and \nthe means to deliver them. They already have chemical weapons. They are \nworking on biological weapons. This is a very serious matter.\n  Much of the knowledge that Senators and administration officials have \non this issue cannot be talked about here in the Senate because of \ntheir very sensitive intelligence issues. But every time I receive a \nbriefing, I become more alarmed about what Iran has and what additional \ncapability they are trying to acquire.\n  Their missile program has been advanced tremendously by the \nassistance from a wide range of Russian entities. The details, as I \nsaid, are classified, but it is comprehensive and it is ongoing. I urge \nevery Senator to review the intelligence information. A summary is \navailable right now in S-407 for Members' review. The intelligence \ncommunity will brief any Senator on the extent and impact of Russian \ncooperation. I have had that briefing and continue to review \nintelligence information. Let me assure the Senate, Russian cooperation \nis deeply disturbing. It is widespread. It has made the day Iran is \nable to target American forces and American allies closer by years. If \nI went into the details of the capability they have acquired and how \nsoon they could have the ability to use that, everybody in the Senate \nand the United States would be alarmed.\n  The basic facts are not in dispute. Iran wants ballistic missile \nproduction capability. Russian assistance has materially advanced \nIranian efforts. American diplomatic efforts to halt assistance have \nnot succeeded. That assistance continues today. That is why we have \nH.R. 2709 before us today in the Senate.\n  We have not rushed to judgment on this issue. Last November, we did \nnot act after the House sent us the legislation, and I received \nspecific calls from the President's National Security Adviser asking \nthat we not act. In the last week we were in session, this legislation \ncould have been passed, probably on a voice vote, immediately. But, in \nresponse to the administration's efforts and assurances that they were \ngoing to get some cooperation, we said all right, we will see if we get \nsome results by waiting.\n  In January, the administration asked for a 3-week delay to compare \nassessments with Israel, our ally most directly threatened by Iranian \nweapons of mass destruction. In February, the administration asked for \ndelay until\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\nVice President Gore's March meeting with then Russian Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin. In March, the administration asked us to wait until \nApril. In every instance, I consulted with Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, talked to Senator Lieberman, checked the intelligence \ninformation, listened to the requests from the President's National \nSecurity Adviser and the Vice President, and continued to make an \neffort to give them time to see if we could get some results, get some \naction. It did not happen. It did not happen again and again and again.\n  In April, though, we said there had to be an end to this or the \nSenate's credibility would be in doubt, if we continued to just hold \nthis out there and not act. And, also, if we do not act soon and this \ncontinues--the capabilities that they are acquiring are extremely \ndangerous, to say the least.\n  So we entered into the unanimous consent agreement in April, the \nmiddle of April, to consider this legislation today. We said we would \ndo it by or on May 22. For 6 entire months, we have tried to give more \ntime for this matter to be addressed, for there to be some indication \nthat Russia was in fact able to deal with these companies and these \nindividuals who were involved in this intelligence, scientific, and \nballistic missile capability exchange. It did not stop. Again, I cannot \ngo into details, but there were specific instances of things we were \nconcerned about. The overwhelming majority of them did not stop, did \nnot change.\n  We have had at least five delays that have been requested by the \nadministration and granted by the Senate. President Clinton has had \nample time to allow his diplomatic approach to work. I would point out, \nhowever, the administration has refused to make sanctions decisions \nwhich are required by law, and there clearly have been some instances \nwhere those sanctions could have and probably should have been \nimplemented. A number of Russian actions supporting Iran's missile \nprogram require U.S. sanctions under the Missile Technology Control \nAct. In fact, if the administration had acted last year, as called for \nunder that law, this legislation probably would not be necessary.\n  The administration often asks for bipartisanship regarding foreign \npolicy, and I think that is as it should be. I have tried more than \nonce to be cooperative and to make sure that we proceeded in a \nbipartisan way. We have done that. I have done it sometimes while \ncoming under heavy criticism from the media or members of my own party. \nBut I thought, and I think, it is the right thing to do. I try to \naccommodate whenever and however I can. This legislation, though, \nshould not be delayed further. It could not be more bipartisan. I \nreiterate, 84 Senators on both sides of the aisle are cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  I hope the administration will reconsider its opposition. I think it \nactually could be helpful. I think the fact we have had this \nlegislation pending has been helpful. It has given the administration \nleverage. Unfortunately, the leverage has not produced results.\n  I fear that the Russian Government does not have sufficient \ncapability to stop this exchange from occurring. They do not have the \nexport control laws that we do. They do not have the ability to go to a \ncompany in Russia as easily as we do and say, ``Do not be engaged in \nthis very dangerous process.'' Or if they do, they haven't been able to \ncarry it out so far.\n  There are those who are going to say, ``Well, there have been some \nchanges. We have a new government there. Chernomyrdin has been replaced \nby a new young Prime Minister. He is talking good.''\n  They have made some recommendations, but some of the things we have \nbeen told have happened we do not have the evidence of yet. Again, we \nare being told that within the last 10 days greater assurances have \nbeen given by Russian officials. This has been going on for months, \nreally years, and now all of a sudden they say, ``Well, wait, there is \na new leader on the block; he is going to make a difference.''\n  If we go forward today and accept the amendment of Senator Levin from \nMichigan and pass this legislation, it still has to go back to the \nHouse. It will probably be 10 days or so before the House can act. \nThere will be a little more time to see if, in fact, these new leaders \nin Russia can begin to make a difference. The President, I reiterate, \nhas waiver authority, and he may decide that this is such a sensitive \nnational security issue at this particular time that he needs to veto \nit. He can do that. But I think that the Senate should not delay any \nlonger.\n  There is beginning to be a pattern around the world of some of our \nfriends, supposedly, and allies, or countries that we are trying to \nwork with, contributing to very dangerous weapons proliferation and \nnuclear activity. Think about it. Do we want Iran to have this \nballistic missile capability? Not only chemical and biological weapons, \nbut they would like to have nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver \nthem in the region or in the world. I don't think so.\n  It is time the Senate delivered a clear message on this--a clear \nbipartisan message. I really think it will be helpful in getting this \nprocess, that Russia and others have been participating in, stopped now \nbefore it is too late.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the Senator from Kansas 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate the \nSenator from Arizona recognizing me to speak on this very important \nact.\n  The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is more important now \nthan ever. I chair the subcommittee in the Foreign Relations Committee \nwhich deals with Iran. We have had a number of hearings on this \nparticular issue. We just had a hearing last week on what all Iran is \ndoing around the world.\n\n  It might be of interest for many people in this body to know that, \naccording to the State Department's last report, Iran is operating in \nsome 21 countries around the world with either terroristic actions \ntaking place or building the base for further expansion of their \nactivities and interests and terroristic actions to happen.\n  I am sure a number of people have already noted as well the recent \nfinding by the Argentine Government of Iranian-backed terrorists \ninvolved with the horrendous bombings that took place in that country \nearlier this decade. The recent nuclear test by the Indians drives this \npoint home even more. It is more urgent now than it was even 10 days \nago to alert the world, and Iran in particular, that the United States \nwill not tolerate an Iranian nuclear program, period.\n  The administration has already shown lack of resolve in its recent \ndecisions to waive the sanctions on Total and Gazprom under the Iran-\nLibya Sanctions Act. This, in my estimation, was a grave mistake, as \nthe world has now received the message that it is once again free to \nfill the Iranian coffers and help it pay for the development of its \nnuclear capability, as well as fund its terrorism activities overseas.\n  In the most recent State Department report that was out less than a \nmonth ago, Iran is the leading nation around the world sponsoring \nterrorism as a state. In the State Department's most recent report, \nIran is the leader in this most ignoble category.\n  We need to make the world understand that Iranian development of an \nindigenous missile capability, combined with nuclear capability, is \ndangerous to everyone. While Iran has been quite open in its calls to \nannihilate Israel, a nuclear-capable Iran will threaten countries far \nbeyond its borders. The very countries which are now planning to refill \nIran's coffers are the countries which will be at risk in the future.\n  The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is not a country-wide \nsanction. What we are proposing here is intended to sanction specific \nentities known to be providing Iran with missile technology. This bill \nis an effort to stem this dangerous flow to Iran and is\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\ndesigned to impose certain sanctions on foreign persons who transfer \nitems contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce \nballistic missiles.\n  There is good intelligence about which Russian entities are involved. \nSome of them are involved in joint space cooperation with the United \nStates. These companies should know that there will be costs if they \nengage in behavior which so obviously threatens our security interests, \nthe security interests of the region, and the security interests of the \nentire world, from the leading sponsor of terrorism around the world, \nwhich is the Iranian regime.\n  The administration claims it is making progress with the Russian \nGovernment on this matter, that we need to give them time to implement \nthe relatively new decree tightening the export of dual-use technology.\n  We keep hearing about the progress we are making with the Russians, \nbut we do not see it. I might note as well, there were recent bills \npassed in the House of Representatives going at the administration in \nthis country about the sharing of dual-use technology with China and \nsaying that this was wrong what the administration has been supporting.\n  How can we believe them that they are going to be able to stop the \nRussians when they are providing some of this in a questionable dual-\nuse area to the Chinese?\n  Mr. President, we do not undervalue what the Russian Government is \ntrying to do. We are all encouraged by the progress that is being made. \nBut the fact remains that the transfers continue.\n  Just 2 weeks ago--2 weeks ago--the Government of Azerbaijan \nintercepted a transfer of materials going from Russia to Iran which \nwould have significantly enhanced Iran's ability to produce missiles \nindigenously.\n  If the Russians are working so diligently on this program, this bill \nposes no threats and in fact really would help them in these efforts. \nThe bill would not sanction the Russian Government. That is a very \nimportant point to make. It does not sanction the Russian Government.\n  In fact, if the Russian Government is serious about stemming the flow \nof this technology, this bill only helps them. After all, it is going \nafter companies which are now breaking Russian laws.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason why the U.S. taxpayer should be \nproviding any taxpayer dollars to companies that are colluding with \nIran to make that country an even greater danger to the United States, \nthe leading country sponsoring terrorism around the world that is \nseeking to get this technology.\n  We cannot allow this river of technology and assistance without doing \neverything possible to stop it. This bill works towards that goal. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for it. I encourage the administration \nto sign it and to help us stop the flow of this technology to the \nleading terrorist regime around the world that seeks to get these \nweapons that can strike at U.S. interests. This bill is clearly in the \nUnited States' best interests.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding time to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if others do not wish to speak at this time, \nI will. And at any time that a Member of the minority would like to \nmake a presentation, that will certainly be all right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters \nthat pertain to the chemical weapons treaty implementation portion of \nthis legislation, a letter from the Chemical Manufacturers Association \nand a letter from the American Forest & Paper Association.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Chemical Manufacturers\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                       Arlington, VA, May 7, 1998.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the Senate is scheduled to \n     take up H.R. 2709 later this month. This legislation contains \n     provisions necessary to assure full implementation of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in the United States. The \n     Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) is committed to \n     timely implementation of the CWC, and urges you and your \n     colleagues to pass the CWC implementing provisions as quickly \n     as possible.\n       CMA and its member companies strongly support the \n     Convention. We have a long history of involvement in the CWC, \n     from the early stages of negotiation, to Senate debate on \n     ratification to international implementation. Throughout the \n     CWC's history, we have held the view that it should be \n     implemented as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n       The CWC imposes on the U.S. government an obligation to \n     make a full declaration of affected government and commercial \n     facilities. Absent the implementing legislation, however, \n     there is no statutory basis to compel commercial facilities \n     to declare their CWC-related activities. CMA believes that \n     the CWC-related provisions of H.R. 2709 is the only route \n     available for the orderly implementation of the Convention.\n       The CWC-related provisions of H.R. 2709 are identical to S. \n     610, which passed the Senate on May 23, 1997. Thus, both \n     Houses of Congress have already approved these provisions. \n     CMA supported S. 610 as a reasonable approach to meet U.S. \n     obligations under the CWC and protect industry's interests. \n     We continue to support the CWC implementing provisions \n     contained in H.R. 2709.\n       If CMA can provide any additional information on its \n     position regarding implementation of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, please have your staff contact Claude Boudrias, \n     CMA's Associate Director of Federal Legislative Affairs, at \n     703/741-5915, or Marybeth Kelliher, Senior Manager for \n     International Trade, at 703/741-5923.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Frederick L. Webber,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 American Forest &\n\n\n                                            Paper Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing with regard to the \n     upcoming mark-up of S. 610, the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1997. Upon review of bill, the American \n     Forest & Paper Association (AF) would like to offer its \n     support, in general, of many of the bill's provisions. While \n     we believe it is unfortunate that the scope of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention (``CWC'' or ``treaty'') is overly broad, \n     S. 610 contains a number of provisions that the forest \n     products industry believes are crucial to ensuring that \n     implementation of the CWC is reasonable and meets the stated \n     purposes of the treaty.\n       Among some of the provisions of importance to the forest \n     products industry are the following.\n       Section 403. We strongly support the prohibition of \n     requirements under the treaty for chemical byproducts that \n     are coincidently manufactured. Due to the broad nature of the \n     category of ``discrete organic chemicals,'' as defined by the \n     treaty, it is critical to recognize that inclusion of \n     coincidental byproducts of manufacturing processes that are \n     not captured or isolated for use or sale would exceed the \n     stated purposes of the CWC.\n       Section 3(11), (12) and (13). We strongly support the \n     listing of covered ``chemical agents'' in the bill. It is our \n     understanding that additions or deletions from the list would \n     only be permitted by legislative amendment, and not through \n     the administrative regulatory process. We believe maintaining \n     congressional authority for any list modifications is \n     necessary to ensure that any such modifications adhere \n     strictly to the intent and purposes of the treaty, as \n     ratified.\n       Section 303(b)(2)(B). We also support the provision \n     prohibiting employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration from participating on inspections conducted \n     under the treaty. The treaty should not be used as an omnibus \n     vehicle for regulatory inspections unrelated to its intended \n     purpose. We believe that it would be inappropriate to include \n     such government officials on an international inspection team \n     formed for the purposes set out in the CWC, and would merely \n     serve to detract from the intent of the inspection.\n       I would be happy to discuss these points with you further, \n     and appreciate the opportunity to provide this information on \n     behalf of AF's members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Josephine S. Cooper,\n                               Vice President, Regulatory Affairs.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I just noted, there are actually two parts \nof this legislation. One of them has to do with the implementation of \nthe chemical weapons treaty which was ratified in the Senate last year.\n  The legislation passed about a year ago. It was finally dealt with by \nthe House, and comes back to us. I do not know of any objection to it. \nAnd I will not take the time to summarize it except to say that in \ngeneral terms it\n\n[[Page S5372]]\n\nmakes it a crime for Americans to produce or use or manufacture these \nchemical weapons.\n  It provides protections for American citizens and businesses in terms \nof search and seizure and takings, so that with respect to the \ninspection regime that is established under the treaty, there is \nprotection of American citizens' constitutional rights, and if anyone \nhas a question about that legislation, I am prepared to try to answer \nthat today.\n  But by far and away the issue that is before us today of most \ninterest to Members is, of course, the Russian missile assistance to \nIran. The majority leader spoke eloquently on the patience that the \nSenate has exercised in withholding action on this important \nlegislation until this time.\n  But there does come a time when, as the majority leader said, the \nSenate does have to finally act here. We believe that by passing this \nlegislation, it will actually have a positive impact on the leadership \nof Russia which has had a very difficult time ensuring that the \nassistance provided to Iran is stopped.\n  Now, one might say, ``Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense if it is \nthe policy of the Russian Government that this assistance not be \ntransferred to Iran.'' But the fact of the matter is, it is difficult \nfor the Russian Government, as the majority leader said, to ensure that \nthere is no transfer of technology or material to the Iranian missile \nprogram.\n  When confronted with evidence that this has occurred, in some cases \nthe Russian Government appears to have tried to take action against it; \nin other cases, as the majority leader said, that has not happened. So \nthis legislation should provide a basis not only for the United States \nto specifically direct attention to the matter, but also for the \nRussian Government to have a very specific basis for enforcing its laws \nand policies against the providing of such technology to Iran.\n  Mr. President, let me just outline in very brief terms some of the \nopen-source information about the kind of technology and other \nassistance that has been provided by Russian firms, individuals, and \nother entities to the Iranian program.\n  One of the Russian ICBM missiles--or at least intermediate-range \nmissile--is called an SS-4 in our terminology. And important missile \ncomponents and instructions of how to build that missile have been sent \nto the Iranians.\n  This is important because this missile has a much greater capability \nthan the one that is most likely to be produced soon. This missile, in \nthe Iranian term, is called the Shahab-4. It would have the capability \nof reaching cities in Europe, Mr. President. So it is not just a \nregional weapon, but a weapon that will challenge countries in Europe \nas well as in the Middle East. That weapon, according to open-source \nmaterial, could be deployable within as little as 3 years.\n  In addition to that, construction of a wind tunnel for missile design \nand manufacture of missile models, and even the sale of missile design \nsoftware has occurred.\n  Moreover, missile guidance and propulsion components, as well as the \nnecessary advice and equipment to produce these components in Iran has \nbeen provided. In that sense, Mr. President, let me note that it is not \nRussians who are actually building these missiles for the Iranians, it \nis Russians who are providing much of the material and the assistance \nand the technology for the Iranians to do it themselves. So they will \nhave an indigenous capability.\n  In addition, more than one special metal alloy which Iran can shape \ninto missile casings and even alloy foil in thin sheets used to shield \nguidance equipment had been provided, in one case, according to open-\nsource material, was stopped in another country after it left Russia.\n  Training of Iranian technicians at Russian institutes and the \nrecruitment of top Russian missile specialists to work with Iran has \nall occurred within the most recent months or years.\n  As I said, the Iranians are using this technology to produce two \nmissiles: One we call the Shahab-3, the other the Shahab-4. The Shahab-\n3 has a 1,300-kilometer range roughly, depending upon what kind of \nwarhead is included on it, and is capable of targeting Israel, as well \nas other targets in the Middle East. According to open-source material, \ndevelopment of this missile could be completed in 12 to 18 months.\n  I mentioned the Shahab-4, which is capable of reaching Central \nEurope, and the fact that development could be completed in 3 years.\n  Mr. President, since the Senator from Connecticut, I think, is \npreparing to speak, let me just summarize one other aspect of this \nassistance; that is the Russian nuclear assistance to Iran, not \nspecifically the target of this legislation, but of equal concern to \nus.\n  Russia has assisted Iran in a number of ways, including a contract to \nconstruct a nuclear reactor and a deal to provide nuclear fuel for the \nreactor for 20 years, and to take back spent fuel for reprocessing. It \nhas agreed to train Iranian nuclear technicians to operate the plant, \nto construct three additional reactors when the first contract is \ncomplete.\n  In 1995, in response to U.S. pressure, Russia agreed to limit the \nscope of nuclear cooperation with Iran and canceled plans to sell gas \ncentrifuge enrichment technology, and heavy water moderated reactors.\n  However, Russia has exceeded the limits it agreed to place on its \nnuclear cooperation with Iran. According to an article in July 1997 by \nThe Washington Post, the United States intelligence reports \n``document[ed] a series of high-level technical exchanges between \nRussia and Iranian engineers,'' which covered matters beyond the \nBushehr reactor, including advice on how to mine and process uranium.\n  Finally, Mr. President, just this month, The Washington Times \ndisclosed that U.S. intelligence reports indicate that Iranian nuclear \nofficials were negotiating to purchase tritium from Russia and were \nslated to view a demonstration of gas centrifuge technology used to \nenrich uranium for nuclear weapons during a visit to Moscow later this \nmonth.\n  At a meeting just last week, we specifically asked the Russian \nAmbassador if he would try to see to it that that demonstration project \nwas not held because its only purpose is to assist the uranium nuclear \nprogram. He indicated personally a desire not to see that meeting go \nforward, but we will see whether it does.\n  Tritium, which I mentioned, is, of course, important for the boosting \nof nuclear weapons and would be an important way for the Iranians to \nmake a nuclear technology more robust than it might be otherwise. These \nare serious matters.\n  The Russian Government, whether complicity or simply negligence, has \nnot been able to stop the transfer of these materials and this \ntechnology. The United States cannot simply sit by and hope for \ndiplomatic actions to work. In the Senate and the House, we recently \npassed money for a supplemental appropriations bill which will be \napplied to both Israeli theater missile defense systems and the U.S. \ntheater missile defense systems so we may at an earlier day be able to \nmeet the threat that the Iranian missiles might pose.\n  There may be a window of vulnerability. That is why it is important \nfor us to try to slow down and stop the assistance that Russia is \nproviding to Iran. This is very important legislation. I hope our \ncolleagues will support it strongly, sending a strong signal to Russia \nthat it should not be providing or allowing to be provided this \nimportant technology to Iran.\n  I yield whatever time the Senator from Connecticut desires.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Arizona not only for yielding but for his principal support of \nthis legislation and for his outstanding statement.\n  I rise to support the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act and to \nthank all of those in the Senate who have cosponsored it, principally \nthe distinguished majority leader of the Senate for his strong \nleadership in this effort. It has been purposeful. It has been \nbalanced. I think it has been quite realistic.\n  I think we have before the Senate a measured response to a real \nproblem. The real problem is the development by Iran of ballistic \nmissile capacity, longer-range ballistic missile capacity, which, when \ncombined with attempts within Iran to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction, holds the potential to change the balance of power within \nthe Middle East.\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\n  It is destabilizing. It is threatening to our troops and forces on \nthe waters within the Middle East region. It is threatening to our \nallies within the Arab world, moderate Arab nations. And it is \nthreatening to our ally, Israel. That is in the short run.\n  In the longer run, the development of longer-range ballistic missile \ncapacity by Iran could threaten our allies in Europe in a wider circle \naround Iran and, eventually, of course, could threaten us directly here \nin the United States of America. We are dealing here with a very, very \nserious and concrete challenge to world order and America's national \nsecurity.\n  This measure has been introduced and principally led by the majority \nleader. I am privileged to have joined with him in that. It is \ncosponsored by more than 80 Members of the U.S. Senate--84 is the \ntotal, I believe. It is in that sense a profoundly bipartisan response \nto this genuine national security problem.\n  I think one of the reasons this measure has gained the broad support \nthat it has is not only because the problem is real, the threat to \nsecurity from Iran having long-range ballistic missile capacity being \nreal, but because the approach taken in the bill is targeted.\n  I will go directly to the language of the bill. ``Sanctions shall be \napplied to every foreign person with respect to whom there is credible \ninformation indicating that person''--and of course ``person'' is given \na broad definition of a natural person --``is an alien or a \ncorporation, business, association, partnership, society, trust, or any \nother nongovernmental entity, organization, or group that is organized \nunder the laws of a foreign country or has its presence, people, or \nplace of business, in a foreign country or any foreign governmental \nentity operating as a business enterprise in any successor or \nsubsidiary of any entity.''\n  So this applies to any entity that comes within that category, that \nfirst transferred items on the MTCR, the missile technology control \nregime annex, or items that the United States opposed for addition to \nthat annex that contributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or \nproduce ballistic missiles.\n  We are talking here about entities that are helping Iran gain the \ncapacity that I have described, as the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenate majority leader have all described, ``to develop ballistic \nmissile capacity or provide technical assistance or facilities which \nthe President deems to be of concern, because of their direct \ncontribution to Iran's efforts.'' Again, to acquire or develop \nballistic missiles or attempt to transfer such items or attempted to \nprovide technical assistance or facilities.\n  That is very direct. Apply sanctions to entities that have actually \ndone something wrong, done something wrong in the judgment of the \nPresident of the United States as reported to Congress every year \nregarding any credible information that occurrences by these entities \nhave transpired to help Iran gain the capacity that we do not want them \nto gain.\n  That applies a series of sanctions in response to that evidence, and \ngives the President, incidentally, the authority to waive those \nsanctions if he either obtains additional information that diminishes \nthe content of the original finding or the President determines that \nthe waiver is required, is essential, to the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  So, it is very targeted and not the broad based, ``don't do any \nbusiness with this country or that country.'' But on a finding of \ncredible evidence by the President of the United States that a person, \na company, a governmental agency or institute has been assisting Iran \nin obtaining ballistic missile capacity, then these sanctions are \napplied and the President may use a waiver.\n  What are the sanctions? I will describe them generally: stopping arms \nsales under the Arms Export Control Act to these entities; stopping the \ntransfer or sale of dual-use items under the Export Administration Act; \nand the cessation of any U.S. grants or loans or other benefits to \nthese entities.\n  Why should we be helping companies or governmental agencies abroad \nthat are contributing to the development of this Iranian ballistic \nmissile capacity which will so threaten our security?\n  So it is a very measured approach which, again, I think is at the \nheart of why this bill before us has over 80 percent of the Senators \nsupporting it, a truly bipartisan measure.\n  Mr. President, there are those who will say that things are changing \nin Iran. So why pass this legislation? Well, from the best that I can \ndetermine, there are the beginnings of some changes in Iran. The \nchanges, certainly, have not gone far enough to alter the essential \ncharacter of the center of that regime, which is still fundamentally \nhostile and threatening to the United States and threatening to our \nsecurity. It is still the major sponsor, state sponsor of terrorism in \nthe world which, to the best of our knowledge, has resulted in the \ndeaths of many Americans and many citizens of other countries that are \nallies of America. Just the finding by the Argentinian security, law \nenforcement forces earlier this week announced--these are tough cases \nto investigate--they have traced two attacks, two bombings on Jewish \ninstitutions in Argentina directly back, by their judgment, just \nrepeating what I have read in the newspapers, back to Iran. And so it \ngoes.\n  So the election of the new President, President Khatami, of Iran, who \nhas been making statements that are more moderate, more open, both in \nterms of Iran's domestic policy and even international, who gave the \nimportant interview to CNN in which he suggested the possibility of \nopening informal contacts with the United States of America, he still \nmade some statements that are extremely hostile and negative toward us \nand some of our allies. But, nonetheless, I take these to be \nencouraging signs. But what remains the fact, as best any of us can \ndetermine, is that the much more radical elements within the Iranian \nGovernment are still in control of the apparatus of that government--\nthe military, the intelligence, the foreign policy--and, in fact, there \nis no indication that any of the sponsorship of terrorism has stopped.\n  In the meantime, the Senator from Arizona has suggested, as we have \nheard in classified briefings which cannot be discussed in detail here, \nthe Iranians get ever closer to developing, in a headlong thrust, full \nforce, full-throttle thrust, to developing long-range ballistic \nmissiles. Maybe it is going to be hard to stop him from doing this. But \nthe intention of this bill, it seems to me, is an exercise in common \nsense, the exercise of traditional principles of self-defense. This \nlegislation will help us to delay the date on which Iran will achieve \nlong-range ballistic missile capacity with which it can deliver weapons \nof mass destruction on those it chooses as enemies, as targets.\n\n  Let's think about it optimistically. Perhaps in that period of time, \nwe will see a fruition of some of the obvious interests, obvious \nconcerns of the people of Iran as expressed in the election of Mr. \nKhatami for a change. I hope so.\n  The people of Iran have no inherent reason--let me put it another \nway, Mr. President. There is no inherent conflict of interest, \nstrategic interest between the people of Iran and the people of the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, since the revolution that occurred in \nIran in the late 1970s, we have been set on a confrontational course \nwhich threatens the stability of the region and the world and does \nnothing good for the people of Iran --a gifted people with a proud \nhistory.\n  So I am hopeful about the changes that are possible within Iran, but, \nby any reasoned judgment, we have a long way to go yet. These missiles \nare being developed rapidly and they are going to be aimed at us and \nour allies. Therefore, this proposal still seems to me to be extremely \nimportant and, as I say, very measured and targeted.\n  Mr. President, there are those who say, well, OK, you are right, \nthere is a threat from Iran. But this measure is really targeted at \nRussia. Not only is there hope of change within Iran, but there is \neven, of course, more substantial change that has occurred, and the \nhope of change, within the Russian Government, particularly on this \nissue. So why provoke the Russians? It is the threat of these sanctions \nfrom Congress that matters, not the realization of it.\n  Let me say first, Mr. President, that on the face of the bill, there \nis no mention of Russia. This is a piece of legislation that is \ntargeted at any people,\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\nany entities, any government, anywhere on the globe that the President \nhas reason to believe is contributing to Iran's development and \nacquisition of ballistic missile capacity. It could apply to, and might \nin the past have applied to, companies in allied countries of ours in \nWestern Europe who, in one way or another, may have attempted to sell \nor sold items to the Iranians, which they have now used or are using in \nthe development of a ballistic missile capacity, or even in the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Certainly, some evidence suggests that there may be entities within \nthe People's Republic of China who have transferred items, sold items \nto the Iranians that are used in the development of these threatening \nprograms. North Korea, our relations with them are much more limited; \nnonetheless, that is another possibility. But it is true, to the best \nof our knowledge today and in recent years--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time controlled by the Senator from \nArizona has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes remain to the Senator from \nDelaware and an additional 90 minutes on any amendment proposed by the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time does my friend need?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thought we had more time available. I am glad to \nfinish up within 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator, who \ndisagrees with my position, as well as I will yield time at the \nappropriate time from our time to my friend from North Carolina as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for his extraordinary \ngraciousness, since we are in disagreement on this particular question. \nLet me summarize the remainder of my argument.\n\n  We know from intelligence sources, some of which had been reported in \nthe press and referred to by the Senator from Arizona, that in recent \nyears, as best we can determine, a number of companies, institutes, and \nsubdivisions within Russia have been involved in transactions, usually \nfor business purposes, with Iran, which are of material technical \nassistance to Iran, to help in their ballistic missile development \nprogram. So, yes, this legislation will apply to Russia.\n  We know this has been raised from the highest level of our \nGovernment--the Vice President, the National Security Adviser, and \nothers, like Ambassador Frank Wisner and Mr. Gallucci, with the \nRussians to end this cooperation with Iran. Progress is being made.\n  On January 22, which I believe is the exact date, former Prime \nMinister Chernomyrdin issued an Executive order in which he stated the \nintention of the government to begin to set some policies for trying to \ncontrol this activity. Within the last week, although I don't believe \nwe have seen the details of it in this country, the Russian Government \nhas promulgated a detailed series of regulations to carry out \nChernomyrdin's order of January of this year. So there is a good-faith \neffort being made at the governmental level.\n  Yet, our intelligence sources--to speak as broadly as I must in these \ncases--tell us there is still evidence that there are entities within \nRussia that are continuing to cooperate with Iran in the development of \nballistic missile capacity. That is why I think we have to go ahead \nwith this legislation today. But why? I think it is very important to \nsay that it is not directed at the Russian Government. In fact, unless \nthere is clear evidence of complicity by the Russian Government in one \nof these transfers, sanctions will not go to the Russian Government. \nThey will go to companies, institutes, or subdivisions. I hope our \nfriends, in return--particularly the new government of Mr. Kiriyenko, \nthe National Security Adviser--to give him a title he may not \nofficially have--and the deputy defense minister, Mr. Kokoshin--will \nclearly understand that this is not directed at them. In fact, when we \nadopt the amendment to be offered by the Senator from Michigan, which \nwill put the effective date of the gathering of relevant evidence to \nthe date of the Chernomyrdin order in January, then, I think, we will \nhave a law that basically says that America will sanction entities \nwithin Russia that are not complying with the clear policy of the \nRussian Government.\n  In that sense, I think this is a very important measure, one that \nwill contribute to our security, one that should not affect our \nbilateral relations with Russia, and one that could be the basis, I \nhope in fact, for us going forward to build a bilateral policy with \nRussia that understands that the strategic reality of the world has \nchanged after the cold war, and that we are no longer in a situation of \na bipolar world where each of the great powers, the Soviet Union and \nUnited States, are facing each other with intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles and nuclear warheads, and that we are working well together to \nbuild down in our weapons through the nuclear weapons, START I and \nSTART II; but that each of us, Russia and the United States, faces \nthreats from the proliferation of the possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the world-changing capacity to deliver those weapons \nwith ballistic missiles.\n\n  So we ought to work together to try to limit the spread of that \ntechnology and the danger it will represent not only to the United \nStates and their allies but to Russia and their allies.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill and for giving \nme the opportunity to speak to it today. I hope that we will adopt it \nunanimously. I look forward to seeing its implementation and the \nincrease in our security in one of those areas that we know will \nrepresent the greatest threat in the generation ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nJanuary 1998 Reader's Digest be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Reader's Digest, June 1998]\n\n                        Missle Threat From Iran\n\n                       (By Kenneth R. Timmerman)\n\n       Last August an American spy satellite spotted a scar of \n     fire on the out-skirts of Iran's capital, Teheran. It was the \n     unmistakable signature of a rocket-engine test. On the \n     ground, engineers and technicians watched a powerful liquid-\n     fueled missile engine bolted to a test stand shoot a plume of \n     fire.\n       The engine firing, conducted at the secrecy-shrouded Shahid \n     Hemat Industrial Group research facility, sent tremors \n     through Western intelligence agencies:\n       First, the successful test marked an ominous advance for \n     the anti-Western Islamic government of Iran. New-generation \n     ballistic missiles could give the regime a decisive military \n     edge in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n       Second, the new missile program bears the fingerprints of \n     an old adversary that is now supposed to be an American \n     ally--Russia. Iran's rocket engines, originally acquired from \n     North Korea, were upgraded in Russia. Technicians at Iran's \n     test facility included engineers from NP. Trud, a prestigious \n     Russian rocket-motor plant that helped develop the missiles \n     that targeted the West during the Cold War. And Iran's new \n     missiles are based in part on Soviet SS-4 strategic rockets.\n       Iran, whose leaders have chanted ``Death to America,'' is \n     believed to be less than a year away from test-firing a \n     ballistic missile, the Shahab-3, and is developing more \n     powerful versions. ``The deployment of these missiles, using \n     just conventional warheads with modern guidance, adds a giant \n     measure to Iran's ability to blackmail allies of the United \n     States,'' says former CIA director R. James Woolsey.\n       But the threat goes even further. The CIA states that Iran \n     is also developing chemical, biological and even nuclear \n     weapons. This, from a regime that the State Department has \n     labeled a terrorist threat.\n\n\n                         A Growing Partnership\n\n       After Islamic radicals overthrew the Shah of Iran and \n     seized the U.S. embassy in 1979, Washington slapped an arms \n     embargo on Iran. Undaunted, Iran conducted an international \n     campaign of assassinations and terrorism, pursued a \n     clandestine nuclear-weapons program and waged a bitter war \n     with neighboring Iraq (1980-88).\n       In that war, Iran launched missiles bought from North Korea \n     or assembled from parts made in China. When the U.S.S.R. \n     collapsed, Teheran began shopping in the huge arms \n     supermarket of the fledgling Russian Federation.\n       In a confidential meeting in Germany, Reader's Digest \n     interviewed an Iranian former intelligence officer who \n     confirmed Western intelligence reports that Russians began \n     working on Iran's long-range-missile projects in 1994. At \n     that time, Russian technicians visited the top-secret Iranian \n     Defense Technology and Science Research Center near Karaj, \n     50 miles northwest of Teheran, Iran subsequently began \n     receiving assistance from Russia's state-run missile\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\n     plants and technical universities. Russian advisers worked \n     at Iran's missile plants in Esfahan and Semnan, as well as \n     at design centers in Sultanatabad, Lavizan and Kuh-e Bagh-\n     e-Melli on the outskirts of the capital.\n       ``After that, Iran's missile program jelled,'' says Patrick \n     Clawson, an Iran analyst at the National Defense University \n     in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n                       the United States in range\n\n       With Russian help, Iran is working to field two families of \n     missiles in the near future. The Shahab-3 is the closest to \n     deployment. It will carry 1,650 pounds of explosives at least \n     800 miles--allowing Iran, for the first time, to hit every \n     major city in Israel, including Jerusalem. It would also \n     reach vital Persian Gulf oil fields--and the bases in Saudi \n     Arabia and Turkey where American forces are serving. A \n     Shahab-3 carrying the anthrax germ could kill millions.\n       Intelligence sources say that a number of engine tests for \n     the Shahab-3 have been observed, and that development will be \n     completed in early 1999, with production soon after. A senior \n     White House official told Reader's Digest that the United \n     States now believes Iran has most of what it needs to mass-\n     produce the Shahab-3. ``It may already be too late to stop \n     them,'' he said.\n       An even more powerful missile in development, the Shahab-4, \n     will carry a one-ton warhead 1,250 miles--making it capable \n     of devastating cities in countries as distance as Egypt. The \n     Russians are also helping a solid-fuel design team at the \n     Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group in Teheran develop a 2,800-\n     mile missile, capable of reaching London and Paris, and a \n     6,300-mile missile that could strike cities in the eastern \n     United States.\n\n\n                          diplomatic stonewall\n\n       At high-level meetings with Russian officials, including \n     President Yeltsin himself, the United States has repeatedly \n     expressed concern over Russian arms sales to rogue nations \n     such as Iran. But when Vice President Al Gore pressed Russian \n     Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on February 6, 1997, Gore \n     received a categorical denial.\n       Two months later, in April, Iran tested a new missile \n     engine. After analyzing the evidence, U.S. officials \n     concluded that the Russians had transferred technology from \n     SS-4 rockets to Iran--a clear violation of the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime that Russia signed in 1995. It also \n     violates the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, \n     in which the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to \n     destroy all such missiles, including the SS-4.\n       Yet each time the United States presented new evidence of \n     Russian assistance to Iran's long-range-missile program, \n     Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials \n     denied that this was Russia's policy, ``While we appreciate \n     such assurances,'' State Department official Robert \n     Einhorn told the Senate last June, ``we remain disturbed \n     by the discrepancy between them and what reportedly is \n     occurring,''\n       In fact, U.S. and Western intelligence sources have \n     confirmed that several hundred Russian engineers and \n     technicians travel regularly to missile facilities outside \n     Teheran helping the Iranians draw up missile-production \n     blueprints. Russia may have transferred to Iran a \n     supercomputer made by a U.S. company to complete the work. \n     And when the Iranians run into technical snags, they fly to \n     top-secret military institutes in Russia to see how the \n     Russians solved similar problems.\n       ``This is not a private operation by some crazy \n     engineers,'' an Israeli official told Reader's Digest in an \n     interview in Tel Aviv. ``The contracts [to assist Iran's \n     missile program] have been signed by companies that are at \n     least partially owned by the Russian government.''\n       Last July President Clinton assigned veteran diplomat Frank \n     Wisner to conduct a joint investigation with the Russians \n     into the missile allegations. His Russian counterpart was \n     Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, which \n     intelligence sources say is aiding in Iran's missile program. \n     (Koptev denies such involvement.)\n       Talks on Russian-technology transfers to Iran continue. \n     Meanwhile, Russian technicians still travel to Iran, and \n     shipments of missile components continue to reach Iran.\n       ``It must be made clear that doing business with our \n     enemies will cost them if they want to do business with us,'' \n     former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz says of \n     the Russians.\n       U.S. laws require the President to impose sanctions on \n     countries that assist certain nations in building ballistic \n     missiles and nuclear weapons. But the Administration has \n     refused to invoke sanctions, including those in a law co-\n     authored in 1992 by then-Senator Gore and Sen. John McCain \n     (R., Ariz.). Now Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.) and Trent \n     Lott (R., Miss.) have introduced new legislation with \n     sanctions that could involve:\n       Russia's space program. The United States is pumping $140 \n     million a year and invaluable expertise into Russia's space \n     program. This aid could be stopped.\n       U.S. contracts. Russian companies working in Iran have some \n     $2.5 billion in contracts with the U.S. government and U.S. \n     defense contractors. The United States could bar them from \n     American business.\n       High-tech exports. Russian firms in Iran have been buying \n     advanced U.S. technology. Such high-tech exports could be \n     barred.\n       In addition to these sanctions, the United States could \n     step up assistance to Israel's Arrow antimissile program to \n     ensure that Israel will have adequate defenses by the time \n     the Iranian missile go into production, possibly in 1999.\n       The United States could also increase pressure on Teheran. \n     Instead, the Clinton Administration has been seeking to open \n     a ``dialogue'' with the Iranians, a gesture interpreted by \n     some of Teheran's ruling clerics as a sign of American \n     weakness.\n       Some American leaders are determined to send a different, \n     stronger message, not only to Teheran but to Moscow as well. \n     ``Russia's transfer of missile technology to Iran is an issue \n     of enormous national security importance to the United States \n     and its allies,'' warns Senator McCain. ``It threatens to \n     further destabilize the region--and risks undercutting U.S.-\n     Russian relations.''\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friend from Michigan has 90 minutes on \nhis amendment. I wonder, in order that we can--we have been able to \nallocate time and I want to make sure that everyone who speaks to our \nposition gets a chance to--whether or not he would be willing to yield \noff the 90 minutes 4 minutes to our friend from North Carolina.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from North Carolina requested 6 minutes. I \nwould be happy to yield 6 minutes to my friend from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from North \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senators from Michigan \nand Delaware. I will stay within the 6 minutes.\n  Madam President, I strongly support H.R. 2709. I come to the floor, \nhowever, rather worried about the administration's decision last week \nto waive sanctions against a French energy company that is doing a \nmassive billion-dollar oil deal with Iran. The President's decision to \nwaive imposed sanctions on the French energy company was done under the \nguise of national security. I have to wonder, and we all wonder, whose \nnational security is he referring to when he chooses to waive the \nsanctions? Certainly, it is not the national security interests of the \nUnited States for Iran to improve its oil-exporting capability so that \nit can turn around and then use the same money to fund missile \ndevelopment. I certainly can't believe it is in the best interests of \nthe State of Israel to have Iran improving its foreign cash reserves \nfor the very same reasons.\n  Iran is improving its cash reserves, and they are improving their \nmissile technology. Just in January of this year, the CIA told the \nSenate that Iran would be able to target ballistic missiles at Israel \nmuch sooner than the 10 years that we had previously been led to \nbelieve. So, therefore, I have to conclude that he made this decision \nin the national interest of France and Russia. I think that is a very \npoor reason to make a decision of this magnitude.\n  Here we go again. We are passing a good bill to impose sanctions on \nindividuals who transfer missile technology to Iran. But section 105 of \nthe bill permits a waiver based on the national security interests of \nthe United States. The part that concerns me is the waiver. I am \nconcerned about how the President has interpreted this in the other \nIranian sanction bills. I think there should be no waiver. I do not \ntrust the President's decision on waivers. Given that Israel was the \nonly sovereign state, outside Kuwait, that was attacked by Iraq during \nthe gulf war as they were attacked by missiles, I think there should be \nlanguage in this bill and in the Iranian-Libyan section that mandates \nconsultation with Israel before we choose to waive any sanctions for \nmissile production or oil production. I think we owe it to our \nfriends--the true friends in the Mideast--the Israelis.\n  I hope that such legislation wouldn't be necessary and that the \nPresident would be more frugal in his actions.\n  So I plan to introduce this as freestanding legislation. I hope we \ncould consider this sometime in the very near future. We should be \nconsulting with Israel before making decisions affecting their \ninterests, just as much so, and more so, than we should be with Russia \nand France. Israel is a country that is most threatened by missile \nproduction by rogue states like Iran and Libya.\n  I know there are some who think the Iranian regime is moderating \nitself. I personally don't think they are. But even if they are, I \ndon't think that we should be lulled into a sense that we\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\nhave turned the corner in our relations with Iran. They only respect \nthe United States for its power. They simply laugh at us when we are \nweak. They take the President's waiver as a sign of weakness--not as a \ngesture of improved relations.\n  The Mideast is still an extremely volatile area. The United States is \nat its best when we stand behind our true ally, the Israelis, as they \nhave been our true ally. They have been our sea anchor in a turbulent \npart of the world. We should negotiate from a position of strength--not \nwhen we accommodate murderers and terrorists who pretend to be \ngovernment figures. We should be supporting our true ally in the \nMideast. Again, I strongly support the legislation.\n\n  I yield the remainder of the time, and I thank the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, up to the time I have allotted to me.\n  I was asked by someone yesterday after a meeting at the White House \non this issue, What did I think about this sanctions act? And I said: \n``Good act, bad timing.'' Good act, bad timing.\n  The extent to which this act that we are about to vote on, this \nsanctions bill, is of value is a little like nuclear weapons: Their \nvalue is in their nonuse; their value is in their threat of use.\n  The administration has made significant progress over the 6 months we \ngave them with the threat of this bill in place. It has had the best of \nall worlds. It has allowed those in Russia who very desperately want to \ncut off this program and this relationship with Iran the ability to \nsay, ``we must do this or we will lose much more than we will gain,'' \nwithout having to put themselves in a position politically in their own \ncountry in which they appear to be publicly buckling to the pressure \napplied by the United States.\n  So, although I have no disagreement with the principle of H.R. 2709, \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997, and I have no \ndoubt that it addresses an urgent concern we cannot ignore, I have a \ngreat deal of doubt about whether we should be voting for it now and \nsending it to the President now.\n  Madam President, to state the obvious, the cold war is over. One of \nthe great wonders of it is that the world was spared any use of nuclear \nweapons during that cold war, and almost--almost--any use of chemical \nor biological weapons. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nand the means to deliver them, however, could bring about the very \nholocaust that we have managed to avoid over the past 50 years.\n  So, everyone here is united in one objective: to stop, inhibit, \ncurtail the proliferation of weapons or the means of delivering those \nweapons. How do we best do that? Is the best way to do that, relative \nto Iran's missile program, to impose these sanctions now? Will this \nbill, by its passage, finally turn off the last few drops of water \ncoming out of that spigot? Or will it enhance the prospect that the \ncooperation with Iran--which began years ago and has continued in \ndiminishing amounts up to now--will be increased, reversing the \nmomentum of the last 6 months?\n  It seems to me, as rational persons--and we all are, obviously, on \nthis--we have to examine that question. For me, the instinct to punish \nRussia for what they did in the past is overtaken by my fear that the \nproliferation will increase. To the extent that I have a disagreement \nwith my friend from Connecticut or my friend from Arizona, two of the \nbrightest people in this body, it relates to how I come down on that \nquestion.\n  One or another country may think it needs these weapons to protect it \nfrom its neighbors or gain the attention of the great powers. The fact \nis, however, that weapons of mass destruction threaten us all, \nespecially when the countries that seek them are ruled by murderous \ndespots or inflamed by ethnic or ideological causes.\n  Today, two sets of neighboring countries--India and Pakistan, and \nIran and Iraq--pose the greatest threat that weapons of mass \ndestruction might actually be used. India and Pakistan have to be \nrestrained from using such weapons against each other. I was reminded \nby someone today, we are talking about a response time of 3 minutes--3 \nminutes; a pretty short leash, quite a hair trigger--when we are \ntalking about Pakistan and India. The same would apply to Iraq and \nIran, who have managed over the last decades to kill hundreds of \nthousands of each other's citizens. So these two sets of neighbors--\nIndia and Pakistan, Iran and Iraq--it seems to me, are most likely to \nget the world in trouble. Iran and Iraq have to be prevented from \nobtaining such weapons and from using them, not only against each other \nbut also against the whole Middle East region, if not the world.\n  Some foreign entities, notably Russia, have continued to assist \nIran's ballistic missile program intended to give Iran long-range \nability to deliver weapons of mass destruction. This assistance must \nstop, and it must stop now.\n  Since early last year, U.S. officials from the Clinton \nadministration, including the President and the Vice President, have \nraised the matter with their Russian counterparts, Yeltsin, \nChernomyrdin, and Kiriyenko. They have all agreed it is hardly in \nRussia's interests to give Iran the capacity to fire long-range \nmissiles with weapons of mass destruction. Special envoys Frank Wisner \nand Robert Gallucci have worked with Russian Space Agency chief Yuri \nKoptev to help Russia determine what it must do to stem this \nassistance.\n  Let us get a little background here, because we all kind of mentioned \nit. Here you have a former empire that has crumbled around the ears of \nRussian leaders. They are left with a number of the old apparatchiks in \ncharge of huge, bureaucratic entities, departments, who have, off and \non for the last 9 years, been free agents to some degree or another.\n  The idea that Yeltsin has his finger on, and knowledge about, and the \nability to control every one of his disparate agencies out there is, I \nthink we would all acknowledge, not nearly, nearly a reality. So, since \nearly last year, American officials have been working very hard, \npressuring, cajoling, and educating the Russian leadership as to why \nthis is against the Russian leaders' own interests and how to gain \ncontrol, how to gain control of their own entities.\n  There is an irony here. If we said to our constituents that there is \nthis outfit in Russia that doesn't control what is happening in a \ndepartment in one of the six nuclear cities in Russia, or doesn't have \ncontrol over a department in Moscow, they would say: ``Wait a minute, \nisn't this the same outfit that ruled with the iron fist, so that they \nwould be able to not only have a command economy, but to command \neverything?'' But the fact is, the Russian leaders do not have that \nability any more. And they do not know how to gain it.\n  So I start off with the proposition that this is a very different \ncircumstance than if we were dealing with the U.S.S.R. and this program \nwere going on. If I were to have turned to even Gorbachev, or any of \nhis predecessors, and said, ``you are transferring this technology to \nIran,'' and had them say, ``we didn't know that, or were unaware of the \nextent of it,'' having been here 25 years and dealt with them on that \nissue for 15 years, I would have said unequivocally on this floor, \n``that is flatout a lie; they cannot not know that.''\n  But it is clear that, although much was known in some quarters, a lot \nwas not known. So you actually have the Russian leadership saying, \n``How do we set up export controls? How do we gain control? You have \nbeen doing this. How do you all do it?'' --we have not done it \nperfectly, by the way, but--``How do you do it?''\n  The fact is that troubling aspects of the Russian assistance to Iran \nprogram continue to this very day. I know that. All of us on this floor \nhave gotten a briefing. We know that. And with each passing day, Iran \ncomes closer to obtaining the ability to have long-range missiles that \ncan rain down chemical or biological destruction on Israel, Saudi \nArabia, and U.S. Armed Forces in the region, and, obviously, to \nunderstate it, that is a real problem.\n  So, what do you do about this? The executive branch, in my view, has \nmade real progress, important progress, that this bill before us, I \nbelieve, will sacrifice. Let me give you a few examples.\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\n  Last year, Russia expelled an Iranian Embassy employee who was \ninvolved in seeking assistance for Iran's missile program. Russia's \nFederal Security Service, the FSB, says that Russia also deported a \nmember of an Iranian military delegation.\n  The FSB adds, in a statement of May 15, that two officials at a \nRussian research center were arrested, convicted, and sentenced to \nprison for trying to ``enter into an agreement with a foreign firm to \ndesign homing electronic devices for missiles.''\n  They also foiled an effort by Iran's SANAM industry group, to get \nmissile parts from a Russian firm, NPO Trud. The FSB statement also \nadds that, ``All the activities of the SANAM group on the territory of \nRussia have been terminated and prohibited.''\n  On January 22, Russia issued Order No. 57 establishing what are \ncalled ``catch-all controls'' over the export of any material or \ntechnology that might contribute to Iran's programs to develop weapons \nof mass destruction or long-range missiles.\n  Last week, Russia promulgated implementing directives for that order \nrequiring that each entity involved in high-tech material or technology \nexports set up a review committee to screen proposals and specifying \n``red flags'' that would require referral of proposals to high-level \nofficials for approval. Those ``red flags'' are precisely the sort of \ncriteria that we would want Russia to use. For example, they name \ncertain Iranian entities that are automatically suspect no matter what \nthey want to buy. That is a take-no-chances approach that suggests the \nseriousness on the part of Russia.\n  The pace of diplomacy is slow, Madam President, and so is the pace of \nRussian bureaucracy, and so is the pace of putting together a Russian \nGovernment that can control Russia. I understand and share the \nfrustration that my colleagues feel in this regard. But, as the kids \nsay, let's get real. When was the last time we turned Russian policy \ncompletely around, and how long did it take?\n  When we didn't like the Soviet Union deploying SS-20 intermediate-\nrange missiles in the European theater, we had to build and deploy \nPershing missiles in response before they would sign the Intermediate \nNuclear Forces Treaty. The process took 10 years. It took a similar \nperiod of time for the Soviet Union, later Russia, to admit it was \nviolating the ABM Treaty in building a large phased-array radar near \nKrasnoyarsk. And there are a lot of other examples of how long this \ntakes.\n  My colleagues will say the assistance continues, that these \ninstitutions and firms are just looking for ways to get around Order \nNo. 57, and that there are still bureaucracies that oppose Yeltsin and \nKiriyenko on this issue; and I will reply, ``Yup, you're right, that's \nexactly what has happened.''\n  What on Earth does anybody expect? Do my colleagues expect Russian \nofficials to be grateful when we catch them doing something stupid and \ncall them on it? Do they expect the institutes, that cannot pay for \ntheir personnel, or their factories that pay their workers in goods to \nbarter on the market, to be happy when we tell them that they have to \nturn down hard currency from Iran?\n  Look, we have a satellite industry that is apoplectic today--an \nAmerican satellite industry that is apoplectic today--because the House \ntook action and the Senate may take action curtailing their ability to \nlaunch these satellites into space from other launch systems around the \nworld. Why? They are going to lose billions of dollars. Mark my word, \nyou are going to start hearing from their employees saying, ``What have \nyou done to my job?'' Right? We all know that. We shouldn't yield to \nthe company or the employee if it is against the national interest, but \nwe are going to hear it.\n  What would happen, do you think, if all of a sudden we were to say, \n``By the way, stop doing'' such and such, which is the only thing that \nallows you to make any money at all, to even be given goods you can \nbarter on the street to keep your apartment? I don't say this by way of \njustifying anything Russia is doing, but there is a report from an \norganization I have great respect for, the American Jewish Committee. \nThe American Jewish Committee had a report written called ``The Russian \nConnection: Russia, Iran, the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction.'' It is a very good report. I recommend it to everyone.\n  They point to an article that was written in Russia about missile \nspecialists who worked in Iran during the past few years. It says that \nspecialists were recruited by Iranians in collaboration with the \nFederal Security Service--which is now going to be part of stopping \nthis.\n  Then the article goes on to say that the policy of assisting the \nmissile program began in 1994, when the then-chief of Yeltsin's \nbodyguard service was involved in export policymaking, and that it was \ndone--for what? For hard currency, for money.\n  Now we have convinced Yeltsin and a new government in Russia--which \nis probably the most pro-American government that has existed in the \nlast 90 years in Russia, maybe in Russian history--we have them taking \nall these steps to cut this off. OK? So far, so good.\n  The American Jewish Committee report points out that the reason they \ndid this was for money. Now we go ahead and we cut off any money that \nwe are going to send these Russian entities in existing bilateral \narrangements we have. What do we think Russian leaders are going to do? \nAre they going to say, ``You know, we now lost the American support \nthat we, the new Government in Russia, want, and we don't want to be \nselling this missile technology anyway because it is against our \ninterest, so at least we could have told the folks in those departments \nthat there was something coming, but the Americans are going to cut off \nthat money, we're not going to get that, but, by the way, still don't \nfollow through on this Iranian program?''\n  It is lose-lose. They not only lose the money that encouraged them to \nenter into these arrangements in 1994, because of our efforts to stop \nit and because they were not quick enough and thorough enough in \nstopping it, they have now lost any other aid they have.\n  Again, I am not approaching this from an ideological point of view. I \nam not approaching this from a point of view of who is right or who is \nwrong, whether they did the right thing or the wrong thing. I am trying \nto approach this from a practical point of view: How do we assure that \nwhat was going on doesn't continue? How do we stop proliferation?\n  This same report published by the American Jewish Committee makes a \nvery, very important point in a section entitled ``American Policy \nOptions.''\n  It says:\n\n       The United States faces tough choices in addressing the \n     issue of Russian-Iranian missile cooperation. Both the \n     Clinton administration and its critics confront the fact that \n     American leverage is probably limited.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       However, the threat of sanctions will not in itself be \n     sufficient. The threat of missile proliferation is serious \n     enough to warrant offering improved carrots.\n\n  Let's get this straight. Everybody has kind of figured this out--\nlet's review the bidding.\n  The Russians were bad guys. They sold technologies to people who were \neven worse guys. The combination of that is against the interests of \nthe United States, and particularly against the interests of Israel. We \nhave to turn it around and stop it.\n  We went ahead, and after the last couple years--with great pressure \nduring this year, thanks to congressional leadership having the \nsanctions sitting out on the table--convinced Yeltsin, and now the \nfriendliest government that ever existed in Russian history toward the \nUnited States, the two new young guys in positions of power, not only \nthat it is against their interests, but also that they better stop. And \nthere is some evidence they are stopping it.\n  They are finding where at least some of the technology leaks are and \nthey are turning them off. And now here we are after they had begun the \nprocess saying, ``Aha, but you did do it.'' Of course they did it. And \nwhat we're going to do is to say, ``we're going to cut your water off \nfrom this end of the spigot. We're going to cut it off.''\n  And if the objective is America's interest and indirectly Israel's \ninterest, which is an American interest, how does that make sense? Let \nme add one other dimension here.\n  I said: ``This is a good act, bad timing.'' Let us review the bidding \nand\n\n[[Page S5378]]\n\nwhat is going on in the Asian subcontinent right now. Regarding India \nand Pakistan, we are breaking our neck, some of us on this floor \npersonally, the President, Democrats, Republicans, pleading, cajoling, \ndoing everything we can with Pakistan not to up the ante. We are doing \neverything we can to take an Indian Government that has overstepped its \nbounds against its good judgment, in my view, and say, ``Tone down what \nyou're doing.'' We are trying to put a lid on this.\n  So what are we doing? Some of us, as well as the administration, are \ndoing everything from picking up the phone and calling Sharif in \nPakistan, to saying, through the administration, to Yeltsin, ``You, \nYeltsin, have a relationship with India. Call them. Tell them. \nCooperate with us.''\n  Every Republican and Democrat who has any contact in China is trying \nto get China to put pressure on Pakistan. And in the middle of this \ngigantic effort, that is literally worldwide, at a moment when every \nnation in the world, particularly the nuclear powers, fully understands \nthe potential consequence of Pakistan's nuclear testing now and India's \nheated rhetoric--now, when all this is going on--what are we doing?\n  In fairness to the leader, this was under a unanimous consent \nagreement, and put off from back in November, but what are we doing? We \nare coming along invoking a sanction potentially that is going to make \nit more difficult by anybody's standard to get worldwide cooperation.\n  Who are the nations that can most influence Pakistan or most \ninfluence India right now, beyond the United States? I will bet that if \nwe ask all the staff in the back who are experts on this--whether they \nare for these sanctions or against them--I bet that if we asked \neverybody in this Chamber, and I put a list on the board saying, \n``Which are the most likely countries to be able to influence \nPakistan,'' and put Russia, France, Germany, England and China--I bet \nyou would all pass the test and say, ``China.'' And why would you say \nthat? Because China has been selling them missile technology.\n  Now, I wonder who would have the most influence on India. The answer \nis Russia, for similar reasons. So thus it seems to me, Madam \nPresident, that this is a good idea at a very bad moment.\n  We also have a new government in Russia. We have two young people--\nand every analyst to whom I have spoken, conservative or liberal, \nDemocrat or Republican, or who has testified before the committee or \nspoken to my staff has said, ``These two new guys are keepers. They're \nthe best shot we have.'' They are the best shot we have. Now they have \ngone out and put their new, fragile reputations on the line in that new \ngovernment, and said, with regard to assistance to Iran's missile \nprogram, ``Shut it down.'' And the first bit of reward we are going to \ngive them is sanctions against entities in their country.\n\n  Now, look, some former President, whom I will not name, once said, \n``Life is not fair.'' I am not suggesting to anybody that it would not \nbe fair to impose these sanctions. By any measure, it is fair, because \nthey did not play by the rules. They broke the agreements. So it is \nfair; but is it smart? Is it in our interests? Is it a good idea? In my \nhumble opinion, the answer is no, it is not smart, it is not a good \nidea, it is not in our interest. The sanctions we mandate will be \nresented and they will be resisted and, in my sincere view, they will \nfail where diplomacy is succeeding.\n  Some aspects of this bill seem calculated to anger Russia rather than \nto secure compliance. One is the ``credible evidence'' standard for \nsanctions. According to the report on this bill, the standard is meant \nto require sanctions when information is merely ``sufficiently \nbelievable as to raise a serious question * * * as to whether a foreign \nperson may have transferred or attempted to transfer'' sanctionable \nitems of technology.\n  This is kind of the ``shoot first, ask questions later'' approach to \ninternational relations. This is cold-war posturing in a warmer \nenvironment, with the friendliest government we have ever had an \nopportunity to work with, and it will likely fail.\n  Fortunately, our action today is not the end of the process. The \nPresident is very likely--very likely--to veto this bill. And if we \nhave the amendment of the Senator from Michigan accepted, which I \nexpect it to be, we will have to go back to conference.\n  And I say to you, Madam President, and to my colleagues, that I hope \nRussian officials and firms that follow this debate will hear the \nmessage my colleagues are sending. If Russian assistance to the Iranian \nmissile program does not cease within a matter of weeks, I truly \nbelieve that this body will override the President's veto and set in \nstone this counterproductive sanctions bill.\n  I also say to my friends who believe that this sanctions bill is \nwarranted on the merits, if you just do it based on weighing the \nscales, that you are giving up nothing by delaying here. Can anyone \nshow me that there has not been real progress over the last 6 months?\n  So if in 2 weeks or 6 weeks or 8 weeks this progress has not \ncontinued, this sanctions bill can be brought back up. But to pass it \nnow, I honestly believe, will be counterproductive.\n  Russia's legal and administrative actions so far, while insufficient, \nshow their good intent. There is also a strong foundation on which to \nbuild. But the edifice of enforcement must be built quickly. Only \nspeedy Russian action is likely to avert the sanctions regime mandated \nin this bill.\n  In closing, let me note my deep objection to the other body's \ninsistence upon attaching the Chemical Weapons Convention \nImplementation Act to this measure. This is a practice that has to \nstop. It is irresponsible, absolutely irresponsible, in my view. \nCombining the two bills, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation \nAct and the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, both of which \nshould be sent over here-- I am not suggesting that they shouldn't do \nthat--to tie them together in the hope that it will force the President \nto sign the bill is holding hostages that relate to our national \ninterest as Americans.\n\n  They did the same thing with the IMF. They did the same thing with \nthe United Nations arrearages by attaching abortion language. Each of \nthese issues warrants debate, but not tied to one another. Attaching \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act to this bill serves \nmerely to delay for many months and to put at risk a bill that is \nimportant to our national interests. That was an irresponsible action, \nin my view, that ill-befits a coequal branch of government, the House \nof Representatives.\n\n\n          Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation--at Last\n\n  Mr. President, title two of the measure that we are passing today--\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1997--deserves \nsome attention. Final passage of this bill is long overdue. Its \nenactment, despite its flaws, will serve the national interest in very \nreal ways.\n  U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention last year was \nnot easily achieved. In the end, however, all the Democrats in this \nbody and most of our Republican colleagues joined to fashion a 74-26 \nmajority for ratification. Nearly one year ago, this body passed the \nimplementation bill that is once again before us.\n  Final passage of that act will serve our national interest in several \nways. First, it will enable the U.S. Government to require industry to \ncomply with the data declaration provisions of the convention. In \naddition, this law will provide protection to confidential business \ninformation that U.S. firms may be required to submit.\n  The filing of a complete national data declaration will finally put \nour country in compliance with this convention. That is no small \nmatter. Until then, the United States cannot exercise effective \nleadership in the organization for the prevention of chemical weapons--\nthe implementing body for the convention. And make no mistake: It will \nbe U.S. leadership that guides the organization toward effective \nverification and enforcement of compliance with this convention.\n  The United States has a tremendous stake in enforcement of the \nChemical Weapons Convention. Our interests are world-wide, and U.S. \ntroops are often stationed in far-flung locations. Wherever U.S. forces \ngo, they will be far safer if chemical weapons are removed as a \nmilitary threat.\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\n  In its first half year since entering into force, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention has already had some successes. China, India, and \nseveral other countries have admitted for the first time to having \nchemical weapons programs. The weapons and weapons facilities that they \ndeclared have been inspected and will eventually be destroyed. The \ninformation that they have provided will enhance our ability, moreover, \nto monitor their chemical establishments and to search out any \nsuspicious activities.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention has also taken some important steps \ntoward universality. Both India and Pakistan have joined; China has \njoined; Russia has joined; and even Iran has joined.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act embodies \ncompromises between treaty supporters and treaty opponents. I supported \nthis compromise bill last year because it was important then--as it is \nnow--to facilitate U.S. compliance with the convention. I support it \ntoday for that reason and because the administration has assured us \nthat it is more important to enact this measure than to spend more time \ncorrecting the faults in it.\n  Let me make clear, however, that I still have very serious concerns \nabout the impact of some of this bill's provisions on implementation of \nthe convention.\n  In particular, I do not believe we should be granting the President \ndiscretionary authority to deny an inspection based on national \nsecurity grounds, as would be done by section 237. By signing and \nratifying this treaty, the United States--with the advice and consent \nof 74 members of this body--agreed to allow certain inspections, \nsubject to our constitutional requirements. With few exceptions, denial \nof a duly authorized inspection would violate the convention.\n\n  Even if the President never exercises this authority, the mere \ninclusion of this provision in the legislation will encourage other \ncountries to deny inspections on national security grounds. If we \nshould enact the so-called ``national security exception,'' we can be \nsure that China, Iran, and other countries will seize upon the \nprecedent we set and use it to undermine the effectiveness of the \nverification regime.\n  I have similar concerns regarding section 253, which would exempt \nfrom reporting and routine inspection requirements unscheduled discrete \norganic chemicals that are coincidental byproducts and are not isolated \nor captured for use or sale. While waste streams are not, in \nthemselves, a threat to the object and purpose of the chemical weapons \nconvention regime, monitoring of such streams does afford one of the \nmost convenient and non-intrusive means of determining whether a \nfacility is worthy of concern in the first place.\n  I am also troubled by:\n  The broad compensation scheme in section 213 that does not even \nrequire a plaintiff to prove its case by a preponderance of the \nevidence in order to receive taxpayer funded compensation for the loss \nof trade secrets; and the limitation in sections 212 and 238 on the \nGovernment's power to require contractors to submit to inspections.\n  Finally, I regret that this legislation does not undo the damage to \nour national security that I fear will be caused by condition 18 to the \nresolution of ratification for the convention. That condition provides \nthat no chemical sample taken by the international inspectors may be \nremoved from the United States for analysis. While it may offer some \nfurther protection to U.S. manufacturers against possible industrial \nespionage, it also opens a huge loophole for countries that may violate \nthis convention.\n  I firmly believe that the convention's provisions and the other \nconditions to our resolution of ratification provide sufficient \nprotection for the confidential business information of U.S. firms. \nIndeed, insistence upon U.S.-based analysis of U.S. samples will \nactually make it easier for foreign spies to obtain that information, \nby effectively specifying the laboratories for them to target. And I \ndread the stain upon our collective conscience if a future violator of \nthis treaty should ever make use of the exemption we are carving out, \nand then use those illegal chemical weapons against U.S. forces or \ninnocent civilians.\n  Opponents of the convention insisted upon condition 18, arguing that \nno good would ever come from on-site inspections anyway. I hope and \nbelieve that they will come to realize the error of their ways and will \naccept the need to make this treaty as effective an instrument as \npossible. Strict verification is crucial to making sure that Iran, \nChina, and other countries with undeclared or formerly undeclared \nchemical weapons programs are given as little an opportunity as \npossible to hide illegal weapons stocks or production.\n  That said, however, final passage of this act is still an important \naccomplishment. By facilitating U.S. compliance and leadership, it \nopens the door to further success in the campaign to rid the world of \none of its most heinous inventions.\n  Mr. President, I now close with a statement that addresses the \n``carrots'' that the American Jewish Committee report calls for and \nthat sets forth some proposals in that area.\n\n\n        Non-Proliferation: An Ounce of Prevention Is Not Enough\n\n  As we near the end of the 1990's, there can be no doubt that future \nhistorians will highlight this time as the decade in which the Cold War \nwas ended and the Soviet Union was dissolved. Even so far-reaching an \naction as the enlargement of NATO, to which this body recently gave its \nconsent, will be seen largely as an outgrowth of the cataclysmic \nchanges in Moscow that upended the bipolar structure of post-World War \nII international relations.\n  How else will historians characterize this decade? Will we be seen as \nhaving turned to peace? Or will historians say that we turned merely to \nfurther war in a new context?\n  The Good Friday Agreement offers hope for peace in Northern Ireland. \nThe Oslo Agreement and related efforts in the Middle East offer hope \nfor peace in that region as well, despite the many obstacles that still \nlitter that path. The Dayton Accords offer similar hope for Bosnia and, \nindeed, for the Balkans as a whole.\n  The wars and massacres in Africa are another matter. We are trying to \ncreate new structures to prevent or control such conflict, but our \nfailure to avert millions of deaths in central Africa will lead future \ngenerations to remark on how poorly we had learned the lessons of the \nfirst holocaust.\n\n\n               The Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n  The final judgment on this decade may well hinge, however, on how we \nhandle the threat of other holocausts--those made possible by weapons \nof mass destruction. The potential for such horrific acts may well have \nbeen increased by the end of the Cold War. And a failure to contain \nthat risk could radically alter the judgment of history, assuming that \nanyone survives to write it.\n  Weapons of mass destruction pre-date the Cold War. In the 1760's, \nEngland used primitive biological warfare to kill American Indians in \nPontiac's Rebellion. Chemical weapons were used in World War I. And the \ntwo atomic bombs that helped to end World War II demonstrated mankind's \nability to bring about the apocalypse in the blink of an eye.\n  During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union amassed \nby far the largest stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction ever seen. \nExperts will argue over whether the use of all those weapons would have \ncaused a ``nuclear winter'' that would end all human existence. There \nis little doubt, however, that the resulting human, economic and \nenvironmental devastation would have destroyed our modern civilization.\n  The great irony of the Cold War, however, was that the tight \nleadership of two blocs by the United States and the Soviet Union kept \nnearly all of this Armageddon arsenal under their firm control. There \nwere a few cases in which chemical weapons were used. By and large, \nhowever, the terror of ``Mutually Assured Destruction'' kept the \nnations of the world inline and prevented any descent into the abyss of \nall-out war.\n  The end of the Cold War has reduced dramatically the risk of a \nnuclear holocaust sparked by war between the United States and Russia. \nStrategic arms reductions under the START Treaty have begun the process \nof stepping back from the brink. Russia will\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\neventually ratify START II, and I think we can look forward, in the \ncoming years, at least to START III as well. The CFE Treaty continues \nto regulate conventional weapons in Europe, moreover, so as to limit \nthe risk of hostilities that could spark a larger conflict.\n  There has also been progress on chemical and biological weapons. \nRussia has joined us as a State Party to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and will destroy at least 40,000 metric tons of \nchemical agent. President Yeltsin admitted that Russia had violated the \nBiological Weapons Convention and ordered an end to Russia s offensive \nbiological weapons program. We still lack confidence that Russia is not \nhiding some illegal chemical or biological weapons or weapons \ncapabilities, but the trend is toward a day in which no massive \ncapability of that sort will remain.\n\n  The greatest risk that is not yet contained is that some other \ncountry, or even a terrorist group, might use these horrendous weapons. \nWhile such countries and groups are unlikely to unleash a holocaust, \nthe scale of destruction they could cause would still be astounding--\nand our own cities or bases could well be their targets.\n  Rogue states and criminals have tried to get Russian and former \nSoviet nuclear weapons material and technology during this decade, \nalthough with little success. Countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria \nhave had better success gaining Russian and/or Chinese chemical weapons \ntechnology and material (including equipment and precursor chemicals), \nbiological weapons material (including production equipment), and \nballistic missiles or missile technology.\n  These transfers of weapons and technology have taken a toll on \nregional stability. India and Pakistan now threaten each other with \nballistic missiles, and India's recent nuclear tests could lead \nPakistan to test as well. It was hard enough to maintain the ``balance \nof terror'' between the United States and the Soviet Union. Can India \nand Pakistan maintain that balance without descending into war, with \ntheir history of border wars and bloody terrorist incidents? I hope \nthey can avoid a regional holocaust; but clearly, the risk of that is \nreal.\n  Russia, China, North Korea, and various Western companies have \ncontributed to India and Pakistan's missile and nuclear weapon \nprograms. There has been a profit motive in those deals, as well as \nsupposed security interests on the part of China and Russia.\n  But how valuable are company profits, or foreign exchange for North \nKorea, if the result is nuclear war? Where is the security for China if \nradioactive clouds should pass over its territory as its neighbors \ndescend into chaos?\n  The same questions apply to those who would assist Iran or Iraq to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. Will the paltry profits in \nassisting Iran's ballistic missile programs really matter if Iran can \nattack Russia and its neighbors with chemical weapons? Do the Russians \nreally think that Saddam Hussein can be trusted with fermenters that \ncould be used to produce biological weapons? Will China really benefit \nif its assistance to Iran should put weapons of mass destruction in the \nhands of a regime that sympathizes less with Beijing than with Islamic \nethnic groups in western China?\n  Russia and China are both great powers. But you have to wonder, \nsometimes, what they are thinking. And you really have to wonder when \nNorth Korea will realize that ballistic missile exports to unstable \ncountries won't do much for a people already reduced to eating tree \nbark.\n\n\n                  An Ounce of Prevention Is Not Enough\n\n  What should the United States be doing to stop the spread of long-\nrange missiles and weapons of mass destruction? The short answer is: a \nlot more than we're doing now.\n  I don t say that to denigrate current U.S. programs or the U.S. \ncommitment to non-proliferation. No great power is as active as we in \ntrying to prevent proliferation. Nobody has as many programs as we do \nto detect proliferation activities, to stop them, to pressure illegal \nbuyers and sellers, to develop military weapons and tactics for \noperations against sites with weapons of mass destruction, and to \nassist the former Soviet states, in particular, in safeguarding and \ndestroying dangerous material and in reorienting their military \nindustry to the civilian economy. We spend over $600 million a year on \nthe assistance programs alone.\n\n  But the fact is, my friends, that we are failing to do all that we \ncan to stop proliferation. Some of our failures are understandable. No \nintelligence system can detect everything, and we risk the loss of \nsensitive sources whenever we demarche a supplier country or let \nclassified information leak to the press. U.S. diplomacy cannot move \nevery supplier to stop every unwise shipment, and economic sanctions \nare a tool that succeeds only occasionally. India's recent nuclear \ntests, in the face of U.S. law that forced the President to impose \nmultiple sanctions, underscore the difficulty of stopping a state once \nit has substantial indigenous capabilities.\n  What ought to embarrass us, however, is that we are failing also to \ntake actions that we know are workable. Thus, we combined the threat of \nsanctions with a promise of economic incentives to freeze North Korea's \nnuclear weapons program. Can we not offer similar multi-national \nincentives to North Korea to stop exporting ballistic missile equipment \nand technology? Won't that be cheaper than battling No Dong missiles \naround the world?\n  Similarly, we are failing to reach most of the highly-trained \nscientists and technicians who developed weapons of mass destruction \nand ballistic missiles for the former Soviet Union. And that is no \nsmall problem! There are well over a hundred thousand such skilled \npersonnel who served the Soviet death machine at its peak. Anywhere \nfrom ten to fifty thousand personnel still have skills that a rogue \nstate or terrorist group would like to obtain, and are underpaid or \nunemployed today. That is not just a problem for those personnel. That \nis a powderkeg just waiting to explode!\n  What should we be doing about this? We should plug the holes in our \ncurrent non-proliferation assistance programs. We should endorse and \nbuild on the ``nuclear cities'' initiative that Vice President Gore and \nthen-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin began in March. We should make a \nspecial effort to assist Russia's biological warfare specialists who \nwant to cease working with dangerous pathogens. And we should consider \noutright subsidies to keep Russian arms experts busy on socially useful \nprojects.\n\n\n                      Improving Existing Programs\n\n  What are the holes in our current non-proliferation assistance \nprograms? Several non-proliferation assistance programs are managed by \nthe Departments of State, Defense and Energy. They provide vital \nassistance to help safeguard Russian nuclear weapons material, to \ndismantle Ukrainian long-range bombers, to support projects that could \nprovide commercial job opportunities for former weapons specialists, \nand occasionally for a one-time operation like purchasing Kazakhstan's \nnuclear material or Moldova's bombers.\n  One program that supports commercial initiatives in the former Soviet \nUnion is the Department of Energy's Initiatives for Proliferation \nPrevention (or IPP). The President's proposed Fiscal Year 1999 budget \nwould reduce that program's budget from $30 million to only $15 \nmillion. This is a short-sighted step at precisely the wrong time. \nUnder its new program manager, IPP is finally bringing projects to the \npoint of commercialization. Fifteen projects have achieved completely \ncommercial funding and 77 now have major private co-funding.\n  If the IPP budget for FY 1999 is reduced by $15 million, IPP will \nhave to cut back its new projects to find socially useful employment \nfor Russian chemical and biological weapons experts. Those weapons are \nwell within the reach of rogue states, as UNSCOM has documented in \nIraq. Do we really want to leave hundreds or thousands of Russian \nexperts underemployed, and thus vulnerable to offers from the likes of \nIran, Iraq, or Libya?\n\n  We must not cut back one of the few programs to combat the risk that \nRussian experts will sell critical material or expertise to those \nstates. Given its important objective and the increasing success of the \nIPP program, restoring the $15 million cut is truly the least we can \ndo.\n\n[[Page S5381]]\n\n  Another important non-proliferation tool is the Nonproliferation and \nDisarmament Fund, which is managed by the State Department. This fund \nhas been used for several urgent and sensitive non-proliferation \noperations over the years, including the purchase of unsecured highly \nenriched uranium from Kazakhstan. The flexibility that it affords \npolicy makers to take advantage of non-proliferation opportunities is a \nvital resource.\n  Recent operations have taken their toll, however, on the \nNonproliferation and Disarmament Fund's reserve. The Fund had a $12 \nmillion reserve at the beginning of Fiscal Year 1997, but only about $4 \nmillion by the beginning of FY 1998. Annual appropriations of $15 \nmillion, while welcome, give the Fund insufficient flexibility to truly \nfulfill its mission.\n  We need to increase our investment in the Nonproliferation and \nDisarmament Fund, either by establishing a higher annual funding level \nor at least by replenishing the Fund's reserve. Our nation has received \ngood value from the Fund in the past, and we should do what it takes to \nkeep the Fund healthy.\n  A third important program is the Energy Department's Material \nProtection, Control and Accounting (or MPC & A) program, which has been \nupgrading security at Russia's nuclear sites. This program uses a lab-\nto-lab approach that builds trust and cooperation. It has forged ties \nwith every single Russian nuclear facility of concern. This program not \nonly improves security, but also encourages transparency regarding \nRussian operations and helps to build ties that can lead to projects \nunder other non-proliferation assistance programs.\n  The time is ripe to apply the same lab-to-lab approach to Russia's \nchemical weapons sites. Russia has declared some 40,000 metric tons of \nchemical weapons stocks that must be destroyed under the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. Physical security for those toxic chemicals is only \nrudimentary: guards, fences, and single-key padlocks that are sometimes \nfalling apart. While a rogue state might have to steal and transport a \nton of this material to gain a militarily useful amount, a terrorist \ngroup could wreak havoc with much smaller quantities.\n  We should encourage the MPC & A program to help Russia slam the door \non that risk. A $10 million start in Fiscal Year 1999 would be money \nwell invested.\n  I have written to the Armed Services Committee and the relevant \nappropriations subcommittees regarding these programs, which I hope \nwill be addressed in their bills. If they are not, I will work with \nother concerned colleagues to raise these issues on the floor.\n\n\n             Weaning Russians Away from Biological Weapons\n\n  Revelations regarding Iraq's biological weapons, along with defector \naccounts of Russia's massive biological weapons program, are making \ntheir mark on our psyche. We are beginning to accept that, whether U.S. \nmilitary planners wanted biological weapons or not, other countries and \nterrorist groups might be all too happy to try them out. Thousands of \nRussian scientists and technicians have biological weapons experience, \nand a rogue state assisted by such personnel could cause unspeakable \nharm.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, using Nunn-Lugar money from the \nDepartment of Defense, is working with the International Science and \nTechnology Center in Moscow--a multi-country program managed by the \nState Department--to support cooperative research projects with \nRussia's civilian biological weapons experts. This is an interesting \nprogram which encourages those experts to find socially useful outlets \nfor their biological weapons expertise.\n  But the National Academy's program also keeps these experts working \nwith dangerous pathogens, rather than applying their skills in less \ndangerous areas of work. So if you're a Russian biological weapons \nexpert who wants to get out of that nasty business, you may find \nyourself unemployed--or recruited by rogues. But if you want to stay on \nthe fringes of it, the United States will help you.\n  Does that make sense? I don't think so, although it's true that this \nprogram will give us useful windows into the work of these personnel--\nand perhaps some lines into Russia's Ministry of Defense labs that we \nfear may be engaged in illegal biological weapons work--for about $8 \nmillion per year.\n  Don't blame the National Academy of Sciences, however, or even the \nDepartment of Defense. The original 1996 contract between those \norganizations called for the Nunn-Lugar money to be used ``to support \nthe conversion of former Soviet BW research personnel to work on \ninternational public health issues.''\n  But that changed after we passed a law to prevent Nunn-Lugar money \nfrom being used for defense conversion. That law is section 1503 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. I suppose it \nwas adopted because defense conversion is difficult and costly. That's \ntrue. But here we are, with a law that lets us keep several hundred \nexperts working with diseases that Russia developed as weapons. But it \nwon't let us help those experts--or a few thousand others who used to \nwork on those weapons--to move into really useful work on the many \nother diseases that afflict mankind.\n  We can understand why that law was adopted. But as Mr. Bumble says \n(in Charles Dickens's ``The Pickwick Papers''), sometimes ``the law is \na ass, an idiot.'' That law needs to be changed, to allow the National \nAcademy's original concept to go forward. We need a much larger program \nto encourage Russia's biological weapons experts to apply their \nknowledge in safer areas of research and development, as well as the \nsmall program for those Russian experts who continue to work with \ndangerous pathogens. I will introduce legislation to remove any legal \nroadblock and create that larger program.\n\n\n                   The ``Nuclear Cities'' Initiative\n\n  On April 27, the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy announced plans to \nsharply reduce the number of institutions involved in nuclear weapons \nresearch and production. The cuts will begin this year, and in five to \nseven years Russia may close a dozen nuclear weapons research and \nproduction facilities.\n  This is big news. The Russian Federation is finally admitting--\npublicly--that its nuclear establishment is far too large. From the \nstandpoint of our strategic arms relationship with Russia, downsizing \nof the ``nuclear cities'' is a welcome step.\n  But what will become of the scientists and technicians who do not \nstay in the downsized Russian nuclear establishment? There are over \n100,000 personnel in those ``nuclear cities.'' Let's say that 25,000 \nstay with the consolidated Russian labs, and that only a quarter of the \nrest have skills that a rogue state or terrorist group would like to \nbuy. That would still leave 20,000 underpaid or unemployed experts on \nthe market. What will be done to reduce the risks posed by that large \npool of desperate people?\n\n  One answer is the Nuclear Cities Initiative. In March, Vice President \nGore and then-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin agreed to develop a new \ninitiative for Russia's vast complex of ``nuclear cities,'' each the \nequivalent of our Los Alamos or Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Last \nmonth, Energy Secretary Pena and Russia's new Minister of Atomic \nEnergy, Yevgeny Adamov, signed an agreement to begin this initiative.\n  The ``Nuclear Cities Initiative'' is a major step that deserves our \nwholehearted support. It would include business training for Russian \npersonnel and a major effort to find commercially viable projects to \nprovide jobs for former nuclear weapons experts. Fiscal Year 1999 \nfunding of $30 million, say, would get that initiative off to a good \nstart and might be matched by some of the money that Russia receives \nfor its weapons-grade material sold to the United States.\n  But I doubt that even this initiative will be enough. For one thing, \nthe obstacles to finding commercial funding for viable civilian \nprojects are really substantial. Personnel in the ``nuclear cities'' \nwere isolated for decades from even the Soviet Russian economy, to say \nnothing of market economics. Russian legal and political structures are \nstill unresponsive, moreover, to the needs of foreign investors.\n  Russian officials often ask for an ``investment conference'' to put \nthem directly in touch with prospective investors. I propose a more \nuseful jump-\n\n[[Page S5382]]\n\nstart of the commercialization process: a presidential commission with \nsubstantial representation from U.S. industry. Most U.S. firms will not \nyet risk real money on new technology from Russia's isolated \nlaboratories. But 50 years ago, an automobile company president showed \nWestern Europe how to recover from World War II. Our high-tech \nindustrialists might best be able to get Russia to create an inviting \nbusiness climate.\n\n\n                        Beyond Commercialization\n\n  Finally, we must ask ourselves whether our current non-proliferation \nprograms are ``penny wise and pound foolish.'' Does it really make \nsense to bar funding for defense conversion, except in programs that \nfind commercial sponsors? Maybe there will never be enough commercial \nsponsors to employ Russia's experts in ballistic missiles or weapons of \nmass destruction. That is a real possibility. So, do we just walk away? \nDo we tell them to pack their bags and move to Iraq, Iran, or Libya?\n  The law also bars using Nunn-Lugar funds for environmental clean-up \nefforts in the former Soviet Union. Such funds should not be used \nsimply for environmental objectives. But what if that's the safest way \nto use the talents of nuclear, chemical or biological arms experts? Why \nisn't any socially useful employment of those personnel worth \nsubsidizing, in order to keep them inside their own countries and away \nfrom their original areas of expertise?\n  The key to this puzzle is the word ``subsidizing.'' Is that what we \nwant to do? Not ideally. But is it a reasonable approach when others do \nnot suffice? Or is it our primary objective to make Russia's weapons \nexperts adapt to a capitalist economy, even if the result is to leave \nsome of them poverty-stricken and prey to offers from less squeamish \ncountries?\n  I am not afraid to subsidize Russian arms experts, if that's what it \ntakes to keep them out of their old trades. We spend billions of \ndollars on defense. We're already looking at over $700 million in non-\nproliferation assistance requested for next year. That may employ \n10,000 or 12,000 people. (Much of the money goes for equipment used in \nweapons security or dismantlement.) Why not add another $250 million \nper year--with Russia putting up some funds as well--to employ another \n20,000 or more Russian specialists on unrelated projects, so long as \nthey help their country and stay away from weapons work?\n\n  Does that sound too much like welfare? Call it welfare, if you wish. \nBut ten years of that welfare will purchase a lot of security for us. \nThose will be ten years of dramatically reduced risk that the fallout \nfrom the collapse of the Soviet Union will be radioactive. They will be \nten years in which many Russian experts will retire and no longer be of \nconcern, ten years for the Russian economy to recover and employ the \nrest of its skilled scientists and technicians, ten years for diplomats \nto solve some of the conflicts that tempt countries to amass and use \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Increased investment in non-proliferation assistance will not solve \nall our proliferation worries. But it will help--at a cost that we can \nafford. I plan to introduce legislation to do this.\n  Let me make clear that the deficiencies in our non-proliferation \nprograms do not reflect a lack of vision on the part of Congress or the \nexecutive branch. Rather, they stem from the daunting and multi-faceted \nnature of the challenge we face.\n  Helping Russia to reduce and reorient its vast defense complex is an \nunprecedented activity. The task requires multiple efforts; what works \nfor missile dismantlement under the START Treaty may not be appropriate \nto chemical weapons destruction or to offering new careers to \nbiological weapons experts.\n  We have had to start with small steps, moreover, and for good \nreasons. First, each program can succeed only once it gains the trust \nand cooperation of former Soviet experts and bureaucracies. Second, a \nmassive effort could become unbearably costly. And third, we must make \nsure that our programs support reorientation of defense facilities, \nrather than unwittingly underwriting the development or export of \nweapons of mass destruction. So we must see what works, adapt, and \nbuild upon the successes.\n  To truly succeed, however, we must not be afraid of building \nsomething big. We should seek international participation and \nfinancing. But even the most expensive programs, if well conceived and \nexecuted, will be bargains compared to the cost of even a single war in \nwhich weapons of mass destruction were used against our troops or our \ncities.\n  Let me return, then, to the question I posed at the beginning: How \nwill historians characterize this decade? Indeed, how will historians \ncharacterize the efforts of this body? Will we be seen as having seized \nthe opportunity of this decade? Or will historians say that we were \nstill too enamored with weapons, too cheap to pay the price of peace? \nIn the coming weeks and months, we will have a chance to put our money \nwhere our hopes are. I call on my colleagues to join together in taking \nat least the little steps, and perhaps some big ones as well, toward a \nmore comprehensive program of non-proliferation assistance. We will not \nonly feel good doing that, we will do some good, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I have been authorized by the Senator \nfrom Michigan to use up to 8 minutes of the time that he still has \nreserved. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I speak about the other part of this \nbill. The Senator from Delaware just made the point that this bill we \nare intending to vote on today contains two very different pieces of \nlegislation in it. Title I is of the Iran missile proliferation \nsanctions. That goes on for twelve pages. Title II is the Chemical \nWeapons Convention Implementation Act. That goes on for 82 pages.\n  I will speak about the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act \nfor just a few minutes. Much of what I want to say is good news. \nImplementation of the treaty is making important and significant \nprogress. It has been just over a year since the treaty entered into \nforce. As of May 14, 1998, 168 nations signed this historic treaty; 108 \nnations have ratified the treaty.\n  This is a landmark treaty that provides us with the means to rid the \nplanet of an entire type of lethal weapon that could threaten every one \nof our nations.\n  The threat has already been effective in identifying nations with \nchemical weapons capabilities. Among the Chemical Weapons Convention \nstates possessing chemical weapons capabilities are some of the \ncountries we have been talking about extensively here in the rest of \nthis debate: Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran. I point out that \nChina and India were among the states that previously denied having \nchemical weapons. So by opening their facilities to inspections \nrequired by this convention, those states were forced to demonstrate \ntheir ability to provide chemical weapons.\n  There is a lot of good news that I want to allude to here, but let me \npoint out three concerns that I have that people need to be aware of as \nwe go forward with this debate and the vote that is intended here.\n  The first of these concerns relates to the fact that the treaty \nrequires an initial declaration of capabilities of both government and \ncommercial entities for all states that are party to the treaty. So \nfar, there are 28 countries, including Iran, that have failed to submit \ntheir initial declarations. The Technical Secretariat for this \nconvention must ensure that those declarations are forthcoming, and \nother states' parties should take measures to ensure their compliance.\n  One of the unfortunate facts I want to point out is that the United \nStates is one of the states that is not in compliance. The U.S. \nGovernment has declared government-owned facilities related to its \nchemical weapons program, but we have yet to declare commercial \nindustrial facilities required for the treaty. This is an important \nmatter to which I hope the administration is devoting priority \nattention. If the treaty is to be an effective vehicle as we intend it \nto be, our leadership in implementation efforts will be critical to its \nultimate success.\n  There are two other matters I want to mention here. The first \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S5383]]\n\nsection 234(f) of this treaty, of this implementing language in H.R. \n2709 regarding the analysis of chemical samples that may be taken \nduring an inspection. The provision contained in the legislation before \nthe Senate, though perhaps desirable for our purposes, our limited \npurposes, could result in a circumstance that we would not want to see \nhappen.\n  Let me explain. Provisions in the treaty regarding permissible \nequipment to be brought in by an inspector restrict their qualitative \nanalytical capabilities. These restrictions could quite feasibly lead \nto ambiguities in analysis. It could require that a sample receive \nadditional examination. Under the treaty's provisions, the analysis \nshould be conducted at three laboratories designated by the Technical \nSecretariat. Only one of those laboratories is located in the United \nStates and the other two lie outside our borders.\n\n  Section 234(f) in this implementing legislation would require that no \nsample taken in the United States is allowed to be examined out of our \nborders. So clearly we are putting in law here a provision which \ncontravenes the terms of the treaty. It is evident to me this is a \nproblem that needs to be addressed at some stage in some way.\n  The second matter that I want to bring to people's attention is the \nright to refuse challenge inspections. During the early days of \nnegotiating the Chemical Weapons Convention, members of President \nReagan's team insisted that all countries must allow challenge \ninspections to occur at any time in any place. They did so in order to \nensure that this very difficult treaty could have some real teeth in \nit. Unfortunately, the legislation that we have before the Senate today \nwould give the President the power to deny a request for a challenge \ninspection if he determines that the inspection could pose a threat to \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  The problem with this provision is that assigning ourselves the right \nto refuse a challenge inspection obviously raises the prospect that \nothers may also choose to refuse a challenge inspection, and that guts \na key provision of the treaty that we intended to see enforced.\n  I hope that these are matters that can be corrected. I think it is \nunfortunate that this legislation has come to us on the floor with \nthese particular two provisions in it. I hope very much that we can \nfind some solution to this either in future legislation or in some \naction by the administration.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is a very important treaty that we \nhave entered into. We have every reason to want to see it be effective. \nThese two provisions that I have pointed to undermine the effectiveness \nof it and also undermine our credibility in trying to urge other states \nto comply with the treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 8 \nminutes on the Iran Missile Proliferation Act and have that time \ncharged to Senator Levin who will be offering an amendment. That is \npursuant to Senator Levin's desire, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it is hard to imagine a greater threat to \ninternational stability than the rogue nation of Iran coming into \npossession of weapons of mass destruction.\n  There are three important reasons why the Iran missile proliferation \nact should be passed at this time.\n  First and foremost, the Iran missile proliferation act is, above all \nelse, a nonproliferation measure. It is intended to halt the spread of \nmissile technology to Iran. With the alarming news that India has \ntested nuclear weapons and, in reaction to this, Pakistan is now \nconsidering testing its own weapons, we see the prospect of a dangerous \nspread of nuclear technology that only underscores the need for further \nU.S. resolve in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The second reason this legislation is important now is because of the \nlack of cooperation on the part of the Russians. Generally, the United \nStates and the Russians have a clear, common interest in halting the \nspread of advanced weapons technology, including missiles. Although \nthere has been some movement within Russia to halt the spread of \nmissile technology to Iran, there is clearly not enough being done. \nCoupled with reports that Iran may be actively acquiring biological, \nchemical, and even nuclear weapons, the case for this legislation is \nclear.\n  Finally, this legislation is needed to bolster our Iran policy and to \nsend a clear signal that the United States will not tolerate the spread \nof missile technology to Iran. Earlier this week, President Clinton \ndecided to grant a waiver from the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act to a \nhuge energy project by a French firm and others. Many of my colleagues \nand I urged the President not to grant this waiver; yet, a decision was \nmade to do so. I believe that this sends the wrong signal to the \ninternational community with respect to investment in Iran.\n  Foreign investment could enable Iran to rebuild its energy sector and \nvastly increase its economic strength, allowing it to acquire vast \nassets that it could use to re-arm and acquire terrible weapons of mass \ndestruction. While I disagree with the President's decision to grant \nthe waiver for the French and Russian energy project, I feel even more \nstrongly about the transfer of missile technology to Iran.\n  Let us make no mistake about it, Iran has become the most serious \nthreat to stability in the Middle East. Israeli and American \nintelligence have recently discovered that, due largely to technology \nobtained from Russia, Iran may soon have the capability to begin \nassembling and testing ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel \nand other vital targets in the Middle East.\n  Russian companies are providing Iran with crucial technologies, \nincluding wind tunnels for the design of missiles, lasers, and special \nmaterials for missile construction. There are even reports of over \n9,000 Russian advisers working in Iran on a variety of military \nprojects, and Iran tested a Soviet-designed rocket engine last year.\n  Iran, one of America's foremost self-proclaimed enemies, has been \nlinked to numerous terrorist attacks, ranging from taking hostages and \nhijacking airlines to carrying out assassinations and bombings.\n  Now is the time to send a clear signal to the world community that \nselling missile technology to Iran is totally unacceptable. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this vital measure, which takes concrete steps to \nhalt the spread of ballistic missile technology to Iran and will act to \nsupport the preservation of peace and stability in the Middle East.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am informed the yeas and nays have not \nbeen requested.\n  At this time, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Senator Levin has time, and he is prepared \nto proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment that I will be sending to \nthe desk will change the trigger date for sanctionable activity from \nAugust 8, 1995, which is currently in the bill, to January 22, 1998. I \nwill explain why I am seeking to do that in the next few minutes.\n  The bill the Senate is debating requires the President to submit \nperiodic reports on foreign persons who, on or after August 8, 1995, \nhave provided or attempted to provide material, technology, technical \nassistance, or facilities that contributed to Iran's efforts to \nacquire, develop or produce ballistic missiles. Those who are \nidentified as assisting Iran's ballistic missile effort will be subject \nto sanctions for at least two years, preventing them from buying \nmilitary equipment and technology, and controlled dual-use goods and \ntechnology, and from receiving U.S. economic aid.\n  The bill includes two waiver provisions, one in case the President \nlearns of new information that shows that a foreign person did not \nprovide assistance initially included in one of the required reports, \nand one in case the\n\n[[Page S5384]]\n\nPresident determines that imposing sanctions would not be in our \nnational security interest.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I strongly support the \nlegislation's goal, Mr. President--to stop assistance to Iran's \nballistic missile program by foreign entities.\n  I am concerned, however, about the bill's use of August 8, 1995 as \nthe trigger date for determining behavior to be sanctioned.\n  My amendment would change the trigger date in the bill for \ndetermining behavior to be sanctioned from August 8, 1995 to January \n22, 1998. This is the date on which the then-Prime Minister of Russia, \nViktor Chernomyrdin, signed a government decree to strengthen Russian \nexport controls on dual-use items that could be used either for weapons \nof mass destruction or for missiles to deliver such weapons.\n  Madam President, we need to strengthen the President's ability to \napply sanctions to foreign entities--whether individuals, companies or \neducational institutions--that provide assistance of any kind to the \ncurrent efforts of Iran to develop ballistic missiles that could \nthreaten their neighbors.\n  But I believe that the more appropriate trigger date for the behavior \nsubject to sanctions is January 22, 1998 rather than August 8, 1995 for \nthe following reasons:\n  The United States Government has been working with the Russian \nGovernment intensely for the last few years to encourage them to stop \nall assistance by any entity in Russia to Iran's efforts to develop a \nballistic missile. Our government has engaged the Russian Government at \nthe highest levels--President Clinton directly to President Yeltsin--\nand at numerous levels below the Presidents. Vice President Gore made \nthis a crucial and central issue in the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, \nand put this on then-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's agenda for immediate \nattention. In addition, the Administration appointed Ambassador Frank \nWisner to work with his specially appointed Russian counterpart, Yuri \nKoptev, the head of the Russian Space Agency, to seek progress in \nstopping assistance from Russian entities to Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram.\n  Ambassador Wisner was recently succeeded by Ambassador Robert \nGallucci, the diplomat who negotiated the North Korean Agreed Framework \nand led UNSCOM inspection teams in ferreting out Iraqi weapons of mass \ndestruction after the Gulf War. So our government has been highly \nenergized and motivated and they deserve credit for their efforts, \nwhich are continuing still.\n  These efforts have met with mixed success. In some cases, the \nactivities have stopped. In other cases, the activities have continued. \nAnd in other cases, the information is inconclusive as to whether or \nnot the activities that the Russian Government has said they are trying \nto stop and which we surely want stopped, and which the world needs \nstopped, in fact have stopped.\n  However, in January of this year, the Russian Government took an \nimportant step that we had been encouraging them to take for some time. \nOn January 22, then-Prime Minister of Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, \nissued a broad decree, known as the ``catch-all'' decree, to strengthen \nexport controls over all dual-use goods and services that could be used \nto proliferate either weapons of mass destruction or the missiles to \ndeliver them.\n  This decree states that Russian entities engaged in foreign trade \n``shall refrain from export transactions involving any dual-use goods \nor services not subject to Russian Federation export control \nregulations should such entities be aware that such goods and services \nwill be used to develop or employ nuclear, chemical or biological \nweapons or missile means of delivery . . .''. The decree goes on to \nstate that ``Should Russian entities engaged in foreign trade have \nreason to believe that such goods and services may be used for the \naforesaid purposes, they shall submit the pertinent application to the \nRussian Federation Governmental Commission on Export control.''\n  Madam President, this Russian decree is a broad and sweeping \nprohibition on the export of any goods and services, if there is reason \nto believe that those goods or services could be used to develop or \nemploy a weapon of mass destruction or the missiles to deliver them.\n  Our Government strongly encouraged the Russian Government to issue \nthat decree.\n  And of great significance, the January 22 decree is broader and \nstronger than the Missile Technology Control Regime. The Missile \nTechnology Control Regime deals only with the proliferation of missile \ntechnology for certain classes of missiles. The January 22 decree is an \neffort by the Russian Government to strengthen controls over the export \nof technology, goods, and services that can lead to the proliferation \nof all weapons of mass destruction as well as the missiles to deliver \nthem.\n  So this decree covers the weapons of mass destruction and their \ncomponents and the materials that go into them. It is much broader than \nthe Missile Control Technology Regime, which just relates to missiles. \nThe Missile Technology Control Regime, to state it more correctly, \ncovers just missiles, whereas the Chernomyrdin decree of January 22 \ncovers the weapons of mass destruction that we are trying to preserve \nand protect the world from, as well as the missiles that could deliver \nthem.\n  This is an important step by the Russian Government. That decree, \nwhich we pleaded with them to adopt and to publish, deserves to be \nsupported and deserves to be encouraged.\n  My amendment uses their decree as the basis for our action--their \ndecree--and that reinforces its effectiveness instead of ignoring its \nissuance.\n  Madam President, it is not clear to me that all the activities of the \nRussian entities that have or could contribute to Iran's ballistic \nmissile program would even be proscribed by the Missile Technology \nControl Regime that the Russians signed in August of 1995. But the \nJanuary 22 decree, being much broader, would prohibit those activities \nbecause they fit under the decree's broad category of ``export \ntransactions involving any dual use goods or services'' that ``may'' be \nused to develop or employ nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or \nthe missiles to deliver them.\n  So, summarizing the amendment, the amendment strengthens the original \nintent of the bill. It recognizes the efforts of the Russian Government \nto address the problem of assistance to Iran's ballistic missile \nprogram through the January 22, 1998, decree. By using that decree as \nthe trigger date for behavior that is sanctioned, the bill reinforces \nthat decree, both recognizing the action that the Russians took at our \nrequest and using the restrictions in that decree which are more \ncomprehensive than those entailed by the Missile Technology Control \nRegime.\n  Our Nation shares a common goal with Russia of trying to stop all \nassistance from Russian entities to Iran's missile program. Russia has \ntaken some steps, but more steps and more cooperation are needed. I \nbelieve that if we acknowledge the efforts they have taken and \nencourage them to continue, we can avoid a counterproductive result. \nThat result could make it harder for Russia to succeed in its efforts \nto stop such assistance. And our goal should be just that--to do what \nworks, to do what leads to a better result.\n  In all likelihood, if this legislation becomes law with my amendment, \nit will still require sanctions to be applied, because there is \nevidence that some Russian entities have provided assistance to Iran's \nballistic missile program since January 22, 1998.\n  Finally, I note that the bill before the Senate contains two \nPresidential waivers. They are there for important reasons. The more \nsignificant of the two waivers is a national security waiver which the \nPresident can use to waive the imposition of sanctions if doing so ``is \nessential to the national security of the United States.''\n  This legislation is not intended to force the President to impose a \nsanction if doing so would harm U.S. national security. If the \nPresident determines that it is necessary for him to waive the \nimposition of sanctions in the interest of national security, then \nunder this bill he may do so. That is in the bill itself. That is not \ntouched by my amendment. But that is why the waiver is included in the \nbill before us.\n  Madam President, I believe that the sponsors of the bill have \nindicated support for my amendment. Senator Kyl\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\nis on the floor. I will let him speak for himself in that regard.\n  I yield the floor. I appreciate their support.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the amendment is acceptable to everyone on \nthis side that I know of. Therefore, we can move the process along and \nhave it accepted formally and conclude the debate. I think our \ncolleagues would appreciate having the opportunity to vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2444\n\n(Purpose: To change the date of behavior subject to sanctions relating \n                     to Iran missile proliferation)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2444.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, beginning on line 15, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n       On page 6, beginning on line 24, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is a reason why this bill picks August \n8, 1995, as the date after which Russian companies should be sanctioned \nfor their proliferation behavior. The reason for this is very simple: \nAugust 8, 1995, was the date upon which Russia joined the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR). In so doing, the Russian Government \nundertook an international obligation to curtail its proliferation \nbehavior. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the Government has not lived \nup to that pledge.\n  At the time that the United States favored Russian membership in the \nMTCR, the Senate was assured by the Clinton Administration that Russia \nhad all of the necessary, effective export controls in place. Well, we \nsee just how accurate that claim proved to be. Two years later the \nUnited States began uncovering evidence of the degree to which Russian \nassistance has sped up Iran's missile program.\n  In retrospect, clearly the United States should have waited until an \neffective, Russian export control regime had been established before \nfavoring Russian membership in the MTCR. As an aside, I hope the \nClinton Administration will learn from this experience. There has been \na great deal of talk lately about encouraging China to join the MTCR. I \nwould hope that the United States would wait an appropriate period of \ntime to see whether China's export controls are truly effective enough \nto warrant membership in the MTCR.\n  Finally, I have reservations about the Levin amendment, because it \nseeks--at a minimum--to ``grandfather'' Russian missile proliferation \nactivities before January 22, 1998. But I will not oppose this \namendment because, among other things, proliferation on the part of \nthese companies has been so rampant even since January 22, 1998 that \nfew companies in Russia, if any, will benefit from this shift in dates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time so we can, \nhopefully, adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Michigan.\n  The amendment (No. 2444) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I rise in support of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act, H.R. \n2709.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make three important points regarding \nthis legislation.\n  First, the Administration's efforts to get Russia to stop assisting \nIran's ballistic missile program have been an abysmal failure.\n  Second, there is a broader failure of United States proliferation \npolicy--a failure of monumental and potentially deadly proportions.\n  Finally, the Senate must now take a greater role in addressing the \nproliferation crisis. Passage of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act is a \nfirst step.\n  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, many in the United States have \nbeen greatly concerned that Russian entities were providing assistance \nto other state's ballistic missile programs. As evidence mounted, the \nClinton Administration responded with diplomatic efforts from the \nworking level up through the high level Commission chaired by Vice \nPresident Gore. Diplomatic efforts were supplemented with economic \nincentives.\n  When additional reports of new and ongoing assistance emerged, \nincluding transfers to Iran in probable violation of the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime, Congress waited for the Administration to \nimpose the sanctions required. When sanctions were not imposed, some in \nCongress sought additional legislation to ``encourage'' the \nAdministration to impose sanctions.\n  The Administration again urged the Congress to wait--to give the \ndiplomatic process more time, to give the Russians time to get an \nenforcement mechanism in place. Administration officials have \nrepeatedly assured us that they have the problem under control.\n  They are wrong.\n  The Congressional Research Service summarizes the situation aptly \nwhen it reports that:\n\n       Despite official denials from Moscow through 1997, evidence \n     is growing of a pattern of missile technology transfers to \n     Iran by Russian enterprises, institutes, and individuals, \n     with direct and indirect Russian Government involvement, in \n     violation of Russian commitments under the Missile Technology \n     Control Regime (MTCR). Russian assistance could significantly \n     accelerate Iran's indigenous missile program . . .\n\n  There is ample intelligence information that supports this \nassessment, and I believe it is important for Senators to have the \nopportunity to review this information. Therefore, Senator Kerrey and I \ndirected the Select Committee on Intelligence staff to prepare a \ncompendium of the classified intelligence reporting on this subject and \nit is available for Senators to review in S-407.\n  My second point is that the Administration's failure to stop Russia \nfrom providing assistance to Iran's missile program is only part of the \nbroader failure of the Administration's non-proliferation policy.\n  There is an ongoing pattern of assistance by Russia, China, and North \nKorea to rogue states and to other states such as India and Pakistan. \nThere is also a pattern of weak Clinton Administration response to this \nproliferation. There is a connection. The Indians cited the weak \nClinton Administration response to China's proliferation of missiles \nand nuclear assistance to Pakistan as one of the reasons they decided \nto test nuclear weapons.\n  Some states seek weapons of mass destruction for prestige or in an \nattempt to enhance their global role. Countries like India and Pakistan \njustify their efforts by citing regional security concerns.\n  Others like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea seek these weapons to \nthreaten and intimidate their neighbors, in particular U.S. friends and \nallies, to threaten forward-deployed U.S. forces, and ultimately to \nthreaten the United States itself.\n  Such states do not wish to confront U.S. conventional military \nforces--the best in the world--with conventional weapons alone. They \nprefer to threaten our forces, or our cities, with asymmetric weapons \nof mass destruction to deter us from carrying out policies to protect \nour global interests.\n  If states believe they can change the calculation of risks and \nbenefits, they have a strong strategic incentive to acquire these \nmissiles. Our near-total vulnerability to the ballistic missile threat \nonly furthers their incentives.\n  Without stronger disincentives, other states will continue to seek \nthe financial, political, and strategic advantages that may be gained \nthrough proliferation, and through taking advantage of our patience and \nvulnerabilities.\n  They have repeatedly offered carrots without wielding or credibily \nthreatening the stick.\n  Indeed, in many disturbing ways, the Administration's policies toward \nRussia and China may have enabled or\n\n[[Page S5386]]\n\neven encouraged proliferation. By failing to respond to dangerous \nproliferation acdtivities to the maximum extent possible under domestic \nand international law, they have led others to question the will and \nability of the United States to take strong measures to punish \nproliferators.\n  Unfortunately, the Executive Branch has not yet come to this \nrealization.\n  It appears to be difficult to get this Administration to act with \nresolve, either by adding backbone to its proliferation policies or by \nresponding to existing and future threats by developing additional \nmeans of deterrence and defense. It is difficult to persuade them to \nmake diplomacy and arms control agreements tools of policy rather than \npolicy objectives in-and-of themselves.\n  However, the Congress can not simply stand back and point our fingers \nat the White House. We must do all that we can do to demonstrate that \nAmerica has the will and the ability to respond.\n  We must provide adequate funding to the Intelligence Community and to \nour military forces to detect and deter, and to prevail when deterrence \nfails. We must put in place the legislative mechanisms to enforce a \nrobust counter-proliferation policy. We must continue to force the \nAdministration to disclose dangerous proliferation activities. And we \nmust make sanctions mandatory.\n  Challenging, deterring, and defending against proliferation won't be \neasy or cost free. But it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, American lives are at stake.\n  The Senate must act. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the bill \nbefore us.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to \nindicate my support for H.R. 2709, the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act.\n  The message this bill sends to the international community is clear. \nThe patience of the American people and their elected representatives \nis not infinite. If diplomacy fails to produce satisfactory results, \nthe United States is prepared to take decisive action to protect our \nsecurity and that of our allies by imposing sanctions on those who \nviolate international agreements restricting the transfer of ballistic \nmissile technology.\n  In my judgment, it is time for Congress to send this message. And it \nis long past time for those who violate international agreements to \nheed the message.\n  I appreciate that diplomacy has produced some positive results in \nthis area and may ultimately yield more progress. Nonetheless, these \nefforts fall short of what is needed to halt the illegal transfers. In \nthe absence of immediate and conclusive evidence of a dramatic reversal \nof Russian behavior, stronger measures are needed, and H.R. 2709 is an \nappropriate vehicle.\n  The end of the Cold War has affected our national security policies \nin many ways. It has reduced the likelihood of a large-scale \nconventional conflict on the European continent. It has made it much \nless likely that either the United States or Russia will intentionally \nuse nuclear weapons against the other. And it has allowed us to meet \nthe remaining threats to our security with slightly smaller defense \nbudgets. These are obviously positive developments.\n  On the other hand, the post-Cold War period has been marked by the \nemergence of a new threat--the spread of weapons of mass destruction \nand the means to deliver them. Let me run down the current state of \naffairs with regard to weapons of mass destruction.\n  First, at the end of the Cold War, five countries--the United States, \nRussia, China, Great Britain, and France--had declared themselves \nnuclear weapons states. Unfortunately, as proven by India's actions \njust last week, the true number in the nuclear club is much larger.\n  Second, the Pentagon suspects that as many as 20 countries have \nchemical weapons programs, and that a slightly smaller number have \nbiological weapons.\n  Third, the Defense Department believes that about 15 countries \ncurrently possess ballistic missiles, and that the number could grow to \nmore than 20 by 2000.\n  It is these disturbing trends that the United States and many other \nnations in the international community are trying to combat.\n  Reversing these trends is a daunting challenge. If there is to be any \nchance of even slowing the spread of this threatening technology, the \nUnited States must act decisively and firmly when confronted with \nactions that violate existing agreements designed to proscribe this \ntype of behavior. It is in this context that we must view efforts by \nseveral Russian entities and individuals to assist the Iranian \nballistic missile program.\n  The status of the Iranian missile program should be of particular \nconcern to U.S. security officials. Iran is located in a critical \nregion of the world. Vital U.S. economic, political and military \ninterests are at stake.\n  Tens of thousands of U.S. troops are within easy reach of the Iranian \nmissiles speeding through their development stage.\n  The entire state of Israel, a staunch ally and friend, would be well \nwithin range of the Iranian missiles.\n  Concern about Iran's intentions are further heightened by the fact \nthat many intelligence analysts believe the Iranian government has \nrepeatedly supported and sponsored terrorist activities.\n  Both supporters and opponents of H.R. 2709 agree on one fact: Russian \nentities and individuals have played an important, if not crucial, role \nin the Iranian ballistic missile program. Even Russian officials \nacknowledge the involvement of Russian companies in these illegal \nactivities. It has been publicly estimated that, largely as a result of \nthis assistance, Iran could soon field missiles with sufficient range \nto threaten the entire Middle East.\n  Where people differ is over what to do about this assistance.\n  Opponents of H.R. 2709 argue the bill's sanctions are a blunt \ninstrument that will not achieve the intended result of stopping \nRussian assistance. They prefer to allow more time for the \nAdministration's diplomatic efforts to bear fruit.\n  Mr. President, I take a back seat to no one in my appreciation for \nthe negotiations the President and his advisers have conducted with \ntheir Russian counterparts on this complex issue. These negotiations \nhave produced positive tangible results. Russian cooperation with Iran \nhas ended in a few specific cases. In addition, the Russian government \nhas issued and agreed to enforce decrees intended to stop the missile \ntrade.\n  Yet, despite the Administration's best efforts and the progress they \nhave engendered, and notwithstanding a score of Russian promises, the \nfact remains that Russian assistance to the Iranian missile program \ncontinues. After months of negotiation, it appears that talk alone is \nnot going to be sufficient to end Russia's involvement with Iran's \nballistic missile program.\n  If we are to convince Russia and the world that we intend to protect \nourselves and our allies, the time has come for more than talk. If we \nare to enforce international law prohibiting transfer of ballistic \nmissile technology, it is time for action.\n  Mr. President, passage of H.R. 2709 is the appropriate action to take \nat this time. However, Senate passage of H.R. 2709 need not be the \nfinal word on this critical issue. If we adopt the Levin amendment, the \nbill will go back to conference with the House. There is still a very \nlimited amount of time for the Russian Government to convince this \nCongress that it has heard our concerns and moved to end cooperation \nwith the Iranian missile program. Failing an immediate and dramatic \nreversal in Russian behavior, it is time to redefine the playing field \nfor those currently violating these laws and those contemplating future \ntransgressions.\n  To those parties, enactment of the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act will underscore that the United States stands ready to \ndefend its own security interests and those of our close allies; that \nthe United States will do all it can to stem illegal efforts to spread \nballistic missile technology; and that the United States will ensure \nthat violations of international law will not go unpunished.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting for H.R. 2709.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter and a \ncosponsor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997. This \nbill addresses the very serious concern of proliferation of ballistic \nmissiles. While this bill is directed at Iran, the problem of\n\n[[Page S5387]]\n\nproliferation is one of the United States' most serious problems. The \nproblem must be addressed.\n  Iran has been actively pursuing better and more sophisticated \nballistic missiles. If the Iranians acquire more long range missiles \nwith a range of at least 1300 miles, then many of our troops and allies \nin the Gulf region will be seriously threatened. While we know that \nIran has already received some of the missile components, we must stop \nthem from receiving the critical support and know-how to move forward.\n  There have been many reports of technology transfers between Russia \nand Iran. Russia has been actively assisting the Iranians in their \nefforts in not only technology, but also in their research and \ndevelopment programs. While Russia has promised the Administration that \nthey are not doing this, even the Administration states that there is a \nreal disconnect between their words and their actions.\n  I believe that this bill is important to stop this disconnect and let \nthe world know that this activity can and should not be tolerated. If \nwe do nothing, then who will. I believe nobody will. And, if we do \nnothing, within a year Iran could be capable of being able to deploy \nmissiles that could deliver nuclear or chemical warheads about 850 \nmiles. These missiles could reach Tel Aviv Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia \nand many of the air bases where our Armed Forces are located.\n  But let me also address a problem that is not being discussed \nconcerning serious military activity between Russia and Iran, with the \nassistance of the United States. Last year, the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation became involved in an office complex project in \nSt. Petersburg, Russia, the Nevsky 25. This project is jointly owned by \na main U.S. investor in Golub & Company from Chicago with 10 percent \nownership, the St. Petersburg Property Fund with 10 percent, European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development with 40 percent, and the Rubin \nCentral Design Bureau for Marine Engineering with 40 percent.\n  My concern is that the Rubin Central Design Bureau is a Russian \nstate-controlled military company whose main product line is military \nsubmarines. Rubin is the builder of the Russian Kilo-class submarine \nand has sold 4 Kilo submarines to Iran, 4 Kilo submarines and 2 Project \n636 Kilo submarines to China, and counts Algeria as one of its \ncustomers.\n  Rubin got involved in commercial activities to supplement their \nsubmarine production. They have become active in the field of oil and \ngas, high-speed rolling stock, power generation, and marine ecology.\n  Igor Spassky, the Rubin Bureau head, is quoted as saying,\n\n       The main reason for these commercial ventures is to help us \n     survive. There is a major responsibility for the company to \n     preserve its intellectual potential and capability for the \n     design and development of submarines. (Janes Navy \n     International 11/1/96)\n\n  Even with these commercial interests, defense work still accounts for \n60-65 percent of Rubin's work.\n  OPIC has tried to assure me that Rubin does not have access to assets \nof the property until the OPIC loan is paid in full and that they are \nmonitoring the situation. The problem is even after the loan is paid, \nOPIC will have assisted in providing a flow of income for Rubin to \ncontinue to build its Kilo class and nuclear ballistic missile \nsubmarines. Also, knowing Russia's record in proliferation and this \nlegislation addresses this problem, I am afraid that this project can \nonly help Rubin in providing future funding for these submarines.\n  Also, OPIC has said that they are assured that only commercial \nactivity is taking place in this office complex. Again, while this may \nbe the case, the activity of concern is being used with the funds \nbecoming available to the company to engage in their military \nactivities.\n  OPIC did say that this is a concern and that they are monitoring it \nbut that this is not a high priority. I believe if this bill to stop \nmissile proliferation is important enough to vote on then sales of \nsubmarines which can deliver ballistic missiles, which may be assisted \nwith U.S. funds is just as important.\n  Mr. President, before I end I want to encourage all my colleagues to \nvote in favor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 \nand to take serious the problems of proliferation and the problems of \nbeing involved with state controlled military complexes who are \nengaging in commercial activity in order to supplement their military \nactivity and sales.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: I rise in strong support of the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  This legislation is very simple. It says you can have normal economic \nand political relations with the United States--or you can join \nAmerica's enemies in building weapons of mass destruction. You cannot \ndo both.\n  This bill applies sanctions to organizations that transfer missile \nhardware or technology to Iran. It would ban U.S. economic assistance \nand the export of technology to anyone who is helping Iran develop the \nmeans of using weapons of mass destruction.\n  Iran has a robust chemical and biological weapons program. As we \ndebate this legislation, Iran is building the Shihab 3 missile. This \nballistic missile could carry conventional, biological or chemical \nweapons to Israel, to the Gulf states or to American interests within \n800 miles of Iran.\n  Imagine these weapons in the hands of a country that is our sworn \nenemy. A country that supports the most radical, anti-American \nterrorist organizations on earth. A country that does everything it can \nto derail the Middle East peace process.\n  These missiles could destroy Tel Aviv. They could reach our NATO \nallies. They could threaten the thousands of American troops in the \nGulf.\n  Russia has played a central role in helping Iran to develop these \nweapons. Despite past assurances, Russian scientists and engineers are \nusing their skills to threaten America's national security.\n  The United States has done a lot to help Russia build a prosperous \ndemocracy. Since 1991, we have given Russia over four billion dollars \nin assistance. We have done a great deal to build a cooperative \npartnership with Russia.\n  As the ranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee that funds the space \nprogram, I have been a strong supporter of US-Russian cooperation with \nthe space station.\n  I supported Russia's participation in the space program for three \nreasons:\n  1. Their technical expertise\n  2. To build stronger links between the United States and Russia\n  3. To ensure that Russian scientists and engineers had civilian \nwork--so they would not sell their skills to rogue governments\n  Russia has failed to live up to their promises on the space station. \nI have no question of their technical competence. But I have strong \nconcerns about their failure to meet their end of the bargain. They \nhave not adequately funded their share of the space station, resulting \nin delays and a cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the entire \nprogram.\n  Even more troubling is Russia's role in the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction. Russia has exported technology, material and \nexpertise to help Iran develop ballistic missiles. They can't do this--\nand expect to have business as usual with America on the space program.\n  Mr. President; our foreign policy must reflect our values. We cannot \nstand by while any country threatens our national security, or the very \nexistence of our closest allies. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Iran Missile \nProliferation Sanctions Act of 1997.\n  Last week, our nation's intelligence apparatus was surprised by the \nIndian government's decision to test a hydrogen bomb. Pakistan may \nfollow suit with a retaliatory test. The fact that last week's test \ncaught our intelligence community by surprise raises serious questions \nabout our ability to monitor such developments. However, while the \nprospect of a nuclear arms race on the Asian subcontinent could \nthreaten our long-term security interests, the United States enjoys \nproductive relations with the two regional adversaries.\n  Iran, however, is neither a democracy nor a friend. While the new \nPresident, Mohammed Khatemi, is seen by some as a ``moderate,'' his \ngovernment continues a twenty year tradition of bitter\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nhostility towards the United States. Iran remains opposed to the peace \nprocess, its role in the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \nin 1996 is still not known, and it is still vigorously pursuing efforts \nto acquire weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear capability. \nWe must not be caught off guard with Iran as we have been with India \nand Pakistan.\n  When this measure was introduced last fall, I had hoped that events \nwould prove it unnecessary. I furthermore remained optimistic that the \nmeetings of the Vice President with then Russian Prime Minister Viktor \nChernomyrdin would have convinced Russia of the seriousness of the \nissue of Iran's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  I had hoped the Administration would have done a better job of \nconvincing the Russians of the seriousness of this matter. I had hoped \nthat the Russian government would have realized that whatever financial \nbenefits they get from such help to Iran are far outweighed by the loss \nof investment from the United States. Even more importantly, I had \nhoped that Russia would realize that such assistance to Iran does not \ncontribute to political stability in such a turbulent part of the \nworld. Unfortunately, none of these developments have come to pass.\n  I was disturbed to learn that Iranian nuclear officials just visited \nMoscow to view a demonstration of gas centrifuge technology--which if \nsuccessfully mastered will provide Iran the easiest type of material to \nuse in a nuclear weapon. If such a sale occurs it would be a gross \nviolation of a promise made by President Yeltsin to the President in \nMay 1995 when the Russians agreed not to sell centrifuges to Iran. This \nfollows the sale of a radioactive gas called tritium which can be used \nto increase the size of nuclear warheads and that a second sale is \nbeing discussed.\n  In addition to this development, I was disturbed to learn how close \nIran came to obtaining some 22 tons of missile-grade stainless steel \nfrom Russia as reported in the April 25th edition of the New York \nTimes. While I do not believe Russia supports the further development \nof weapons of mass destruction, I am concerned about the Yeltsin \ngovernment's ability to stem the proliferation of dangerous weapons \ntechnology and equipment. When this shipment of steel can be halted by \ncustoms officers in Azerbaijan but not in Russia, we are entitled to \nask serious questions about Russia's ability to cooperate in limiting \nthe global spread of weapons components.\n  Mr. President, I understand that Iran has begun a program to build a \nmissile called the Shahab 3 which has an 800 mile range. This range is \ndouble the capacity of a SCUD missile and is long enough to reach \nIsrael and Saudi Arabia. This type of missile would give Iran more \npower with which to threaten the West's strategic interests in the \nMiddle East only seven years after we fought a war with Iraq--another \nstate that may still be trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction. \nWe cannot allow Iran, just as President Bush did not allow Iraq, to \nassert control over the majority of the world's oil supply.\n  Mr. President, we should not view this bill as an anti-Russian \nstatement. This bill does not detract from our support for Russian \ndemocracy or Moscow's efforts to build a strong free-market economy. \nHowever, it does reflect our concern over the actions of many firms in \nRussia that have an interest in trading with either rogue states or \nnations that are inclined to develop the ability to deploy weapons of \nmass destruction. Under this legislation, Russian firms will have to \nchoose with whom they want to do business--the United States or an \nIranian regime that has yet to show the moderation promised by the \nelection of President Khatemi. Since persuasion and shared intelligence \nwith Russia may not be sufficient to stop Iran from acquiring dangerous \nweaponry, this bill has become regrettable but necessary. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it today before this menacing military threat \nfrom Iran grows even larger tomorrow.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act, I cannot stress enough the \nimportance of this legislation and I am grateful that it is now being \nconsidered before the full Senate.\n  Iran's desire to obtain ballistic missiles is a direct threat to \npeace and security in the Middle East, and therefore, a clear threat to \nU.S. national security. Limiting the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction and ensuring stability in this strategic region must remain \namong the highest priorities for the U.S. and our allies.\n  Iran is a leading sponsor of international terrorism and has been \nlinked to numerous bombings, hijackings, and assassinations. This rogue \nnation provides financial support and political training for terrorist \ngroups such as the Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Just this week, \nthe Argentine government announced they have proof that Iran was behind \nthe 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy and the 1994 bombing of the \nJewish Community Center in Buenos Aires.\n  According to news reports, Iran is months away from developing \nmissiles that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia, or the frontiers of the \nNATO alliance. Considering that Iran is already suspected of possessing \nchemical and biological weapons and is trying to acquire nuclear \nweapons capability, the threat of Iran possessing missiles capable of \nreaching U.S. forces in the Middle East is truly frightening.\n  This legislation would require the President to report periodically \non individuals, companies, and research facilities who have provided \nmaterial, technology, or technical assistance that could help Iran \ndevelop ballistic missiles. Once these suppliers have been identified, \nthey would be subject to sanctions making them ineligible for export \nlicenses and U.S. aid.\n  I believe this legislation will be a valuable tool in slowing Iran's \nprogram to develop ballistic missiles. I hope that the Senate \noverwhelmingly passes this legislation, and I want to thank the \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott, for all his hard work on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Iran Missile \nSanctions Act. I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I hope the \nSenate will approve it without delay.\n  This legislation will impose sanctions against entities--individuals, \ncompanies, and research facilities--that have provided Iran with the \ntechnology and materials required to develop ballistic missiles. Those \nidentified as assisting Iran --or as attempting to do so at least \nonce--will be subject to sanctions for two years. These entities will \nbe ineligible for export licenses for arms or controlled goods and \ntechnology. Additionally, they will not be eligible to receive U.S. \nassistance. The President would be authorized to waive sanctions if he \ndetermines that it would be in the U.S. national security interest to \ndo so or if additional information which demonstrates that the alleged \nacts were not committed by the sanctioned person is available.\n  The need for this legislation is clear. There is growing evidence \nthat Russian companies and research facilities continue to provide Iran \nwith the technological assistance and the materials necessary to \ndevelop ballistic missiles capable of reaching U.S. forces in the \nMiddle East and our stalwart ally Israel. According to public reports, \nwith the help of Russian entities, U.S. officials estimate that Iran \ncould deploy the medium range Shahab 3 missile within 12 to 18 months. \nThat missile is capable of targeting Israel, other Arab countries in \nthe Middle East, and U.S. troops in the region. According to public \nsources, Iran could also deploy the Shahab 4 missile within three \nyears. That missile reportedly would be able to reach targets in \nEurope.\n  The Russians are not building these missiles for the Iranians. \nRather, Mr. President, they are providing the material and training \nnecessary for the Iranians to develop an indigenous capability. Make no \nmistake about it. The development of these Iranian missiles will be \nvery destabilizing in the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, to its credit, the Administration has made the \ntransfer of missile technology a very high priority in dealings with \nRussian officials, including the recent talks between Vice President \nGore and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Special Envoy \nWisner has worked on this issue aggressively, and the State \nDepartment's Robert Galluci has been doing the same. I commend them for \nthe attention they have focused on this very\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nsensitive matter and the effort they have made to persuade Russia to \nclamp down on exporters.\n  Clearly, some progress has been made. On January 22, Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin issued an Executive Order stating the Russian government's \nintention to set policies that will more effectively control the \nexports of technology to Iran. Nonetheless, public reports indicate \nthat the cooperation is ongoing and that the transfers continue.\n  Because the stakes are so high, we don't have the luxury of time. And \nwhile I hope the Administration's efforts will succeed in persuading \nthe Russians to clamp down on these technology transfers, this Senator \nbelieves time is running out. The missiles being developed by the \nIranians are capable of delivering chemical weapons throughout the \nMiddle East. They are lethal. They threaten U.S. troops. They threaten \nour ally Israel. And in the long run, they will threaten our European \nallies. America needs to use every appropriate tool in its arsenal to \nprevent the Iranians from developing these missiles which will threaten \nour interests in the region. And we need to use those tools now.\n  Mr. President, the sanctions in this legislation provide another \ntool. They are appropriately targeted against the entities--the \ncompanies, individuals, and institutes--that are cooperating with the \nIranians. They are not targeted at the Russian government. If used \neffectively, these sanctions--or the threat of these sanctions--can \nhelp the Administration in its efforts to clamp down on those entities \nthat are cooperating with the Iranian government.\n  For the stake of promoting stability in the Middle East, I urge my \ncolleagues to approve this legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Iran Missile \nProliferation Sanctions Act before us today. At the same time, I am \nuncomfortable about the implementing legislation for the Chemical \nWeapons Convention attached to it.\n  Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses the gravest risk \nto domestic and international security in the post-Cold War era. Based \non this assessment of U.S. security concerns, it makes sense for the \nSenate to pass legislation designed to prevent or, at a minimum, curb \nproliferation threats in every possible instance.\n  The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act will help to attain our \nnon-proliferation objectives. A very important national security \nobjective is to prevent Iran from obtaining and improving its weapons \nof mass destruction. A critical concern is Iranian acquisition of \nballistic missiles, especially those with a range of 1,300 kilometers \nor more. Such capability would pose an unacceptable threat to U.S. \nforces in that area, not to mention our allies throughout the region.\n  This Sanctions legislation is a careful and sound approach to non-\nproliferation. The legislation should offer the Administration \nadditional leverage in curtailing Russian assistance to Iran's missile \nprograms, and I applaud those objectives.\n  Ideally, the implementing legislation for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention would have similar objectives--stemming the threat of \nproliferation. The goal of the Chemical Weapons Convention is to create \na sufficient web of deterrence and detection capabilities so as to \nminimize the potential threat that chemical weapons pose to U.S. and \nglobal security. In order to attain this objective, the CWC relies on \nthe most stringent verification regime ever before codified in an \ninternational arms control instrument.\n  The verification measures set forth in the CWC were carefully crafted \nover many years to ensure that the attained transparency in no way \nimpedes private industry's ability to protect proprietary information.\n  In addition, measures for ``challenge inspections''--a verification \nmeasure initially proposed by the Reagan Administration in negotiations \nover a decade ago--allow for inspection at any time and in any place. \nOtherwise, the CWC is rendered incapable of ferreting out undeclared \nactivities. I remind you that this was a weakness of the nuclear \nnonproliferation regime that Iraq successfully exploited to hide a \ncovert weapons program.\n  The proposed CWC implementation legislation, attached to H.R. 2709 \n``Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997,'' seriously weaken \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention in such a manner as to pave the way for \nrogue nations to capitalize on U.S. short-sightedness.\n  There are several aspects of the proposed legislation that are \nproblematic. First, however, the following is clear: if the U.S. Senate \nratified an international ban on poisonous gases, it makes no sense for \nthe Administration to have negotiated legislation that renders the \nConvention impotent. Secondly, the U.S. Senate cannot ratify a treaty \nand then renege on its own commitment to provide effective and \nreasonable measures for implementation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes three provisions that are of \nconcern:\n  (1) First, there is a measure that allows for the President to refuse \na challenge inspection on the grounds that it ``may pose a threat'' to \nU.S. security interests. Presumably, Hussein did not want UNSCOM in his \nPresidential palaces for similar reasons. Other countries would no \ndoubt follow suit. The White House is claiming that this is \n``harmless,'' because they do not intend to invoke it. If there is no \nintention to use it, then including this provision merely opens the \ndoor for other nations to follow our lead and diminishes our capacity \nto catch cheaters.\n  The CWC provisions on challenge inspections preclude abuse of the \nchallenge inspection option. The treaty incorporates stringent measures \nto ensure that confidential or classified information remains secure. \nMoreover, the CWC provides penalties for any state that might opt to \ninvoke a frivolous challenge inspection.\n  (2) Another dangerous aspect of the legislation is found in the \nprovisions on routine inspections and sampling. Again, the verification \nmeasures and procedures of the CWC were painstakingly crafted to ensure \nprivacy and confidentiality. Also, the ability to detect cheating at \nboth declared and undeclared facilities is critical to the viability of \nthe regime.\n  The proposed implementing legislation before the Senate allows for \nonly one inspection per year at industrial plants. The treaty allows \nfor two. This is a critical point. Given the number of facilities \nworldwide that will require inspection by a relatively small, highly \nqualified cadre of inspectors, most facilities will only be inspected \nonce a year. However, the treaty allows for two routine inspections in \ncase something suspicious or inexplicable is unearthed in the results \nfrom the first inspection.\n  The persons drafting this legislation may have assumed that they \nwould be sparing U.S. chemical facilities from the tedious drill of \ncoping with more inspections than necessary. However, this view is \nshort-sighted and will hinder the inspectorate's ability to identify \ncheaters. Again, other countries will follow the U.S. lead.\n  Should inspectors come across suspicious evidence in another country \nand desire more information to clarify the activities at a foreign \nfacility, the only option at that point would be to wait a year OR \ninvoke a challenge inspection. A lot of deadly chemicals can be \nproduced in a year.\n  In addition, challenge inspections were thought to be necessary to \nunearth undeclared clandestine activities. In all likelihood, invoking \na challenge inspection will be fraught with tension. Do we want to \nescalate every unclear circumstance at any facility in any country to \nthe level of a challenge inspection, when the original provisions of \nthe CWC provide the means necessary to avoid this?\n  (3) One last provision within this legislation requires adjustment. I \nremind you, once again, CWC was carefully crafted to provide measures \nfor stringent and comprehensive verification. The redefinition found in \nthe implementing legislation would undoubtedly narrow the number of \nU.S. facilities required to make declarations. Please bear in mind, the \nU.S. cannot hold other countries to standards that we ourselves are not \nwilling to meet.\n  Most commercial products have a mixture of chemicals in them. For \nexample, a ballpoint pen contains a chemical that could be extracted \nand used to make poison mustard gas. Under CWC provisions, chemical \nmanufacturers are required to include in their initial and annual \ndeclarations the production of mixtures with a low\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nconcentration in so-called Schedule 3 chemicals. U.S. chemical industry \nrepresentatives and U.S. government officials agreed that 30% or less \nof a Schedule 3 chemical in a mixture constitutes a low concentration.\n  The U.S. implementing legislation changes that figure to 80%. In \nother words, substantially fewer U.S. facilities will be subject to \ncompleting annual declarations or inspections. The same will hold true \nfor other countries that follow our example of assuming that 80% is a \nlow concentration. We thereby increase the likelihood that \nproliferators will use industrial facilities to mask chemical weapons \nactivities, averting detection.\n  The Chemical Manufacturers Association was extensively involved in \ndesigning the CWC verification measures. Chemical Manufacturers in this \ncountry were a strong and vocal group in support of this treaty. They \nconsistently urged that stringent and comprehensive verification \nprovisions be included in the treaty. The U.S. chemical industry did \nnot ask for these provisions to protect their interests so who, then, \ndo these provisions protect? The answer is simple: The provisions in \nthe U.S. implementing legislation protect those who want to cheat on \nthis treaty.\n  These restrictions on routine and challenge inspections will \ninevitably backfire on U.S. security interests. Keeping in mind that \nthe U.S. is setting an example with its implementation of the treaty's \nprovisions, these restrictions provide a great deal more latitude \nwithin which a rogue nation can maneuver to hide a chemical weapons \nprogram.\n  Intelligence sources repeatedly identify over two dozen states that \neither already have or are attempting to attain chemical weapons \ncapability. In its first year, the CWC has begun to reverse that trend. \nIn view of our most recent experience in Iraq, there is little reason \nto assume that lax verification measures for detecting or deterring \nweapons of mass destruction designs or capabilities will serve U.S. \ninterests.\n  At this time, the U.S. itself is already in violation of the CWC, \nbecause it has failed to pass implementing legislation and commence \nwith declarations and inspections. The U.S. Administration has come \nunder intense pressure from Japan, China, Australia and the European \nUnion to proceed.\n  The U.S. chemical industry is confronting pressures from their \ntrading partners overseas, because it has not yet been subject to \ninspection. States that are complying fully with the CWC's reporting \nand inspection requirements are threatening to stop inspections on \ntheir territory if the United States, which has the world's largest \nchemical industry, does not soon allow inspections of that industry to \nproceed.\n  Due to these pressures, the U.S. chemical industry and the \nAdministration want action now. However, we cannot allow these \npressures to distract us from the fundamental problems with this \nimplementing legislation. Short-sightedness on issues of U.S. and \ninternational security can be very dangerous over the long haul.\n  Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem are the most serious threat to U.S. security today. The aims of \nthe Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act are laudable and I fully \nsupport them. I supported the Chemical Weapons Convention last year, \nand I would wholeheartedly support passage of reasonable and effective \nimplementing legislation for that treaty. Due to the pressures that our \nchemical industry is confronting and our current violation of the \nConvention, I will also support this legislation.\n  However, I will not do so without pointing to the hypocrisy of \nsanctioning entities who proliferate missile technology to Iran, and, \nat the same time, passing implementing legislation that opens the door \nfor chemical weapons proliferators.\n  It is essential that we impede the flow of missile technologies to \nIran. It is also critical that we pass implementing legislation and \njoin the international community in eliminating chemical weapons and \ndetecting defectors. However, it is critical that we do it right. This \nCWC legislation is all wrong. I would like to work with my colleagues \nto improve this implementation regime in the near future. Otherwise, \nour overzealous desire to shield ourselves will ultimately be used by \nthose we would like to protect ourselves against.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire, if all time has been yielded back, \nthe amendment has been accepted, are we not ready to proceed to the \nvote on final passage?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time on the bill is also yielded back, \nwe are prepared to do exactly that.\n  Mr. KYL. There is no time on this side. I do not know about the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe the Senator from \nDelaware has 8 minutes remaining on the bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will, in a moment, yield back the time I \nhave left.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by suggesting, again, I think this is \nthe wrong time to do this. I think it has its greatest value held in \nabeyance, as long as significant progress is being made. I am fearful \nif this is signed into law by the President, in the near term it is \ngoing to have the exact opposite impact. But in the interests of \naccommodating people's schedules--although I am not sure how much we \nare going to accommodate because I am told there will be insistence \nthere be a vote on the highway bill, and if that is true, we are not \nbeing able to accommodate anybody's time. But I am delighted to yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Actually, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. We are \nprepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to announce that the \nAppropriations Committee will hold a meeting at 2 o'clock to discuss \nISTEA, and until that meeting is over, I will object to any proceedings \non ISTEA.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say, because I know everyone is interested in this, \nthis is a critical moment on a very important bill. The managers of the \nISTEA II legislation have labored late into the night and all morning \ntrying to make sure Members are aware of what is in the bill. I think \nthey have done a good job. It might not be perfect in anybody's eyes, \nbut we need to get it done. We need to get it done this afternoon.\n  There will be an opportunity for Members to express themselves, but I \nbelieve for all concerned the wise thing to do is to go to this bill as \nsoon as we can, have a limited debate, and vote. It won't be easier on \nSunday afternoon at 4 o'clock. It won't be easier in a week or a month.\n  I think we need to complete this legislation. We will work on both \nsides, as we have all along, to make sure that Members are satisfied \nwith what we try to do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks just made by \nthe majority leader. We have 20 or 25 Senators, all of whom have planes \nto catch this afternoon, who don't want to miss this vote. I certainly \nhope that we wouldn't inconvenience a third to half of the Senate as we \nget to this crucial time.\n  I hope everybody will cooperate and work with us. We have to get this \nlegislation done. My hope is that we won't leave until we get it done. \nI hope we could seek cooperation on both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Where is the report?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have the managers here on the floor that \nhave worked on this legislation who are prepared to begin to discuss \nthe legislation, to answer questions, and be prepared to go to a vote \nwhen the Senators are ready to do that.\n  I don't know the physical location. I presume that will be available.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As I understand, no one lives further from the Senate \nthan I do and I have a wife waiting for me halfway home.\n  However, I am also a conferee. I have not seen the conference report. \nI was not given even the privilege of deciding whether I should sign \nthe conference report. I do not know for sure what is in the bill as \nfar as the jurisdiction of the committee I happened to chair at the \ntime. I have not waited almost 30 years to be the chairman of this \ncommittee to see it emasculated in 5 minutes because people have to get \na plane home.\n  Mr. LOTT. In response to the Senator from Alaska, I understand that \nhe wants to see what is in it. I think he will like what he sees in it, \nboth for him and his constituency and the country as a whole.\n  This is over a $200 billion bill that is needed in this country for \nsafe, decent roads, bridges, and mass transit. We have drug it out for \nweeks and months and it is time to act.\n  Now, does every Senator deserve a right and an opportunity to see the \nformula and see how each State does and look at what it means for the \nAppropriations Committee and every committee? Yes, let's do it. Let's \ndo it now. You will have an opportunity to look at this, and others \nshould. But it is time that we get serious and get it done in a \nreasonable time in the best interest of America.\n  My father died on a narrow, two-lane road that wasn't safe and I am \nnot going to stand any longer for us having inadequate roads and \nbridges in this country and for money to be sometimes spent in other \nplaces.\n\n  I am bending a little bit here, but I think everybody in this Chamber \nknows I tried to listen to everybody's needs, concerns on both sides, \non tough legislation this week and this year. I am sympathetic. I \nwanted to look at the numbers. I have. I haven't seen the report. I \ndon't know whether it is perfect. But it has been a laborious, tough, \ninvolvement and it is time that we bring it to a conclusion. Help me do \nthat.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. Leader, I regret deeply the death of your father. I \nhave similar feelings when cancer comes before the Senate because my \ngrandfather, father and brother all died from cancer. I understand \nthose feelings.\n  However, I also understand that our committee has responsibility for \nthe controllable expenses. This bill reduces controllable expenses, if \nI am told right, by at least 2\\1/2\\ to 3 percent. It further will \nrequire, if I am informed right, that if there is an increase in the \nhighway tax revenues, we must spend them, even if it means changing the \nbudgets for other subcommittees. If there is a decrease and the \nestimates are not met, I am told we will take the money from \ncontrollable accounts and put it in this account to pay for highways at \nthe cost of all the other functions that are controllable.\n  Now, I think that is something that I have a right to look at and \nSenators have a right to debate if they want to do that. I regret \ndeeply being in a position of apparently opposing my leader who I do \nsupport and am committed to, but I feel this process needs to be \nunderstood.\n  Again, I am only reporting what I have been told because I have not \nbeen privileged to have a copy of this yet, despite the fact that I am \non that conference committee. Now, I have been here almost 30 years, \nand I have never seen this happen before. Never.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And it is not going to happen now without me seeing that \nreport.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been here 25 years as a Member of the House and \nSenate and 4 years before that as a staff member. I have never seen a \nhighway bill that was done any differently than this. Maybe this one is \neven a little better.\n  I was getting calls at my home last night until 11:30. Senators were \ninvolved, Congressmen--negotiations going on right downstairs. There \nhave been staff members and Senators and Congressmen coming in and out \nof there.\n  I know the Senator from Alaska, as chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, has seen the computer runs previously.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Not one. You had my staff's estimate of that run. I \nasked repeatedly for a copy of it and the Senator from Rhode Island \nwill tell you, he told me the other day they were not available yet. We \nhad an estimate of the run, and it was run on our own computers.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like you to meet Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I met him at Harvard Law School in 1947.\n  Mr. LOTT. And Senator Warner. We would like you to get together and \nlook at the numbers and the language and I believe you will be happy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Respectfully, Mr. Leader, there have been meetings all \nover this Congress for the last 2 weeks and I have tried to get into \nthem and I was not allowed in. Now, we are going to have a meeting of \nour committee to find out how this affects the appropriations process. \nUntil we know how it does, I hope you will understand, I respectfully \nobject to proceeding with this bill until we have seen a copy of the \nreport.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the easiest thing to do to resolve this problem is \nfor you all to go meet, stop talking about it, get what you need, and \nthen we can go ahead.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry. Is the report before the Senate \nyet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report is not before the Senate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. This applies to the Senator from Rhode Island. While the \nappropriators are meeting and having a chance to review the documents, \nI think this would be a good time for the managers to begin to talk \nabout and explain what is in the bill, what the policies may be, answer \nquestions of Senators. We can begin the process\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\nright now. I believe Senator Daschle thinks that would be a wise move. \nI believe that would be the thing to do at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have charts here and we will make them \navailable for anybody who wishes to see them. I know that most of the \nSenators' staffs have been briefed already today on this. Those \nSenators who have not, we certainly would be delighted to meet with \nthem and go over this chart and give them a copy. I think that is the \nway to do business. It is true that the report is not yet before us, \nand that was understood when we commenced this discussion, with the \nidea to save as much time as we could. The report will be along. \nCertainly, it is a massive report. People are going to have difficulty \nabsorbing it, but those are the time exigencies we are working under at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to what the majority leader said, at this \ntime I will discuss the philosophy behind this legislation and some of \nthe difficulties that we encountered as we proceeded. The philosophy we \nhad in this legislation was to repeat what took place, as far as the \ngeneral philosophical approach in ISTEA I, which passed in 1991. Now, \nin 1991, the first time, we passed a measure that was truly a \ntransportation bill rather than solely a highway bill. In other words, \nthe philosophy in 1991 was to do the best we could to devise a system \nto move people and goods from point A to point B in the most efficient \nand safe manner. So, as I say, it was more than just a highway bill; it \nwas a transportation bill.\n  Mr. President, so thus we have this legislation, which deals not \nsolely with highways, as I said, it deals substantially with mass \ntransit. Likewise, indeed, it encourages what they call \n``intermodalism,'' which is the blending of various methods of \ntransportation. That is where the ``I'' comes from in Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act. That is where the original ISTEA \nacronym came from. We believe we followed out that philosophy in \nconnection with this legislation, which sometimes we call ISTEA II.\n  Mr. President, we then came to the always-difficult part of \ndetermining how to divide up the funds. You have a limited amount of \nfunds, and how do you divide them? So we have a formula that is worked \nout. In that formula, you take into account vehicle miles traveled, \nnumber of lanes, mile lanes in the State, you take into account bridge \nproblems, and a host of other factors, and that becomes the formula.\n  When you run something like that, you frequently end up with \ndifficulties. Not everything comes out just the way you want it. So we \nmade adjustments to the best of our ability. One of the points that was \ncardinal in our approach on this legislation was that all the donor \nStates--that is, the States putting in more than they get back--should \nat least receive-- originally, we strived for 91 cents back on the \ndollar. In other words, every dollar a donor State put in, the effort \nwas made to get 91 cents back because, in ISTEA I, we have a series of \nStates who received back 88 cents, or even less than that in some \ninstances.\n\n  Now, when you try to bring States up from below 90 cents or 88 cents, \nwherever it might be--for example, California, under ISTEA, was at 89 \ncents. You would think just bringing California up 3 cents for every \ndollar put in would be a simple thing. Well, mechanically, it is; but \ncost-wise, it is very expensive. So despite our sincere efforts to get \neverybody 91 cents back on the dollars contributed, the best we could \ndo was 90.5 cents. Therefore, if you look down the list of those \nreceiving moneys, you will find there is no State below the 90.5, and \nthat is a very, very significant achievement. Now, do we have some \nStates who are getting back more than a dollar? Of course, we do. Those \nare the donee States. But we believe that, taking into consideration \nall the factors, we ended up with a fair deal.\n  The average increase that was received across the country was 43 \npercent. That is the increase over ISTEA I. In some instances, States \ngo to more than that. Alabama is at 60.6 cents in increase, for \nexample. Some States were less. But that is what comes about when you \nstrive to reach as much fairness as possible.\n  Let me say, there are frequently distorting factors that get into \nthese equations. What would be an example of a distorting factor? A \ndistorting factor would be a State that had received very, very \nsignificant additional amounts in a prior year--that is, when the \nformula was worked out under ISTEA I. Pursuant to that, that State \nreceived either a monstrous amount of projects, or very significant \namounts of other moneys coming from various sources that distorted the \npicture of that State, so that you could not take that State with the \nvery high additional amounts that it had received through projects, \ngrants, project moneys, and expect to get a 40-percent increase on top \nof it. So that accounts, in some instances, for the fact that some \nStates would be considerably lower than the 43-percent increase over \nISTEA I.\n  So, Mr. President, I am prepared to talk with anybody about this. As \nI say, I think many staffs have been briefed. We have tried to keep \ncertainly the conferees from the Environment and Public Works Committee \nbriefed as we went along. We had a whole series of meetings to try to \nkeep them briefed. It is true that when you do negotiations like this, \nyou don't have 65 people from each side in the room. There has to be a \nlimited number of negotiators in order to get moving along. We were \nfortunate in our negotiations. We always included, every step of the \nway, the ranking member and representatives from his side of the aisle. \nLikewise, I was tremendously assisted in this by the chairman of the \nsubcommittee dealing with this subject. That is, the Infrastructure \nSubcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nWarner of Virginia. It so happened that the ranking member of the full \ncommittee is also the ranking member on that Infrastructure \nSubcommittee. So that Senator Baucus was, in fact, wearing two hats.\n  Mr. President, I think the result is not everything all our way. No; \nit isn't. But that is what happens when you get into negotiations.\n  One of the things I am very glad about is that some of the language \nthat was in the House bill was not accepted. In other words, it was \ndropped. Of course, there are some things that we had that were \nlikewise dropped. But some of the provisions--for example, the so-\ncalled ``mid-cost correction''--which would reopen this whole subject \nin 3 years we felt was not constructive. To go through all of this \nanother 3 years from now would not be something we would countenance.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the distinguished ranking member \nand have him address his remarks to what we have been undertaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to first compliment the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Chafee, who has done, I believe, an \nextraordinary job. I wish Members of the Senate who were not in the \nconference committee could have watched the proceedings. They would \nhave seen the chairman set a very civil, gracious, and respectful tone. \nThat was the tone of the conference. Sometimes conferences get pretty \nacrimonious. This one was not at all.\n  Just a brief summary of the bill, Mr. President, on where we are.\n  This is truly a historic bill. That is a term that many Members of \nCongress use somewhat loosely around here. But this one really is. And \nI think even compared to the last ISTEA bill, this is historic. Let me \ntell you why.\n  For the first time, all the dollars that we as citizens pay in fuel \ntaxes when we put gasoline in our cars, or diesel fuel in our pickups, \nwill go into the highway trust fund. And all the dollars that come out \nof that trust fund will go back in the form of highway allocation, or \nmass transit allocation. We are not changing the distribution between \nmass transit or highways. But, again, all the dollars that come into \nthe trust fund paid for by gasoline taxes will come out of the trust \nfund through to the State's allocation for their various highway \nprograms, or, in the case of the mass transit account, to\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nthe mass transit account. That is a major change from the current \npractice. The current practice, for those of us who fill the gas tank \nand put dollars into the highway trust fund through our gasoline taxes \nand are not sure that those dollars are going to come back in the form \nof highway allocations, sometimes those dollars at the will of the \nCongress and the President are used for other purposes. That will no \nlonger be the case. Dollars in, dollars out.\n  We also wrote into this legislation a guarantee called a ``firewall'' \nto make sure that happens. It is not totally 100 percent guaranteed, \nbut for all intents and purposes, it might as well be.\n  After that huge increase, we have a lot more highway dollars coming \nout, not only because of the guarantee I mentioned but also because \njust recently Congress enacted legislation to ensure that the 4.3 \ncents-per-gallon gasoline tax previously used for deficit reduction is \nnow going into the highway trust fund, which means 4.3 cents more than \npreviously was the case. The rule of thumb basically is that 1 penny of \ngasoline tax--about $1.6 billion, or $7 billion--goes into the highway \ntrust fund. This is a big increase. On average, States will receive \nabout a 43-percent increase in highway funds for each of the next 6 \nyears compared with what they have received in the past 3 years. It is \nagain for those reasons.\n\n  I might also say that the attempt of the conferees, which I think was \nmet, was for regional balance. This process started in the Senate about \na year ago. Senator Warner from Virginia, myself, Senator Chafee, and \nSenator Moynihan, also for all intents and purposes, introduced \nseparate bills representing different parts of the country, each part \nhaving generally a different point of view. Senator Warner was \nessentially concerned proportionally more about the donor States; that \nis, those States which historically have been receiving from the trust \nfund considerably fewer dollars than they have been putting in.\n  Then there are the Western States, and small States which have unique \ncircumstances because of low population density, and sometimes wide \nspaces, which also have a certain point of view.\n  Then, third, there are the Northeast States by and large--I grant you \nthese are very rough estimates and a very rough explanation. But the \nNortheast States, which are more densely populated historically, \nreceive quite a bit of highway funds as well as mass transit funds.\n  We try to give balance in this bill, first by ensuring that the donor \nStates, those that would put so much into the highway trust fund but \nreceiving a lot less, are guaranteed essentially 90 cents on the \ndollar--90.05 cents. There are some adjustments. That is basically it.\n  In addition, small States receive what small States believe would be \na fair share. It is true that the Northeastern States don't get the \nsame, on average, percent increase. But that is, to be honest about it, \nbecause those States in the previous ISTEA bill got quite a large chunk \nof money compared with other portions of the country.\n  So this is a guarantee to even things out.\n  For those who are concerned about the environmental provisions, let \nme say that this bill is environmentally sound.\n  There is the congestion mitigation account, which has more dollars in \nit than the previous ISTEA bill.\n  So the dollars are there for cities which do not meet the Clean Air \nAct standards--additional dollars--to undertake the various \nexpenditures to reduce air pollution in their cities. That is there.\n  The enhancement provision is still fully funded. Those who are \nconcerned about bike paths and trails are also going to be, I think, \nhappy with the provisions in this bill.\n  We also rejected in the final hours some provisions which I think \nwould have been very harmful to the environment.\n  There has been some talk about the PCB problem in New York. That was \nrejected. It is not in here.\n  I can list other attempts. I know some of the environmental \nconservation committees are worried about what was attempted to be put \nin this bill and the conferees rejected.\n  I might also just outline and remind us that each of us, as a \nSenator, is worried about fighting for our respective States. That is \nour job, that is what we ran for office for, and that is what we hired \nout to do--to represent our States the best we possibly can.\n  As you know, Mr. President, most Senators are not wallflowers. Most \nSenators are good advocates for their States. They are fierce advocates \nfor their States, which obviously means that it is hard to get 100 \npoints of view all accommodated, particularly when each State thinks it \nhas a unique point of view that makes it a little bit different from \nother States. Add to that the further complication that there is \nanother body; there is a House of Representatives. We in the Senate \npass what we think is the best legislation for our States. The highway \nbill that passed the Senate passed by a very large margin. Senators \nliked the bill. It was good for our respective States and was a good \ncompromise for all our States. But House Members have a very different \nview on the highway program compared to Senators. It is, very simply, \nbecause we Senators represent entire States; House Members don't \nrepresent entire States, except for a very few. There are about five or \nsix very-low-populated States, like my State of Montana, which has only \none Member of Congress. But most Members of Congress, who tend to be \nfrom populous States, such as New York, California, and Florida, for \nexample, are really much more interested in their districts; what is \nthe highway bill going to do for their districts, rather than for their \nStates? Of course they care about their States. They care deeply about \ntheir States. But I dare say they probably care a little bit more about \ntheir district. After all, they run for reelection every 2 years. They \nwant to show, legitimately and properly, to their constituents, the \npeople who voted for them--or perhaps didn't vote for them--that they \nare doing the best job they possibly can for their district, which \nmeans the formulas, as the allocations, somewhat clash.\n\n  Senators are worried about Senate distribution. Senators are worried \nabout State distribution. House Members are worried a little bit about \nState distribution, but quite a bit about how much their districts get. \nHence, we have this phenomenon called demonstration projects. It is \ndifficult to meld these two competing points of view together.\n  I mention all of this because as we in the Senate are here, now, \nvoting on this conference report which is about to be before us--as we \nlook at it, we might find it is not exactly what we would have \npreferred. It is not exactly the bill that passed the Senate. But when \nMembers of the Senate look closely at what is in this conference \nreport, I think they will find it is very close to the provisions that \npassed the Senate and should not be distressed. Certainly, it is \nimportant to point out that every State but for one, which is a very, \nvery special case, will receive a significant increase in dollars per \nyear allocated to the State. The average increase, and I must underline \nthe word average, is about a 43-percent increase for all the States. \nThat is not a small number. It is a large number. It means, for \nexample, that it is increased from 28----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So it, the current program, is roughly $18 billion, the \ncurrent ISTEA which expired. This bill is $26 billion, roughly; hence, \nroughly a 43-percent increase. And a State, on average, will receive \nthat 43-percent increase. So, while there are little ``i's'' that are \nnot dotted properly according to some Senators, or ``t's'' that are not \ncrossed properly according to some, I submit this is a good bill. It is \ngood for the country. It repairs a lot of needed repairs. There are a \nlot of roads in our country that need repair and curves that need to be \nstraightened out--in addition to our very good environmental programs \nin this bill. I just hope the Senate, when we see the conference report \nfrom the House, acts on it very quickly because then we will have \nfinished our business, people home will be proud of what we have\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\ndone, and we can get on to other business when we come back after \nrecess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished senior \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on this highway \nbill. Seeing there is no one else here, I will not limit time. But I \nwant to, first of all, congratulate the chairman of the committee and \nthe Senator from Montana, the ranking member, at having done what I \nthink is an excellent job with a most difficult issue, an issue where \nyou take a vast amount of money that comes in from gas taxes and seek \nto put it into a formula that is fair to all the States, and yet \nadheres to the purpose of the thing, which is an interstate highway \nprogram that runs from coast to coast, that runs from Mexico to Canada, \nand that does all the things that an interstate program is supposed to \ndo. So there does need to be some adjustment, in terms of the dollars, \nwith respect to the various States.\n\n  It is most difficult. I am here to support the bill. I think it is \nwell done. Also, to remind Members that this committee has been working \nin this area for more than a year. This bill was brought to the Senate \nmore than 2 months ago and passed, I think almost unanimously, and this \nproposition that comes before us today is very similar to what was \npassed here in the Senate.\n  One of the difficult parts, procedurally, of course, is that \nsomething quite different was passed originally in the House. In order \nto get this done, there has to be some conference. There has to be some \ncommunication. There has to be some allocation of differences between \nthe House and Senate, and they were extreme, those differences, \nparticularly in the area of the so-called demonstration projects, all \nabove the formula line.\n  So it has been a very long process and one that has been tedious, one \nthat has been difficult. I sympathize, I think, with the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee in his feeling of not having been as \ninvolved as he would have liked to be. I suspect that is probably true \nof all of us. This is a large bill. It will be out here soon. We are \nsaying, my gosh, we are being asked to vote in an hour or two on a bill \nof that kind? But the fact is, the real issues have been known for some \ntime. The real issues have been talked about. The real issues have been \nin the daily reports. The real issues have been done by our staffs. So \nit is not a surprise.\n  Of course we don't know all the details, and unfortunately I have to \nsay: How many of these bills that are 18 inches high has everybody read \non the other issues? But the principles are there. And the principle is \nto try to spend about the amount of money that comes in on gas tax for \nhighways; that is fairly reasonable--or for transportation. The idea of \nguaranteeing that each State will have 90.5 percent of what they paid \nin, that is pretty basic. We know that.\n  We have some things in there that I think are very important to all \nof us. We have increased the money that goes to national parks. All of \nus have national parks. And certainly if we don't have them in our \nState, we all use national parks and enjoy national parks. They have no \nother source for funding, and that is good. For Federal lands, of \ncourse, to the Presiding Officer and I, representing a State that is 50 \npercent Federal ownership--and some others are substantially higher--\nFederal land money is very important.\n  So these are the principal things that are there. These are the \nthings that we know about. I think we have to remember that the \ndeadline for reauthorization has passed. It passed last January. We had \na temporary bill that went into place until the first of May. This is \nsomething that makes it impossible, if we do not have a bill, for \nStates to go ahead and plan. And that is particularly true for those of \nus who live in the northern part of the country where we have a \nrelatively short construction time, and States need to know what kind \nof money they will have to deal with. So I think it is vital that we \nget into this bill, that we find out the basic points that we need to \nbe informed on, and that we move forward and, frankly, do this before \nwe go on this recess.\n\n  I guess, as a practical matter, we can go on the recess and we will \nnot know a great deal. The issues will still be about the same when we \ncome back. The issue is not so much a matter of understanding as it is \na matter of not everyone is going to be perfectly happy. In \nMassachusetts, for example, they had a huge allocation before, for a \nspecial project, so their formula this year looks a little strange \nbecause they don't have that huge project in.\n  So there is an effort to make it that way. So I hope we move forward. \nWe have really been through this business of talking about whether we \nare going to spend the gas tax on highways or not. We went through \nthat. We voted on that. We are ready to move forward. This is a very \ncomplicated program. I believe it is a good one. I believe the \ncommittee has done very well, and I urge my friends in the Senate to \nmove forward and complete this discussion today.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been a member of the conference \ncommittee on the ISTEA bill, and I want to express my appreciation to \nall those who played a leadership role in writing this legislation.\n  North Dakota is profoundly dependent on Federal support to maintain a \nstrong road system in our State. As all of my colleagues know, we have \na big area and we have a sparse population. If we are going to have a \nnational road system, we have to have a national program.\n  I can tell my colleagues, it would be pretty grim going across North \nDakota without the Federal Highway Program. Instead, we really have an \noutstanding network of roads across our State, although they are in \ndeteriorating condition. You cannot drive around my State without \nnoticing that the condition of our highway network is deteriorating, \nand deteriorating markedly. That is why it was so critically important \nthat there be additional resources for the road and bridge program in \nthe country and why I am so pleased at the result of the conference \ncommittee.\n  We have seen a very significant increase in funding. On average, \nStates will receive a 44-percent increase. I am pleased my State will \ndo somewhat better than that, but it is very much needed. Our State \nwill receive $171.5 million a year. Under the previous program, we have \nbeen getting $111 million a year. So that is a substantial increase. It \nis very much needed in order to catch up with the maintenance \nconditions that currently exist in the State.\n  I will say, Mr. President, that there is a part of this funding \nmechanism that does concern me, and that relates to the question of the \nfunding. I am concerned about that part of the funding that comes out \nof the veterans' program. There is a group of us who opposed that \nfunding mechanism in the Budget Committee and who opposed that funding \nmechanism on the floor of the Senate when we had an amendment to try to \nchange it. I assure veterans in my State that we will take further \nsteps to try to redress the wrong that is done with respect to that \nfunding source in the highway legislation.\n  With that one exception, I think it is very important to thank those \nwho have been the leaders on this matter. The Senate bill was far \nsuperior to the House bill, and we should thank Senator Chafee and \nSenator Baucus for their very strong leadership in allowing us to have \na bill that is much closer to the Senate bill than to the House bill.\n  I thank our colleagues who were members of the conference committee, \nand I especially thank Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I add my congratulations and my thanks to \nSenator Chafee and Senator Baucus especially. My colleague, Senator \nConrad, has described how important this piece of legislation is. I \nknow both the chairman and ranking member\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\nworked very hard for a long, long while to make sure that the result \nwas a result that is fair to all parts of this country.\n  A lot of people don't think much about road issues. Not many people \nthink about roads when they are driving on a good road. They don't \nthink about roads much until they hit a bad road. They don't think \nabout bridges until they read a story or see a bridge that is in \ndisrepair or has fallen down and caused a loss of life.\n  The investment in this country's infrastructure--roads and bridges--\nis critically important. In a State like North Dakota, that is 10 times \nthe size of Massachusetts in landmass, yet with only 640,000 people \nliving in the State, it is very difficult for us to maintain a broad \nnetwork of roads and infrastructure without the kind of investment that \nwill be made possible in this legislation.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, mentioned the increase \nin funding that will exist with this legislation--from $111 million a \nyear to about $170 million a year, just in excess of a 50-percent-per-\nyear increase. That comes from the gas taxes that people pay when they \ndrive up to the gas pumps and fill their car. That gas tax is used to \ninvest in this country and invest in its infrastructure--roads and \nbridges. That is what makes possible this kind of legislation.\n  This is a wonderful step forward. I know some debated the size and \ndebated the formula, but the fact is, this is the kind of investment \nthat makes you feel this is a better country because of it. If you go \nto other countries--I won't mention them--if you go to a half-dozen or \ndozen other countries and drive on their roads, you immediately \nunderstand that they have trouble financing their infrastructure. Their \nroads are in disrepair, full of potholes, some barely built, some not \ngraveled.\n  All you have to do is look at a country's infrastructure to see what \nkind of country it is. Is it a country which devotes the resources to \nroads and bridges and the things that make transportation possible and \nthe transportation of grain and commodities and items of commerce back \nand forth possible? The answer is yes. One of the important things \nabout this bill is, we decided long ago that transportation should be \nnational in scope. If you are going to haul fresh fish or frozen shrimp \nfrom the State of Washington to the State of Maine, you are going to \nneed roads across the center of the country, even if it is not very \npopulated. Yes, you might drive through Wyoming and North Dakota. There \naren't many people there. It is a lot less crowded than New York and \nCalifornia. But the roads to get from here to there are just as \nimportant as a mile of road in New York City. That is what the need of \na national highway program is all about.\n  When Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to build an interstate highway \nsystem, he didn't say, let's spend all that money just where people \nlive; he said, we are going to build an interstate highway system and \nwe are going to build it to connect the entire country, and we are even \ngoing to make that investment in sparsely populated States because that \nis what allows people to move around this country.\n  That is the long way of saying this is a good bill and advances the \ninterests of our country.\n  Let me make one final, quick point.\n  I have worked 5 years on a small piece of legislation that probably \nwill not mean much to some, but it is in this piece of legislation we \nwill consider this afternoon. In five States, it is perfectly legal in \nAmerica to put one hand on the driver's wheel of a car and another on a \nfifth of whiskey. Drink and drive and you are perfectly legal. You just \ncan't be drunk. No problem drinking while you drive. In 22 States, if \nthe driver can't drink, it is fine for the people in the back seat or \nthe person in the front seat next to the driver to drink while you \ndrive.\n  For 5 years, I have tried to get that changed. Some say I have no \nright to tell some State that they have to have a prohibition on open \ncontainers in their State. Maybe they think I have no business doing \nthat. I have a right to say to anybody anywhere in this country who \ndrives into an intersection in any city, any State, that they ought to \nhave some reasonable expectation they are meeting a car in which the \ndriver isn't drinking or in which there isn't alcohol being consumed in \nthe car. We have a right to aspire to that in this country as a sense \nof national purpose.\n\n  Drunk driving is a major problem in this country. Every 30 minutes, \nanother family receives a call. My family received the call. A loved \none was killed in a drunk-driving accident. Every 30 minutes, every \nhour, every day. This is not some strange and mysterious illness for \nwhich we do not have a cure. We know what causes it, and we know what \ncures it.\n  This piece of legislation today includes a provision that States will \nenact a prohibition on open containers, and it has a sanction if they \ndo not. The sanction is not quite as strong as I proposed, but, \nnonetheless, it is still a sanction.\n  This advances some things that I have felt strongly about and worked \non for 5 years. The Senate voted on this provision. It was somewhat \ncontroversial, but it passed the Senate, and I am very pleased that, in \nthe conference with the House, we were able to keep this provision. I \nalso know that because this provision exists and because this Congress \ntook this step, lives will be saved. I commend those who worked with me \nto fight for that piece of legislation.\n  Finally, let me say thanks again to all of those who worked so hard. \nA lot of folks worked around the clock a couple days on this. Their \nnames probably will not be called on the Senate floor, but thanks to \nthem for their commitment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are only going to have an hour when the \nbill comes over, if that. I know many of my colleagues are eager to \nstart the Memorial Day recess. I thought I might do a good turn for \nsome people who have tickets to go ahead and speak now on the highway \nbill rather than waiting for my assigned time, which has been \npreviously reserved under a unanimous consent request, to speak on the \nbill. So as a matter of courtesy to my colleagues, I wanted to go ahead \nand speak now.\n  Mr. President, we have before us a highway bill that will have a \nprofound impact on our country. I am very proud of this bill. I am \nproud to have played a small role in making this bill happen.\n  I started 2 years ago in an effort to convert our tax system on \ngasoline into what I would call honesty in taxation. We had a situation \nwhere for almost a decade Americans were being told that when they \nbought gasoline and paid taxes, that that money was going to build \nroads.\n  And yet last year, roughly 25 cents out of every dollar of gasoline \ntaxes ended up going to general government to fund everything, except \nhighways.\n  And yet, when Americans went to the filling station and stood there \npumping gas in their car or truck, they could read right on the \ngasoline pump the bad news, that a third of the price of a gallon of \ngasoline was taxes, and the good news, that at least the taxes went to \nbuild roads. The only problem, as is often true with government, the \nbad news was true; the good news was not true.\n  I was able to get an amendment on the Finance Committee bill cutting \ntaxes last year that shifted all revenues from gasoline taxes into the \nhighway trust fund. Senator Byrd and I started a crusade at that moment \nto guarantee that the money collected in gasoline taxes that went into \nthe trust fund was actually spent on highways. That crusade has reached \na successful conclusion with the adoption of this bill. Under this \nbill, every penny collected in gasoline taxes over the next 6 years \nwill be obligated to be spent on highways and on mass transit in this \ncountry.\n  The net result is a dramatic increase in resources to build new \nroads, to maintain the roads we have, and it is literally true that \nthousands of lives will be saved as a result of the adoption of this \nbill and the increased resources. It is true that millions of hours \nthat people would have spent snarled in traffic will be saved so that \nthey can spend more time at work earning a living, so they can spend \nmore time with their families doing the things that\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nparents want to do, spending time with their families and enjoying the \nfruits of their labor.\n  A second achievement of this bill is that we have taken a long step--\nbig step--toward eliminating inequity in the distribution of funds. We \nhave a National Highway System. And I would not have it any other way. \nBut part of the problem with the National Highway System is that when \nyou are building certain sections of interstates or you are building \nbig projects, it produces a situation where some States are donor \nStates, that is sending more money to Washington than they are getting \nback, and other States are beneficiary States, getting more money spent \nin their State during that time period than they received back.\n  My State in recent years has been a donor State. When we were \nbuilding the big east-west interstate highway systems, we were briefly \na beneficiary State. But under the last highway bill, which lasted for \n6 years, Texas averaged getting back only 77 cents out of every dollar \nwe sent to Washington in taxes.\n  One of my goals--and a goal that was championed in this bill by \nSenator Warner--has been a goal of trying to guarantee that no State in \nthe Union will ever get back less than 90 cents out of every dollar \nthey send to Washington to be spent on highways, no matter what \nnational project is being undertaken. We actually did slightly better \nthan that in this bill. But that was our objective. I think it is a \nmajor improvement in highway construction, and I think it is fairer to \nour States than the old system.\n\n  I am, obviously, proud of a provision of this bill which provides \nmoney for border infrastructure and for international trade corridors. \nWe have entered into an international trade agreement with Canada and \nMexico. It has literally filled up my State with trucks hauling goods \nand services back and forth. The good news is that it is creating jobs \non both sides of the border. It has brought great prosperity to my \nState. The bad news is it has literally pounded our roads and highways \ninto dust in many parts of the State. It has made I-35 in my State a \nparking lot for hundreds of miles. And we are looking at a doubling of \nthe truck traffic over the next 7 years.\n  So one of my major priorities in the bill was to begin to provide \nfunding to develop international trade corridors and border \ninfrastructure. We provide $700 million in this bill for that purpose. \nI really see it as the beginning of something bigger.\n  If you look at a map of America and you look at our Interstate \nHighway System, and you stand back from that map, the plain truth is \nthat we, with just a few exceptions, we have an east-west interstate \nhighway system. And what we need to do over the next 50 years is to \nbuild a north-south interstate highway system to go with it. NAFTA will \nrequire that we do that. And I think this $700 million will be a major \nstep in that direction.\n  There are many other provisions of the bill that I could talk about \nthat I am pleased with--greater flexibility for mass transit in my \nState, other provisions that are of a parochial interest. But I will \ntalk about basically the big picture on the bill. The big picture on \nthe bill, in trying to sum it up, is every penny collected in gasoline \ntaxes in the next 6 years will be spent for transportation \ninfrastructure--by dramatically reducing discrimination against donor \nStates, at least within the level you can achieve it, and have a \nNational Highway System. The combination of those two factors--honesty \nin taxation and dramatically reducing the inequity in the distribution \nof funds--will mean that Texas will get 61 percent more money under \nthis highway bill than we did under the previous highway bill. Our \ntotal level will be $11.3 billion.\n  That money is desperately needed in my State, as I am sure the money \nfrom the bill is needed in every State in the Union, to build the \nhighways we need, to maintain the roads we have, to rebuild bridges \nthat are structurally unsound. And obviously this is a very important \nday for me.\n  I want to especially thank Steve McMillin, who has been my staffer \nworking on these issues. It is literally true that his involvement and \ndedication and the hours he has worked, the quickness of his wit, has \nreally been the difference between many of these provisions being in \nthe bill and those provisions not finding their way into the bill. I \nhave been constantly amazed at how well he knows the details of these \nissues.\n  I would also like to say that I appreciate the assistance and the \nwork of two staffers who work for Senator Byrd--Jim English and Peter \nRogoff. I do not think we have any staffers who knew more about the \nsubstance of this issue or did more than they did.\n  Often people who serve in the Senate get great credit for work we do. \nAnd often much of that work is done by our staffs. I wanted to be sure \nto single out these two staffers for Senator Byrd, and Steve McMillin \non my staff who has rendered great service to my State and to the \ncountry.\n  Let me also say it has been one of the great privileges that I have \nhad in public life in working with Senator Byrd on this issue.\n  When we joined forces here I felt it was like having a team of good, \nsolid, strong mules attached to a wagon that has been stuck in the mud \nfor a very long time, stuck in the mud as funds were taken out of the \ngasoline tax and spent on general government, really cheating the \ntaxpayer and deceiving the taxpayer in terms of where money was going.\n  We have worked together for over a year, literally had dozens and \ndozens of meetings with our staffs, together with outside groups. We \nhave worked together to build a nationwide coalition. We have \nundertaken, I believe, the only true bipartisan effort in this \nCongress. We have been successful.\n  Senator Byrd obviously was a critical part of that. It has been a \ngreat privilege for me to have been partners with him on this issue and \nto have an opportunity, at least in this way, to link my name with the \npremier legislator of our generation.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Bud Shuster on this bill. This \nbill, I am sure, in many ways is the culmination of his successful \ncareer in the House. I am sure he hopes to have many other successes. \nBut for the chairman of the Transportation Committee in the House to \nhave put together a bill which achieves one of his lifelong objectives \nas a legislator, to assure that funds that are collected in gasoline \ntaxes end up being spent for the purpose they are collected, this has \nto be, at least to this point, the seminal achievement of his career.\n  I want to thank Senator Chafee for his leadership and his help in \nthis bill. I want to thank Senator Domenici for working to see that we \nguaranteed money for highways, but that we didn't start a new \nentitlement program in the country.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Lott for his leadership in pushing \nthis effort forward. I do think this is an important bill and will \ncertainly go down as one of the most important things we have done in \nthis Congress, one of the most important things we have done in many \nCongresses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just wanted to say where you thank me, \nfor whatever you did, I want to add to that statement to the best of \nour ability we have not sacrificed the other appropriated accounts to \nthe increases in the highway bill. We have found offsets and other \nthings. They could suffer at some time in the future, but what we put \nbefore the Senate when we approved this with the offsets already in \nthere, even with the new programs for veterans that are in here, $600 \nmillion, we will not take the extra money out of the NIH and other \naccounts of government.\n  I told you I wanted to do that and you did not object on the floor, \nbut this is the first time we could actually do it in the bill. We \ncould think about it on the budget resolution, but we could do it on \nthe bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My point, and I will yield the floor on this point, our \nobjective was to guarantee that we spent money on highways, but we \ndidn't want to start a new entitlement program. I think when you try to \ndo something that has not been done before, it is often very difficult. \nBut I think we can take pride in the fact that we do have all of the \noffsets in the bill. We are not going to bust the budget. We didn't \nstart a new entitlement.\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. You said that for the third time. What is it, if it is \nnot an entitlement program?\n  Mr. GRAMM. What it is is an earmarking of funds to be appropriated \nfor the purpose that the tax was collected. The Appropriations \nCommittee must still act for the money to be spent, but we have a \nguarantee that the money cannot be spent on anything else.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield further, there are lots of \nprograms where the taxes are collected for a particular purpose.\n  Take the airports and airways funds, for instance. There is a whole \nseries of them. Those funds come from the appropriations process and \nthey are appropriated.\n\n  You have created an entitlement in this bill, the most massive \nentitlement other than the Medicare trust fund entitlement, that I \nknow. There is no discretion for anyone to change that except by an act \nof Congress, a subsequent act of Congress. There is no individual \nallocation of those moneys to meet needs.\n  The President will submit a budget in January. It will lay out what \nthe highway department believes will be the return as estimated to have \nbeen brought into the Treasury from the year before and it will be \nspent. It will be spent according to this bill. There will be no review \nof what has happened in the year before, and we in the appropriations \nprocess would go over the budget request through the year and in \nSeptember send a bill to the President to spend the money as we \nbelieve--that Congress believed, not the Appropriations Committee, but \nCongress believed--it should be spent.\n  That will not occur because this money will be spent according to the \nbudget received from the Federal Highway Administration every year. \nThat will be done by the Federal Highway Administration under their \nunderstanding of this law for 5 years. It will not be changed except by \nan act of Congress.\n  To this Senator, that is the most stringent entitlement that we have \non the Federal laws in this country, that we have ever had.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say this. We had a long, running battle over this \nissue. We had a long, running battle over this issue. Senator Byrd and \nI put before the Senate the proposition that the money collected in \ngasoline taxes ought to be spent. We thought it was wrong to have it \ndiverted to other uses. We had a choice. The Senate voted \noverwhelmingly for it. We had two ways we could go. As the Senator \nknows, the House wanted to do an entitlement to take it completely out \nof the appropriations process and out of the budget. We rejected that.\n  We tried to find a compromise that would solve both objectives. One, \nnot to take it out of the budget process, not to take it off budget, \nnot to take it out of the appropriations process. But on the other \nhand, to be faithful to the commitment we made that the gasoline tax \nwould be spent.\n  I think, given the commitment the Senate made overwhelmingly on the \namendment that I offered with Senator Byrd, we did as well as we could \ndo in meeting everyone's concern. I am proud of what we have done. I \nthink it is a good compromise.\n  I conclude by again saying what a great privilege it was for me on \nthis bill and my small involvement to work with Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Texas \nhas said. This Senator supported the concept that moneys which come in \nthrough gasoline tax should be spent for the purposes the taxes were \ncollected. We have not had an argument over that.\n  Where we have the argument is over whether there should be a bill \npassed every 5 years that sets absolute corridors for the spending of \nmoney, with no discretion on the part of appropriators or the Congress \nitself to change--6 years, I beg your pardon. That is even worse.\n  The real problem we have with it is flexibility. I still haven't seen \nthe bill. I have come to tell the Senate that I have visited with the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, for whom I do share with the Senator \nfrom Texas our admiration of the Senator from New Mexico as the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. Based upon his understanding of the \nbill, there is not a great problem, at least in the first 2 years of \n1999 and the year 2000 with regard to the nondiscretionary funds that \nare within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee being \nreduced because of the expenditure of more moneys to highways that are \ncurrently estimated.\n  Now, that is our understanding. We haven't seen the language yet. To \nmy knowledge, no one in the Senate yet has read that language. Under \nthe circumstances that we have, I have come to this conclusion after \nhaving the meeting with our committee members and listening to the \nstaffs of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee with \nregard to the impact of this bill on the appropriations process.\n  I will not insist upon the delay of this bill. However, I believe it \nmay set a new unfortunate course with regard to the flexibility and \nexpenditure of taxpayers' money and the ability to use the money for \nthe purposes that have the most need at the time the bill is passed \nannually. This is going to lock us in for 5 years. Again, I am saying \nto the Senate, with I hope at least the understanding of my great \nfriend from West Virginia, this Senator, who is chairman of the \nappropriations bill, intends to look at this bill, examine it very \nclosely, and if it does constrict us so that we do not have the \nflexibility we should have, we will bring before the Senate this year \nan amendment to this bill and we will have it out.\n\n  We are not arguing over whether the highway tax money should be spent \nfor highways; we are arguing how it should be allocated and when the \ndetermination should be made as to what the priorities are for the use \nof that money. This bill will set it for 6 years now. If it went \nthrough the appropriations process, we would determine that annually.\n  I see my great friend here, Senator Daschle, who just went through \nthat horrible flood up in his area. We have disasters in this country. \nWe have earthquakes and floods, and we have enormous tornadoes. We have \nto have discretion to allocate funds in a way that meets the best needs \nof our people as a whole.\n  I do not think that the bill that is going to come before the Senate \ncan be followed without an enormous spillover into the areas of other \nnondefense discretionary funds, which must be allocated by the \nAppropriations Committee annually. What I mean is, I think the effect \nof this bill will be that we will have to constrain other nondefense \ndiscretionary spending in order to accommodate the extraordinary demand \nhere that if the revenues from the gas tax money exceed the caps, \nexceed the estimates, it is going to be spent anyway. And we have a 4-\npercent leeway, what I call a ``fudge factor.'' But if they go up to 10 \npercent, we are going to have to absorb 6 percent of that from other \nnondefense discretionary accounts. That is going to affect every single \nState in the Union adversely. It is going to affect the operations of \nthis Government adversely.\n  I can't tell the Senate it will happen now. I can only tell the \nSenate that, as I understand the way the bill has been written, it \ncould happen. And if it does, I do think that would be a disaster. \nAgain, to a certain extent, I sense a feeling here, particularly from \nmy friend from Texas, that the Appropriations Committee has not \nprovided funds for highways. We have exceeded the amount that came in \nfrom the gas tax in the period of the last 5 years. We have spent more \nmoney through the appropriations process for highways than would be \nspent under this bill for highways, if we had had the allocation of \nfunds that the Budget Committee has generously brought back into this \nprocess and made available for this entitlement.\n  This turf battle that I sense is not coming from our committee. All \nwe are saying is that there is not flexibility here. If the authorizing \ncommittee wants to pass a law saying you are going to allocate this \nmoney, then pass a law saying you are going to allocate it every year. \nBut don't sit around and tell people you have done a good job for the \ncountry when you have allocated for 6 years, based upon an estimate \nthat the two organizations that really are most concerned--OMB and \nCBO--\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\ndisagree, as you know. They have about a $10 billion difference in the \nestimates of expenditures. We are taking the high one, of course; we \nare going to follow the high one. If we were wearing our budget-cutter \nhats, we would take the low one. But here we are spenders, so we are \ntaking the high one.\n  The problem is that one section of this bill says--and I have not \nseen this yet--if the money doesn't come in, we have to make it up. I \nwas just told by one of the staff that that probably is not true. He \nused the words ``flexible guarantees.'' I am going to be anxious to \nread how we write a bill that is flexible every year based upon the \nvariations of one anticipated and estimated revenue, as opposed to \nestimated actual revenues, when either one is any more than an \nestimate. I have to adjust the budget and meet a total cap level under \nthe budget agreement and be subject to a point of order if we are not \nright.\n\n  I say to my friends who have been involved in this, I wish you luck. \nDon't feel surprised if this Senator is back out on this floor this \nyear with amendments to this bill to do it right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will not be long.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from Arizona be \npermitted 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized after the Senator from New Mexico. The Senators speaking now \nare more directly involved in the action going on here. Therefore, they \nwill explain to the rest of us what is occurring. I wanted to ensure \nthat they had an opportunity to speak. I would like the opportunity to \nspeak after the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first say that I think everybody \nknows that I have the highest regard for the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. There should be \nno doubt in this body of my very, very high respect and honor for the \nSenator. Let me repeat. Everybody knows I have the highest honor and \nrespect for Senator Byrd, also. He has known that for a long time. I \nhave to say that Senator Gramm started off to do something and he \ndidn't mince any words. He said what he was going to do. Joining \ntogether with Senator Byrd, he has done that.\n  Now, frankly, I believe I can say to my good friend, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, that this is not what I would have done \nwith reference to trying to minimize the way this fund looks. Does it \nlook more like a real appropriations bill, or does it look somewhat \nlike a mandatory program? I guess I would have to say, for all the \naccolades of trying to keep it from being an entitlement, it probably \nis a bit more on the mandatory side than it is on the appropriations \nside. But at least it does get appropriated every year. There is a \nfirewall, much like the trust fund established for crime by the same \ndistinguished two Senators. If you look in that appropriation bill \nwhere we set aside some of the savings that would be forthcoming from a \nreduction in Federal employees, as I recall, you will find it every \nyear listed as an entrusted amount. If you don't spend it in that \nbill--Senator Judd Gregg's bill now --you can't spend it for anything. \nSo it is there every year.\n  On the other hand, there is some concern that if you put a 5- or 6-\nyear program on track and it is not subject to appropriations review, \nwhich I submit--be it the most in-depth or not--is the only annual \nreview we have around here. Others are done willy-nilly and some don't \nget reviewed for 10 years, and some do often. The truth is that you \ncan't get away without appropriations review every year, because you \nhave to appropriate every year. This is going to have to be \nappropriated every year. So that part is still there. But essentially, \nin the quest to see that every penny of the 4.3 is spent, there is a \nrecognition and a very strong position by the House that the resources, \nthe taxes that are estimated could be up or down from the obligational \nauthority we attribute to them, because if we assume we are using them \nall and then the tax comes in higher, we haven't used them all. If we \nassume they come in lower, then we are spending taxes that didn't come \nin.\n\n  Essentially, what the Senator from Alaska, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, is concerned about is--and I think Senator \nByrd and Senator Gramm, who was an appropriator for part of his life in \nthe Senate, would be concerned--if, in fact, you were obligated to \nspend an amount that represented an increase, because the reality was \nthat the tax was higher and by doing that you had to cut other \nappropriation committees, which would make that excess a mandatory \ndemand on you--well, I told my friend that I didn't read the language \nwhen it was last drafted. I haven't seen it yet. In fact, for that \neventuality, if it is higher than expected and you have to spend it, it \nholds the appropriators harmless. We don't need to talk about what that \nmeans. If you want to say what that does to the caps, you say that, I \nsay to the Senator from Texas; but for the time being, I am saying it \nholds them harmless. I would not have spent the extra amount based on \nestimates. I think we are accurate and I would have used them like we \nhave done in the past.\n  Having said that, obviously, a lot of Senators are not going to be \npleased with the allocations and other things. I didn't have anything \nto do with that. It is not my assignment. I felt somewhat \nuncomfortable. I don't have authorizing authority or appropriation \nauthority. Nonetheless, it fell on me to try to make this a fair bill.\n  When it comes to the appropriations process, I am going to put in the \nreport right now the offsets that are in this bill. It is not bill \nlanguage, but we insisted early on that we offset the increased \nexpenditures from the appropriated accounts, so that by spending more \nmoney, we wouldn't be cutting the appropriated amounts which we have \nset in place by operation of law for a number of years. So we used the \nword ``offsets,'' and we found some.\n  Maybe there will be a further debate on the offsets. I am prepared to \ndebate them. I don't like to be responsible for all of the offsets. \nSome are found by us. I am more than willing to say I think they are \nfair. We have committed ourselves to increasing the expenditures for \nhighways and mass transit and not to diminish the amount of money \navailable for the remainder of domestic expenditures under the overall \nagreement that we made with reference to the budget. That is the best \nthat we can do.\n  That does not mean there will not be added pressure for the \nappropriators because of this. It does mean if you wanted more \nflexibility in the highway programs, you won't have that much. But I \nsurmise that before we are finished there will be some flexibility, \nbecause there are needs.\n  I also want everybody to know, when we have departed significantly \nfrom the obligational authority for highways and mass transit and \nincreased it dramatically in the appropriations bill, for the most part \nit was when we had an emergency. All that money went to freeways that \nwent to highways. It didn't come out of the regular trust fund, nor \nwould it come out of these dollars that are in this bill. You would \nhave an emergency just like you had in the past.\n  I send that little summary to the desk and ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       ISTEA CONFERENCE RESOLUTION\n                     [1998-2003 outlays in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Category                     WODI     Add-ons    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHighways..................................    $139.2     +14.5    $153.7\nMass transit..............................      27.7      +3.0      30.7\n                                           -----------------------------\n      Total...............................     166.9     +17.5     184.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Net of\n                                                  Add-ons      offsets\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOffsets required for add-ons..................      +17.500  ...........\n         Potential Offsets to Add-Ons:\nVeterans tobacco (OMB Scoring)................      -16.969        0.531\nVeterans add-backs (Montgomery GI)............       +1.602        2.133\n                                               -------------------------\n      Veterans net savings....................      -15.367        2.133\nStudent loan extension 3 month................       +0.090        2.223\nReduce Social Services block grant............       -2.423        0.200\n                                               -------------------------\n      Net total offsets.......................      -17.700        (\\1\\)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Not applicable.\n\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First of all, let me say that I think it is a good thing that we are \nfinally beginning to spend gas tax money on the purpose for which the \ntax was collected in the first place; namely, our highway and transit \nsystems in this country. But I don't think it is a good thing that \nthere are winners and losers in the process depending upon who you are.\n  Mr. President, I have a hard time justifying this legislation to my \nconstituents in Arizona who continue to ask me why it is that the \nfastest growing State in the country that sends $1 to Washington in gas \ntax continues to get less than $1 back. As a matter of fact, because we \nare a Western State, there is also supposed to be some consideration \ngiven to the fact that the wide open spaces require more highways, as \nis the case with many of the other Western States. But it is not to be. \nInstead, historically Arizona has gotten 86 cents on the dollar. And, \nunder the original Senate bill, we were supposedly guaranteed that \nArizona would receive the generous sum of 91.5 cents on the dollar. It \nnow turns out that it will be 90.5 cents on the dollar.\n  Mr. President, I am not here asking that Arizona receive something \nextra, unlike a lot of the people who are still negotiating in the \ncloakroom here. I am not asking for money for special projects. But I \nam asking why it is that the donor States--the States that send more \nthan they receive--can't eventually hope to get some equity in this \nprogram. What we are doing here is locking in for 6 years a continued \nunfair program for the 18 or so States that contribute more than they \nreceive.\n  Mr. President, this reminds me a little bit of the ``Animal Farm'' \nstory of George Orwell of 1946. It turns out that all the animals in \nthe barnyard were equal, except that some were more equal than others. \nThat is the way it is with the States of the Union here.\n  As I said, you have a fast-growing Western State like Arizona, the \nfastest in the country, that receives, or would receive under this \nlegislation, 90.5 cents for every dollar sent to Washington.\n  How will some of the other States make out? The majority leader \npointed out that Senator Stevens would probably be pretty happy with \nwhat Alaska got under the bill. Instead, I would be happy if I got $5-\nplus for every dollar that I sent, which is what Alaska will receive. I \nwould be happy if I were in Connecticut and I got $1.52 for every \ndollar I sent; or Delaware, $1.54. These are very small States, by the \nway. Montana, a large State--we are supposed to get a little extra \nconsideration for the size--gets $2-plus back; my fellow Western States \nof New Mexico and Nevada each get more than $1 back--$1.14 and $1.18, \nrespectively. The Senator from West Virginia, his State receives $1.41 \nback. Another small State, Vermont, $1.76; South Dakota, $2; \nPennsylvania, $1.20.\n  It turns out that who you are matters more in this process of \ndeciding how this money that everybody in the country pays-- that \nmatters more than equity.\n  Once we have an opportunity to review the bill--there has been one \ncopy available, and everybody has had to try to sort through that one \ncopy--I think there are going to be a lot of criticisms of how this \nmoney was allocated. There will also be a lot of questions asked, many \nof which have been raised here already.\n\n  How about the offsets? This is all supposed to come out equally, so \nthat we are not spending more than we are taking in. As the Senator \nfrom New Mexico pointed out, we are now going to use the more generous \nOMB figures than the CBO figures which we have always insisted on using \nin the past because we think they are more accurate. That would permit \nus, in effect, to exceed the budget caps.\n  There is a significant question of the appropriators' authority, \nwhich Senator Stevens raised. There are questions about the earmarks. \nAs far as I can tell from the information I have, they don't add up. \nWhen the bill left the Senate, the formulas for the individual State \nprojects called earmarks were supposed to be included within the \nState's formula allocation. But apparently that is not true under this \nbill, at least to the extent of $200 million; I don't know beyond that.\n  Mr. President, probably the most distressing thing about this is that \nmost of the Senators who are going to vote on this will not know what \nis in the bill, and, therefore, they may have a bit of a hard time \nexplaining to their constituents later on when problems are raised why \nthey were in such a hurry to vote on this.\n  We lose nothing by waiting until we have an opportunity to review \nthis. There is authority for States to continue to spend and charge it \nagainst this allocation. That has expired. We can extend that for \nanother 10 days, until we get back.\n  But this bill is over $200 billion, one of the largest spending bills \nthat this Senate, this Congress, will have ever authorized, and yet we \ndon't know most of what is in the bill.\n  As I said, what I do know I don't like, because it appears that once \nagain a few States are being discriminated against in order that other \nStates, which are represented heavily on the committees that make the \ndecisions, will get more than their fair share.\n  Mr. President, I regret to have to be this critical, but I think it \nhas to be said very plainly.\n  When I have an opportunity to find out a little bit more about it, as \nthe staff is now being made available to us--they have been very busy \nworking all through the night, as I understand it, trying to get this \nfinally negotiated--as they are made available to us, we will be able \nto understand some additional information about this. I intend to then \nreturn and comment some more.\n  But I did want to make the point right now that I think this is not a \ngood process. We are hurrying too much. We are spending too much. We \naren't going to be able to offset this, probably, under the estimates \nthat have been provided. There are too many questions. And the numbers \ndon't add up. To the extent that the States that are making \ncontributions in excess of the amount that they receive back and are \nhoping to receive some ultimate relief, it appears that we are locked \nin for a 5- or 6-year period and that is not to be and, therefore, that \nour citizens will continue to be discriminated against.\n  Mr. President, for all of those reasons I am going to be very \ndisappointed to have to change the vote I cast when I supported this \nbill earlier because I thought we were making progress in changing the \nformula. I wanted to assist our leadership in moving toward the concept \nthat the gas tax dollars will at least be spent on highway and transit \nneeds, that I will reluctantly have to vote no on this and just hope in \nthe future, in the interests of States that are donor States here, that \nwe can get a more equitable distribution of these funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I acknowledge the Senator from \nNew Mexico who spoke just a few moments ago. Senator Domenici has been \nvery helpful throughout this whole process. I appreciate the comments \nhe has just made. I appreciate the way he worked with the authorizers \nin trying to develop this formula and to establish the policy for the \nfuture and to deal with the offsets. He has just been tremendously \nhelpful, including working with the Appropriations Committee this \nafternoon. I thank him for his work.\n  A lot of other people here put in effort on this. Senator Bond, \nSenator Gramm, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Byrd, and \nSenator Kerry have been involved in this. There is a long list of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who have been involved in this and \nthere has been a lot of give and take. And some of us were giving, even \nlast night, on some projects for which we were very hopeful.\n  But I want to remind my colleagues, when you might say, ``We could do \nbetter,'' this is the largest infrastructure transportation bill in \nhistory. The formula is more fair than it has ever been before. My \nState got 84 cents on a dollar in the past; it is going to be in the \n90s, like every other State this year. Most States will be getting more \nthan they got over the past 5 or 6 years.\n  So I think we need to get started. There are States in this country, \nin the\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nMidwest and the Northeast, they need to know that they have this money \nand how much so they can get started with projects now. The season is \ngoing to get away from them. So I hope every Senator will keep that in \nmind and allow us to get this to completion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5391-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to say to all Senators, with regard to the \nweek we are coming back. I have been discussing this with Senator \nDaschle. When we complete this infrastructure transportation bill, \nISTEA II, and dispose of that, that will be the last vote or action of \nthis week, other than doing some Executive Calendar matters we are \ntrying to clear. The next vote will not occur until Tuesday when we \ncome back. That would be June 2. But when we return on Monday, June 1, \nwe will continue to debate the tobacco bill, and the pending issue is \nthe Durbin amendment. Of course, there are other amendments that are \npending. We will be talking back and forth over the next week as to \nexactly how the process will go forward.\n  On that Tuesday, the 2nd, the Senate will conduct a cloture vote on \nthe motion to proceed to the nuclear waste bill, which I will put in \nplace in the next few minutes, as well as amendment votes relative to \nthe tobacco legislation.\n  I do want to emphasize, the nuclear waste issue we intend to double \ntrack. That is one where we can take an action and then come off of \nthat and go, then, to other legislation, the tobacco legislation. And \nit will take a period of days to get through the process we have to go \non, on nuclear waste. But that is not intended to take the place of \neither the tobacco bill or the Department of Defense authorization \nbill. It will be double tracking as we go forward.\n  So I expect the Senate will be considering the tobacco bill and the \nnuclear waste bill during the first week in June. If problems arise \nwith regard to either one of those, the other issue that we have \nalready done some work on, and we want to go back to at the first \nopportunity, would be the Department of Defense authorization bill. We \nneed to get that completed so we can then go to the appropriations side \nof the defense bill. I know that first week back will be a busy one \nbecause we have a lot of important work to do. We will be in session on \nMonday, but we will not have recorded votes on that Monday.\n\n  Senator Daschle, did you want to comment or ask a question on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the information the majority leader has \njust shared. I think that is certainly in keeping with the \nunderstanding that he and I have had in our private discussions now for \nsome time. My hope is that we can come back and complete our work on \nthe tobacco bill. I believe that is certainly within our reach.\n  I understand, because of the plethora of other bills that are on the \ncalendar, we have to begin consideration of other issues. We have some \namendments and bills that we want to raise at some point as well. But I \nthink this schedule accommodates the demands that we are going to have \non our schedule for the balance of the month of June, and I am hopeful \nthat we can see the same level of cooperation on both sides of the \naisle with that schedule that we have had over the course of the last 2 \nor 3 weeks.\n  I certainly have no objections to proceeding as the majority leader \nhas suggested, certainly with the expectation that we will complete our \nwork on the tobacco bill early when we come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as I have discussed with the distinguished \nmajority leader, I do not want to slow up the proceedings. I never \nhave. I am trying to simply resolve a couple of last-minute details. So \nI am constrained to object, at least for a few moments, until Senator \nChafee can finish doing what he is doing and we have a chance to \nconfer. I assure my colleagues, this should not be a long-term process, \nand I hope we can resolve it very, very quickly, but I do object at \nthis moment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand, as one of the managers of \nthe bill, we can speak at some length here. But is there desire that \nsomeone wish to have a minute or two?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I was going to use about 2 minutes to thank \nthe distinguished chairman of our subcommittee, the Senator from \nVirginia, and say kind things about him. But if he wishes----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor instantly.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to say a very quick word or two about \nthe TEA-21 , I believe, Transportation Efficiency Act of the year 2000 \nand to express my deep appreciation for the leadership that Chairman \nChafee, Chairman Warner and Senator Baucus have provided. This, as has \nbeen said, is one of the very largest bills that we have acted upon. It \nhas an impact on each of our States and will have for the next 6 years.\n  It has been a very difficult fight to raise the dollars necessary and \nto allocate them fairly. I express the deepest appreciation to all \nthree of my colleagues I mentioned.\n  I want to say what tremendous work has been done by the staff on the \nmajority side, Jimmie Powell, Ann Loomis, Dan Corbett; on the minority \nside, Tom Sliter and Kathy Ruffalo.\n  On my own staff, Tracy Henke has worked literally hundreds of hours \nand has had very little sleep, as all of the staff on Environment and \nPublic Works. They have done an outstanding job.\n  When we started this process, I said there were five essential goals: \nIncrease the funding for highways. We need a bigger pie. We need, for \nthe State of Missouri, to get a fair share. We must upgrade and repair \ndeteriorating bridges. We need to put the trust back into the highway \ntrust fund so that people who pay gas taxes into the trust fund will \nknow that those gas taxes are coming back to build better roads, \nbridges, highways and transportation system. Finally, there should be \nflexibility so the States and localities can get the most for their \nmoney.\n  I am delighted they have approved all those principles. I note for \nthe Record what I have noted in committees, in conferences, in \nindividual discussions. I have grave and deep problems with and do not \nagree with the use of the funds from a newly and administratively \ncreated veterans' smoking program to offset the expenditures of the \nhighway fund. I believe the highway fund should be spent for highways; \nveterans' funds should be spent for veterans. I have fought those \nbattles; I have lost those battles because the President has insisted \non using that as an offset. I intend to come back and work with \ncolleagues, such as Chairman Specter of the Veterans' Committee, \nSenator McCain, Senator Smith and others to put a good veterans health \ncare measure into the next vehicle, and I believe that is probably \ngoing to be the tobacco bill.\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\n  We are going to see that our veterans are cared for. I realize that \noffsets are needed. I do not think we should have taken this one. But \nfor our State, we are going to receive tremendous benefits in Missouri. \nThis is nearly a 53-percent increase in the annual funding for the \nState of Missouri where our roads, highways and bridges are not just a \nmatter of convenience, they are a matter of life and death. Safety \ndepends upon adequate roads.\n  For the first time, we are going to see our share of the funds moving \nup from the low 80 cents per $1 sent in to almost 92 cents. We will see \na structure to ensure the gas taxes will be used for highways and \ntransportation. The flexibility is expanded and for good measure.\n  I thank the leaders for agreeing to my wetlands banking amendment \nwhich will enable us to ensure improved protection for wetlands in \naccommodating the highway construction.\n  Last year, I worked with people on both sides to put through the Bond \nextension which kept the highway funding flowing until May 1 of this \nyear. We have not had contract authority, obligation authority for the \nlast month. I believe the President, through his Secretary of \nTransportation, expressed great appreciation for this measure, and I \nhope that we can pass it today and get it signed by the President so we \ncan go back to rebuilding the roads, bridges and highways that are \nvitally important for our country.\n\n  I thank the leader and thank the leadership of the committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5401-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 2400\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I intend to renew this request about every 2 \nminutes for the remainder of the day, and as soon as we get this \nconsent, I suggest we go to a recorded vote, because there are major \nproblems being caused by this delay and they are only going to grow. In \nthat Senators want to express their interest, concern, appreciation or \nhatred, they will be able to do so at great length.\n  I hope we can get something done here so we can move to this \nunanimous consent request and then move to a vote. Senator Daschle is \nin concert with me on this. It is the right thing for us to do for each \nother and for our country.\n  I will withhold momentarily, but I am going to renew this request in \njust a few minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, while both leaders are present on the floor, as one \nwho has been involved for a year and a half in preparing the \nlegislation which now, hopefully, will be voted upon by the Senate, I \nthank my distinguished colleague, the majority leader, and my \ncolleague, the distinguished minority leader. I just think of how many \ntimes during the course of this conference we have made calls to them \nto seek their guidance that both are entrusted to give as a consequence \nof their very important positions.\n  I also have virtually over the last 7 days and nights worked at the \nside of my distinguished chairman, Senator Chafee, and the \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, as \nwe prepared and then I think very fairly, forcefully and successfully \nadvocated the Senate's position before the House of Representatives.\n  The House was very ably represented by Chairman Shuster, ranking \nmember Congressman Oberstar, Congressman Petri, Congressman Rahall--the \nfour from the House versus the three from the Senate.\n  It was a long conference. Not until late last night did we put in \nplace the final decision for the foundation on which I believe this \nbill rests, and that is equity among the States. Fifteen months ago, as \nchairman of the subcommittee in the Environment Committee entrusted \nwith this important legislation, we embarked on the hearing process for \nthis legislation. We held hearings in seven different States because it \nwas essential to go out and get the views of the people: The citizens, \nthe supervisors, the State legislatures and, indeed, the \nrepresentatives of their legislatures and the Governors themselves. \nSenator Baucus and I actually went to a joint hearing of the States of \nMontana and Idaho. Senator Chafee held hearings in other parts of \nAmerica. So we didn't just sit in Washington, we went to where the \nproblems are and to learn firsthand.\n  Senator Baucus has been an absolute brick, as we say throughout my \npart of the world, as my partner, together with Senator Chafee, not \nonly in the final hours, but throughout the 15-month process to bring \nthis bill to fruition.\n  The dollar value represents the largest increase in the history of \nAmerica. Many people played a vital role in that, notably the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, the senior Senator from Texas, Senator \nDomenici and, indeed, Senator Stevens was very helpful, because this is \na very complex series of votes and then adjustments to the various \naccounting principles and budget principles which we adhered to in the \nSenate.\n  So many persons are deserving of a great deal of credit for providing \nthis important conference report which will shortly be voted on by this \nbody.\n  The staff is extraordinary. In my 19 years in the Senate, I do not \nknow of another instance in which I have seen more dedicated service. \nBy my side here in the Chamber is Ann Loomis, who was the counsel for \nthe subcommittee, who 15 months ago worked and traveled, as did I and \nothers, to gain the very important information from across the United \nStates to incorporate into this bill. Kathy Ruffalo of Montana was \nSenator Baucus' principal assistant on the committee. She also worked \nwith us throughout this bill, as did Ellen Stein of my staff. Jimmie \nPowell, of course, is the staff director. Dan Corbett, Tom Sliter--and \nall too often we forget the many others who are back in the offices of \nthe Senators, who represent those Senators on the committee in the long \nhearings and the workup of this legislation, and, most particularly, \nthe support staff who are on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--all contributed to making this, I think, the most \nsignificant bill in the history of the United States of America \naddressing transportation needs.\n  How often has Senator Gramm or Senator Byrd pointed out that we are \nin a one-world market. To the extent that we in the United States can \nhave an efficient and safe transportation system is to the extent we \ncan compete with nations far beyond our shores.\n  Our system was aging, continues to age; and this bill makes the \nnecessary corrections. And through the leadership of Senator Byrd and \nSenator Gramm, we got the additional funds to make it the most \nmeaningful transportation bill in America's history.\n  Equity was the theme, the very theme that united all of us. While we \nincorporated many of the principles of ISTEA, the bill passed in 1991--\nand it was important to do so--there were corrections that, I can say, \nas softly, I suppose, as it can be expressed, were very definitely \nneeded to correct what we felt were inequities in ISTEA.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished leader. I will be happy to \nyield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5402-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5402-S5403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 2400\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Equity for the donor States. ``Donor States'' is a \ncategory created by ISTEA I. We never actually heard that term prior to \nISTEA I. But generally speaking, what it represented was as a \nconsequence of ISTEA I, a group of States, about 18 to 20 in number. \nSome were right on the borderline. Those States, when their citizens or \nvisitors in those States went to the gas pump and paid this very \nsignificant Federal gas tax, those 19 States got back a very small \namount in comparison to other States whose return, as a consequence of \nISTEA, was far higher.\n\n  My State got 79 cents on what we called the apportion dollar that \ncomes back from the highway trust fund; other States had equally. \nSeveral had less than my State. And that was basically an unfairness to \nthe citizens of that State, that those moneys that they expended in a \nFederal tax, and which was represented as to be for the purpose of \nhighways, did not come back in what I believe was a fair formula.\n  So the foundation in this bill was to change that inequity such that \nthat class of donor States received no less than 90.5 percent.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate it very much.

I would suggest perhaps we could make the unanimous \nconsent request subject to the circumstances that are now being \ndiscussed with the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, that assuming that those two matters could be worked \nout, that no additional unanimous consent requests would be in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the ISTEA conference report, notwithstanding the receipt of \nthe papers, and it be in order for me to ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe adoption of the conference report, and, further----\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me complete my request. And, further, I ask unanimous \nconsent that if the House passes the identical text, the vote be \nconsidered as having occurred on the conference report. I further ask \nunanimous consent that this agreement be null and void only by the \nSenator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, within the next 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I renew the same request with the exception of Senator \nWyden and the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in response to the majority leader's \nrequest for unanimous consent to proceed to the conference report on \nISTEA without having all of the conference report papers in hand, I \nmust withhold my consent until I have had the opportunity to review the \nsections of the report relating to important funding and project \nmatters for Oregon. It is not my intent to delay final action on this \nmajor piece of legislation; however, I want to be assured that \ncommitments that have been made are reflected in fact in the conference \ndocuments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2400), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by majority the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of May 22, 1998.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now ask for the yeas and nays on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia was posing a question to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In essence, I was asking if the conference report--the \nfloor was 90, so that although South Carolina was getting 71 cents back \nand Georgia 74, we could expect, if this were to pass, 90.5 cents?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia is correct. And I \nmust say that it was only because of the efforts of the Senator from \nGeorgia, the Senator from South Carolina, and all in the donee-donor \ndispute--the donor States bonded together. I thank the Senator for his \nhelp, because without it we could not have achieved this result.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. One more comment. There are still donor States, so \nthere is in this agreement a recognition of special circumstances, \ndistances, rural areas, or other infrastructures. There is still a \nsubsidy that occurs, some of it legitimate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. There are certain \nprograms, like the Federal Lands Program, certain environmental \nprograms, to which all the States contribute. The Senator is correct.\n  But the major achievement is the floor, which is a floor that puts us \nin range with almost all the other States of significant size. For \ninstance, the smaller States, there are 13 small States. That was the \nsecond building block that the Senator from Virginia put together to \nformulate this bill months ago. It seems so long ago now. The \ndistinguished Senator from Montana was a key player in that, Senator \nGraham of Florida, and we put this together.\n\n  Indeed, I would like to acknowledge the participation by the \nGovernors of these various States, the donor States, and the small \nStates, and their various highway representatives.\n  So that was the nucleus, the engine that began to take this bill \ndown.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I won't interrupt the Senator's speech, but I take \nthis\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nmoment to commend the Senator from Virginia. This has been a very \nvexing issue, and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for his very active participation. I \nfeel a certain sense of achievement that this Senator from Georgia can \ngo back now and say to his constituents at long last equity prevails in \nthe distribution of our highway trust fund.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Did the Senator have a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Virginia has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry. I wonder if we could get 5 more \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, you are just extending for 5 \nmore minutes?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have no objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. The Senator from Virginia is one of \nthe managers of the bill and very much wants to accommodate other \nSenators.\n  I understand the distinguished ranking member of our committee is \nabout to have a colloquy with the Senator from Oregon, so I yield for \nthat purpose and then thereafter would like to regain the floor for my \nspeech.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nVirginia for his graciousness.\n  Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the ranking \nmember regarding the Intelligence Transportation System Program.\n  Would the Senator from Montana agree the policy in the program \nintended to encourage private sector investment should be implemented \nin a manner that does not interfere with ongoing technology, \ndeployment, and system implementation in States that have already made \na substantial investment in its tests and deployment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to my very good friend, the Senator \nfrom Oregon, I strongly agree with the Senator. In States that have \nalready made a substantial investment in intelligence transportation \ntests and deployment projects, nothing in this bill before us, the new \nTEA-21, the old ISTEA II bill, will interfere with ongoing deployment \nand system implementation in these States.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from Montana. It is particularly \nimportant to encourage transportation innovation.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, referring to the bill, we have not \ndiscussed today the important strides made in safety of the traveling \npublic. Nearly 440,000 persons a year, regrettably, lose their lives on \nhighways and many more suffer incredible injuries. The bill includes \nfour new and significant provisions which hold great promise to save \nlives.\n  First, there is a new incentive program to give States funding based \non each State's improvement in seat belt use. I want to particularly \nacknowledge the important contribution of public interest groups \nspeaking on behalf of safety. Those groups indicated that this will \ngreatly reduce highway deaths and injuries.\n  Second, the conference report contains a new incentive grant program \nto reduce drunk driving by rewarding States who have passed .08 blood \nalcohol content law.\n  Third, the conference report includes a new program to require States \nto adopt minimum penalties for repeat drunk driving offenders.\n  I am privileged to say that was a conclusion that this Senator made \nafter close consultation with many safety groups, and, indeed, \nacknowledgment should be to the other groups--restaurant groups and \nothers who came in to see us on this issue. Statistics on drunk driving \nconfirm that repeat drunk drivers represent one of the most significant \nparts of our tragedy on the highways today, as a consequence of \nalcohol.\n  Fourth, another Senate provision requiring States to enact laws \nagainst open alcohol containers is included. Senator Dorgan was \nparticularly interested in that, and he deserves much credit for \nbringing that to the Senate's attention.\n  These four provisions, I believe, begin a new day in our efforts to \nimprove the safety of our Nation's highways. The conference report \ncontains a new title, championed by Senator Chafee, the distinguished \nchairman, and Senator Graham of Florida, to implement innovative \nfinancing techniques to leverage private dollars for transportation \nprojects.\n  The bill also recognizes the significant needs of our border States \nwho have experienced significant transportation growth since the \npassage of NAFTA.\n  There is a new $700 million grant program to meet the needs of our \nborder States and those trade corridor States carrying significant \ntraffic to those areas.\n  Lastly, there is a provision in the conference report to provide $900 \nmillion to replace the aging Woodrow Wilson Bridge. I wish to express \nmy appreciation to my colleagues from Maryland and my colleague from \nVirginia, Mr. Robb, and, indeed, strong assistance from the House. \nChairman Shuster was very supportive, as was Mr. Oberstar. While they \ndid not put it in the House bill, they recognized I would have it in \nthe Senate bill, and at a figure considerably above the request by the \nPresident.\n  The President took a personal interest in this bridge and summoned a \nnumber of us to the White House, to a very important conference \npresided over by the Director of OMB and his senior staff. There was a \ngeneral consensus at this conference that the $900 million was as much \nas we could achieve under this particular piece of legislation, \nrecognizing that these dollars were in competition with the other 48 \nStates and Maryland and Virginia and, of course, the District of \nColumbia.\n  Therefore, another piece of legislation will have to be carefully \ndrafted by the White House, in consultation with the Governors of \nMaryland and Virginia and the representatives of the District of \nColumbia, to allocate the next financing package which could be as high \nas this one between the several States, notably Maryland and Virginia, \nand the District. I think they should bear a portion of it, and a \nfurther significant contribution, I presume the majority, coming from \nthe Federal Government and how that would be financed. There were a \nnumber of schemes which I think were quite innovative and discussed, \nbut I will leave it up to those drafters of the legislation to work out \nthose details.\n  I will be pleased, and, once again, together with our colleagues, to \nwork towards passage of this legislation in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks on this bill, again, commending \nour distinguished chairman, Mr. Chafee, and the ranking member, Mr. \nBaucus--the three of us were the principal negotiators for the \nconference--and, again, paying great respect to my staff, and most \nparticularly to this loyal one seated next to me, Ann Loomis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on the \nISTEA conference report. I commend the work of the Conference Committee \non the job it has done. This is landmark legislation. It represents the \nmost substantial transportation legislation ever considered by the \nCongress. The bill provides much needed funds for both the construction \nand repair of our nation's roads, bridges and rails. This legislation \nwill provide the additional resources for our states to meet their \ncompelling transportation needs.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill preserves the concept of \nintermodalism. After completing the nation's interstate highway system \nseveral years ago, we decided in the ISTEA bill adopted in 1991 that \ntransportation was not just about highway construction. We committed \nourselves to investing funds in other modes of transportation, such as \nlight rail, bus and ferries. If our nation is to move people and goods \nsafely and efficiently in the 21st century, we must diversify our \ntransportation system. This legislation continues on that course.\n  We have also preserved our commitment to mass transit, which is \nextremely important in densely-populated states like Connecticut. I was \nparticularly pleased to join Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes in a \nsuccessful\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\neffort to increase funding for mass transit by $2.4 billion dollars \nduring deliberations between the House and the Senate conferees. I want \nto commend my two colleagues for their vigilance in this effort.\n  This legislation also furthers environmentally-sound principles such \nas congestion mitigation, air quality improvement and alternative fuel \ntechnologies. I believe that energy-efficient and environmentally-\nfriendly means of transportation are not only possible, but essential \nif our nation is going to remain strong, competitive and \nenvironmentally healthy into the next century. In this regard, I am \nparticularly pleased that the conference report retains the Senate-\npassed level of funding for the development and deployment of maglev \nhigh speed rail. This is an extraordinary technology that can move \npeople and goods on a fixed guideway at speeds of up to 300 mph. I \nbelieve that this mode of transportation can be to the 21st century \nwhat airplanes were to the 20th century, and trains were to the 19th--\nnamely, a dramatic step forward in safe, efficient and reliable \ntransportation. I applaud Senator Moynihan for his stalwart efforts to \nsupport maglev technology.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this is good and important legislation. It \nwill improve transportation safety, reduce congestion, diminish \npollution, increase efficiency and create jobs for the people of \nAmerica. For these reasons, the conference report has my support. That \nis not to say, however, that this is a perfect piece of legislation. I \nhave a number of concerns, as I know that my colleagues do, that I hope \nwill be addressed as we go forward.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report did not include the \nSenate provision that would penalize states if they failed to change \nthe legal definition of intoxication to .08 nationally. Although I am \npleased that the conference report contains incentives for states to \nmove in this direction.\n  I am also concerned that the bill offsets some of its spending with a \nreduction in expenditures for veterans in need of treatment for \nsmoking-related illnesses. For years the United States military \neffectively encouraged active duty forces to smoke by providing them \nwith free cigarettes. Therefore, it is only fair that the federal \ngovernment bear its fair share of responsibility for treating veterans \nwith illnesses contracted as a result of addiction to those cigarettes. \nI intend to work with my colleagues, including Minority Leader Daschle \nand Senators Lieberman and Rockefeller, to insure that as Congress \ncontinues consideration of tobacco legislation, we provide for the \nneeds of our veterans.\n  I am also concerned about the reduction in the Social Services Block \nGrant. This block grant is important to children and families of modest \nmeans throughout the country. We must not compromise on our commitment \nto provide better health care, child care and nutritional assistance to \nthese needy Americans. As a member of the Labor Committee, I intend to \nwork with members of the appropriations committees to made sure that we \nfind the resources to provide for these families.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for our nation's economy, transportation is \nliterally where the rubber hits the road. There are few things more \nimportant to my home State of Oregon or to the country's economy than \nhow well we build and maintain our transportation system. \nTransportation is one of the basic ingredients in any economic growth \nrecipe. It is one of the key things that businesses will look at as \nthey consider where to locate.\n  Both houses of Congress recognized this in passing bills to rev up \ntransportation spending over current levels. Providing more money \ntransportation money clearly helps keep us on the road to \ncompetitiveness and economic prosperity.\n  But the transportation debate involves more than just economics, as \nimportant as that is, it's also about our quality of life. I've always \nbelieved that you can't have major league quality of life with minor \nleague transportation systems. In the modern world, a transportation \nbill is about so much more than just how you get from point A to point \nB.\n  Congress recognized this when we passed the original ISTEA \nlegislation. For the first time, there was Federal recognition that \ndecisions about where and how to build transportation projects can have \ntremendous impacts on our communities, our environment and our \ncitizens' quality of life. Through ISTEA, we began to consider the true \ncosts of our transportation spending as part of the process of planning \ntransportation projects. And, for the first time, Federal funds were \nmade available to mitigate the impacts of these projects throught the \nCMAQ and the Transportation Enhancements Programs.\n  ISTEA recognizes that properly planned and constructed transportation \nsystems are both economically efficient and environmentally sound.\n  Badly designed or badly built systems waste taxpayer money and \ncontribute to traffic congestion that snarls our highways. This causes \nboth additional stresses for commuters and additional exhaust emissions \nthat degrade the quality of our air.\n  Both the Senate and the House bills continue many of these landmark \ninitiatives of the original ISTEA legislation. These were clearly good \nfirst steps, but if we're going to improve both our transportation \nsystem and our quality of life, we need to do more than spin our \nwheels.\n  Today, the Congress has recognized that the Federal government's role \nin funding transportation project also has ripple effects on patterns \nof development in our local communities. When it comes to \ntransportation, if you build it, they will come and build around it.\n  Uncontrolled development not only hurts our citizens where they live \nand breathe, it also hits them in their wallets. Several studies have \ncome out that show the costs of sprawling growth are significantly \nhigher than more compact, managed growth patterns. These studies show \nthat taxpayers can save billions of dollars in public facility capital \nconstruction and operation and maintenance costs by opting for growth \nmanagement.\n  Because of the major impacts Federally funded transportation projects \ncan have, there is an appropriate role for the Federal government in \nensuring these projects and the development they spawn are both \neconomically and environmentally sound.\n  That role should not be to embroil the Federal government in land use \ndecisions that have historically been State and local issues. We don't \nwant Federal zoning.\n  Instead, the proper role for the Federal government is create \nincentives to encourage and build on the State and local efforts to \naddress transportation and growth that are already underway. I am very \npleased to report that the ISTEA conference report includes a program I \nproposed to help local communities grow in environmentally sustainable \nways by creating incentives for local growth management.\n  I greatly appreciate Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner and Senator \nBaucus working with me to include this program in the bill. Chairman \nChafee and the other managers of the legislation also deserve enormous \ncredit for how they have built on and reinforced the goals of the \noriginal ISTEA law. Thanks to their efforts the bill now before the \nSenate will enable our national environmental policies to merge more \nsmoothly with our transportation policies.\n  The new Transportation and Community and System Preservation Program \nprovides $25 million per year investigate and address the relationships \nbetween transportation projects, communities and the environment. The \nProgram consists of three parts:\n  (1) a comprehensive research program;\n  (2) a planning assistance program to provide funding to States and \nlocal governments that want to begin integrating their transportation \nplanning with community preservation, environmental protection and land \nuse policies; and\n  (3) an implementation assistance program to provide funding to States \nand local governments that have developed state-of-the-art approaches \nto integrate their transportation plans and programs with their \ncommunity preservation, environmental and land use planning programs.\n  The research program will create a database on the experiences of \ncommunities in uniting transportation, community preservation, \nenvironmental and land use goals and decision making\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nprocesses. This research will also identify benchmarks for measuring \nthe performance of communities' experiences. This information will be a \nvaluable resource to help communities throughout the nation meet their \nfuture transportation needs with lower environmental impacts, improved \ntransportation efficiency, lower infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance costs, and in a way that is more responsive to the views of \ntheir citizens.\n  The planning assistance provided by this program will mean additional \nfinancial resources to States and communities that wish to explore ways \nto integrate their transportation programs with community preservation, \nenvironmental and land use planning programs. Participants in this \nplanning assistance program would be able to develop their own local \napproaches to meet their needs. And, as their programs develop, they \ncould become eligible in the future for funding to help implement their \nlocally developed solutions.\n  Finally, for States and communities which already have established \ncommunity preservation or land use programs, the program provides \nadditional financial resources to enable them to carry out \ntransportation projects that also meet community preservation, \nenvironmental and land use goals. In providing this assistance, the \nSecretary of Transportation is directed to give priority consideration \nto applicants that have instituted policies such as directing funds to \nhigh growth areas, urban growth boundaries to guide metropolitan \nexpansion, and ``green corridors'' programs.\n  My home State of Oregon leads the nation in developing innovative \napproaches to manage our growth and to tie transportation policies in \nto growth management. Our statewide land conservation and development \nprogram requires each municipality to establish an urban growth \nboundary to define both the areas where growth and development should \noccur and those areas that should be protected from development. This \nsystem keeps agricultural and forest lands in productive use and \npreserves ``green corridors'' for hiking, biking and other recreational \nuses that are located in or close to urban areas. Our transportation \nplanning and construction efforts reinforce these policies by not only \navoiding developing in environmentally sensitive areas but also by \nhelping make the areas where we want development to occur more \naccessible.\n  Oregon recognizes that it's not enough to tell people where they \ncan't build. For our system to work, we have to make it easier to \ndevelop the areas where we want growth to occur. And we don't just give \nlip service to this principle. We actually put our money where our \nmouth is to make sure the development we want occurs.\n  The State of Oregon and METRO, the Portland area's regional \ngovernment, are currently using $3 million of our Surface \nTransportation Program (STP) funds to develop housing and commercial \nproperties around light rail stations. Our folks have even figured out \nhow to use $3.7 million CMAQ air quality funds to help pay for \nsidewalks, light rail tracks and landscaping in these developments.\n  These policies make the State of Oregon, METRO, the City of Portland, \nand other localities in our State ideal candidates to apply for \nimplementation grants under the Transportation and Community and System \nPreservation Program.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Conference \nReport to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998 \n(ISTEA). During this period of tremendous economic growth, I believe \ninvesting in the nation's transportation infrastructure should be one \nof our highest priorities. I am pleased to offer my support to the \npassage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, despite my support for the improvements in the \ntransportational infrastructure that will occur as a result of this \nbill, I have strong concerns about one of the funding sources contained \nin this legislation. I do not believe that we should take money from \nveterans disability programs to be spent building roads. At a time in \nwhich the veterans hospitals in my state are experiencing budgetary \nshortfalls, I am troubled about transferring funds away from the \nVeterans Administration (VA). We in the United States have a long-\nstanding commitment to providing benefits and healthcare to those who \nhave served our country in the Armed Forces. In my opinion we should be \nworking to strengthen that commitment, not weaken it through budgetary \nslight of hand.\n  The issue of providing compensation to veterans for tobacco-related \nillnesses is one which the Congress must take closer look at in the \ncoming months. During consideration of the FY99 Budget Resolution, I \nvoted in favor of an amendment that requires the Veterans \nAdministration, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the General \nAccounting Office (GAO) to jointly study the VA General Counsel's \ndetermination regarding compensation for tobacco-related illnesses. I \nfully expect Congress will conduct a detailed examination of the \nresults of this study and will engage in full debate before any change \nin permanent law is enacted. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that \ndebate, any savings as a result of a change in VA compensation policy \nshould be redirected into VA health care and benefits programs, not \ninto transportation infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, despite my concern about this funding provision, I \nwill vote in favor of this Conference Report because I believe today's \ninvestment in roads and transit systems lays the groundwork for \neconomic growth for decades to come. The Senate's passage of this \nlegislation will improve the safety of our roads, create jobs, spur \neconomic activity and give more Americans a shot at the American Dream. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I join the majority of my \ncolleagues today in expressing strong support for the conference report \non H.R. 2400, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nreauthorization. As a member of the conference committee, I know the \namount of time and effort that was put into developing this final \nagreement. I believe a fair compromise was reached among the wide \nvariety of interests and between the House and Senate.\n  This legislation represents a change from past transportation \nlegislation and a shift toward an integrated, intermodal transportation \nsystem to promote efficiency and economic growth. Some of its major \nprovisions include: assurance that gas tax dollars are used for \ntransportation purposes, greater planning authority for state and local \ngovernment, increased funding for highway safety, and funding for \nenvironmental protection activities.\n  A reauthorized ISTEA should continue to recognize regional \ndifferences but at the same time, recognize that our transportation \nsystem is a national system. Certainly, every state want to get its \n``fair share,'' and we will need to balance each state's needs with the \nneeds of the Nation.\n  From New Hampshire's perspective, it is important to ensure that \nsmall states continue to receive adequate funding for their \ninfrastructure needs. New Hampshire strongly supports certain programs, \nsuch as the Bridge Rehabilitation, Scenic Byway and Recreational Trail \nprograms, that other states may not need as greatly. The strength of \nthis legislation is that it recognizes these varying needs and provides \nstates with the flexibility to direct funding as they see appropriate.\n  There are many challenges before us as we operate in a balanced \nbudget environment--something for which I have fought long and hard. \nOur needs will always outweigh our resources. But we also have to \nrecognize how critical our transportation system is to our economy and \nsocial well-being. While it is difficult to balance these frequently \ncompeting goals, I believe this bill strikes the right balance in \nproviding an adequate amount of resources within the context of the \nbalanced budget agreement.\n  In conclusion, I believe this is a good bill and deserves Senate \napproval. The quality of our Nation's transportation system is \ndepending on it. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying the re-authorization of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act. While I support this legislation, I am \ndisappointed that veterans programs were used to pay for a portion of \nthis bill. Nonetheless, this bill\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\ncontains significant increases in funding for Maryland's highway and \ntransit programs. I am proud to have worked with my colleague Senator \nSarbanes to make sure Maryland got its fair share of funds for its \ntransportation needs.\n  With billions in needed maintenance and construction in the State of \nMaryland, this legislation will make our highways safer and expand \ntransit options for our citizens. It will help to ease the flow of \ntraffic on our major highways and byways and begin the long awaited re-\nconstruction of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.\n  This bill provides $900 million for a new Wilson Bridge, $500 million \nmore than the Administration proposed last year. Although this does not \nrepresent the total cost of a new bridge, it is a first step toward \nreplacement of the bridge. Let me make it clear, I do not consider this \nfunding to be the end. I consider this to be the beginning. In future \nyears, I will continue the effort to secure additional funding to \ncomplete the re-building of Wilson Bridge, a critical link on the I-95 \nsystem and the only federally owned bridge in the system.\n  Under this bill, Maryland will receive more money for its highway \nprogram than it gets now. Maryland can expect approximately $400 \nmillion per year for its highway program--almost $90 million more than \nit gets now. This is almost a 30 percent increase in funding that will \nhelp improve the conditions of our highway system--which is one of the \nmost congested in the nation. The Washington area has the second \nlongest commute time in the nation. The funds authorized in this bill \nshould help provide some much needed relief.\n  The bill not only provides more funds for Maryland's overall highway \nprogram, it specifically targets funds for high priority projects \naround the State. The bill provides $26 million to upgrade Route 113 in \nWorcester County, one of the most dangerous highways in the State of \nMaryland. Every time I visit the Eastern Shore, I am always reminded \nabout the need to upgrade this highway. Too many Marylanders have lost \ntheir lives on this stretch of roadway. This legislation will fund the \nfirst and most critical phase of this project to make the road safer \nfor those who use it.\n  Another major project that has desperately needed funds has been the \nI-70/I-270 interchange in Frederick. It is one of the only interchanges \non the interstate system that does not meet interstate standards. It \nhas been a safety hazard for years. The lack of an adequate interchange \nin the area has forced trucks off the interstate and into surrounding \nareas. This legislation will provide funding to complete the first \nphase of reconstruction and relieve the local community of this burden, \nwhile improving the safety of this section of highway.\n  For the first time, almost $10 million will be earmarked for Route 32 \nin Anne Arundel County in the vicinity of the National Security Agency. \nThis highway is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the State \nand needs to expand capacity to accommodate the growth in the \nsurrounding area.\n  This legislation will also increase funding for the Appalachian \nHighway System. Maryland can expect to receive approximately $6 million \nper year for the next six years under this bill--that is enough to \nrebuild U.S. 220 in Allegany County. This is the number one highway \npriority for Western Maryland and a serious safety problem. This is $4 \nmillion per year more than Maryland receives now. Thanks to this \nlegislation, Maryland will have the funds to upgrade this highway.\n  Mr. President, not only does Maryland receive more highway dollars, \nwe receive more transit dollars. Maryland will receive almost twice as \nmuch federal funds for its transit programs. The MARC system will \nreceive an additional $185 million and the Baltimore Light Rail System \nwill receive $125 million to double-track the system. This will \ncontinue to expand transit opportunities for Marylanders and help \nrelieve congestion on our highways.\n  Mr. President, I do have one major reservation to this conference \nreport. I believe it is just plain wrong that our veterans are being \nasked to sacrifice their compensation for our transportation needs. I \nmade my feelings very clear when I voted in favor of an amendment to \nthe Budget Resolution earlier this year that called on the Congress to \nprotect veterans benefits. As the Ranking Member of the Veterans \nAffairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I will look for way to ensure that \nthese funds are replenished. Our vets, our heroes, deserve better and I \nwill fight to correct this deep injustice.\n  Despite my anger over the veterans offset, I will support this \nlegislation because it is so important to improving the safety of \nMaryland's highways, byways and transit systems. Improving public \nsafety and creating jobs are two of my highest priorities and this bill \naddresses both.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Why does ISTEA allow the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to provide for earlier state \nimplementation of the Commission's recommendations?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The bill clarifies that it does not affect EPA's \nauthority to provide for state implementation of the agreements and \nrecommendations set forth in the June 1996 Grand Canyon Visibility \nTransport Commission Report on a schedule consistent with the \nCommission's Report. This was a critical issue for the conferees. The \nconferees recognize that the Commission's Report was the product of \nseveral years of debate and analysis, and reflects broad consensus on \ncontrol strategies and measures that should proceed with \nimplementation. The conferees added specific language so as not to \npreclude the Administrator from providing for earlier state \nimplementation of the Commission's agreements and recommendations, \nconsistent with the implementation schedules in the Commission's \nReport.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss my support for the \nISTEA conference report which I believe appropriately and rationally \nexpands and improves our nation's transportation programs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is good news for Rhode Island, a \nstate that unfortunately has some of the most significant \ninfrastructure needs in our nation according to experts. Yet, many \npeople might overlook the fact that this conference report also \nprovides essential investments in our nation's mass transit programs. \nIndeed, I am pleased that the Banking Committee's transit title of the \nconference report contains $35 million for new capital transit programs \nin Rhode Island as well as $5.79 million for the purchase of urgently \nneeded new buses by the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. I want \nto personally thank Chairman D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes, \nparticularly, for their assistance in addressing my state's transit \npriorities and their hard work in producing a very balanced transit \nprogram that will serve our country well.\n  While there is much that is good in this bill, I am troubled by some \nof the budgetary offsets used to permit a higher level of \ntransportation investment. Like many of my colleagues, I remain \nconcerned that in order to accommodate essential infrastructure funding \nwithin the confines of strict budget caps, this legislation would \nendorse a plan to deny payments for veterans with service connected \nsmoking-related illnesses. Indeed, earlier this year, I voted against \nthis proposal, and I plan to work with like minded colleagues in the \nmonths ahead to see if we can reverse it. In addition, I am saddened \nthat the ISTEA bill no longer contains a tougher national standard for \ndriving under the influence of alcohol. All too often we hear of \nanother senseless death due to drunk driving. A tougher standard for \nblood alcohol content or BAC would have been an excellent deterrent in \nthe fight against drunk driving tragedies, and I regret that the \nSenate's strong support for this standard did not prevail in \nnegotiations with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, like many pieces of legislation, this bill is not \nperfect. However, repairing my state's roads and bridges; ensuring that \nthousands of mass transit riders in Rhode Island continue to receive \nservice; and improving safety on our roads; are worthwhile goals that I \nhope all my colleagues support.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate \nconsideration of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \nbill, the so-called ISTEA bill.\n  This bill sets priorities and funds for surface transportation \nprojects and\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nprograms for the next six years. It is the product of many months of \nnegotiations between the House and the Senate and between Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. We have managed to come together on this bill \nby compromise and a willingness to listen to all points of view for the \ngood of the nation and the States.\n  As ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, I can tell you that \nthe provisions in the Commerce Committee title of the bill were the \nproduct of intense negotiations for many weeks. But the way to judge \nour efforts is the result and I am proud of what has been achieved.\n  We have provisions to strengthen the safety of motor vehicle air bags \nand to allow States to design programs to raise the percentage of their \ncitizens who use seat belts. In addition, we have given the Secretary \nof Transportation the flexibility to design additional commercial motor \nvehicle safety programs. We have authorized a program to provide funds \nfor the development of rail and intermodal projects. These programs \nwill allow us to expand the nation's infrastructure. Most importantly, \nthe bill contains funds to replace our crumbling bridges and roads. \nTogether these programs will provide our citizens with safer bridges \nand roads and additional infrastructure will allow our citizens to \ncompete in the world market.\n  Commerce Committee provisions also address the needs of recreational \nboaters and anglers. The bill extends the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund \nand recovers a greater portion of the federal fuel taxes paid by \nboaters and anglers. In addition, Commerce Committee provisions ensure \nthat funds are available to make boating safer, more accessible, and \nenvironmentally cleaner for the 76 million Americans--more than one-\nfourth of the nations's population--who go boating each year. Finally, \nthe bill extends programs to restore and protect sportfish resources \nand strengthens efforts to introduce segments of the American public . \n. . especially our youth . . . to the healthy fun of fishing and \nboating.\n  I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Commerce Committee \nfor their efforts on behalf of this bill, and indeed, on behalf of all \nof us.\n  Mr. President, I urge passage of this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconference report to the Intermodal Surface Transportaton Efficiency \nAct (ISTEA). I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss the benefits \nof this legislation for my home state of Illinois.\n  This conference report is truly historic. It makes the largest \ninvestment to date in our nation's aging infrastructure, $216 billion \nover the next six years. In short, this conference report increases the \nState of Illinois' total ISTEA dollars and provides greater \nflexibility. It goes a long way toward improving the conditions of \nIllinois' roads and bridges, properly funding mass transit in Chicago \nand downstate, alleviating congestion, and addressing highway safety \nand the environment.\n  The bill provides $175 billion over six years for highways, highway \nsafety, and other surface transportation programs. Illinois has the \nthird largest Interstate system in the country; however, its roads and \nbridges are rated as the second worst in the nation. The State can \nexpect to receive about $5.3 billion over six years from the highway \nformula. That's nearly a 30 percent increase or $1.2 billion more than \nthe ISTEA of 1991.\n  Major reconstruction and rehabilitation projects like Downtown \nChicago's Wacker Drive and the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) will be able \nto move forward thanks, in large part, to this legislation. The \nconference report designates $25 million each for both of these \npriority projects. In addition, both the Stevenson Expressway and \nWacker Drive projects will be able to compete for federal funds through \ncertain discretionary programs.\n  The conference report also includes funding for over 100 high \npriority projects from throughout the State worth more than $375 \nmillion.\n  Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago metropolitan \narea as well as to many downstate communities. It helps alleviate \ncongestion and provides access for thousands of Illinoisans everyday. \nThe conference report includes $41 billion over six years for mass \ntransit. Illinois can expect to receive about $2.5 billion over six \nyears, a 67 percent increase or $1 billion more than the 1991 ISTEA.\n  The conference report authorizes the Chicago Transit Authority to \nexpand the capacity of the Ravenswood Brown Line and fully funds the \nrebuilding of the Douglas Branch of the Blue Line. It also will help \nMETRA expand Northeastern Illinois' commuter rail system by double-\ntracking and extending service into rapidly growing areas. The Metro \nLink light rail system in St. Clair County will have the ability to \ncomplete an extension from East St. Louis through Belleville Area \nCollege to MidAmerica Airport under the conference report. The transit \nprovisions will also help transit authorities throughout the State \npurchase and upgrade buses and bus facilities.\n  The conference report also includes $150 million per year for the \nJobs Access and Reverse Commute Grants program. This program will \nassist communities in filling the gaps in transit service that prevent \nwelfare recipients from finding and keeping the jobs they need to \nremain self-sufficient.\n  Congress also has made a commitment to high-speed passenger rail, a \nsafe, cost-effective means of transportation, in this conference \nreport. With increased funding, it is my hope that the Midwest can \ndevelop an effective transportation system.\n  This legislation also preserves and expands some important \nenvironmental and enhancement programs, including the Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program. CMAQ's goal is to help \nstates meet their air quality conformity requirements as prescribed by \nthe Clean Air Act. The conference report increases funding for CMAQ by \n18 percent. Illinois can expect more than $1 billion over six years \nunder the program. The report also fully funds transportation \nenhancement activities, such as bicycle pedestrian facilities and \nhistoric preservation.\n  Illinois is one of 15 states that has been responsible enough to pass \na .08 legal blood-alcohol concentration level for drivers. The State \nhas had .08 BAC since July of 1997 and we are already beginning to see \npositive results. Unfortunately, the conference committee did not \ninclude language that would have sanctioned states that refused to pass \n.08 BAC legislaton. Instead, Illinois and other states who have passed \n.08 will receive as much as $6 million per year in highway safety \nincentives.\n  I am pleased that the conference report extends the current excise \ntax exemption for an important Illinois product--corn-based, renewable \nethanol fuel--through 2007. Farmers and the ethanol industry must have \nthe ability to plan for the future. Extending the incentive gives them \nthe tools necessary to expand their operations and this important \nindustry while improving the environment and decreasing our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, I know this conference report is not a perfect \ndocument. Illinois' highway formula should be higher. I will work with \nthe Administration to ensure that Illinois competes for and receives a \nfair share of discretionary transportation funds available as a result \nof this conference report. With the passage of this legislation, \nCongress has upheld its obligation to reauthorize and improve our \nnation's important transportation programs. I am pleased to support \nthis measure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like to engage the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato in a colloquy regarding a Pennsylvania mass \ntransit project. It is my understanding that the project under the \ntransit new start program entitled ``Philadelphia-Pittsburgh High Speed \nRail'' is intended to be for initial planning, design and engineering \ncosts for a high speed magnetic levitation public transportation system \nin Pennsylvania. Having ridden such a system in Germany in January of \nthis year, I believe a system of this nature will revolutionize the \nsteel industry and could provide an excellent means of mass transit in \nthe 21st Century.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I concur with my colleague's understanding that the line \nitem he described is intended to make available Federal Transit \nAdministration funds for initial costs of a high speed maglev system in \nPennsylvania. It is my understanding that these funds\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\nwill be applied for by an existing transit system or state agency in \naccordance with traditional requirements for FTA grants.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Congress finally completed its work on a \nsix-year bill to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act today. This bill has been a long time coming. I'm \npleased that Wisconsin will now have a chance to address our state's \nvital transportation needs for the next year and plan its priorities \nfor the next six years. This bill moves Wisconsin a long way toward \nachieving fairness in Federal transportation spending, and I cannot \noverlook this dramatic step forward.\n  While the bill is not perfect and includes a number of items I would \nnot support individually, it goes a long way toward ending Wisconsin's \ndecades-long legacy as a donor state. Historically, Wisconsin's \ntaxpayers have received about 78 cents for every dollar we have paid \ninto the Highway Trust Fund. As a result, we have lost more than $625 \nmillion since 1956. Under this bill, Wisconsin will receive \napproximately 99 cents for every dollar it contributes to the Highway \nTrust Fund, beginning next year. I applaud the efforts of Wisconsin's \ndelegation in achieving a greater measure of fairness for Wisconsin's \ntaxpayers. On this travel weekend that many believe will be the biggest \nin history, the people of Wisconsin should be happy to see that their \ntax dollars will be used to improve Wisconsin's roads and rails.\n  Finally, I urge the President to use his line-item veto authority to \nstrike the pork-barrel spending projects inserted into the House \nreauthorization bill and included in this conference report. We should \nallow states and localities to decide on how best to address \ntransportation needs. The Senate decided to use more than $2 billion on \nblock grants to states instead of earmarks for particular projects. I \nam certain that Wisconsin, and other donor states, could have reached \neven greater equity had the House followed the Senate's lead.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would first like to thank the \nmanagers of Conference Report. Both Senators Chafee and Baucus have \nworked day and night trying to produce a fair and balanced Conference \nReport. They have done their best to try to accommodate my views. We \ndid not always agree on every issue, but they both tried to work with \nme and engage in a constructive dialogue when we differed.\n  I would also like to thank the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, Senator Warner. He put in a substantial effort to try to \ncreate a consensus that would satisfy the need for this critical \nlegislation.\n  And I would like to thank Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes for their \ndiligence and hard work on the mass transit title. Because of their \ncommitment, this bill represents a balanced transportation bill.\n  Mr. President, I offer some comments to indicate my specific views on \nhow this good bill will help my State of New Jersey. As a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I have been working on the \nISTEA reauthorization bill this entire Congress. I have been fighting \nfor increased investment in our nation's infrastructure, a balanced \ntransportation system and critical safety programs.\n  Overall, on balance, this is a good bill--good for the country and \ngood for New Jersey. It includes $173 billion for highways and $41 \nbillion for mass transit nationally over six years. As the Ranking \nDemocrat on the Budget Committee, I worked hard to increase mass \ntransit funding by almost a third compared to the 1991 ISTEA bill. \nOverall, this translates to over $4 billion to New Jersey for highways \nand over $2 billion for mass transit over the six year life of this \nbill. As a result, New Jersey will receive an increase of over $1 \nbillion in transportation funding as compared to the 1991 ISTEA bill.\n  Mr. President, the ISTEA bill, like any bill that provides funding to \nthe States, became a battle between regions. Western Senators argued \nthat their needs were greatest because of the sheer miles of highways \nin their states. Southern Senators suggested that they had population \ngrowth and they needed increases. The so-called donor states were \npushing a ``minimum allocation'' that would revise the formula that \nprevailed over the past six years.\n  Mr. President, obviously, I pushed hard for increased investment in \nmy region and my state. The Northeast states face tremendous \ninfrastructure needs over the next six years. Since we are the oldest \nregion in the country with the highest density and greatest volume of \ntraffic, our infrastructure needs are great. This problem is compounded \nby harsh weather conditions, intense congestion and air quality.\n  Mr. President, I didn't get everything I wanted for New Jersey. \nHowever, this bill does provide substantial increases in funding for \nNew Jersey for highways and mass transit. It also includes funding for \nover 40 highway and mass transit projects for my state. I fought to \nkeep all of the my colleagues in the House of Representatives' projects \nin the final bill. The Senate bill originally did not include any \nspecial projects, but I am pleased that a few of them were included in \nthe Conference Report at my request. The first project is an emergency \nheliport on Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, which will speed up \nrapid emergency service for hospital patients in the region. I am also \npleased with funding to construct a roadway network using the former \nBergen Arches rail corridor going from east to west in Hudson County, \nNew Jersey. The Bergen Arches project will provide congestion relief \nand will allow the demand for development of the Hudson County \nwaterfront--the so-called ``Gold Coast''--to move at its rapid pace.\n  Mr. President, anyone who is familiar with my work in the Senate \nknows that I don't relent when it comes to standing up for my \nconstituents and my state. I feel my responsibilities to the people who \nsent me here as a sacred obligation and I would never agree to anything \nthat is detrimental to our needs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is all about compromise. And this \nConference Report is not perfect for my state, but, in the end, the \nsubstantial increases in highway and mass transit funding will reduce \ncongestion, increase productivity, clean the air, and improve the \nquality of life so I will support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I must note to my colleagues that the \nprocedure that has been used here on the floor today for consideration \nof this conference report is outrageous.\n  Despite the process followed here, I intend to vote for this bill, \nbased on the representations about Michigan's share of highway funds \nmade in the incomplete charts provided by the Conference Committee. I \nask unanimous consent that those charts be placed in the Record \nfollowing my statement. The best judgement I can exercise at this point \nis to support the apparent increases provided to my state. According to \nthese charts, Michigan will receive an annual average of $825 million \nper year from the Highway Trust Fund, an increase of $310 million over \nthe ISTEA I average. Our percentage return on the dollars distributed \nwill rise from approximately 84% to 90.5% and is guaranteed to go no \nlower. And, our share of the total funds going to the states will \nincrease from approximately 2.87% to 3.16%, close to the Senate bill's \nmark.\n  If the factual matter in those charts proves to be inaccurate, I, and \nI am sure my donor state colleagues, will seek corrective action.\n  Michigan and the nation are making some significant progress with the \npassage of this bill. We are now going to spend all or nearly all our \ngas tax dollars on transportation, rather than leaving them in the \nHighway Trust Fund. That means we are going to start addressing the \nserious backlog of infrastructure projects that are vital to our \neconomy and quality of life.\n  I understand the report contains a minimum guarantee provision \nsimilar to that in the Senate bill, though the ``guarantee'' has been \nreduced to a 90.5% return on dollars distributed rather than the 91% \nthe donor states were promised. Still, this is some incremental \nprogress for my state, but Michigan will continue to be a substantial \ndonor state and continue sending money to the donee states. We will \ncontinue pressing at the next opportunity for more equity, particularly \non transit when that title is reauthorized in two years. But, for the \nmoment, we can declare a minor victory.\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\n  While I appreciate the conferees', particularly Senator Warner's, \nattention to the donor states' needs, I am concerned by one particular \nprovision. Apparently, the report includes an item that could \ndrastically reduce the minimum guarantee funds to states if revenues \nincrease by more than 25% over a 1998 baseline. This provision has no \nplace in this bill, particularly since the total amount authorized and \ndistributed by this bill is projected to rise by approximately 25% over \nthe next six years, assuming current CBO projections. Its inclusion \nundermines the ``guarantee'' and the promise that the Senate conferees \nmade to the donor states, since we could be disproportionately hurt. I \nintend to examine this provision closely and will work with the other \ndonor states to change this provision if it proves harmful to us.\n  I am pleased that the conferees have included a number of important \nprovisions in the report, including a provision similar to one I \nauthored in the Senate's bill enhancing local transportation officials \nparticipation in the preparation of the states' transportation \nimprovement program. Also, the international trade corridor number 18, \nwhich includes I-69 and I-94, is designated as high priority. \nAmbassador Bridge access projects are made eligible for Federal \nfunding. The State of Michigan will receive $10 million in FY99 and \n$13.5 million in FY2000 for buses and bus facilities in a block grant \nfor distribution around the State. Numerous other important projects \nare identified all over the State, from an Intelligent Transportation \nSystem technology project in Lansing, to Monroe Rail Consolidation, to \nthe South Beltline in Grand Rapids, to renovation and rehabilitation of \nthe Detroit Waterfront, to upgrading 3 Mile Road in Grand Traverse \nCounty, to upgrading H-58 in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore., etc.\n  This is not a perfect bill. But, it is another step on the long, long \nroad toward equity. When I started in the Senate, we were getting \nsomewhere around $.75 cents on our gas tax dollar. The 1991 ISTEA bill \nbrought us up to approximately $.80 per dollar, and the conference \nreport before us should get us to about $.83. Some day, Michigan \ntaxpayers will get back 100% of the gas taxes they pay into the Highway \nTrust Fund in the form of better roads and bridges and well-maintained \ninfrastructure. But, only if we keep fighting.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the charts printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

        urban core colloquy\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Banking \nCommittee. Mr. President, the ISTEA conference report includes language \nthat reauthorizes a very important mass transit project in my state. \nThe New Jersey Urban Core project provides critical links in a rail \nsystem that is the backbone of the transportation system of the \nNortheast and the nation. The Urban Core project links all of New \nJersey's rail lines and builds new ones where necessary, to establish \none comprehensive and coordinated rail transportation system within the \nstate.\n  Mr. President, the Conference Report makes a number of changes to the \nauthorization of this important project. The report adds new projects \nas elements of the Urban Core and makes a number of critical changes. \nThe conference report is silent on the future of full funding \nagreements. Do the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking \nCommittee, who authored the Mass Transit title to the next surface \ntransportation authorization bill, agree that it is important that the \nSecretary and the State of New Jersey enter into full funding grant \nagreements sometime in the next six years, for those elements of the \nUrban Core that can be demonstrated to be under construction by \nSeptember 30, 2003? Is it your intention to urge the Secretary to work \nwith the State of New Jersey over the next two years to sign full \nfunding grant agreements?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey that the Urban Core is an important mass transit \nproject that serves millions of people every day and demonstrates every \nday the importance of mass transit to our national transportation \nsystem. I also believe that the Secretary should work with the State of \nNew Jersey during the next few years to provide assistance to those \nelements of the Urban Core that will move ahead in the next six years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I concur with the Chairman of the \nBanking Committee's statement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Banking Committee for their support for the New Jersey Urban \nCore, and for their support for mass transit nationwide. They are true \nchampions of investing in a sound and balanced transportation system.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support final passage of \nthe conference report on the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). I commend my colleagues who have \nworked so hard on this bill, Senator Chafee, Senator Warner and Senator \nBaucus, Senator Domenici and Senator D'Amato.\n  This has been an incredibly difficult process. Whenever you have to \ndivide resources among competing interests there is going to be \nfriction. The conferees on this legislation have done an admirable job \nin balancing these competing interests in the name of our shared \nnational interest in safe, efficient highways.\n  This highway and transit reauthorization is important for the country \nand for my state of Utah. Utah needs this bill and I am happy that we \ncan deliver it to them. Like a lot of states, Utah has a number of \ncrucial infrastructure improvements needed in our highway and transit \nsystems. Unlike other states, however, Utah must complete a number of \nthese projects in time for the 2002 winter Olympic Games.\n  This bill makes clear that the federal government has a \nresponsibility to assist my state of Utah make the transportation \nimprovements needed to successfully host the 2002 Games. By including \nlanguage which gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to \ngive priority consideration for Olympic host cities, the Congress has \nacknowledged that these really are America's Games.\n  I also applaud the members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for crafting a formula which recognizes the fact that there \nhas been a population shift to the west and that a federal highway \nfunding formula must accommodate the rapid growth in western states.\n  There are a number of important projects authorized in this \nlegislation. I am pleased that we were able to bring a number of \nearmarked demonstration projects up to an appropriate level. Utah is \ngrowing quickly both in population and vehicle miles traveled. These \nprojects, all part of the state's transportation improvement plan, will \nmake a real difference in a number of rural counties.\n  Finally, I wish to commend all the members of the Utah delegation. We \nare a small delegation, but we are a strong delegation and when we work \ntogether, as we have all done relative to this legislation, we are an \neffective delegation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are now asked to vote on a bill \nauthorizing the expenditure of more than $200 billion. No member of the \nSenate other than a handful of conferees has seen a copy of the bill; \nno one knows anything about its major policy implication.\n  The Senate bill allowed each state's money to be spent as each state \ndetermined. This bill included hundreds of Congressionally designated \nprojects in both the highway and mass transit accounts. Although the \nearmarked Washington state projects were all appropriate in the highway \ncategory, the mass transit title did not treat my state fairly. The \nRegional Transit Authority, perhaps the most cost-effective project in \nthe nation, was less fairly treated than projects abandoned by the \ncommunities for which they are authorized.\n  Even more importantly, the general highway fund distribution formula \ndiscriminates unfairly against Washington state. It returns to us a \nlower percentage of our motor vehicle fuel taxes than does present law, \nthe original Senate bill, or the House bill. Our conferees in the \nSenate did not represent us well.\n  The bill is full of pork and unfair. I will vote against it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to explain \nmy concerns about the conference report on the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA).\n  I want to first say that I was pleased to be able to vote for the \nSenate bill in March. This bill will continue the important work that \nwas begun under the first ISTEA. It represents a comprehensive package \nto address all transportation needs. It continues the fundamental goal \nof the original ISTEA, which is to afford state and local governments \ngreater flexibility in allocating transportation dollars.\n  I believe that investing in our transportation infrastructure is \nessential if we are to remain economically competitive. Today, our \nhighways and transit systems need continued support in order to meet \nour commercial and personal transportation requirements.\n  I also want to thank all the people in Minnesota who have educated me \nalong the way on transportation issues. In addition to the \n``traditional highway advocates''--the city, county and state \nofficials, engineers and contractors--I have been working closely with \ncommunity organizers, architects, preservationists, bicyclers and \ncommunity activists. Though some may have questions about this or that \nprovision, all of these people support ISTEA.\n  ISTEA will guarantee that a federal investment will be made in \nmaintaining and expanding Minnesota's highways, transit and other \ntransportation related programs. I am pleased that several transit \nprojects have been proposed in Minnesota, including the Twin Cities \nTransitway. Improving existing transit and building new transit will be \ncrucial as we see our population in the state continue to grow. It is \nclear that, as our region continues to grow, we will need alternatives \nto the traditional car and driver commuting.\n  Transportation is critical to our daily lives. We cannot separate how \npeople and goods are transported from the many other parts of their \nsocial and economic lives. It is important to work together to ensure \nthat we have a fully integrated, safe and environmentally sound \nintermodal transportation system in the State of Minnesota and the \ncountry. ISTEA does this through the MPO, ATP and STIP process. The \nplanning provisions of the bill put the major decision-making back at \nthe local level where it belongs. In addition, the conference report \ncontains language that allows for appropriate meaningful public \nparticipation in the MPO process. While the\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nMPO process has worked well, this new language will make the process \nthat much more responsive to the communities that are most affected by \ntheir decisions.\n  Unfortunately despite these facts, I cannot vote for this conference \nreport for a number of reasons. First, the conferees have reportedly \nselected major offsets that I strongly oppose. While we do not have all \nthe details, I believe the bill assumes $15.5 billion in savings from \ndenial of compensation claims by veterans with smoking-related \nillnesses. The veterans health cuts are especially troubling. I believe \nit is an outrage that funding that could have gone to meet the many \npressing needs of this country's veterans, will instead be used as an \noffset for spending in this bill.\n  For years, veterans have been told that cuts to the Veterans \nAdministration (VA)--and particularly cuts to veterans health care--\nwere necessary to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. Last \nyear's balanced budget agreement flatlined the VA budget over six \nyears. It provided virtually no allowance for medical inflation, which \nin years past has come to roughly $500 million per year.\n  But Congress can no longer pretend that its failure to provide for \nveterans' programs is a lack of resources. First of all, the budget is \nnow balanced. Indeed, this year we have a projected surplus of \nsomewhere in the range of $50 billion. Second, in this case Congress is \ntaking resources away from veterans themselves. If Congress insists on \ndenying benefits to veterans who were hooked on smoking during their \nmilitary service, there is no excuse for transferring those savings \noutside the VA.\n  I can think of a lot of areas in the veterans budget where we could \nhave put those savings to good use. For example, I have a bill to \nprovide compensation for veterans who were exposed to radiation during \ntheir military service. I've been told these atomic vets cannot be \ncompensated because offsets would have to come from elsewhere in the VA \nbudget. Yet this ISTEA bill seizes upon an enormous offset from that \nvery VA budget and dedicates those funds to transportation.\n  We could certainly provide more resources for veterans health care, \nwhich is facing a severe funding crisis. Without additional funding the \nVA health care system will ``hit the wall,'' VA Undersecretary for \nHealth Dr. Kenneth Kizer has testified.\n  This particular offset makes a mockery of the Senate's professed \nconcern for veterans and for deficit reduction. I have real doubts \nabout the various estimates of savings from denial of smoking-related \nclaims. I know others do as well. Nobody knows how much VA will save by \ndenying these benefits to veterans. But the conferees have apparently \nopted for the highest possible number.\n  This offset makes very clear what some of us have long suspected. The \nreason veterans programs have been cut in recent years is not deficit \nreduction. It's not for the purpose of balancing the budget. It's not \nbecause full funding would require a tax increase.\n  It's none of those things. It's because this Republican Congress \nplaces a lower priority on veterans than on other areas of the budget. \nWe cannot get around that fact. Congress would rather use these savings \nelsewhere.\n  Whether we like it or not, the legislation we pass in this body makes \nit very clear what our priorities are. I, for one, think we need to \nreorder those priorities. I think we need to put more emphasis on the \nneeds of working families. And in this case, I think we need to put a \nlot more emphasis on veterans who have faithfully served their country.\n  I will also vote no on this bill, as much as I believe in its goals, \nbecause of the way it attempts a resolution on an historic land use \ndispute in my State regarding the management of the Boundary Waters \nCanoe Area Wilderness, without adequate Congressional consideration or \ndebate. Congressmen Bruce Vento and James Oberstar this week reached a \nlast-minute, independent agreement on a proposal to change future \nmanagement of the BWCAW. The proposed agreement would re-open two \nportages in the BWCAW to motorized transport in return for closing two \nsmall, pristine wilderness lakes to future motorized use.\n  I regret that this agreement was reached in this way, at the last \nminute in the House-Senate conference committee, without having been \ndebated by either the House of Senate. As I have said elsewhere, I \nwould have preferred an open, fair, public Congressional debate on my \nlegislation, patterned after Minnesota mediation proposals, and the \nmajor alternatives offered by my colleagues. I remain convinced that my \ncompromise plan was a viable one which carefully balanced the interests \nof all parties. I do not think that last-minute private deals like this \none are an appropriate way to conduct policy, especially on a major \nissue which has so divided our stated. Such deals do nothing to improve \nMinnesotans' confidence in the fairness of the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate my support for the overall \nobjectives of this legislation. I believe investing in our \ntransportation infrastructure is essential if we are to remain \neconomically competitive. Today, our highways and transit systems need \ncontinued support in order to meet our commercial and personal \ntransportation requirements.\n  It is therefore with deep regret that I will be voting against this \nconference report. I believe that we could have done much better and \nproduced a bill that continued federal support for transportation and \ntransit infrastructure without the problems that this bill has created.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to give my warmest thanks to \nthe leadership on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which \nI proudly serve, for the hard work and dedication that led us to \npresent the Conference Report on the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century, also known as ISTEA II.\n  I ask if the distinguished chairman of the Committee, Senator Chafee \nof Rhode Island, would respond to a question.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will be happy to respond to a question from the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. This conference report has provided \nimportant funding to preserve a bridge in California. This bridge is \nnot just any bridge. It is the bridge that is a symbol for my state and \nit is a national treasure. The Golden Gate Bridge is truly a jewel in \nCalifornia. It frames California as our Pacific Gateway. I believe many \nAmericans would agree it is one of our nation's most magnificent \narchitectural treasures.\n  But, Mr. President, it is also highly vulnerable to earthquakes. We \nneed to protect it. We have a 1.2 billion program in the Bay Area to \nprotect our bridges from earthquakes. This seismic retrofit and new \nconstruction is being paid for entirely by state revenues and by tolls \npaid by our motorists. The Golden Gate, however, is not a state bridge. \nIt is not a Federal bridge. It is owned by the Golden Gate Bridge and \nHighway Transportation District which collects the tolls and operates a \nlocal mass transit service. Consequently, the bridge, this treasure, \nneeds additional funds in order to pay for a $217 million program to \nprotect the bridge from earthquakes.\n  I am so pleased that Senator Chafee and my colleagues on the \nconference committee heeded our pleas for help on this project and \nprovided $51.75 million for the retrofit program. That amount includes \n$25 million from the Bridge Discretionary program.\n  I ask the chairman if it is his understanding that the Golden Gate \nBridge is eligible for additional funding from the discretionary bridge \nprogram.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, the Senator from California is correct, the Golden \nGate Bridge is eligible for additional discretionary funding from this \nprogram. I wished that the conference could have done more to earmark \nfunding, but the earmark provided was not intended to limit any \nadditional discretionary grants for the bridge.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As the Senate considers the conference report for the \nTransportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century, I want to take a \nmoment to discuss the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program \nthat is part of this bill.\n  The DBE program was designed to ensure that all Americans have the \nopportunity to compete for the many billions of dollars in contracts \nthat will\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\nflow from this legislation. The program, which has been in place since \n1982, has proven both necessary to and effective in our efforts to \nremedy discrimination in transportation procurement markets. By \nreauthorizing the DBE program again this year, Congress has signaled \nits belief that the evidence remains clear: we need this program if we \nare to remove the continuing barriers confronted by minority- and \nwomen-owned businesses.\n  Let me take a moment to share with my colleagues additional \ninformation that has come to light since the two chambers last \nconsidered the DBE program. A disparity study conducted for the \nColorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and released in April \nfound that there was a disproportionately small number of women- and \nminority-owned contractors participating in Colorado's transportation \nconstruction industry. The study showed that African-Americans received \nnone of the state-funded highway construction contracts over $500,000. \nHispanic firms received less than one-half of one percent (.26%), and \nwomen-owned businesses were awarded less than one-quarter of one \npercent (.18%). The vast majority of contracts--more than 99 percent--\nwent to firms owned by white men. The authors found that a significant \ndisparity existed between what minority contractors actually received \nand what they might be expected to receive in the absence of \ndiscrimination.\n  The Colorado study also demonstrated that the DBE program has worked \nin leveling the playing field for women- and minority-owned firms. It \nnotes that ``only when a DBE program has been in effect, has there been \nany significant dollar amounts utilized with [minority-/women-owned] \nfirms.''\n  The fact of the matter is that discrimination continues to plague \nminority- and women-owned firms in America. Congress has a strong and \ncompelling interest in remedying this situation; and in the DBE \nprogram, we have had and will continue to have an effective tool.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Rhode \nIsland that the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program has been an \neffective part of the highway program. It's given construction \ncompanies owned by women and minorities a seat at the table.\n  I also believe that the program is constitutional. Under the Supreme \nCourt's Adarand decision, affirmative action programs like the DBE \nprogram must pass two tests. The first is that the program serve a \ncompelling interest. The lower court decision in the Adarand case held \nthat there is such a compelling interest. The Senate debate reinforced \nthis point. There was discussion of discrimination in the construction \nindustry, and of statistics showing the underutilization of women- and \nminority-owned businesses in that industry, such as evidence of \ndramatic decreases in DBE participation in those areas in which DBE \nprograms have been curtailed or suspended.\n  There also was discussion of the second test, whether the program is \nnarrowly tailored. As I explained in my statements during debate on the \nMcConnell amendment, I believe that the program is narrowly tailored, \nboth under the current regulations and the new regulations, which \nemphasize flexible goals tied to the capacity of firms in the local \nmarket, the use of race-neutral measures, and the appropriate use of \nwaivers for good faith efforts.\n  As I said during the Senate debate, the DBE program is fair. It is \nnecessary. And it works. I am pleased that, in rejecting amendments \nthat would have undermined the DBE program, the Senate has reaffirmed \nits commitment to equal opportunity.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to associate myself with the remarks by my friend \nand colleague from Montana regarding the constitutionality of the \nprogram. This is an important matter, and I appreciate his comments. I \nhope our colleagues will find all of this information of interest.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. Chairman, I understand the amount authorized \nunder this section for the DART North-Central Light Rail Extension \nshall be no less than $188 million.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, in addition, I understand the federal share of the \nFull Funding Grant Agreement executed by the Department of \nTransportation for this project shall be $33 million.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct, and I thank the Chairman for his \nsupport in this matter.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my \nappreciation to Senators on both sides of the aisle, in particular my \ncolleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, for all their \nwork in crafting the new six-year transportation bill that is before \nus. A great deal of the credit must go to Senator Chafee and his staff, \nespecially Jimmie Powell, for their tireless efforts in crafting a \ncompromise bill that resolves a good number of contentious issues.\n   Mr. President, this highway bill reaffirms many of the revolutionary \nprinciples established by ISTEA in 1991. Like ISTEA, it provides broad \nand substantial support for all modes of surface transportation, \nincluding transit. It funds important maintenance, safety, and air \nquality needs as well as the construction of new infrastructure. As the \nproduct of difficult House-Senate negotiations, this compromise bill \ndoes not include every policy that I would have liked. Yet the bill \nrepresents a sound and reasonable basis for strong transportation \npolicy over the next six years, and I support it.\n  Finally, let me clarify one provision in the bill. A provision I \ndrafted provides funding for the development of a rail trail in Winsted \nand Winchester, Connecticut. This provision should be read to include \nthe development of the trail in Torrington, Connecticut, as part of \nthis project. The trail will provide residents with access to trails in \nBarkhamsted and Canton, Connecticut.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while I am very pleased with the \nallocations for Pennsylvania, I am voting against the ISTEA conference \nreport because the offsets hit the veterans' accounts so hard.\n  I compliment House of Representatives Chairman Bud Shuster and Senate \nChairman John Chafee on their extraordinary diligence and \naccomplishments as lead negotiators on this mammoth bill. I work \nclosely with them in Pennsylvania's infrastructure's needs and I thank \nthem for the accommodations on Pennsylvania's roads, bridges and mass \ntransit systems.\n  In seeking total offsets of $17.7 billion, the veterans' accounts \nhave been hit for $15.367 billion and 86.8% of the total offsets. As \nthe Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a chief advocate \nfor veterans' interests, I believe this is excessively disproportion.\n  There is an additional $25 billion in the highway trust fund. I am \nadvised that $25 billion will yield approximately $6 billion in \ninterest over the next six years. Those funds could have been used for \nthe offset or at least part of the offset; or other funds could have \nbeen found for a part of the offset.\n  Accordingly, I register this protest vote.\n  My concern for this veterans' offset is consistent with my position \nduring consideration of the FY '99 Budget Resolution when I opposed \nthis large offset in the veterans' accounts. I shall work to try to \nrecoup these offsets from the veterans' accounts as we move forward in \nthe appropriations process.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In July of 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency \npromulgated final rules that set new National Ambient Air Quality \nstandards for fine particle air pollution, known as PM2.5. The \nstandards require three years of monitoring data to be collected before \ndetermining whether an area is meeting the standards.\n  It is my understanding that under the Clean Air Act, Governors are \nrequired to submit designations for attainment, nonattainment and \nunclassifiable areas within their states within 120 days but no later \nthan 1 year following promulgation of a new or revised standard. The \nEPA is then required to promulgate designations within two years of the \nissuance of such final standards.\n  For the July 1997 PM2.5 standard, this schedule poses a problem. \nMonitors are not yet in place and three years of monitoring data will \nnot be available to permit Governors and the EPA to determine whether \nan area is or is not in attainment. Therefore, the Clean Air Act would \nrequire EPA to take the meaningless step of designating areas as \nunclassifiable in July of 1999 on the basis that three years of PM2.5 \nmonitoring data are unavailable.\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That's correct. But the Senate included an amendment in \nthis bill that addresses this problem. Under this amendment, for the \nJuly 1997 PM2.5 standards, EPA would no longer be required to designate \nareas regarding their PM2.5 attainment status in July of 1999.\n  Instead of the designation schedule currently in the Clean Air Act, \nthis amendment would establish the following requirements for PM2.5 \ndesignations: Section 4102 would extend the time for Governors to \nsubmit designations for the July 1997 PM2.5 standard until one year \nafter receipt of three years of monitoring data.\n  Rather than the two year period normally provided by the Clean Air \nAct, under section 4102(d) of this amendment, EPA would not be required \nto promulgate nonattainment, attainment and unclassifiable designations \nfor PM2.5 areas until one year after the Governors are required to \nsubmit the designations or until Dec. 31, 2005, whichever date is \nearlier.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference agreement on ISTEA now before \nthe Senate, which will appropriately be entitled ``The Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century'', is a magnificent accomplishment for \nthose of us who have labored many long months to achieve the enactment \nof this truly monumental highway bill. Today is the day that we have \nall been hoping for lo these many months. Today is the day Congress \nwill send to the President a 6-year ISTEA reauthorization act that \ntruly keeps faith with the American traveling public. In adopting this \nconference report, the Senate will make two profoundly important \nstatements to the American traveling public. First, we are telling the \nAmerican public that we are finally prepared to guarantee that the \nrevenues collected at the gas pump will indeed be spent for the purpose \nfor which they are collected; namely, the maintenance, upkeep, safety, \nand expansion of our national highway and transit systems. Second, we \nare telling the traveling public that we are determined to reverse the \nFederal Government's chronic underinvestment in our national highway \nneeds.\n  We are about to send to the President a highway bill calling for a \nfull $216 billion in transportation investments over the six years, \n1998 through 2003. Of that amount, $173 billion is provided in contract \nauthority for our national highway system.\n  Senators will recall that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993 assessed a new 4.3 cents gas tax, solely for the purpose of \ndeficit reduction. That was the first time since the Highway Trust Fund \nhad been established in 1956, that a permanent gas tax was put on the \nbooks for a purpose other than for transportation investments. In May \nof 1996, our former colleague, Senator Dole of Kansas, rekindled the \ndebate on the appropriate use of the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax. At \nthat time, I signaled to my colleagues my intent to offer an amendment \nto transfer this 4.3 cents gas tax from the general fund to its \nrightful place in the Highway Trust Fund so that it could be used to \nhelp meet our ever-growing unmet needs in the area of highway \nconstruction and maintenance, as well as to rebuild the thousands of \nunsafe and overburdened bridges throughout the nation. In my view, the \nFederal Government has, for too long, held its head in the sand while \nour Federal investment in our nation's infrastructure declined, both as \na percentage of our gross domestic product. As such, I was poised to \noffer my amendment to transfer the 4.3 cents tax into the Highway Trust \nFund throughout the summer of 1996. At the behest of both the majority \nand minority leaders, I deferred offering my amendment on two separate \ntax bills. Unfortunately, another opportunity to offer my amendment did \nnot arise during the 104th Congress.\n  During debate on the budget resolution last year, Senator Gramm \noffered a Sense-of-the-Senate amendment supporting the transfer of the \n4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax from deficit reduction to the Highway \nTrust Fund, and the spending of that revenue on our highway \nconstruction needs. Senator Gramm was joined by 81 of our colleagues in \nsupport of this amendment. Later that year, when the Finance Committee \nmarked up the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, it was Senator Gramm, who is \na member of that committee, who successfully included a provision \ntransferring the 4.3 cents to the Highway Trust Fund. That \nprovision became law with the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act in \nAugust of 1997.\n\n  Transferring this new revenue to the Highway Trust Fund was crucial, \nbecause it gave Congress the opportunity to authorize and commit \ndramatically increased resources on our National Highway System. \nUnfortunately, however, even with this new revenue coming into the \nHighway Trust Fund, the Environment and Public Works Committee reported \na highway bill on October 1, 1997, that failed to authorize even one \npenny of this new revenue to be spent on our Nation's highways and \nbridges. Indeed, under the funding levels reported by the Environment \nand Public Works Committee for the highway program, the unspent balance \nin the Highway Trust Fund (including both the highway and transit \naccounts), was expected to grow from $22.9 billion at the beginning of \n1998 to more than $55 billion at the end of 2003, the end of the ISTEA \nII authorization period. I found these figures to be grossly \nunacceptable. Senator Gramm and I did not successfully champion the \ntransfer of the 4.3 cents into the Highway Trust Fund so that the \nrevenue would sit in that Trust Fund, unspent. There was no question \nthat these funds were sorely needed on our Nation's highways. I have \ntaken to the Floor numerous times over the years to remind my \ncolleagues of the hundreds of thousands of miles of highways in the \nnation that are rated in poor or fair condition, and the thousands of \nbridges across our nation that are rated as deficient or functionally \nobsolete.\n  Following the Environment and Public Works Committee's action, I held \nseveral discussions on the subject with members of the committee, \nincluding Chairman Chafee, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus. As a \nconsequence of these discussions, I prepared an amendment to the \nhighway bill to authorize the spending of the full amount of revenues \ngoing into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. Given the \ncontinuing deterioration of our Nation's highways in all 50 states, and \nthe growing volume of concern on the part of the Nation's Governors and \nState legislators regarding the Federal Government's underinvestment in \nour infrastructure, I felt that it was essential that the Senate have \nan opportunity to vote on whether or not we meant what we said when we \nplaced these additional highway tax revenues into the Highway Trust \nFund.\n  I was pleased to have as the very first cosponsor of the amendment I \nhad prepared my very good friend and colleague, Senator Gramm. Shortly \nthereafter, our efforts were given a great boost when we were joined by \nSenator Baucus, the ranking member of the Surface Transportation \nSubcommittee, and Senator Warner, the subcommittee's chairman. Senators \nGramm, Baucus, Warner, and I diligently sought to obtain cosponsors for \nour amendment. In total, we were able to secure an additional 50 \ncosponsors, making a total of 54 cosponsors for the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-\nWarner amendment.\n  Our amendment authorized additional contract authority for highways \nover the period Fiscal Years 1999 through 2003, totaling $30.971 \nbillion. At the time we introduced our amendment, that amount was the \nCongressional Budget Office's estimate of the revenue from the 3.45 \ncents portion of the 4.3 cents gas tax that would be deposited into the \nhighway account of the Highway Trust Fund over that five-year period. \nIn January of this year, the Congressional Budget Office re-estimated \nthat five-year figure to a level of $27.41 billion, or a reduction of \n$3.561 billion from their earlier forecast.\n  During Senate debate on the highway reauthorization bill, Mr. \nPresident, it appeared that a true battle was brewing. The Senate was \ndivided into two camps--the camp of those that had joined with Senators \nByrd, Gramm, Baucus, and Warner in support of authorizing the spending \nof the additional revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, and the \nopposition, led by Senators Domenici and Chafee, who opposed this \napproach. This division was causing a delay in Senate consideration of \nthe ISTEA bill, a delay that\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\nmade all Senators uncomfortable, since we faced the May 1 deadline \nbeyond which most states could not obligate any federal aid highway \nfunds absent a new authorization bill. The fact is, that the May 1 \ncutoff of highway obligation authority is still in effect and is a \nmajor reason why it is so critical that Congress get this legislation \nto the President's desk before the Memorial Day Recess. Ultimately, in \nan attempt to break the Senate deadlock on the highway bill, the \nmajority leader, Mr. Lott, asked that all parties join him in his \noffice for negotiations on this issue. And so, Senator Gramm, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Domenici, Senator \nD'Amato, and I did join with the majority leader to discuss the \nsituation. After several days of back and forth discussions, under the \nvery adept moderating style of the majority leader, I was pleased that \nan agreement emerged that resulted in an amendment to the then-pending \nhighway bill totaling $25.920 billion in additional highway spending. \nThat amount represented 94 percent of CBO's most recent estimate of the \nrevenue to the highway account, stemming from the 4.3 cents gas tax.\n  On a matter that was of critical importance to me, the negotiated \namendment included $1.89 billion for the Appalachian Development \nHighway System. Coupled with the $300 million already in the committee \nbill for this system, total funding over the 6-year ISTEA bill, for the \nAppalachian Regional Highway System equaled $2.19 billion, the full \namount requested by the administration in their ISTEA proposal. Back in \nDecember--or January, rather, of 1997, I had met with the President \nwith the goal of convincing him of the importance of completing the \nAppalachian Highway System. The completion of these highways were \npromised to the people of Appalachia more than 32 years ago. But as we \nenter the new millennia, we find that our Interstate Highway System is \nalmost 100 percent complete while the Appalachian Highway System \nremains less than 78 percent complete. In my home State of West \nVirginia, we lag behind the average for the region. Our segments of the \nAppalachian Highway System are only 73 percent complete. I was pleased \nthat, following our meeting, the President saw fit to include $2.19 \nbillion for the Appalachian Highway System in his ISTEA reauthorization \nproposal. While this amount would not serve to complete the Federal \ncontribution toward the system, it represented a substantial boost to \nthe system and sent a signal to the entire Appalachian region that we \nare serious about completing these corridors. So the proposal also \nprovided for the Appalachian States to be able to draw down contract \nauthority from the trust fund in order to complete their Appalachian \ncorridors.\n  The $26 billion included in our amendment not only allowed for a \nboost to the Appalachian Highway System, it provided for substantial \nincreases in highway funding for all 50 States and many other national \nhighway initiatives. Perhaps, most importantly, it closed the \nsubstantial funding gap that existed in the total amount of funding in \nthe Senate highway bill and the highway bill under consideration in the \nHouse of Representatives. It paved the way for a less contentious and \nmore amicable conference. Put simply, by bringing the additional $26 \nbillion to the table, our amendment better enabled the conferees to \ninclude many critical initiatives in the conference agreement--\ninitiatives that might otherwise have been left out of our Federal \nAid Highway program for the next 6 years.\n\n  This conference agreement includes an historic increase in the \noverall level of investment in our Nation's highways, a 44 percent \nincrease over the levels authorized in the original ISTEA legislation \nfor the years 1992 through 1997. The agreement includes a total of \n$2.25 billion for the Appalachian Highway System. Within that amount, \nWest Virginia can expect to receive roughly $345 million to aid in the \ncompletion of Corridor H from Wardensville to Elkins and Corridor D in \nthe Parkersburg area. The bill also includes specific earmarks for \nseveral high priority projects throughout the State. These include: $50 \nmillion for West Virginia Route 10 from Logan to Man and $22.69 million \nfor the continued construction of the Coalfields Expressway in Southern \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I commend the conferees for their diligent efforts in \nreaching this historic agreement. I especially commend chairman Chafee \nand chairman Warner, as well as Senator Baucus, who have spent untold \nhours in negotiations with the House conferees in an effort to reach a \nfair and balanced conference agreement. I also commend chairman Shuster \nfor his splendid efforts on the House side in chairing this very \ndifficult conference and for bringing it to a successful conclusion in \nsuch an expeditious manner. Further, I want to especially commend my \nown Congressman, Representative Nick Rahall of the Third District of \nWest Virginia in which my voting residence is attained. He served as \none of the leaders of the House conferees and has been a stalwart ally \nin the effort to guarantee the American people that their gas taxes \nwill be spent on our Federal highways. His wisdom and his experience \nhave made West Virginia and the Nation proud.\n  I also compliment the many members of staff--for example Jim English \nand Peter Rogoff--who have worked diligently over these many, many \nmonths, as a matter of fact, in helping to bring this historic bill to \nfruition. I must thank, again, both leaders, Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lott, \nfor their support of the legislation. I thank all Senators who have \nparticipated one way or another in the working out of this agreement. \nAnd, again, I compliment and thank Mr. Shuster and the Members on the \nHouse side.\n  It was a difficult bill. It was a difficult battle and a difficult \nconference.\n  I close by thanking once more, Senator Gramm of Texas for his \nsplendid leadership, for his unfailing courage, for his high dedication \nto the passage of this bill, and also for his determination to do \neverything possible to see to it that the moneys the American people \nspent on the gas tax when they fill their fuel tanks go into the \nhighway trust fund and are spent on highways. I thank him for joining \nwith me in seeing to it that the amendment which would provide for the \nexpenditure of those trust fund moneys on highways and bridges was \nimplemented. This was the goal that we sought. We thought it was right. \nWe thought that it was being honest with the American people.\n  I don't think I could have had a better supporter and compatriot and \ncolleague in this effort than Senator Gramm. He is, indeed, a very able \nSenator, and has one of the brightest minds I have seen in my 40 years \nin this Senate. I salute him and express my gratitude for his steadfast \nsupport and his encouragement that he gave to me and to others of us \nwho worked together in this matter.\n  This conference agreement represents a remarkable accomplishment, \nlong sought by the American people and those of us who are fortunate \nenough to represent them. I commend all those whose efforts have \nbrought us to this historic day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia not only for his comments, but also for his \nuntiring work on this very important legislation. He is to be \ncommended. I thank all of our colleagues for their work and their \ncontribution on the highway bill. But I assure everyone in this country \nthat were it not for the senior Senator from West Virginia, this bill \nwould not have been passed in this body this afternoon and be part of \none of the most massive improvements of our transportation system in \nthis country. He is to be commended. I know there are so many people \nthat are not here today that want to say thank you to the very \ndistinguished Senator for his contribution in this regard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Louisiana. I thank \nhim for his kind words, and I thank him for his support all along the \nway which greatly helped us in bringing this legislation to its \nfruition. I thank him again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the conference report.

Mr. President, I rise for a moment to congratulate all \nof those Senators who have had so much to do with the success that we \nhave just demonstrated with the passage of the Interstate \nTransportation Efficiency Act, the so-called ISTEA II bill. Senator \nBaucus, Senator Chafee, Senator Warner, Senator Byrd, and Senator Gramm \ndeserve our accolades and our commendation for a job extraordinarily \nwell done.\n  This represents the single biggest investment in our infrastructure \nin our Nation's history. It represents an effort to recognize the \nimportance of infrastructure and the array of challenges that we face \nin an information age, as well as at the turn of this century and the \nentrance into a new millennium.\n  It also recognizes the importance of regional balance--the West, the \nSouth, the Northeast, the Midwest--all with our disparate challenges \nand problems that we face with infrastructure, all with the needs, all \nwith the recognition that our States are vastly different as those \nneeds are reflected in public policy. This not only represents the \ngreatest investment, in my view, it represents as well the best \nregional balance that we have been able to demonstrate.\n  Finally, I think it recognizes the importance of something the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from West Virginia \nhave said on the floor many times: We must recognize the critical \nnature of the trust fund itself and restore the practice that this \ncountry had at one point and was religious in adhering to, and that is \nthat we use the funds that are designated for particular trust funds as \nthey should be used. When this legislation is fully implemented, that \nis exactly what will happen; the trust fund will be used as it must be \nused.\n  Today, we spend approximately $32 billion from the trust fund on an \nannual basis, but only $21 billion goes to highways and infrastructure \nneeds; $11 billion, roughly, goes to needs that are not highway \ndesignated, that are not related to infrastructure. Mr. President, the \ntime has come for us to make a change in that practice, and this \nlegislation does it.\n  There has been a great deal of concern expressed on both sides of the \naisle about the veterans' offset. Frankly, I am very disappointed and \ndiscouraged about the fact that we are using a veterans' fund for \npurposes of offset, but this is not the last word. I must say, if we \nwere using the trust fund for which it was designed, we wouldn't need \nthe veterans' fund because the highway fund is more than adequate to \ncover our needs for infrastructure in this country.\n  We will revisit the veterans smoking issue, and, in my view, we will \nrevisit it in a successful way. We must recognize there is a dependency \ncreated in large measure because of past practices in the Armed Forces \nthat we must address. Whether it is in the smoking bill, whether it is \nin some other legislation in the future, we will not ignore the fact \nthat veterans need the same consideration as every other smoker in this \ncountry; in fact, in some cases you could clearly say more.\n  There are two issues to be resolved: One is the offset; the second is \nthe policy. I believe in the longer term we will deal with both \nsuccessfully. But that should not in any way dissuade us from taking \ngreat satisfaction today with this accomplishment, for the tremendous \njob that was done in bringing us to this point; that, in fact, at long \nlast--a month overdue--at long last we did what the Nation was waiting \nfor us to do: Pass a meaningful infrastructure bill that represents the \nneeds, challenges, and demands that must be put on this Nation as we \nenter a new era.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5417-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me make a brief comment. I want to associate my \ncomments and feeling with the earlier remarks of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, with regard to his comments about \nthis bill and the use of funds in the highway legislation that could be \nused for veterans disability benefits associated with smoking.\n  I was very, very pleased to hear Senator Daschle point out very \nclearly that this issue will be revisited. It needs to be revisited. It \nis unfortunate, I think, that moneys that were going to be available \nfor veterans who have suffered disabilities from smoking problems will \nbe used for part of this legislation that we just recently passed. But \nI think it is very clear there is a strong feeling among most all \nmembers of the Commerce Committee that this is an issue that needs to \nbe revisited. We need to find the funds to make sure that these types \nof health disabilities are taken care of and that if it is a veterans \ndisability associated with their service that they be treated as such. \nI support that. I will be here to do anything that I can to try and \ncorrect this problem.\n  As we deal with the tobacco legislation on the floor, it would seem \nto me this would be, perhaps, a good way of addressing this particular \nissue as a health-related smoking issue. I hope we could find a way \nwithin the tobacco legislation to address this.\n  I stand committed to work with Senator Daschle on finding a way to \ncorrect this problem. I am quite confident that we will be able to do \nso, and certainly I am committed to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5417-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5417-S5419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, before we break for the Memorial Day \nrecess, I\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\nwould like to remark on the celebration of Asian Pacific American \nHeritage Month and to honor the contributions Asian Pacific Americans \nhave made to our country.\n  Mr. President, the scope of the celebration has expanded every year \nsince 1992, when President Bush signed Public Law 102-450 designating \nMay of every year as ``Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.'' In \nWashington, D.C., and in cities all around the nation, schools, \ncommunity organizations, cultural groups, and government agencies are \ncommemorating the occasion with film festivals, conferences, cultural \nshows, museum exhibits, political forums, and a multitude of other \nactivities.\n  Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent number 10 million and \nthat figure continues to rise. Asian Pacific Americans represent a \nbroad range of ethnic groups. Their histories are as diverse as the \nlands of their origin. The earliest immigrants--Chinese, Japanese, \nAsian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos--and the most recent refugees--\nVietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians--all experienced similar, yet \nunique journeys as they crossed the Pacific to venture to a new land of \nopportunity. Opportunities, however, were not as plentiful as they \nwould have hoped. From the Chinese Exclusion Laws, which restricted \nimmigration on a racial basis, to Executive Order 9066, which resulted \nin the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans and their \nimmigrant relatives, life in America, at times, proved to be a \nnightmare rather than the promised American Dream. But despite \nseemingly insurmountable obstacles, these early intrepid immigrants \ntoiled and sacrificed in order to make this country their own and to \npreserve the American dream for their American children. They helped \nbuild our railroads, labored on our farms, worked endless factory \nhours, and formed the backbone of many small businesses.\n  Today, even more so than in the past, Asian Pacific Americans \ncontribute to every sector of our society. They are in corporate board \nrooms, scientific laboratories, universities, Congress, statehouses, \nthe judiciary, government agencies, the performing arts, and sports. \nThey are architects like I.M. Pei, scientists like AIDS researcher \nDavid Ho, statesmen like Senator Dan Inouye, writers like journalist \nIris Chang, musicians like conductor Zubin Mehta, filmmakers like Chris \nTashima, sports heroes like Tiger Woods, and warriors like General Eric \nShinseki. Unfortunately, the scope and ubiquity of Asian Pacific \naccomplishments are often overshadowed by insensitive acts directed \nagainst members of the community.\n  For example, during last year's investigation of campaign finance \nabuses, the distinction between foreign donors and Asian American \ndonors was frequently blurred by members of both political parties and \nthe media. While investigations focused on contributions made to the \nDemocratic National Committee by foreign donors, legitimate American \ndonors were unduly interrogated and harassed simply because their \nsurnames happened to sound ``foreign.''\n  For their part, the media, including major newspapers, networks, and \nmagazines, often confused ``Asian'' with ``Asian American'' in their \nstories and headlines on the donor controversy, though they never \nseemed to confuse ``European'' with Americans of European extraction. \nThe media's inability to distinguish between foreigners and citizens \ncontributed to the stereotypical impression that there is a nefarious \n``connection'' between all Asians and Asian Americans.\n  This bias was in more recent evidence just after Michelle Kwan and \nTara Lipinski honored America by winning the silver and gold Olympic \nfigure skating medals, respectively. Immediately after the event, the \ninternet website of NBC's cable affiliate, MSNBC, contained the \nheadline, ``American Beats Out Kwan for Women's Figure Skating Title.'' \nAs we all know, both Lipinski and Kwan are Americans. But the \ndifference between the two champions, in the eyes of MSNBC's editors, \nwas their skin color, making one ``more'' American than the other.\n  Mr. President, instances like these remind us that Asian Pacific \nAmericans, whatever their achievements, whatever their contributions to \nthe nation, are still perceived as foreigners, whether fifth or first \ngeneration. These unfortunate incidents are reminders that as a nation \nwe still have a long journey ahead of us on the road to tolerance and \nmutual understanding.\n  But I would be remiss if I did not also point out that there have \nalso been a number of developments that have helped advance the Asian \nPacific community's quest to become fully accepted members of American \nsociety. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two notable \nevents which occurred during this month's celebration of Asian Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month, events that I hope reflect a growing \nunderstanding of, and appreciation for, Asian Pacific Americans by \nfellow Americans.\n\n  First, last Saturday, a ceremony celebrating the designation of Angel \nIsland as a National Historic Landmark was held in San Francisco. \nLocated in San Francisco Bay, Angel Island Immigration Station served \nas an immigration processing station for many West Coast immigrants \nbetween 1910 and 1940. Most of the immigrants entering through Angel \nIsland were Chinese, but a sizable portion of the immigrants came from \nJapan, the Philippines, and Europe as well. However, the Chinese \nexperience was vastly different from that of other immigrants, \nregardless of which port of entry they entered through. Subject to a \nseries of Chinese exclusion laws beginning in 1882, Chinese immigrants \ncould only enter the United States under the ``exempt class.'' Instead \nof a welcoming atmosphere, these Chinese were subjected to days, weeks, \nmonths, and even years of hostile interrogation before being admitted \nto the U.S. or being deported back to China. They languished in prison-\nlike conditions at Angel Island until decisions were handed down. In \ncontrast, processing at Ellis Island took an immigrant, on average, \nthree to five hours. Angel Island Immigration Station closed in 1940 \nafter processing over 175,000 Chinese immigrants.\n  In 1970, a state park ranger discovered scores of poems beautifully \ncarved into the wooden walls of the detention barracks, evidently \ncomposed by its onetime Chinese and Japanese resident. In one poem, a \nprospective Chinese immigrant wrote:\n\n     Every one says traveling to North America is a pleasure.\n     I suffered misery on the ship and sadness in the wooden \n           building.\n     After several interrogations, still I am not done.\n     I sigh because my compatriots are being forcibly detained.\n\n  Another wrote\n\n     Originally, I had intended to come to America last year.\n     Lack of money delayed me until early autumn.\n     It was on the day that the Weaver Maiden met the Cowherd.\n     That I took passage on the President Lincoln.\n     I ate wind and tasted waves for more than twenty days.\n     Fortunately, I arrived safety on the American continent.\n     I thought I could land in a few days.\n     How was I to know I would become a prisoner suffering in the \n           wooden building?\n     The barbarians abuse is really difficult to take.\n     When my family's circumstances stir my emotions, a double \n           stream of tears flow.\n     I only wish I can land in San Francisco soon,\n     Thus sparing me this additional sorrow here.\n\n  These poignant works reveal the hardships these immigrants endured; \nbut, more importantly, they also revealed hopes and desires that are \nuniversal to the American story. This story is work preserving, whether \nit is the experience of the Irish of Boston, the Italians of New York \nCity, the African Americans of Savannah, the Mexicans of El Paso, or \nthe Cambodians of Long Beach.\n  I would like to congratulate the Angel Island Immigration Station \nFoundation, the Chinese Historical Society of America, the California \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation, and the many other community \norganizations and individuals who worked tirelessly to procure National \nHistoric Landmark status for Angel Island. It is my hope the new \ndesignation will help preserve a significant experience in the lives of \nAsian Pacific immigrants, on that will also resonate with the universal \nimmigration experience of all Americans.\n  The second promising development that occurred this month was the \nannouncement by Hasbro Toys, the company, which manufactures ``G.I. \nJoe,'' that it will be creating a Japanese American G.I. Joe, as part \nof its G.I.\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nJoe Classics Collection. The action figure will honor the Japanese \nAmericans who fought valiantly for our country during World War II.\n  My colleagues will recall that as members of the famed 100th Infantry \nBattalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team, Japanese American soldiers \nsuffered unparalleled casualties in the French and Italian campaigns. \nMany veterans today still recall the heroism of this fighting unit, \nwhich during one famous engagement sustained 800 casualties to save the \nlives of some 200 members of a Texas battalion who were facing certain \nannihilation by German troops. The 442nd emerged as one of the most \ndecorated units in our nation's military history, among its more famous \nmembers is Senator Daniel Inouye, whose heroism earned him the \nDistinguished Service Cross.\n  Aside from their military prowess, what was even more remarkable \nabout these brave men was the fact that they were fighting for a \ncountry which was, in essence, holding their families hostage in \ninternment camps. One of the darkest chapters of our nation's history \nwas the forced evacuation of over 110,000 Japanese Americans into \ninternment camps.\n  And so I am very pleased that a toy company, which markets to our \nmost important community, our children, has dispensed with typical \nmarketing values to honor America's home-grown Asian Pacific American \nheroes. For ultimately, only change in our cultural values will have \ntransformational effect on race and ethnic relations as we approach the \nnext millennium.\n  Mr. President, I am Native Hawaiian and I am Chinese, but above all I \nam American. I have embraced all of my identities and hope that others \ncan learn to embrace and cherish our inherent diversity. It is my \nsincere hope that as we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth, each and every citizen will reflect on our nation's multiple \nheritages and appreciate the relationship between our racial and ethnic \ndiversity and the unity that binds us together as Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5417-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5419-S5420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE SENATE'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the honor of closing up today \nand sending everyone on their way back to their homes with the joyous \nnews that there is highway money. I go back to Wyoming almost every \nweekend and travel 1,200 miles across Wyoming's vast open spaces, and \nwe will appreciate that highway money. It truly has been a landmark \nachievement. I want to congratulate the senior Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Thomas, for his outstanding efforts on that bill. He did some \nearly drafting and formulas that have helped tremendously in this. I \nhave also appreciated his guidance since I have been here. Now we are \nheading back to our respective States.\n\n\n                        The Tobacco Legislation\n\n  The other thing that we have done this week is spend some time \ndebating the tobacco settlement, debating how we can get teens to quit \nsmoking, debating how we can solve the problems of tobacco. I hope that \nall Senators go back to their States and talk about this landmark piece \nof legislation that is before us--landmark in that it will be the \nlargest tax increase in my memory, a tax increase that will be placed \non a separate segment of the people.\n  I am going to stop right here and mention that I have not taken any \nmoney from the tobacco companies. When I was campaigning, I desperately \nneeded some funds, but I didn't feel that it was right to do that. My \ncomments are not based on that. It is concern out of what we debated \nthis last week, the constitutionality of whether we have the right to \nsolve this problem in this body for every person in the Nation, whether \nwe can set that kind of a precedent. I am sure that if people have been \nwatching, they have been a little confused about the amount of time it \nhas taken to debate it. I want to assure them that it will take \nconsiderably more time to debate this issue. This would probably be \nmore appropriate in six bills, coming from six different committees. It \nwas tried that way, and it was determined that it needed to be in one \nbill. Each of those bills would require as much debate as we had this \nweek.\n  We are going from a premise that these companies need to be punished. \nLately, documents have shown that they have withheld information from \ntheir consumers--the people using the product--that shows that nicotine \nis definitely addictive, that it does affect their health, that it is \ngoing to hurt them. Consequently, there is a desire across this Nation \nto punish those companies. But as several of my constituents who smoke \nhave said, ``Let's see, they abused my body for years, and now you want \nto punish them by taxing me?'' And we do this in the name of reducing \nteen smoking. We all want to reduce teen smoking. We hope they realize \nthat 3,000 kids a day start smoking and they are going to kill \nthemselves, and 1,000 of them for sure in that day will be killed \nsooner. And we say raising the price of cigarettes will do that.\n\n  I have been traveling Wyoming. I have been asking people about the \nprice and how that would affect them. I have been going to schools when \nI am out there and asking about that price. And the general consensus \nis, yes, for a little while it will make a difference. But they refer \nme to other kinds of drug use that is expensive, more expensive, and \nincreasingly expensive, and that use is going up.\n  I saw a college report from the George Washington University which \nwas looking at the fact that they have increased the requirements on \nsmoking on campus, and yet the number of kids smoking has gone up. At a \nuniversity, they are supposed to be more intellectual perhaps. I know \nthey believe they are. But they are still smoking more. So they are not \nthinking through the problem. But they asked them why. Part of it is \nrebelliousness. Part of it is because their parents did it. There are a \nnumber of reasons. None of the answers suggested included that the \nprice would make a difference.\n  Kids today are paying outlandish amounts for a pair of tennis shoes. \nI sold shoes for 28 years. Would you believe they are paying 50 bucks \nfor a pair of tennis shoes? I said that just to see if you were paying \nattention. Do you know that there are tennis shoes out there for 150 \nbucks and the kids are buying them? It is the kids that have the money \nto buy them. There are more kids working today, making money, and they \nare not using that money to help support their family. It is money that \nthey get to spend. They are spending it on things like $150 tennis \nshoes.\n  So an increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes will bother them \nfor a little while but not as a long problem.\n  Who winds up with the money in this bill? We have heard some comments \nhere that in the highway bill there may have been some money taken from \nveterans. That was money never passed by Congress, never budgeted by \nCongress, never funded by Congress, and wasn't even in the President's \nbudget this year to have that money. I don't know why it isn't in this \nsmoking bill. Everything else is. Everything else is--even things that \nare not remotely related to smoking. If you ever had an idea for a \nproject, this is a bill you can put it in. We will just kick the price \nof cigarettes up just a little bit. That will solve everything. It \nstarted out at $368.5 billion, went to $516 billion, and perhaps now is \nat $800 billion. We could match the regular U.S. budget in the \ntrillions with this, eventually. We can just add in some other \nprograms.\n  We are talking about compensating farmers. That will be the big \ndebate when we get back. And the farmers ought to be involved in this \ndebate. But we are talking about perhaps $20,000 an acre. And they get \nto keep the land? We are talking about vending machine owners. The \nmachines run $1,500 to $2,500, maybe $3,500. We are talking about \ncompensating them $13,000 per machine? That is where their current \nvalue of future lost revenue is--the amount of money they could have \nmade off that machine, as though it was our fault that they bought the \nmachine, as though it was our fault that smoking was bad for people.\n  Those are debates we will have when we get back, and those debates \nwill take awhile.\n  The FDA is being given explicit authority in this. They need to \nprobably\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nhave some explicit authority. But their budget already under our budget \nis increased significantly. Now, under this bill, we increase it 10 \ntimes more, $34 million to $340 million, a huge increase. We are \nexpecting those people to gear up and utilize that money. It looks like \nwe are forming an additional bureaucracy. I also want you to watch the \ndollars.\n\n  In Wyoming, for years we have been talking about increasing the price \nof the tax on cigarettes by 15 cents. When I was in the State \nlegislature in Wyoming, we talked about that. We usually talked about \nputting that money to health needs. Even talking about putting it to \nthe health needs, it raised approximately $8 million a year. I have to \nfocus on the difference here between billion and million. In the \nStates, a million is a lot of money. Out here, a billion is not much. \nBut that 15 cents a pack raises $8 million. We are told that $1.10 a \npack will raise $6 million. It doesn't sound like very good math. It \nsounds like the usual Washington program where it comes back here, we \nkeep a bunch of it, and we send a little bit back. If that is the case, \nthe State would do it better. It would have more money for the States.\n  I am going to mention two final concerns that I have on this. When we \npassed the budget bill, we talked about the need to help Medicare with \nmoney that came from the tobacco. That is what we were going to do with \nall of the money from the tobacco settlement--put it into Medicare, \nshore that up. It is in bad financial shape. That would give us some \nmore time to work on it. There is very little provision in this bill \nfor doing anything for Medicare. We should take care of Medicare. That \nwould be a medical use for the money. That would be money that \nnonsmokers have been paying in to pay for smokers' problems that \nincrease the cost of Medicare.\n  The final need that we have to have in the bill is a provision where \nwe don't spend the money until we have the money. It disturbs me a lot \nthat we are talking about putting an industry out of business but \nrelying on ever-increasing revenues from this business going out of \nbusiness. Somehow the basic counting instincts here just do not \nbalance. We really have to be sure that the money gets collected before \nit gets spent if we are going to decrease the revenues.\n  So there are a lot of concerns there.\n  I hope my colleagues will go home to their States and discuss with \nthe people there the complexities of this bill. I don't know that there \nhas been that complex a bill before. We are not going to probably break \nit down into six separate bills. So there will be a long debate on it \nwhen we get back. Share your ideas. Share your concerns. And we will \nget with that when we come back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5419-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as the United States fought World War \nII, Americans mobilized in support of the war effort like they never \nhad before. Everyone was trying to find a way to help our troops battle \nthe Axis and keep the world free and safe. Whether it was children \nflattening and saving tin cans that were used for scrap metal, or \npeople growing fruits and vegetables in ``Victory Gardens'', everyone \ntried to find a way to make their own contribution to winning the war \nand supporting our men and women in uniform.\n  It was at this time that the American Red Cross took on the \nresponsibility of collecting blood that would ultimately be used to \nhelp save the lives of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Army Air \nCorpsmen wounded in action. The efforts of the Red Cross were truly a \nsuccess as they helped to reduce the death rate among the wounded by \nfifty percent.\n  For the past fifty years, the American Red Cross has been responsible \nfor administering the Nation's blood supplies and they have done a \ncommendable job in ensuring that the United States has a ready and \nample reserve of blood for those who need it. Just a few days ago, on \nApril 30th, American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole helped to \ncelebrate the fiftieth anniversary of that organization's Biomedical \nServices. Her remarks nicely illustrate the contributions and \naccomplishments of the Red Cross in administering the Nation's blood \nsupply. I think that my colleagues and the public would be interested \nto read what Mrs. Dole had to say and I ask unanimous consent that her \nremarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Remarks of Elizabeth Dole\n\n       Thank you, Paul, for that kind introduction and ladies and \n     gentlemen, thank you so much. And special thanks to Donna \n     Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, and David \n     Kessler, Dean of the Yale Medical School and former \n     Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration We are \n     delighted you could be with us today as we mark the 50th \n     anniversary of the most important of our national reserves: \n     America's reserve of life, the American blood supply. Thank \n     you, Donna and David, for your continued leadership, and for \n     your steadfast dedication to the safety and quality of \n     American health.\n       Aren't we thrilled to have Garth Brooks here. Garth, you \n     have a magical hold on the spirit of our people. What a joy \n     it is that you would share that bond with us. We are \n     enormously grateful.\n       What a day! We are also so very pleased to be joined by the \n     Oak Ridge Boys! Boys, your music puts the party in the \n     birthday, and we thank you.\n       Also, many thanks to the other wonderful celebrities with \n     us today--Lynda Carter, Kennedy, and William Moses. We \n     sincerely appreciate your generosity in joining us to \n     celebrate our 50th birthday of Biomedical Services. And, \n     welcome to Councilwoman Charlene Drew Jarvis, the daughter of \n     Dr. Charles Drew, renowned plasma pioneer for the American \n     Red Cross and leading authority on transfusion. The Charles \n     Drew Institute honors his memory. Thank you, Charlene, for \n     your support over the years.\n       As we observe this 50th anniversary, of American Red Cross \n     Blood services, it's a time to take satisfaction in our past \n     and pride in where we've been. The Red Cross started \n     collecting blood during World War II in order to save \n     soldiers' lives, and our efforts were credited with reducing \n     the death rate among these soldiers to half that of their \n     World War I counterparts. When peace came, we created \n     America's first nationwide, volunteer blood collection and \n     distribution system, assuring all our citizens access to one \n     of the great medical advances of this century.\n       But health events in the last two decades rocked us to our \n     very foundations. The age of blood-borne diseases such as \n     AIDS and new forms of hepatitis swooped down on us with a \n     vengeance. We knew we could no longer operate at the Red \n     Cross as we had done for so many years. Which is why this \n     year, our 50th anniversary, is a year to look forward, rather \n     than back. Today I take great joy in announcing an historic \n     achievement:\n       As the year closes, the American Red Cross will celebrate \n     the completion of our nearly seven-year, $287 million dollar \n     transformation of our blood operations. This long-awaited \n     milestone is the reason I stand here with so much \n     confidence--and hope--for the future. The accomplishment of \n     Transformation is a great, triumphant victory in our common \n     endeavor to expand what is possible in health care.\n       And I'm also pleased to announce today that, following this \n     speech, I am leaving on a nation-wide tour of blood drives \n     and celebrity events to focus attention on the safety \n     revolution in America's blood supply. Many of our citizens \n     are still frightened of transfusions, and they should not be! \n     Many millions still mistrust those red bags of life, and they \n     must not! We have achieved a new American miracle in blood, \n     and I will take that message across America. We will \n     celebrate and we will educate but first, let me ruminate.\n       When I came to the Red Cross in February 1991, the legal \n     and financial vulnerabilities of our blood operations \n     threatened the very\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\n     viability of the Red Cross. The country was pretty worried \n     about the safety of America's blood supply back then. And as \n     the person newly responsible for half of it, so was I. Some \n     of our Board members wanted us to get out of blood banking \n     altogether, believing our duty to safeguard the rest of our \n     historic organization demanded that we abandon this mission \n     field. Between Congressional hearings, media exposes and \n     enormous regulatory pressure, there were days when I wanted \n     to get out, too.\n       Still, the question haunted us: if we left blood banking, \n     who would fill our shoes? The Red Cross is not a public \n     agency, but what we do--especially in blood--is a public \n     trust. We weren't going to let America down. Not on our \n     watch.\n       The blood supply was as safe as the current blood systems \n     and contemporary scientists knew how to make it. But in the \n     age of AIDS and other blood borne infectious diseases, wasn't \n     there more we could do? We had to ``think outside the box'' \n     with respect to existing science, blood supply management, \n     and safety approaches.\n       We dreamed, in 1991, of where we wanted to go. But we did \n     more than that. We mustered our courage and embraced \n     Transformation as our ticket to ride. It was the most \n     ambitious project the Red Cross had ever undertaken: the \n     total redesign of how we collect, process, test, and deliver \n     nearly half of America's blood supply. I dare say it is the \n     most profound change any non-profit organization has made in \n     recent memory!\n       At the time, it felt the way I imagine a Shuttle astronaut \n     must feel on her first space walk letting go of the ship, \n     taking her first step into the unknown. It felt as if our \n     whole organization had let go. . .let go of the security of \n     status-quo standards, let go of the financial certainty \n     underpinning our entire operation, let go of what we knew, in \n     search of what we hoped to find--but knowing that each step \n     was backed up by a truly exceptional scientific team entirely \n     committed to forging new frontiers. I feel so fortunate that \n     Jim Ross with Brian McDonough and each member of his \n     outstanding team answered my call to complete this challenge.\n       In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration imposed a consent \n     decree on our blood services operations. But as David will \n     tell you, we were already more than two years into \n     Transformation. The consent decree was basically a \n     codification or ratification of our far-reaching plan, with \n     timelines and milestones for measuring our progress. And \n     today, as we conclude Transformation, we also are wrapping up \n     our last requirements under the decree.\n       With the completion of Transformation this year, we will \n     have forced ourselves from the mind set of always doing \n     things the way we had done them before. We already have left \n     behind our days in the comfort of industry averages to become \n     the undisputed leader in blood banking. Once we were weighed \n     down with 53 non-standardized blood centers running 28 \n     computer systems in a patchwork quilt of regions, each with \n     its own operating procedures and business practices. Today we \n     have one set of operational procedures, one set of business \n     practices, and one state of the art computer system--which \n     gives us the best national donor deferral system and the \n     largest blood information data base in the world for \n     transfusion medicine research.\n       We determined that today's demands were best met in high-\n     volume, state-of-the-art, centralized labs, so we replaced \n     our 53 testing facilities with 8 state of the art, high-tech \n     laboratories that today are the leading centers of their kind \n     in the world. This enables us to quickly incorporate medical \n     technology as it evolves.\n       Perhaps most importantly, today we no longer fear finding \n     our own faults. We actively seek them out, report them and \n     then fix them, ourselves. We hired a leader in quality \n     assurance who created an independent program, providing more \n     than 200 experts to audit and consult with all of our fixed \n     sites. We actively monitor for more than 150 possible \n     deviations in manufacturing. And our folks, can and on \n     occasion have shut down a process immediately, when they have \n     found a serious deviation from standard operating procedure.\n       In short, we have a new, centralized management structure, \n     a new information system, and the best quality assurance \n     program in existence. We have consolidated and modernized \n     testing and have strictly standardized procedures and \n     training across our system. As a matter of fact, we now run \n     the highly acclaimed Charles Drew Biomedical Institute--and \n     provide leadership to the entire blood banking community.\n       We have moved to a position of leadership in an industry \n     which has achieved phenomenal success in the face of \n     frightening odds: In 1991, an American's risk of HIV \n     transmission from a blood transfusion was one in 220,000. \n     Today, it is nearly one in 700,000--more than a three-fold \n     reduction in risk. I'd say that is worth cheering about, \n     wouldn't you?\n       Today, I can say what I could not seven years ago: the Red \n     Cross is in the blood business to stay. We are sure of our \n     mission and we know how to fulfill it. No longer an \n     organization constrained by yesterday's technology, we \n     operate today with the gleaming precision and efficiency of \n     what is still, for most in the world, only tomorrow's \n     possibilities. We offer Cadillac quality coupled with Volvo \n     security. Don't get me wrong: every car on the lot meets the \n     government standard for safety. But like Cadillac and Volvo, \n     we have set standards of our own.\n       Unlike car companies, however, we don't do what we do for a \n     profit. The pins on our lapels and the patches on our sleeves \n     remind us daily that we are in this business to fulfill a \n     national trust, to live up to our moral commitment to do the \n     best we can to ensure the well-being of the American people. \n     We are also reaching out to the rest of the world, sharing \n     the lessons we have learned from Transformation to help \n     improve the safety and reliability of the world's blood \n     supply.\n       Of course, modernization and improvement is a process that \n     must never end. As David Kearns, the former chairman of \n     Xerox, once said, ``In the race for quality, there is no \n     finish line.'' This could never be more true than in the \n     blood banking business. We're determined to remain not only \n     the industry leader in quality and safety, but to place \n     ourselves in the forefront of new product development.\n       At our world-class Holland Laboratory, Red Cross physicians \n     and scientists are evaluating and monitoring possible threats \n     to the blood supply and working on many other new, cutting-\n     edge technologies--some of which we will share with you \n     today.\n       But all this technology wouldn't be worth a thing without \n     the Red Crossers who make it work for America. They are the \n     reason and the inspiration for our service. We have 1.3 \n     million volunteers, 32,000 paid staff, and 4.3 million blood \n     donors--that's 20,000 donors every day--I'd like to stop just \n     a minute to give those quiet heroes a loud round of applause.\n       Yes, after 50 years in Blood Services--and spending the \n     last seven years transforming them, the American Red Cross \n     has much to celebrate. In addition to enhancing blood safety, \n     our investment has given us the knowledge and confidence to \n     shape our own future.\n       Before Transformation, the Red Cross and other blood banks \n     around the country waited for signals from the FDA that \n     change was required. Today, the Red Cross is a leader of \n     change. While Transformation the program is nearly complete, \n     Transformation the process will be never ending.\n       There is a story I love about Supreme Court Justice Oliver \n     Wendell Holmes. When Justice Holmes was in his 90s, he took a \n     trip on the Pennsylvania Railroad. As he saw the conductor \n     coming down the aisle, he began patting his pockets, looking \n     for his ticket. The conductor, recognizing the famous jurist, \n     said, ``Don't worry, Mr. Justice. I'm sure you'll find your \n     ticket when you leave the train, and certainly the \n     Pennsylvania Railroad will trust you to mail it back later.''\n       Justice Holmes looked up at the conductor with some \n     irritation and said, ``My dear man, the problem is not, where \n     is my ticket. The problem is, where am I going?''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, the American Red Cross knows where \n     it's going! As we have led the nation in blood \n     transformation, so we will set a new credo of business for \n     businesses of the heart. But more than that, we are dedicated \n     to saving and improving every life we can. We at the Red \n     Cross want to be the model for non-profits in the next \n     century. The status quo is no longer our milieu. Well into \n     the new millennium, the Red Cross will seek out the cutting \n     edge; we will be the people who question the range of \n     possibilities--in blood banking as well as in every other \n     aspect of our mission.\n       But we know we cannot accomplish all of our dreams by \n     ourselves. We need the time and money, the brainpower and the \n     lifeblood of Americans like you. Together, we will continue \n     to imagine the unimaginable and attain the unattainable. \n     Together, we will be privileged to touch, and in so doing \n     transform, the millions of individual lives we are dedicated \n     to serve.\n       On behalf of our entire Red Cross family, thank you for all \n     you've done, and for all you continue to do. And on this \n     special day, thanks for coming to our party.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5420-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5421-S5422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating \nthe people of the Republic of Georgia on the 80th anniversary of their \nindependence.\n  Eighty years ago on May 26, 1918, following the collapse of the \nRussian Empire, the people of Georgia gained their independence and \nestablished their own government. Tragically, Georgia's independence \nwas short-lived. In March 1921, the Soviet Army reoccupied Georgia, \nbeginning decades of further occupation, domination and repression.\n  Despite this persecution by the Soviet leadership, the spirit of the \nGeorgian people could not be defeated. Throughout almost seventy years \nof Soviet rule, the people of Georgia never lost sight of their goal to \nbe free from outside domination and influence.\n  Finally, in 1991, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, the people of Georgia were again able to \nrealize their dream of independence, and their nation now enjoys a \nbright future. The election of President Eduard Shevardnadze and the \nelection of a Parliament committed to legal reform in 1995 have \nencouraged economic growth and reforms in human rights.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n  Today, as we celebrate this 80th anniversary of Georgia's \nindependence, we also honor and commend the Georgian people for their \ncourage and commitment in achieving their dream of a nation free again \nat last and committed to the principles of democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5421-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5422-S5423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AWARD OF DOD's DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about \nour former colleague and Majority Leader, Senator Robert Dole.\n  There are few people who have given more to this Nation than Bob \nDole. He has dedicated his life to public service. He was a young Army \nofficer during World War II, helping to liberate Europe, where as we \nall know, he suffered his lifelong wounds. He served in the Kansas \nState House, in the United States House of Representatives, and \nultimately in the United States Senate, as Majority Leader, where he \nleft his greatest mark. Even though he no longer holds elected office, \nBob still finds ways to contribute to the public good through a variety \nof efforts, not the least of which is his work on the World War II \nMemorial. He is truly a man who has distinguished himself through his \nselflessness, who has rendered the Nation a great service, and is \nworthy of the respect and admiration of all Americans.\n  A few weeks ago, another one of our former colleagues, Secretary of \nDefense William Cohen, made certain that Senator Dole knew the high \nregard in which he is held by the men and women of our armed services \nby holding a full dress parade in his honor and bestowing upon him the \nDepartment of Defense's Distinguished Public Service Award. This was an \nespecially impressive ceremony that weaved together pageantry, \nheritage, and patriotism in a stirring tribute to both Senator Dole and \nhis service to the United States. I was particularly moved by the \nremarks of my two friends and want to share them with my colleagues in \nthe Senate, and with the Nation through the Congressional Record. I am \ncertain that all who read these speeches will agree with me that they \nprovide both insight into a modest and private man and a fitting \ntribute to a true American hero.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of Secretary Cohen's and Senator \nDole's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenator Bob Dole--Remarks Prepared for Delivery, Fort Meyer, Virginia, \n                             April 29, 1998\n\n       If given the choice between receiving an award from a \n     Secretary of Defense or appointing a Secretary of Defense, I \n     would have picked the latter.\n       Seriously, I am humbled and honored by this award, and it \n     means all the more to me because it was presented by a man I \n     have long been privileged to call my friend. Thank you, Mr. \n     Secretary, for this ceremony, for this award, and for \n     reminding us that when it comes to our national defense, we \n     should not define ourselves as Democrats or Republicans, but \n     rather, simply as Americans.\n       I am also pleased to be joined today by the president of \n     the American Red Cross. Throughout this century, wherever you \n     have found American service men and women--whether on the \n     battlefield, on the base, or in the hospital--you knew that \n     close by you would also find the American Red Cross.\n       And on behalf of all the past and present members of the \n     Armed Forces here, I thank Elizabeth for the difference the \n     Red Cross has made in our lives. And while I may not be proof \n     of the old saying that here in America, any boy can grow up \n     to be President, I take heart in the fact that I am proof \n     that any boy can grow up and be married to the President . . \n     . of the American Red Cross, that is.\n       During my life I have been privileged to be called by many \n     titles--including congressman, Senator, and majority leader. \n     But the two titles of which I am most proud have nothing to \n     do with elective office. The first is ``Kansan.'' And the \n     second is ``veteran.''\n       I have often wondered why the Army assigned a kid from the \n     plains of Kansas to serve in the 10th Mountain Division, but \n     I've never wondered about the courage and heroism of those \n     who served with me, and those who have defended our country \n     in the half century that has followed. And I can't help but \n     recall today the words of General George Marshall, who was \n     asked soon after America's entrance into World War II, \n     whether we had a secret weapon that would ensure victory.\n       Marshall said, ``Yes, our secret weapon is the best darned \n     kids in the world.''\n       Marshall was right. America ensured the survival of freedom \n     in World War II precisely because we had the best darned kids \n     in the world--kids who were willing to fight and die for \n     their country and for the cause of freedom.\n       What was true in World War II, has continued to be true in \n     the decades that have followed, as more of those best darned \n     kids have fought and died in places with names like Inchon, \n     Porkchop Hill, the Persian Gulf, and countless other \n     locations around the globe.\n       I traveled to Bosnia just this past weekend, and can report \n     to you, Mr. Secretary, that our Armed Services can still \n     boast the best darned kids in the world.\n       Throughout my years in the Battlefields of Capitol Hill, I \n     always tried to remember and stand up for those who were \n     serving or who had served. And I always tried to remember \n     that the only way to ensure that future generations or those \n     kids would not be buried on foreign land was to continue to \n     provide for a strong defense and American leadership whenever \n     and wherever it was needed.\n       And any success I achieved in this regard was achieved \n     because so many others stood with me. And although this old \n     soldier has retired from elective office, I don't intend to \n     fade away. Rather, I will continue to stand up and speak out \n     on matters of importance to the United States, and I will \n     always regard this day and this award not as recognition for \n     any achievements of the past, but as a reminder of our \n     responsibilities to future generations of Americans.\n       And so, Mr. Secretary, Lieutenant Robert J. Dole is \n     reporting for duty today, ready for a mission that must be \n     shared by all Americans; a mission perhaps best defined by \n     the author Herman Wouk, who said:\n       ``(Our duty is to) reassure (our men and women in uniform) \n     that their hard, long training is needed, that love of \n     country is noble, that self-sacrifice is rewarding and that \n     to be ready to fight for freedom fills one with a sense of \n     worth like nothing else . . . for if America is still the \n     great beacon in dense gloom, the promise to hundreds of \n     millions of the oppressed that liberty exists, that it is the \n     shining future, that they can throw off their tyrants, and \n     learn freedom and cease learning war, then we still need \n     heroes to stand guard in the night.''\n       Thank you, Mr. Secretary for this day, and thanks to all \n     those heroes here today and the countless thousands who serve \n     with you who make the world a safer place by standing guard \n     in the night.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Remarks of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen--Presentation of \nDistinguished Public Service Award to Bob Dole, Conmy Hall, Fort Myer, \n                        Virginia, April 29, 1998\n\n       General Ralston, thank you for your gracious words. Senator \n     Dole, Elizabeth and Robin Dole; Members of Congress: Senator \n     Thurmond, Specter, Campbell, Smith and Reed and Congressmen \n     Ryun and Houghton; Deputy Secretary Hamre and Julie Hamre; \n     Service secretaries, service chiefs and spouses; \n     Distinguished guests, especially Jack Kemp, Warren Rudman, \n     Paul Laxalt, Colin Powell, Ambassador Ellsworth. Welcome all, \n     and thank you for joining Janet and me and the entire \n     Department of Defense in paying tribute to a dear friend and \n     a true American hero--Bob Dole.\n       Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who served his country \n     both as a soldier and a public servant, once spoke to his \n     fellow veterans in words that reflect the soldier and public \n     servant we honor today. Holmes said: ``As I look into your \n     eyes, I feel that a great trial in your youth made you \n     different. It made you a citizen of the world and not of a \n     little town. Best of all, it made you believe in something \n     else besides doing the best for yourself. You learned a \n     lesson early which has given a different feeling to life, \n     which put a kind of fire into your heart.''\n       Today we express our gratitude to Bob Dole, a man from the \n     little town of Russell, Kansas for whom the lessons of life \n     came early. With the Dustbowl came the lesson of hard work. \n     With the Depression came the lesson of hardship. With World \n     War II came the lesson of service and sacrifice in a way most \n     of us will never know.\n       Throughout his distinguished career, we have called Bob \n     Dole by many titles--Congressman Dole, Senator Dole, Chairman \n     Dole and Candidate Dole. Our ceremony today honors all those \n     roles, but also honors a time when he was known as Second \n     Lieutenant Robert Dole, who led the Second Battalion of the \n     85th Infantry Mountain Regiment of the U.S. Army's 10th \n     Mountain Division.\n       As the war in Europe was winding down, a spring offensive \n     was scheduled for April 12, 1945 to bring about the surrender \n     of German forces in Italy. On the same day, as it happens, \n     President Roosevelt died. But it was not the President's \n     death but a heavy fog that delayed the offensive until April \n     14 at oh-six-hundred. After the intensive assault against \n     fortified German positions by heavy bombers, fighter-bombers \n     and artillery, the 10th Mountain Division began to move \n     across a ravine to a clearing to take for the Allies what was \n     known as Hill 913.\n       But even after the shelling and bombing, there was \n     significant German resistance. The snipers were dug in. The \n     10th Mountain Division would take more causalities on April \n     14, 1945 than all the other Allied forces in Italy. Second \n     Lieutenant Robert Dole was hit and gravely wounded by a \n     mortar blast and waited in a shell hole for nine hours until \n     the medics could reach him.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n       The war in Europe ended just a few weeks later on May 8, \n     1945. Second Lieutenant Dole came back to a Topeka hospital \n     and eventually back to Russell. When he went to Europe, he \n     weighed a muscular 200 pounds and was a football, basketball \n     and track star at the State University of Kansas. When he \n     came home after the war, he was on a stretcher and weighed \n     120 pounds. At one point, his temperature reached 108.7 \n     degrees.\n       Faced with this terrible situation and the unanimously \n     gloomy opinion of his doctors, many people, even most people, \n     would have become disheartened and simply given up. But Bob \n     Dole persevered, through more than three years of arduous \n     recovery and through a lifetime of difficulty and hardship \n     which he handled with this customary humor and grace. No one \n     ever worked harder, complained less or laughed more than Bob \n     Dole. And no one ever loved his country more or had a better \n     appreciation of the honor and sacrifice of military service.\n       From the terrible trauma of his injuries, Bob Dole fought \n     back and won elective office as county attorney, US \n     Congressman, US Senator and Senate Majority Leader. He has \n     been his party's nominee for Vice President and President. He \n     even makes a pretty good VISA commercial! (Although his \n     credit is not very good in that financial mega center--\n     Russell.)\n       Also, no hero does it alone, and Janet and I also want to \n     pay tribute to a lady of grace, charm and accomplishment who \n     is Bob's partner, friend and wife--Elizabeth Dole. Elizabeth, \n     thank you for your service to America.\n       I had the privilege of serving with Bob Dole in the \n     legislative trenches of the U.S. Senate for 18 years. And I \n     can tell you he remained a warrior eager to take on a new \n     battle every day. He is and always will be an American Hero \n     of the highest order.\n       Thanks to people like Bob Dole who have worked for a strong \n     national defense, we are privileged to live in largely \n     peaceful times where the sons of Bangor, Maine or Russell, \n     Kansas are not being sent to fight and die on distant \n     battlefields. The privilege of these peaceful times is made \n     possible by the sacrifice of many thousands who have given \n     their bodies and their lives in the cause of liberty.\n       We do not pause often enough to give tribute to the silent \n     white gravestones which dot the hills of Arlington National \n     Cemetery or give thanks to the heroes who are still among us. \n     Today, as Secretary of Defense, it makes me extremely proud \n     for our Department and our nation to pay tribute to a modest \n     man of immodest talent--a person who has defined heroism and \n     courage for millions of Americans.\n       The great American writer John Steinbeck once wrote that \n     the best measure of one's time on this earth is the \n     contribution each of us makes to the world around us. ``There \n     is,'' Steinbeck wrote, ``no other story. A man, after he has \n     brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left \n     only the hard clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? \n     Have I done well--or ill?''\n       For Second Lieutenant Bob Dole--Army Serial #17179287--\n     Steinbeck's question is not a hard one. He has done well--he \n     has served his nation with the highest distinction--he has \n     remained a man with fire in his heart. And it is my highest \n     privilege to award our highest civilian honor, the Department \n     of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, to Bob \n     Dole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5422-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment \nto express my condolences to the families of the students killed and \nwounded during the tragic shooting yesterday at the Thurston High \nSchool in Springfield, Oregon.\n  The thoughts and prayers of all Americans today are with the families \nof Springfield. It is yet another community where lives have been \nshattered forever by children with easy access to firearms.\n  This attack was the fourth killing in a high school in the last six \nmonths by a youth under the age of 16. Mr. President, this killing must \nstop.\n  Last year, approximately 50% of all serious violent crimes were \ncommitted by teens against teens. Our nation's overall firearm-related \ndeath rate among children was nearly 12 times higher than among \nchildren in the other 25 industrialized countries combined.\n  This is an outrage. Mr. President, these horrific crimes amply \ndemonstrate that we have a responsibility to oppose the proliferation \nof violence and to stand fast against any effort to make firearms more \nfreely available. Does anyone still believe that it is possible to \nraise children in a society where guns are so easily obtained? We \ncannot continue to protect our children in such a world.\n  We must come together as a society and recommit ourselves to keeping \nfirearms out of the hands of children and to guaranteeing that only \nthose people who know how to use guns responsibly have access to them. \nWe must expand programs to train gunowners in the proper use and \nstorage of their weapons.\n  Responsible gunowners have nothing to fear from reasonable gun laws. \nWe must have reasonable gun laws that will prevent tragedies like the \none that happened yesterday in that small community in Oregon from ever \nhappening again. The second amendment was never intended as a \nsubterfuge for domestic carnage. Our living constitution can respond to \nchanges in our society which jeopardize our freedom from fear and \nrandom violence by children. I think it is appropriate for us to have \nthat debate, given the importance to our children, to their safety, to \nour liberty and freedom and safety in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5423-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5423-S5424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  JUDGE JOE ANDERSON'S REDEDICATION OF THE EDGEFIELD COUNTY COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the very foundation of our Nation lies \nin the rule of law, and there is perhaps no symbol more closely \nassociated with the process of justice than the courthouse. Not only is \nthe courthouse where justice is dispensed, but it is a reminder to all \ncitizens that the judiciary is the third branch of our system of \ngovernment.\n  Recently, the Edgefield County Courthouse was rededicated, and Judge \nJoe Anderson, of the South Carolina District Court, was the keynote \nspeaker at the ceremony. His remarks were very well received by the \ncrowd and helped to make the event a great success. Though I was unable \nto attend this event, I heard from a number of friends who did that \nJudge Anderson's remarks were truly excellent. After requesting a copy \nof his speech, I came to the very same conclusion and thought that my \npeers in the Senate would enjoy reading them as much as I did.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this speech be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Judge Keesley, Members of the County Council, other \n     distinguished guests, and friends:\n       What a joy, what an honor, to have the privilege of being a \n     part of this ceremony. I appreciate the opportunity you have \n     given me to come home, and to show my appreciation, I promise \n     not to afflict you with many words.\n       As one who spends all of my working hours in a courthouse \n     building, I am honored to say a few brief words in \n     rededication of this historic structure and what it has come \n     to symbolize for our community.\n       Winston Churchill once said that the best measure of the \n     quality of a society is the quality of its justice.'' America \n     is distinguished from other countries by the quality of its \n     law and how it is used by its people to expand liberty and \n     opportunity. Our law represents our national dreams, our \n     system of justice towards one another.\n       The assumptions that we make every day, the security we \n     take for granted, the social compact that allows us to live \n     together peacefully . . . these are the result of law. In \n     rededicating this building we rededicate ourselves to the \n     rule of law.\n       Courthouse buildings, of course, represent a symbol of \n     permanence and the place where our laws are administered. It \n     is here that our citizens are summoned to become actively \n     involved in the public administration of justice--a privilege \n     that citizens of most other countries do not enjoy. It is \n     here that the cogs and gears of liberty function on a daily \n     basis.\n       I have always thought that the rather nondescript term we \n     use to describe these buildings--``courthouse''--does not \n     adequately convey the importance of the work that goes on \n     inside. The French use a more inspirational name: ``Palace of \n     Justice.''\n       Regardless of the name by which it is called, no one can \n     deny the role that our courthouse, our ``Palace of Justice'' \n     has played in the development of our county. We are all \n     indebted to Chairman Monroe Kneece and the members of our \n     county council Betty Buter, Sam Speight, Daniel Bishop and \n     Norman Dorn and County Administrator Wayne Adams for their \n     foresight in recognizing the renovations and improvements \n     that were needed. Their vision and hard work have brought \n     this historic structure up to standards that will allow it to \n     serve in the next millennium and beyond, while at the same \n     time preserving all the charm and history that makes this \n     building special for all of us. This ceremony is, in part, a \n     tribute to their stewardship of one of the real crown jewels \n     of our county. On occasions such as this, we ask God's \n     blessing on their endeavors.\n       Today is one of those moments when we can pause, take a \n     look at where we've been, where we are, and where we might be \n     headed.\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n       Bettis Rainsford has chronicled for you the history of the \n     Edgefield County Courthouse. There may not be many other \n     courthouses in America, certainly not in South Carolina, with \n     a pedigree to match that of this building. I am certain that \n     there is no courthouse anywhere with so many portraits of \n     notable leaders--statesmen, generals, lawyers and judges. I \n     distinctly remember my first visit to this courthouse with my \n     father. The portraits on the walls left a lasting impression \n     on me. I particularly remember my father singling out Senator \n     Strom Thurmond, pictured on these walls when he was a young \n     Circuit Judge, as well as his father, John William Thurmond, \n     one of the most able lawyers our state has ever produced.\n       But what does all this history mean to us as we are about \n     to embark on a new century? As South Carolinians and, \n     especially as Edgefieldians, we have a rich heritage. We are \n     each of us the sum total of generations of growing, yearning, \n     of planning and failing, of building and destroying and \n     building again.\n       This is an exciting time for Edgefield County. Our area is \n     growing, our young people have a place to come back to, our \n     schools are moving ahead, industry is recognizing the virtues \n     of small town life and good work ethic that goes with it. \n     Edgefield County is on the move.\n       This building is a monument to the hands, hearts and minds \n     of our forebearers. Not just the dignitaries on these walls--\n     not just the statesmen, the generals, the lawyers and the \n     judges--but also the public servants behind the scenes, like \n     Miss Martha Rich, the merchants, the ministers, the school \n     teachers, the sharecroppers, the industrialists, the artists \n     and the artisans who have gone before us to help make this \n     corner of God's earth a special place in our hearts.\n       Thank you again for inviting me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5423-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OPERATION GRADUATION WEEKEND\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, yesterday, Xavier Becerra, Jose E. Serrano \nand the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called upon the Republican \nleadership to vote upon the Latino nominees to judgeships who have \nlanguished in the Senate far too long. I welcome the views of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus to the debate and I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of their letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have spoken often, too often, about the crisis in the \nSecond Circuit and our need for the Senate to move forward to confirm \nthe nominees pending on the Senate calendar to that important court.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York in \n1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the \nNew York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney \nand was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is \nstrongly supported by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato. She is a \nsource of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to \nwomen. When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second \njudge of Puerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit.\n  By a vote of 16 to 2, the Judiciary Committee reported the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Senate. That was on March 5, 1998, over \ntwo months ago. No action has been taken or scheduled on that \nnomination and no explanation for the delay has been forthcoming. This \nis the oldest judicial nomination pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. In spite of an April 8 letter to the Senate Republican Leader \nsigned by all six Senators from the three States forming the Second \nCircuit urging prompt action, this nomination continues to be stalled \nby anonymous objections. Our bipartisan letter to the Majority Leader \nasked that he call up for prompt consideration by the Senate of the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. That was over one month ago. I \nrequest unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be included in the \nrecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Nor is Judge Sotomayor the only woman or minority judicial nominee \nwho has been needlessly delayed. Indeed, if one considers those \nnominees who have taken the longest to confirm this year, we find a \ndisturbing pattern.\n  Hilda Tagle, the only Hispanic woman the Senate has confirmed this \nyear, took 32 months to be confirmed as a District Court Judge for the \nSouthern District of Texas--that was over two and one-half years. As I \nhave noted, Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the Second Circuit is the \nlongest pending on the Senate calendar, another qualified Hispanic \nwoman nominee. Judge Richard Paez, currently a District Court Judge and \na nominee to the Ninth Circuit, was first nominated in January 1996. \nTwenty-eight months latter, Judge Paez's nomination remains pending on \nthe Senate calendar. Nor have we seen any progress with respect to the \nnomination of Jorge Rangel to the Fifth Circuit or Anabelle Rodriguez \nto the District Court for Puerto Rico, although her nomination was \nreceived in January 1996 almost 28 months ago.\n  For that matter, we have seen the President's nomination of the Judge \nJames A. Beaty, Jr., the first African-American to the Fourth Circuit \nstalled for 29 months, since December 1995.\n  We have seen the attack on Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson, who would \nhave been the first African-American woman to serve on the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, but who was forced to withdraw. We have seen \nthe nomination of Clarence Sundram held up since September 1995, almost \n32 months.\n  With the delays in the Senate consideration of Margaret Morrow and \nMargaret McKeown earlier this year, we had the opportunity to consider \nwhy it is that the Senate takes so much longer to consider and confirm \nso many woman nominees. That question has yet to be answered \nadequately.\n  Margaret Morrow was targeted by some and debate on her nomination was \ndelayed for more than a year. She was first nominated in May 1996 and \nwas not voted on for 21 months. When we finally got a vote, she was \nconfirmed by a vote of more than two to one. Margaret Morrow was the \nfirst and only woman to serve as the President of the California State \nBar. The ABA gave her its highest rating. She had strong bipartisan \nsupport. She was held up for a judicial emergency vacancy for many \nmonths without cause of justification.\n  Nor was Margaret Morrow an isolated case. Consider the nomination of \nJudge Ann Aiken to the District Court in Oregon. That nomination was \nreceived in November 1995 but not considered by the Senate until \nJanuary 1998, 26 months later. She, too, was confirmed by a vote of \nmore than two to one.\n  Then we had the case of Margaret McKeown who was nominated to a \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit in March 1996 but not considered until two \nyears later in March 1998. When she received a Senate vote, she was \nconfirmed by a vote of 80 to 11.\n  We still have Susan Oki Mollway pending before the Senate without a \nvote although she was first nominated back in December 1995 for the \nvacancy on the District Court in Hawaii--that was more than 29 months \nago and still she is without a vote.\n  In his annual report on the judiciary last year, the Chief Justice of \nthe United States Supreme Court observed: ``Some current nominees have \nbeen waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote \nor a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and \n36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\nin 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no \nobligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary \ntime for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.''\n  For some unexplained reason, judicial nominees who are women or \nracial or ethnic minorities seem to take the longest. Of the 10 \njudicial nominees whose nominations have been pending the longest \nbefore the Senate, eight are women and racial or ethnic minority \ncandidates. A ninth has been delayed in large measure because of \nopposition to his mother, who already serves as a judge. The tenth is \none who blew the lid off the $1.4 milllion right-wing campaign to \n``kill'' Clinton judicial nominees.\n  Pending on the Senate calendar, having been passed over again and \nagain, are Judge Sonia Sotomayor, Judge Richard Paez and Susan Oki \nMollway. Ronnie White has now finally been reported, as well. Held up \nin Committee after two hearings is Clarence Sundram. Still without a \nhearing are Anabelle Rodriquez, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., and Jorge C. \nRangel. What all these nominees have in common is that they are either \nwomen or members of racial or ethnic minorities. That is a shame.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman, Senate Government Affairs Committee, Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader and Mr. Chairman: As Members of the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), we are writing to \n     express our grave concern with the lack of progress and \n     consideration of judicial nominees before the Senate. In \n     particular, we are profoundly distressed that several of \n     those nominees are highly qualified individuals of Latino \n     descent. While this Congress has seen a slowdown in the \n     confirmation process it is notable that Latino judicial \n     nominees have been subjected to inexplicable delays.\n       Of the Federal judges confirmed in the 105th Congress (1997 \n     and 1998), only 2 have been Latinos. At present, there are a \n     number of Latinos with strong judicial and academic \n     qualifications pending Senate judicial confirmation. Yet, \n     several Latino judicial nominees have languished \n     unjustifiably in the Senate for over two years and only two \n     of the candidates have been reported out of committee.\n       The delay in the confirmation process results in \n     significantly higher caseloads for existing Federal judges, \n     and a system that guarantees frustration for those who \n     utilize it. Already, and Second Circuit has been declared a \n     ``judicial emergency''--the circuit has seats that have been \n     vacant for more than 18 months. Overburdened judges and a \n     slowdown of court proceedings undermine faith in our judicial \n     system and our democracy as a whole.\n       Inaction by the Senate is contributing to the \n     underrepresentation of Latinos on the Federal bench. Latinos \n     make up less than 5% of all Federal judges. We urge your \n     prompt and favorable action in confirming judicial \n     candidates.\n           Sincerely,\n     Xavier Becerra.\n     Jose E. Serrano.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5424-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MS. ROSELLA SCHNAKENBERG\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Rosella \nSchnakenberg, a woman who has served her friends and fellow Missourians \nfor more than 50 years. Although this service has transcended \noccupational boundaries, the most prominent way Ms. Schnakenberg, a \nlifelong resident of the Cole Camp community, has benefitted her fellow \ncitizens has been to hold a pivotal role at the First Community Bank in \nIonia, Missouri.\n  During her time as an employee of First Community Bank, Ms. \nSchnakenberg has helped customers open accounts, fill out and process \nloan applications, save for the future, balance checkbooks, and cash \npay checks. In addition to this long list of responsibilities, what is \nremarkable about this versatile employee is that she performs her \nduties with enthusiasm and concern. That attitude has helped propel Ms. \nSchnakenberg from a teller who earned $75 a month to a Vice President \nand Facility Manager, overseeing day-to-day operations of the bank. \nDuring her lengthy tenure, she has observed the bank change and grow \nfrom an establishment that applied for deposits by hand and lacked \nindoor plumbing to an institution that functions and flourishes in the \nmodern world.\n  First Community Bank has not only prospered economically, under Ms. \nSchnakenberg's leadership, it has also benefitted from her research and \nrecording of the bank's colorful history. That history includes a \nDepression-era incident when one of the bank managers had cashiers band \na high-value bill on both sides of the $1 bill stacks.\n  Mrs. Schnakenberg has also touched the lives of the people around her \nthrough the unselfish distribution of her time, such as serving in \ncommunity activities, visiting friends in nursing homes, and playing \nthe organ at St. John's Lutheran Church services.\n  To honor Ms. Schnakenberg, First Community Bank hosted a reception in \nher honor on Sunday, March 22, 1998, in Ionia, Missouri. It is an honor \nfor me to recognize such a fine Missourian and to serve her in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5425-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5425-S5426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE SCHOOL TRAGEDY IN SPRINGFIELD, OREGON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we were all shocked and saddened by the \ntragic shooting incident at the Thurston High School in Springfield, \nOregon. I listened with sympathy this morning to my colleagues from \nOregon, and share their sentiments. My heart goes out to the victims of \nthis horrendous crime, and my prayers are with the injured, and with \nthe families of all the victims in the Springfield community. I know \nthat every parent or grandparent who sends a child to school shares the \ngrief of the Springfield families.\n  This kind of tragedy has become far too common. It was only two \nmonths ago that we were shocked by the violence and horror of the \nschoolyard shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Every day, it seems, we are \nassailed by new stories of senseless crimes committed by juveniles who \nshould be too young to be capable of such acts.\n  Our juvenile crime problem has taken a new and sinister direction. I \ncan imagine few acts more heinous than some of the crimes recently \ncommitted by juveniles around the country. We seem now to be in a new \nera, in which juveniles are committing sophisticated adult crimes. This \ndisturbing trend demonstrates the need to reform the juvenile justice \nsystem that is failing the victims of juvenile crime, failing too many \nof our young people, and ultimately, failing society.\n  The Senate has before it comprehensive youth violence legislation. S. \n10, the Hatch-Sessions Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act, \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee last year on bipartisan vote. \nThe goal of S. 10 is to reform and redirect the role played by the \nfederal government in addressing juvenile crime in our Nation.\n  Responding to the testimony and advice of many state and local \nofficials, S. 10 reauthorizes and streamlines the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA), which provides assistance to the \nstates in fighting juvenile crime. S. 10 also creates a $500 million \nper year incentive block grant program for the states. These block \ngrants can be used for a multitude of purposes, such as incarceration, \ngraduated sanctions, serious and habitual offender programs, juvenile \ncriminal record sharing, drug testing and treatment of juvenile \narrestees, and numerous prevention programs.\n  In the face of tragedies such as the Springfield and Jonesboro \nmurders, it is tempting to look for easy answers. I do not believe that \nwe should succumb to this temptation. We are faced, I believe, with a \nproblem which cannot be solved solely by the enactment of new criminal \nprohibitions. It is at its core a moral problem. Somehow, in this case \nand too many others like it, we have failed as a society to pass along \nto the next generation the moral compass that differentiates right from \nwrong. This cannot be legislated. It will not be restored by the \nenactment of a new law or the implementation of a new program. But it \ncan be achieved by communities working together to teach accountability \nby example and by early intervention when the signs clearly point to \nviolent and antisocial behavior, as seems to be the case in some of \nthese tragedies.\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\n  S. 10 provides the framework to address the modest federal role in \nthis effort. We should not let politics overwhelm this issue. I believe \nthat this legislation must move forward. This will require us to work \ntogether. It will also require leadership from the Administration. In \nthe ten months since this legislation was ordered reported from the \nJudiciary Committee, we have heard no productive comment from the \nAdministration on the bill. The President must show leadership on this, \nand support S. 10. Otherwise, I am afraid that another year will pass \nwithout our having taken action on this critically important issue.\n  I also ask my colleagues to join me in this effort, and to join me in \nextending the sympathy of the Senate to the families and victims, to \nthe community of Springfield, and the State of Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5425-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5426-S5427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week we conclude another work period \nby disappointing the American people. We recess, again, without \nconcluding the people's business and passing a strong tobacco bill. \nTobacco legislation is now added to the litany of important matters the \nCongress has left unfinished.\n  Last month, the Congress adjourned without even completing the \nfederal budget and this month we recess, again, without concluding even \nthat basic action.\n  Most Americans think of April 15 as the day that they file their tax \nreturns and pay their taxes, and most Americans dutifully collect their \nfinancial records and go through the sometimes arduous task of \npreparing their tax returns. I hope that next year and in the years \nahead that task will be made a little easier by legislation I have \nsponsored to require the IRS to post information and forms on the \nInternet, along with regulations and rulings.\n  Well, April 15 was also the legal deadline for Congress to have \npassed a budget resolution. While the Senate did some preliminary work \non a flawed proposal earlier this year, Congress is recessing, again, \nwithout completing this fundamental task--another duty ignored, another \nlegal requirement violated.\n  I hope that as Congress returns from its Memorial Day break it will \ncomplete work on a balanced budget to serve the American people without \nadditional delay. It should be balanced in two senses: It should be a \nbalanced series of proposals to meet the health, education, \nenvironmental and law enforcement needs of the country. And it will \nalso, for the first time in almost three decades, be a balanced budget \nthat will not rely on deficit financing.\n  I recall all too well last year when we were told that we could never \nachieve a balanced budget without a constitutional amendment. I recall \nthe stacks of deficit-laden federal budgets proposed by Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents since President Johnson and being told that the \nonly answer to annual budget deficits was to pass an ill-conceived \nconstitutional amendment whose terms and effects could not be \nexplained. I defended the Constitution then and this year President \nClinton sent us the first balanced budget in almost 30 years.\n  With the cooperation of the Republican leadership in the Congress we \ncan enact the first balanced budget since 1969, and we will have done \nit without inserting a fiscal straightjacket into the text of the \nUnited States Constitution. They said it could not be done, but it can \nand will as a result of the sound fiscal policies of this \nAdministration which have lead not only to balance but to the prospect \nof budget surplus. In 1993, a Democratic Congress put us on the right \nroad to fiscal responsibility when we took the hard votes and passed \nthe President's plan. Congress should culminate that extraordinary 5-\nyear effort without further delay.\n  Completing action on the budget is the first step toward Congress \ntaking action on the annual appropriations bills that are so important \nto the government programs that protect the environment and assist \nState and local governments with education and law enforcement. \nRepublican Congressional leadership is well-known for shutting down the \ngovernment by not completing work on these basic measures in a timely \nway.\n  Those contracting with the government, working in partnership with \ngovernment services and those dependent on government services deserve \nbetter. Americans deserve piece of mind and the assurances that their \ngovernment is working. Congress needs to complete its appropriations so \nthat the agencies and service providers can plan programs, pay staff \nand work with the American public in an effective manner.\n  It is high time for the congressional leadership to do its job and \nfor the Congress to get on about the business of governing.\n  Congress should not be taking breaks without having completed the \nwork of the people. Such callous disregard for the needs of the \nAmerican people has become too much the rule as year after year under \nRepublican leadership Congress recesses without having completed its \nwork on emergency supplementals, budgets, and appropriations bills.\n  The Senate has also failed to take action to end the judicial \nemergency in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \nOn March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court \ncaused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a Circuit emergency, to \nbegin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having \n3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge.\n  I have been urging favorable Senate action on the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit to fill a longstanding vacancy. \nThat nomination remains stalled on the Senate calendar. Before the last \nrecess I introduced legislation calling upon the Senate to address this \nkind of judicial emergency before it takes another extended recess. The \nSenate has pending before it four outstanding nominees to the Second \nCircuit whose confirmations would end this crisis.\n  Unfortunately Republican Senate leadership has not taken the judicial \nvacancies crisis seriously and has failed to take the concerted action \nneeded to end it. They continue to perpetuate vacancies in almost one \nin 10 federal judgeships.\n  With 11 nominees on the Senate calendar and 32 pending in Committee, \nwe could be making a difference if we would take our responsibilities \nto the federal courts seriously and devote the time necessary to \nconsider these nominations and confirm them. Instead, we are having \nhearings at a rate of one a month, barely keeping up with attrition and \nhardly making a dent in the vacancies crisis that the Chief Justice of \nthe United States has called the most serious problem confronting the \njudiciary.\n  We began this legislative year prepared finally to make progress on \nissues like campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation and juvenile \ncrime legislation. Republican leadership has lead to inaction on all \nthree.\n  On the issue of campaign finance reform, Democrats and some notable \nRepublicans have been prepared to attack the soft money that so \npervades the current system. Rather than close the loopholes and \ncorrect the system, the Republican leadership has chosen to close the \ndebate and perpetuate the status quo.\n  On tobacco legislation, we have an important opportunity to make real \nprogress. Now that the courts have moved to disclose the secret \ndocuments from the industry's efforts to hide the nature of nicotine \naddiction and their marketing efforts to children, now that the tobacco \ncompanies' lobbying stranglehold on Congress has been loosened, and now \nthat we have demonstrated that the majority of the Senate agrees with \nSenator Gregg and me that we need not grant special legal protections \nto tobacco companies in order to enact legislation that can make a \ndifference, it is time for the Senate to move forward. We should be \npassing strong tobacco legislation.\n  Since the first week of the year I have been urging attention to the \nmatter of juvenile crime. When the Judiciary Committee reported a \nmisguided bill last year, I noted the improvements that had been made \nin the Committee's consideration and the aspects that needed to change \nfor us to develop a legislative consensus that could help State and \nlocal law enforcement in the battle against juvenile crime.\n  We have heard for months this would be a priority this Congress. \nInstead of\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nreaching across the aisle and working to develop a consensus, some have \nlimited themselves to Republican-only Dear Colleague letters and \nseeking to pick off a few Democratic allies. Juvenile crime should not \nbe a Republican or Democratic issue. There are things we can do to \nassist State and local law enforcement without partisanship and by \nconsensus.\n  Afterschool programs and crime prevention programs should be central \nto those efforts. I hope that the Senate Republican leadership will \njoin in a truly bipartisan effort.\n  We still face the same problems and challenges with which we began \nthe year.

Mr. President, about one year from now, in June 1999, the \nindependent counsel law is due to expire unless Congress acts to renew \nit. In the Senate, the Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am a \nmember, is responsible for examining whether the independent counsel \nlaw ought to be reauthorized. I rise today because, as I've begun to \nlook at the reauthorization issues, one stands out as central to the \nlaw, central to the question of reauthorization, and central to the \nissue of whether the independent counsel law is a tool of fairness or a \nweapon of politics.\n  In a recent Law Day speech, independent counsel Kenneth Starr \nproclaimed that, ``No one is above the law.'' He is correct. No one is \nabove the law--certainly not the President, who was the focus of \nStarr's remarks, but equally so, not an independent counsel.\n  The question I want to discuss today is whether independent counsels \nare themselves complying with the law, in particular a provision at 28 \nU.S.C. 594(f)(1), which states that independent counsels ``shall'' \ncomply with the ``written or other established policies of the \nDepartment of Justice.''\n  This is a straightforward provision. The law says ``shall,'' not \n``may,'' not ``should.'' It makes compliance with established Justice \nDepartment policies mandatory, not discretionary, for every independent \ncounsel. The only exception to this rule is where compliance with \nDepartmental policies would be ``inconsistent with the purposes of the \nstatute'' such as, for example, compliance with a policy requiring the \npermission of the Attorney General to take a specific act. Barring this \nexception, the law's clear general rule is that independent counsels \nmust comply with established Justice Department policies.\n  This provision in the law is an important one. It is a key constraint \nto ensure that persons who are subject to independent counsel \ninvestigations receive the same treatment as ordinary citizens--no \nbetter and no worse. It is a key safeguard against an overly zealous \nprosecutor.\n  The Senate felt so strongly about this requirement that, during the \nlaw's 1994 reauthorization, the Senate approved an amendment by Senator \nBob Dole emphasizing that failure to follow Justice Department policies \nconstitutes ``cause'' for removing an independent counsel from office. \nThe final conference report on the law, while omitting the Senate \nprovision as accurate but too limiting, said, ``refusal to follow \nimportant Department guidelines . . .--like many other circumstances--\ndo provide potential grounds for removing an independent counsel from \noffice.''\n  Independent counsel compliance with Justice Department policies was \nimportant to the Supreme Court. In the key decision upholding the \nindependent counsel law, Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court referred \nto the requirement as one of the keys to the law's constitutionality. \nThe Court did so when determining whether the independent counsel law, \n``taken as a whole, violates the principle of separation of powers by \nunduly interfering with the role of the Executive Branch,'' in \nparticular the Constitutional requirement that the President, as head \nof the executive branch, ensure that the laws be faithfully executed. \nThe Supreme Court stated:\n\n       It is undeniable that the Act reduces the amount of control \n     or supervision that the Attorney General and, through him, \n     the President exercises over the investigation and \n     prosecution of a certain class of alleged criminal activity. \n     . . . Nonetheless, the Act does give the Attorney General \n     several means of supervising or controlling the prosecutorial \n     powers that may be wielded by an independent counsel. Most \n     importantly, the Attorney General retains the power to remove \n     the counsel for `good cause,' a power that we have already \n     concluded provides the Executive with substantial ability to \n     ensure that the laws are `faithfully executed' by an \n     independent counsel. No independent counsel may be appointed \n     without a specific request by the Attorney General, and the \n     Attorney General's decision not to request appointment if he \n     finds `no reasonable grounds to believe that further \n     investigation is warranted' is committed to his unreviewable \n     discretion. . . . In addition, the jurisdiction of the \n     independent counsel is defined with reference to the facts \n     submitted by the Attorney General, and once a counsel is \n     appointed, the Act requires that the counsel abide by Justice \n     Department policy unless it is not `possible' to do so.\n\n  The Court then went on to say, in language directly relevant to this \nissue: ``Notwithstanding the fact that the counsel is to some degree \n`independent' and free from executive supervision to a greater extent \nthan other federal prosecutors, in our view these features of the Act \ngive the Executive Branch sufficient control over the independent \ncounsel to ensure the President is able to perform his constitutionally \nassigned duties.''\n\n  The Supreme Court thus highlighted four ``features'' of the \nindependent counsel law which enable the Attorney General to meet the \nconstitutional requirement that the President, as head of the executive \nbranch, ensure the faithful execution of the law. The four features \nidentified by the Court are the Attorney General's sole authority to \nrequest appointment of an independent counsel, her authority to remove \nan independent counsel from office for good cause, her authority to \ndefine the scope of an independent counsel's investigation, and the \nrequirement that independent counsels must abide by Justice Department \npolicy.\n  Mandatory compliance with Justice Department policies is important \nnot only for the law to be constitutional, but also because that \ncompliance is one of the few practical constraints on the conduct of an \nindependent counsel. The Supreme Court has held that the special court \nwhich appoints independent counsels ``has no power to supervise or \ncontrol the activities of the counsel'' it has appointed. Congress, \nlegally empowered to oversee independent counsels, has shown little \ninterest under the current Republican leadership in monitoring \nindependent counsels investigating the Clinton Administration.\n  The law does empower the Attorney General to remove an independent \ncounsel from office for good cause, but that draconian penalty is not a \npractical one and has never been used. For example, if Attorney General \nReno were to fire independent counsel Starr for enforcing subpoenas \nserved on Secret Service personnel, the Republican Congress as well as \nthe news media would have her head. The power to terminate an \nindependent counsel, while an essential element in the law's \narchitecture for purposes of constitutionality, is simply not, except \nfor unusual circumstances, a practical means for limiting an \nindependent counsel's individual prosecutorial decisions.\n  That means a key remaining constraint on independent counsels is the \nlegal requirement that they comply with established Justice Department \npolicies.\n  Yet questions have increasingly arisen about whether sitting \nindependent counsels are acting in ways that an ordinary federal \nprosecutor would, or\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nwhether they are taking actions outside the established practices of \nthe Department of Justice.\n  A prime example is an independent counsel subpoena so troubling that \nthe Supreme Court has agreed to review it on an expedited basis next \nmonth. This subpoena was served by independent counsel Starr on a \nprivate attorney who, in 1993, met with Vincent Foster nine days before \nhis suicide to discuss representing him during inquiries into the White \nHouse travel office. The Starr subpoena demands the notes taken by the \nattorney during that meeting, on the ground that the attorney-client \nrelationship dissolved upon Mr. Foster's death.\n  The U.S. Attorney Manual states that the Justice Department, ``as a \nmatter of policy will respect bona fide attorney-client relationships, \nwherever possible, consistent with its law enforcement responsibilities \nand duties.'' But instead of respecting the bona fide attorney-client \nrelationship between Mr. Foster and his attorney, Starr asserted a \nlegal position that the Justice Department--in over one hundred years \nof criminal prosecution--has never taken. As Starr admits in a Supreme \nCourt filing, the Foster case ``is the first federal decision \naddressing the question . . . of whether attorney-client privilege \nfully survives the client's death.''\n  A federal trial judge asked to enforce the Starr subpoena struck it \ndown for violating attorney-client confidentiality, but an appeals \ncourt, in a 2-1 decision over a strong dissent, reversed. The \ndissenting judge wrote that the Starr subpoena is contrary to the law \nin all 50 states, the Supreme Court's advisory committee, and model \ncodes of evidence. He characterized the Starr subpoena as striking ``a \nfundamental blow to the attorney-client privilege.'' An independent \ncounsel stretching that far is assuming the authority of the Justice \nDepartment to set legal policy for the United States.\n  Required compliance with Departmental policies not only helps ensure \nthat persons who are subjects of independent counsel investigations \nreceive the same treatment as ordinary citizens, but also guards \nagainst an independent counsel's misuse of the authority to represent \nthe United States. Developing federal legal policy is the province of \nthe Justice Department, which is institutionally motivated and equipped \nto consider competing public policies, constitutional values, and the \nlong-term health of the American legal system. It is not the province \nof an independent counsel who has a narrow mandate and operates without \naccountability for legal positions that may reverberate throughout the \nfederal criminal justice system.\n  Yet in the Foster matter, we have an independent counsel arguing a \ndramatically new position, that the attorney-client privilege \ndisappears at death, without the Justice Department's ever determining \nwhether that is a suitable position for the United States to take.\n\n  And the prosecutorial stretch illustrated by the issuance of the \nFoster subpoena is not the only instance in which an independent \ncounsel appears to have stretched his authority. Just last week, over \nthe strenuous objection of the Justice Department and for the first \ntime in the nation's history, Starr asked a federal court to force \nSecret Service personnel to disclose how they operate and what they \nhave observed of the President in the course of protecting him. No \nfederal prosecutor has ever before asked a court to compel such \ntestimony from a Secret Service agent, according to the Justice \nDepartment.\n  But Starr is undeterred by the opposition of both the Justice \nDepartment and Secret Service. Discounting arguments regarding the \nsafety of the presidency and effective operation of Secret Service \npersonnel, Starr has assumed the role of policymaker. In so doing, he \nhas issued subpoenas which are not only unprecedented, but also, \njudging from the opposition of the Justice Department, in violation of \nJustice Department policy and in violation of Mr. Starr's obligation to \ncomply with Justice Department policy.\n  There's more. The Department of Justice has carefully constructed \npolicies determining when government attorneys may contact possible \ntargets of prosecution without the knowledge and consent of their \nattorney. These policies are intended to protect every citizen's right \nto legal counsel in the criminal justice arena. In a Departmental \nregulation, 28 CFR 77.8, the Justice Department explicitly prohibits \nfederal prosecutors from offering an immunity deal to a target without \nthe consent of the target's legal counsel. Yet independent counsel \nStarr's staff reportedly confronted Monica Lewinsky, in the first \ncontact they had with her, at a shopping mall outside the presence of \nher counsel for the express purpose of offering her an immunity deal. \nIndeed, it has been alleged that the independent counsel's office made \nthe immunity deal contingent upon her NOT contacting her counsel. The \npress has reported that the judge supervising independent counsel \nStarr's grand jury proceedings issued a sealed opinion expressing \nconcern about the actions of the independent counsel in this matter and \nindicating she may refer the matter to the Justice Department's Office \nof Professional Responsibility which is authorized to examine alleged \nviolations of the rules prohibiting contact with a represented person.\n  There's more. Independent counsel Starr issued subpoenas to force two \nbookstores to disclose all purchases by Monica Lewinsky over a 2 year \nperiod. The bookstores, supported by the publishing and bookselling \ncommunities, the American Library Association and others, moved to \nquash the subpoenas. Ruling that the subpoenas implicate the First \nAmendment, the presiding judge required Starr to provide additional \njustification for the subpoenas. The American Booksellers Foundation \nfor Free Expression has stated that ``in the long experience'' of their \nmembers, these subpoenas are ``unprecedented'' in their breadth and \n``threaten free speech by making people afraid that the government will \nfind out what they are reading.''\n  Then there are the subpoenas Starr has issued to news organizations \nto obtain nonpublic information from their news gathering efforts. \nLong-standing Justice Department regulations caution federal \nprosecutors against such subpoenas in order to safeguard freedom of the \npress. The regulations require trying elsewhere for the information, \nnegotiating requests for information first, and, in a final provision \nthat a court has found falls within the exception to the compliance \nrequirement, obtaining the Attorney General's permission prior to \nissuing a subpoena. Despite the established policy discouraging media \nsubpoenas, independent counsel Starr and independent counsel Donald \nSmaltz have issued subpoenas to news organizations on several \noccasions. When ABC News objected to one such subpoena, Starr stated in \na court pleading that the Justice regulations ``do not govern an \nIndependent Counsel, who, by statutory design, operates for the most \npart outside the Department of Justice.''\n  Then there are the subpoenas Starr issued calling a White House aide \nbefore the grand jury to question him about his communications with the \nmedia and calling another White House aide before the grand jury to \nquestion him about his communications with his local Democratic party. \nIn both cases, Starr created the appearance of using the grand jury to \nsilence or intimidate critics of his office--surely not an established \npractice of the Justice Department.\n  Then there is the subpoena to Monica Lewinsky's mother despite a \nstated policy in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual that, ``the Department will \nordinarily avoid seeking to compel the testimony of a witness who is a \nclose family relative of . . . the person upon whose conduct grand jury \nscrutiny is focusing.''\n  The list goes on.\n  The key question, here, is whether the actions taken by Starr were in \ncompliance with established Justice Department policies or whether they \nwere actions that no ordinary federal prosecutor would take. The test, \nby the way, is not whether a judge would uphold the action in a court \nof law--prosecutorial conduct not in accordance with Justice policies \nmay still be legal. The proper test is not whether the prosecutor's \naction is legal, but whether it is the type of action that the Justice \nDepartment has determined represents what federal prosecutors ought to \nbe doing.\n\n  A federal prosecutor may be legally able to subpoena a target's \nmother, but\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nshould he? A federal prosecutor may be legally able to subpoena a \nSecret Service agent, but should he? A federal prosecutor may be \nlegally able to offer immunity to a target without telling her \nattorney, but should he? A federal prosecutor may be legally able to \nsubpoena the media's nonpublic information, but should he? Justice \nDepartment policy says, in most cases, he should not. Such policies \nraise serious questions as to whether independent counsel Starr is \nmeeting his legal obligation to comply with Justice Department \npolicies.\n  Starr is not, by the way, the only independent counsel to raise these \nconcerns. Independent counsel Smaltz, appointed to determine whether \nthen-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy violated criminal laws, is another \nexample. One key issue in this area involves the role that courts play \nin enforcing independent counsel compliance with Justice Department \npolicies, as mandated by statute. To date, several courts have held \nthat criminal defendants lack standing to enforce such compliance and \nhave declined to examine the substance of their claims. One judge \nhandling a prosecution by independent counsel Smaltz went further, all \nbut reading the requirement to comply with Justice Department policies \nout of the law.\n  The case involved Ronald Blackley, one time chief of staff to \nSecretary Espy. Independent counsel Smaltz charged Blackley, among \nother crimes, with making false statements on a financial disclosure \nform. Blackley moved for dismissal, in part by citing section 9-85A.304 \nof the U.S. Attorneys' Manual which he said prohibited:\n\n     prosecuting alleged violations of financial disclosure \n     requirements under 18 U.S.C. 1001 ``unless a nondisclosure \n     conceals significant wrongdoing.'' . . . [T]here is no \n     allegation of any underlying wrongdoing. . . . We have found \n     no case where an individual filer has been criminally \n     prosecuted in a situation similar to this one.\n\nIn a published decision, United States v. Blackley, 986 F. Supp. 607 \n(1997), the judge held the following:\n\n       It undeniable that Congress's addition of section 594(f) to \n     the Independent Counsel statute in 1982 created somewhat of a \n     paradox between that provision's purpose and the rationale \n     underlying the overall Independent Counsel framework. On the \n     one hand, through section 594(f)(1), Congress is ensuring \n     that there are not two different standards of justice \n     depending on the prosecutor; that ``treatment of officials is \n     equal to that given to ordinary citizens under similar \n     circumstances.'' . . . To prevent against public officials \n     being subject to potentially capricious prosecutorial \n     conduct, an Independent Counsel needs to be tethered to some \n     quantifiable standard, and the Department of Justice policy \n     guidelines provide arguably the most complete, detailed and \n     time-tested standards available. Furthermore . . . adherence \n     to the executive branch's established prosecutorial \n     guidelines helps to guard against constitutional separation-\n     of-powers challenges to the Independent Counsel statute. . . \n     . On the other hand, if an Independent Counsel is supposed to \n     operate as nothing more than the identical twin of the \n     Department of Justice, with no permissible variance in \n     prosecutorial discretion, then the need for the Independent \n     Counsel structure becomes highly questionable. . . . For the \n     Independent Counsel to play a meaningful role, he or she is \n     necessarily expected to act in a manner different from, and \n     sometimes at odds with, the Department of Justice. . . . \n     Therefore, the Independent Counsel may prosecute this case, \n     even if said prosecution is contrary to the general \n     prosecutorial policies of DOJ. . . . Potential criminal \n     ethical violations that may be too small to concern the \n     Department of Justice are nonetheless properly within the \n     purview of the Independent Counsel because the Independent \n     Counsel is, in a sense, charged with the responsibility of \n     ensuring that public officials have maintained the highest \n     standards of ethical conduct.\n\nThe court then upheld the indictment of Blackley, ruling that it was \nirrelevant whether or not the charge in question complied with Justice \nDepartment policy.\n  Contrary to the court's ruling, however, Congress has never charged \nindependent counsels with ethics enforcement. Independent counsels are \nfederal prosecutors required to act in accordance with established \nJustice Department policies. The Blackley decision misreads both the \nlaw and the legislative history, not only by expanding the mission of \nindependent counsels beyond criminal law into ethics enforcement, but \nalso in essentially reading out of the statute the requirement that \nindependent counsels comply with Justice Department policies.\n\n  The Blackley decision is now on appeal. It brings legal focus to the \nissue of independent counsel compliance with established Justice \nDepartment policies--its importance to the law and the question of how \nto enforce it.\n  The Supreme Court stated the following in a 1935 case about \nprosecutorial misconduct, Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78:\n\n       The United States Attorney is the representative not of an \n     ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose \n     obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its \n     obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, \n     in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, \n     but that justice shall be done. . . . He may prosecute with \n     earnestness and vigor--indeed, he should do so. But, while he \n     may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul \n     ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods \n     calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use \n     every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\n\nThis language applies with equal force to an independent counsel, and \nmandatory compliance with established Justice Department policies is a \nmeans to that end.\n  As the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, the \nAttorney General is responsible for ensuring that ``no one is above the \nlaw.'' The law requires independent counsel compliance with established \nJustice Department policies. Where there is evidence that independent \ncounsels are not complying with Justice Department policies, the \nAttorney General has a legal obligation to determine if that is so and, \nif so, to take whatever action is appropriate to obtain independent \ncounsel compliance. In light of court rulings that persons who are the \nvictims of independent counsel noncompliance lack standing to contest \nthe independent counsel's actions in this area, no one other than the \nAttorney General has the responsibility and the capability to enforce \nindependent counsel compliance with the law.\n  If the Attorney General does not act, we need to understand why. If \nthe reason is that the Attorney General feels she has insufficient \nstatutory authority to obtain independent counsel compliance with \nJustice Department policies, we need to clarify the statute. If the \nreason is not the wording of the law, but politics that makes it \nimpossible for the Attorney General to insist on compliance, we need to \ndesign new enforcement mechanisms which are more politically feasible. \nStronger enforcement mechanisms could include, for example, amending \nthe law to require an independent counsel to obtain from the Attorney \nGeneral a certification of compliance with Justice Department policies \nbefore seeking court enforcement of a subpoena or filing an appeal of a \nquestion of law, or adding a provision giving affected persons legal \nstanding in court to force independent counsel compliance with Justice \nDepartment policies.\n  The requirement for compliance with Justice Department policies is \ncentral to the law's constitutionality and fairness. The Attorney \nGeneral and the Attorney General alone can enforce it. Since an \nindependent counsel is not above the law, the Attorney General must \nenforce Section 594(f), which is the law of the land and essential to \nthe independent counsel law's constitutionality and purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5427-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5429-S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ISRAELI MEMBERSHIP IN A UNITED NATIONS REGIONAL GROUP\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today a unanimous Senate will state in \nclear and simple terms that we will no longer abide by the \ndiscrimination faced by Israel at the United Nations. I speak of the \nfact that Israel is excluded from a United Nations regional group. \nIsrael is the only one of the 185 member states of the United Nations \nbarred from membership in a regional group. The United Nations member \nstates have organized themselves by regional groups since before Israel \njoined the United Nations in 1949. Membership in a United Nations \nregional group confers eligibility to sit on the Security Council, the \nEconomic and Social Council, as well as other United Nations councils, \ncommissions, and committees.\n  For the first time, the Senate provides notice of its intention to \nwork to end this Cold War anachronism. One sorry throwback to an era \nwhen the institutionalized isolation of Israel was a given in \ninternational affairs--the ugly\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\n``gentlemen's agreement'' that excludes Israel and only Israel from \nmembership in any United Nations Regional Group. Israel, and only \nIsrael, can never sit on the United Nations Security Council. Israel, \nand only Israel, can never serve on the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Council, where her expertise is so sorely missed. Israel, and \nonly Israel, is less than a full member of the very international \norganization which bravely voted on November 29, 1947 to create it.\n  Today we call for Israel's admission to a United Nations Regional \nGroup. This must be a goal of our government's foreign policy and a \npriority of reform efforts at the United Nations. That such legislation \nis necessary is a reminder that, despite the unparalleled success of \nthe Zionist movement in its first hundred years, the state created half \na century ago, as the fruit of this ideal, still requires support from \nits friends to overcome this institutional prejudice.\n  It is a fitting tribute to this vision that our country will take its \nrightful place in the forefront of the effort to allow Israel to \nparticipate fully in international affairs and to be counted as a \nlegitimate member among the nations of the world. I am joined in this \neffort by 54 cosponsors. I thank my colleagues for their support and in \nparticular the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator \nLugar, for his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5429-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \ntreaties and sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5430-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT TO CONGRESS ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE U.S. CITIZENS WHO HAVE \nBEEN MISSING FROM CYPRUS SINCE 1974--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 133\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with Public Law 103-372, I hereby submit the enclosed \n``Report to Congress on the Investigation of the Whereabouts of the \nU.S. Citizens Who Have Been Missing from Cyprus Since 1974.''

A bill to make the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 applicable to the United States Postal Service in the same manner \nas any other employer; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                postal employees safety enhancement act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Postal Employees \nSafety Enhancement Act of 1998.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by my \ncolleagues Senators Bingaman, Kennedy, Jeffords and Hutchinson would \nfully bring the United States Postal Service under the regulatory \numbrella of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It has \nalways been my unshakeable belief that the Government must play by its \nown rules. This important legislation is an incremental step in the \neffort to ensure that the ``law of the land'' applies equally to all \nbranches of the Government as well as the private sector --and \neverything in-between.\n  Since I became a member of this distinguished body, I've been \nadvocating legislation geared to improve the safety and health of our \nnation's workplaces. My sincere devotion to this issue, however, goes \nback much farther than my work here in Washington. For 12 years, I was \nan accountant for Dunbar Well Service in Gillette, WY, an oil well \nservicing company with offices throughout Wyoming. Like most businesses \nin my home state, Dunbar Well Service is a small business. The payroll \nconsisted of 130 employees. As a result, I wore several hats. One of my \nroles was safety instruction, which required me to travel the state \nteaching employees about the importance of workplace safety and health. \nThe company's rigorous safety program even had me collecting samples \nfor drug tests--an extremely effective method of deterring workplace \ninjuries and fatalities, by the way.\n  I saw things with OSHA that I thought needed to be changed. I served \nin the State legislature. I was told that States can't change that and \nI understand that. Then I got to come to Washington, and in Washington \nwe can make a difference in the workplace. I went to work on a SAFE \nAct, one that will provide safety in all businesses. That has been \nthrough hearings. It has been through markups in the Labor Committee \nand is ready to be debated on this floor. I have had hands-on \nexperience in the workplace with safety, and I know that workplace \nsafety and health is everyone's business. And that's the only way it \nworks. It is not a political issue, it is an issue that cannot be \ndivided by a barrier that separates even the public and the private \nsector. It's everybody's concern, and that is the only way it works.\n  We must ensure the safety and health of all employees because they \nare the most important asset of any business. It's success or failure \nrests with their ability to provide efficient care and service to their \ncustomers, whoever they may be. Although all Federal agencies must \ncomply with the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health statute, they are \nnot required to pay penalties issued to them by OSHA. The bill I am \nintroducing today is the first step in the effort to eliminate this \nbarrier.\n  It is important to point out that this legislation is not intended to \nsingle out the Postal Service. My first look at how ineffective Federal \nagencies are at making workplace safety and health a priority began \nwhen I noted that Yellowstone National Park was cited by OSHA last \nFebruary for 600 violations--92 of them serious. One of those serious \nviolations was the Park's failure to report an employee's death to \nOSHA. In fact, Yellowstone has posted five employee deaths in the past \nthree and one-half years. Although there are these and other serious \nproblems noted in the Park's safety and health record, I later found \nthat it pales in comparison to the United States Postal Service's \nrecord.\n  After looking at the past 5 year totals for all Federal workplace \ninjuries, illnesses, lost work time and fatalities, I was shocked to \nsee the Postal Service at the very top of the list. It was my initial \nfeeling that the armed forces would be the most hazardous occupation in \nthe Federal Government. That notion was proven wrong. Surprisingly, the \nPostal Service employs relatively the same number of workers as the \nDepartment of Defense. Yet it has double the number of total workplace \ninjuries and illnesses and almost double the number of lost work-time \ncases as the Department of Defense.\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\n  What is most troubling about the Postal Service's safety record, \nhowever, is its annual workers' compensation payments. From 1992 to \n1997, the Postal Service paid an annual average of $505 million in \nworkers' compensation costs--placing them once again at the top of the \nFederal Government's list. Moreover, the  Postal Service's annual \ncontribution to workers' compensation amounts to almost one-third of \nthe Federal program's $1.8 billion price tag. These facts are simply \ninexcusable and clearly justify the need for legislation. Better yet, \nthis legislation would likely decrease the annual expenditures for \nworkers' compensation because of a reduction in workplace injuries, \nillnesses, lost time and fatalities.\n\n  In 1970, Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act, eliminating \nthe old Postal Department status as a cabinet office. Twelve years \nlater, the Postal Service became fiscally self-sufficient--depending on \nmarket-driven revenues rather than taxpayer dollars.\n  Of course the Postal Service is big. The Postal Service is 43 percent \nof the world's mail. It has annual profits that exceed $1.5 billion. If \nthe Postal Service were a private company, it would be the 9th largest \nbusiness in the United States and 29th in the entire world. It is \nbigger than Coca-Cola, Xerox, and Kodak combined. It has offices in \nvirtually every community. In fact, some of the communities in my State \nare communities because they are a post office. So it covers the big \nand it covers the small.\n  When I did the SAFE Act I talked to my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. I talked to any group that would talk to me. I talked to \nbusinesses, I talked to employers, I talked to employees, I talked to \nunions, and then drafted a bill. That bill is going through the \nprocess.\n  When I noticed this problem, I went through the same process. I have \nmet with those groups--agencies, unions that are involved in this \nprocess--and I have to say, I have gotten some very helpful, \nconstructive suggestions from those groups. Those suggestions appear in \nthe bill.\n  I have talked to the Postal Service about it. They have reviewed it. \nThey have asked for additional time to review it. The bill is only five \npages long. I don't know how long it takes to review that, so I can \nonly assume that they have no problem with the bill either, although I \nam sure they are not excited to come under the same rules that everyone \nelse plays under.\n  The point of this legislation is simple. If government makes the \nrules, Government must play by them. this is the same basic premise \nadopted by Congress when it passed the Congressional Accountability Act \nduring the 104th Congress. The Postal Service is not above the law and \nits employees are no less important to its daily operations than the \nemployees of private businesses are to the companies that employ them. \nWhen advocating workplace safety and health in this context, I can \nthink of no better place to start than the Postal Service--which calls \nitself a Federal agency when it is helpful to refer to itself as such. \nIn fact, it's not a Federal agency at all. It's a self-sufficient, \nquasi-governmental entity. How many Federal agency's employees can \ncollectively bargain under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act? How \nmany Federal agencies don't receive one dime of the taxpayers' money? \nHow many Federal agencies post annual profits exceeding $1.5 billion? \nThe Postal Service exhibits almost every characteristic of a private \nbusiness. Still, it's reluctant to fully comply with Federal \noccupational safety and health law. Clearly, that must change.\n\n  After carefully examining the perspectives of the Postal Service and \nthe unions representing its employees, I have concluded that the Postal \nEmployees Safety Enhancement Act is necessary legislation. The bill \nwould permit OSHA to fully regulate the Postal Service the same way it \ndoes private businesses. In addition, the bill would prevent the Post \nOffice from closing or consolidating rural post offices or services \nsimply because it's required to comply with OSHA. Service to all areas \nof the Nation, rural or urban, was made a part of the Postal Service's \nmission by the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act. The quality of the \nservice it provides should not decrease because of efforts to protect \nand ensure employee safety and health. Along this same premise, the \nbill would prevent the Postal Rate Commission from raising the price of \nstamps to help the Postal Service pay for potential OSHA fines. Rather, \nthe Postal Service should offset the potential for OSHA fines by \nimproving workplace conditions which would decrease its annual $500 \nmillion expenditure on workers' compensation claims.\n  This bipartisan bill will make the law of the land mean what it says. \nCongress would only be applying those standards to the Postal Service \nthat it applied to itself three years ago. The Postal Service has the \nmost alarming occupational safety and health record in the Federal \nGovernment. It should therefore be the first to be reined in.\n  Every schoolchild is familiar with the words on the New York Post \nOffice that became the motto of the Postal Service, ``Neither snow, nor \nrain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift \ncompletion of their appointed rounds.'' Add to that the million and one \nbarriers, complaints, dogs, assaults and other obstacles our postal \nworkers must deal with every day and it is clear that they have more \nthan enough to deal with without having to worry about the conditions \nof their workplace as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this necessary, common sense \nlegislation to show our support for workplace safety and health \neverywhere throughout the country, in every business and corporation, \nin both private and the public sector.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 2112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, in introducing the Postal \nEmployees Safety Enhancement Act of 1998.\n  I want to begin by commending the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \nfor bringing this issue before the Senate. As my colleagues know, in \nthe short time he has been in the Senate, Senator Enzi has become one \nof the leading experts on the Occupational Health and Safety Act of \n1970. I have found him to be extremely willing to listen to all sides \nof what are complex issues, to work in a bipartisan manner and to \nengage all interested parties in a constructive dialogue on OSHA \nrelated issues. I also commend him for recognizing the need which this \nlegislation will address and for working with all interested parties \nover the past few weeks to draft a bill that will address that need.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is really rather \nsimple. It will make the Occupational Health and Safety Act applicable \nto the United States Postal Service as it would be to any other private \nsector employer. The reasons for doing this, and the need to do so, are \nvery obvious to anyone who looks at this issue. A comparison of all of \nthe worker's compensation costs charged to federal employing agencies \nfrom July 1, 1993 to July 30, 1994 showed the Postal Service had a \nsignificantly higher rate of employment based injury claims than any \nfederal agency. There are numerous reports of safety and health \nproblems that have gone unaddressed by the P.O., some of which have \nbeen laid out by Senator Enzi this morning. Unfortunately, unlike every \nother private sector employee in America, Postal Service workers do not \nhave the benefit, or the protections of the OSHA Act. While the Postal \nService has some internal mechanisms for addressing employee injuries \nmost would find these to be inadequate to protect employees and to help \nthe Postal Service provide a safer workplace. This legislation should \nbe welcomed by all who care about worker safety and health and I \nbelieve the Postal Service does care.\n  As my colleagues know, the Postal Service is one of the largest U.S. \nemployers. Over the past several years it has gone through a series of \nreorganizations and restructuring to improve the quality of the service \nit provides. I commend the Postal Service for many of these initiatives \nand appreciate the service it provides to the people of my state. Like \nSenator Enzi, I do not mean to single out the Postal Service with this \nlegislation. However, because the Postal Service operates in essence \nlike any other private business, I think it is appropriate to expect \nthat it complies with the same safety and health standards as other \nbusinesses. Likewise I think Postal workers deserve the same \nprotections afforded all other private sector workers, under the Act.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will work quickly to adopt this \nlegislation this year. I see no reason why this bill should not pass \nquickly and overwhelmingly.\n  Again Mr. President, I commend Senator Enzi for bringing this \nimportant worker safety measure before the Senate and look forward to \nworking with him to ensure its swift passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, Senator \nEnzi, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Bingaman, in introducing the Postal \nEmployees Safety Enhancement Act. This important legislation will \nextend coverage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to employees \nof the United States Postal Service.\n  Few issues are more important to working families than health and \nsafety on the job. For the past 28 years, OSHA has performed a critical \nrole--protecting American workers from on-the-job injuries and \nillnesses.\n  In carrying out this mission, OSHA has made an extraordinary \ndifference in people's lives. Death rates from on-the-job accidents \nhave dropped by over 60% since 1970--much faster than before the law \nwas enacted. More than 140,000 lives have been saved.\n  Occupational illnesses and injuries have dropped by one-third since \nOSHA's enactment--to a record low rate of 7.4 per 100 workers in 1996.\n  These numbers are still unacceptably high, but they demonstrate that \nOSHA is a success by any reasonable measure.\n  Even more lives have been saved in the two places where OSHA has \nconcentrated its efforts. Death rates have fallen by 61% in \nconstruction and 67% in manufacturing. Injury rates have dropped by \nhalf in construction, and nearly one-third in manufacturing. Clearly, \nOSHA works best where it works hardest.\n  Unfortunately, these efforts do not apply to federal agencies. The \noriginal OSHA statute required only that federal agencies provide \n``safe and healthful places and conditions of employment'' to their \nemployees. Specific OSHA safety and health rules did not apply.\n  In 1980, President Carter issued an Executive Order that solved this \nproblem in part. It directed federal agencies to comply with all OSHA \nsafety standards, and it authorized OSHA to inspect workplaces and \nissue citations for violations.\n  President Carter's action was an important step, but more needs to be \ndone. When OSHA inspects a federal workplace and finds a safety \nviolation, OSHA can direct the agency to eliminate the hazard. But OSHA \nhas no authority to seek enforcement of its order in court, and it \ncannot assess a financial penalty on the agency to obtain compliance.\n  The situation is especially serious in the Postal Service. Postal \nemployees suffer one of the highest injury rates in the federal \ngovernment. In 1996 alone, 78,761 postal employees were injured on the \njob--more than nine injuries and illnesses for every hundred workers. \nThis rate is 23% higher than the overall private sector rate, and 40% \nhigher than the overall federal rate. Fourteen postal employees were \nkilled on the job in 1996--one-sixth of the federal total. Workers' \ncompensation charges at the Postal Service are also high--$538 million \nin 1997.\n  This legislation will bring down these unacceptably high rates. It \npermits OSHA to issue citations for safety hazards, and back them up \nwith penalties. This credible enforcement threat will encourage the \nPostal Service to comply with the law. It will save taxpayer dollars \ncurrently spent on worker's compensation costs.\n  Most important, it will reduce the extraordinarily high rate of \ninjuries among postal employees. Every worker deserves a safe and \nhealthy place to work, and this bill will help achieve that goal for \nthe 860,000 employees of the Postal Service. They deserve it, and I \nurge my colleagues to provide it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Akaka, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Graham, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Warner, Mrs. \n        Boxer, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2114. A bill to amend the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act, the Older Americans Act of \n1965, and the Public Health Service Act to ensure that older women are \nprotected from institutional, community, and domestic violence and \nsexual assault and to improve outreach efforts and other services \navailable to older women victimized by such violence, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           older women's protection from violence act of 1998\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce this legislation \nwith my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. \nUnfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. \nThose who perpetrate violence against their family members do not \ndesist because the family member grows older. In fact, in some cases, \nthe abuse may become more severe as the victim ages becoming more \nisolated from the community with their removal from the workforce. \nOther age-related factors such as increased frailty may increase a \nvictim's vulnerability. It also is true that older victims' ability to \nreport abuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser \nfor care or housing. Every seven minutes in Illinois, there\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\nis an incidence of elder abuse. Several research studies have shown \nthat elder abuse is the most under reported familial crime. It is even \nmore under reported than child abuse with only between one in eight and \none in fourteen incidents estimated to be reported. Seniors who \nexperience abuse worry they will be banished to a nursing home if they \nreport abuse. They also must struggle with the ethical dilemma of \nreporting abuse by their children to the authorities and thus \nincreasing their child's likelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear \ngag them so that they remain ``silent victims.''\n  Domestic violence programs have a moral and ethical responsibility to \nprovide services to individuals of any age who are the victims of \ndomestic abuse. Yet most domestic violence programs see only a few \nolder women a year. That is not to say that the domestic violence \nservice providers actively discriminate against older victims. Analysis \nof the few studies that do exist of elder domestic abuse indicate that \nthe vast majority do not themselves seek to access existing services. \nThere may be many reasons for this. The images portrayed in the media \nof the victims of domestic violence generally depict a young woman, \nwith small children. Seniors suffering domestic abuse may not readily \nidentify with these images and, therefore, may not see those services \nas being for them. Other cultural barriers may also exist. Many older \nwomen were raised to believe that family business is a private matter. \nProblems within families were not to be discussed with anyone, \nespecially strangers or counselors. Only a handful of domestic abuse \nprograms throughout the country are reaching out to older women.\n  This legislation seeks to improve current federal family violence \nprograms, such as The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Family \nViolence Prevention Services Act (FVPSA), to make them more sensitive \nto the needs of the nations seniors. Title I of this bill promotes the \ninclusion of elder abuse cases in law school clinics and training for \nlaw enforcement in the identification and referral of older victims of \ndomestic violence or elder abuse to services. Title II allows FVPSA \ngrant funds to be used for outreach to older individuals. We know that \ngreat improvements have taken place since VAWA was first passed. One of \nthe most successful programs is the law enforcement training program, \nwhich received $200 million in FY 1998. However, improvement can be \nmade with respect to identifying abuse among all age groups. When the \nabuser is old, there may be a reticence on the part of law enforcement \nto deal with this person in the same way that they might deal with a \nyounger person. Who wants to send an ``old guy'' to jail? However, lack \nof action jeopardizes the victim further because then the abuser has \nevery reason to believe that there are no consequences for their \nactions. Another common problem is differentiating between injuries \nrelated to abuse and injuries arising from aging, frailty or illness. \nToo many older women's broken bones have been attributed to \ndisorientation, osteoporosis or other age-related vulnerabilities \nwithout any questions being asked to make sure that they are not the \nresult of abuse.\n  Title III reauthorizes the very important Elder Rights programs \ncontained within the Older Americans Act. These programs provide seed \nmoney for state elder abuse programs. Included here is the Long-term-\ncare Ombudsman program that monitors nursing homes and investigates \nreports of abuse in such institutions.\n  Most domestic abuse shelters are filled with young families. The \nstaff and volunteers are predominantly younger than 50 years old. The \nrecreation calendar has activities for young women and children. \nDiscussions at support groups can be dominated by younger women talking \nabout their children, child care and custody. Many domestic abuse \nshelters are not readily accessible to those who are less mobile. For \ninstance, some may not be accessible via the ground floor. Moving from \nyour home into a shelter is always a traumatic event. However, it may \nbe even harder for those who find themselves in surroundings so \nunfamiliar and so totally oriented to a different age group. In my home \nstate of Illinois, there are only two centers that focus on the shelter \nneeds of seniors. One is the Center for Prevention of Abuse in Peoria, \nthe other is the Swan center in Olney, which has a comprehensive elder \nprotective services program. Title III seeks to address this shortage \nby encouraging expanded access to domestic violence shelters that cater \nto the needs of older individuals.\n  This bill seeks to help foster collaboration between the aging \nnetworks and domestic violence coalitions. Throughout the United \nStates, through the Older Americans Act, a variety of programs seek to \nserve seniors in their communities. Home-delivered meals and other \nservices provide an opportunity for seniors to interact with \nindividuals outside their own homes. Increasing the knowledge of such \ncare providers in how to identify and refer victims of domestic \nviolence would likely provide much-needed relief to many of these \nindividuals. Title III of this bill contains a ``Community Initiatives \nand Outreach'' grants program to help coordinate both public and \nprivate efforts in elder domestic abuse prevention and treatment. \nFostering communication between these two groups has the potential of \ndramatically increasing the number of individuals that are sensitive to \nthese issues of abuse and, also, to increase the number of individuals \nwho are served by domestic violence programs generally.\n  Family violence is one of the most common causes of disease and \ndistress seen by physicians. In spite of its existence as a pervasive \nand debilitating medical and social problem, many advocates in the \ndomestic violence community believe that it receives insufficient \nattention in the curricula of most schools of medicine or other health \nprofessional training institutions. Dr. Jane Jackman, past president of \nthe Illinois State Medical Society noted last year ``Doctors are \nfinding that the problem is under-recognized. Elder abuse or \nmaltreatment is growing in significance as a factor in trauma, hospital \nadmissions, rising costs of long term care and, ultimately, deaths.'' \nTitle III of this bill directs the Assistant Secretary of Aging to \ncollaborate with other Departments of Health and Human Services and the \nNational Institute of Aging to update and improve curricula for both \ntraining and retraining of health professionals and others in the area \nof elder domestic abuse. These curricula would be made available to \neducational institutions involved in training health professionals. \nTitle IV would amend the Area Health Education Center and Geriatric \nEducation Centers funded through the Health Professionals Education Act \nto allow them to use funds for training and retraining health \nprofessionals in elder domestic abuse.\n  The last title of the bill, Title V, examines the issue of financial \nexploitation of seniors. Take the case of Helen (not her real name) \nreported in the Chicago Tribune last year. Helen was a 66-year-old \nmother and grandmother from DuPage County. Early in 1997, Helen lost \n$90,000 and even access to her own kitchen due to the actions of her \ndaughter. Helen describes how she felt like a P.O.W. Helen had agreed \nto pool resources with her daughter and son-in-law and buy a house \nwhere all of them would live; the deal seemed like a win-win \nproposition. Unbeknownst to Helen, most of the money went to pay off \nher son-in-law's debts. Soon the young couple asked Helen for thousands \nmore and $300 in monthly rent. Shortly after this, her daughter had \nconstruction done on the house which put a new wall between Helen's \nbedroom and the kitchen, blocking her way to the kitchen and forcing \nher to prepare her food in the bathroom. Eventually, Helen found \nherself in a shelter. She now lives in a government subsidized \napartment.\n  The Illinois Department of Aging and other elder abuse service \nproviders will attest to the fact that Helen is not alone in \nexperiencing such financial exploitation. Of the 5,833 reports of elder \nabuse in Illinois in 1997, nearly half (44.6%) were reports of \nfinancial exploitation. Statistics compiled by the Illinois Department \non Aging show that the majority of financial abuse victims are female \nand that most have a functional impairment, such as Alzheimer's \ndisease. For some, financial exploitation may at times be accompanied \nby physical abuse or the threat of physical abuse or other form of \ncoercion. The states Attorneys General have efforts underway to examine \nthis area and are\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\ncooperating in sharing information on how best to deal with such abuse. \nFinancial exploitation is probably more complex and sometimes more \ndifficult to detect than other forms of abuse. Therefore, we are \nproposing a study by experts in the field to more comprehensively \nanalyze the problem and to make recommendations for future actions.\n  With the greying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in \nall its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we \nneed to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence \nprograms and ensure that these and other programs that serve seniors \nare sensitive and knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse. I am pleased \nthat Senators Akaka, Moseley-Braun, Harkin, Mikulski, Wellstone, Dodd, \nKohl, Warner, Boxer, Graham, Cleland, Landrieu, Reid, Torricelli and \nFaircloth have all joined Senator Collins and myself in introducing \nthis bill, and I hope that many more will join us in this effort to \nfocus attention on the needs of the ``forgotten older victims of \ndomestic violence.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted the the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and \n     over who are victims of abuse each year, at least two-thirds \n     are women;\n       (2) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse \n     and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member and adult \n     children of the victims are the largest category of \n     perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of \n     perpetrators;\n       (3) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United \n     States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is \n     expected to continue growing;\n       (4) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's \n     elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the \n     rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;\n       (5) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5 \n     cases being reported in 1980 and 1 in 8 cases being reported \n     today;\n       (6) based on site-specific information from the Indian \n     Health Service, the rate of trauma and violence faced by \n     Indian women could be considered to be epidemic;\n       (7) elder abuse takes on many forms, including physical \n     abuse, sexual abuse, psychological (emotional) abuse, neglect \n     (intended or unintended), and financial exploitation;\n       (8) many older persons, particularly women and minorities, \n     fail to report abuse because of shame or as a result of prior \n     unsatisfactory experiences with individual agencies or others \n     who lacked sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older \n     people;\n       (9) the lack of culturally relevant elder abuse services \n     for Indian women makes access to shelter and other services \n     difficult and often impossible for some Indian women;\n       (10) many older persons fail to report abuse because they \n     are dependent on their abusers and fear being abandoned or \n     institutionalized;\n       (11) the lack of access to telephones, law enforcement, and \n     health services in remote areas, including Indian \n     reservations, makes access to relief from elder abuse \n     particularly difficult for some populations;\n       (12) public and professional awareness and identification \n     of elder abuse is difficult because older persons are not \n     tied into many social networks (such as schools or jobs), and \n     may become isolated in their homes, which can increase the \n     risk of elder abuse;\n       (13) the Department of Justice does not include age as a \n     category for criminal statistics reporting;\n       (14)(A) there are relatively few statistics and research \n     studies regarding violence against older women, and even less \n     is known about the incidence of violence against Indian \n     women; and\n       (B) there is no national data base regarding violence \n     against Indian women; and\n       (15) older persons would greatly benefit from policies that \n     develop, strengthen, and implement programs for the \n     prevention of abuse, including neglect and exploitation, and \n     provide related assistance for victims.\n              TITLE I--VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, there is no conduct less \nconsistent with the precepts of a civilized society than the physical \nabuse of those unable to defend themselves. Our recognition of this has \nled to an aggressive and ongoing campaign against child abuse, and it \nmust lead to an equally strong response to domestic violence directed \nat older Americans. For that reason, I am honored to rise today to \ncosponsor the Older Women's Protection from Violence Act, legislation \nintroduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nand I commend Senator Durbin for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. President, at a 1995 hearing in Portland, Maine, chaired by my \npredecessor, Senator Cohen, elder abuse was aptly described as \n``society's secret shame.'' Family violence, particularly when directed \nat the elderly, was a major concern of Senator Cohen, and I welcome the \nopportunity to continue his efforts to combat this intolerable \nmistreatment of older Americans.\n  Mr. President, earlier this month my home state released its crime \nstatistics for 1997. I was cheered by the wonderful news that crime \nfell by 8.7% from 1996, to the lowest rate in at least 20 years. Hidden \nbehind this positive statistic, however, was one that was very \ndisquieting, namely, that domestic violence increased by 7.8%. \nIronically, at the same time as we are becoming less likely to be \nharmed by strangers, many of our neighbors face an increasing threat \nfrom members of their own households.\n  National data demonstrate that cases of domestic elder abuse, which \nincludes neglect as well as physical abuse, are steadily increasing. \nFrom 1986 to 1996, the number of cases went from 117,000 to 293,000, an \nincrease of 150%. Furthermore, there is widespread agreement that this \ntype of abuse is greatly underreported. For example, although the \nnumber of reported cases in 1994 was 241,000, the National Center on \nElder Abuse estimates that the true number of cases was 818,000.\n  Mr. President, while these numbers indicate a serious and growing \nproblem, all of the statistics in the world do not describe the problem \nas eloquently as the words of a single victim. At the Maine hearing, \none such victim told what happened to her at the hands of her husband \nafter her children left home.\n\n       [T]hings got really bad. I had two broken wrists, cracked \n     ribs, held down with his knee on my chest with a knife at my \n     throat. I was made to crawl across the floor with a gun \n     resting on my head, ready to fire. I've been choked until I \n     was limp, and then he would drop me on the floor with a kick. \n     I've been spit on, thrown through a window, dragged into the \n     lake as he said he was going to drown me.\n\nAstonishingly, but not atypically, the witness was married to her \nhusband for 44 years.\n  Compounding the physical abuse suffered by elderly victims of \nviolence is the sense of being trapped. Again, one of the witnesses at \nthe Portland hearing described this far more effectively than I can.\n\n       People ask why I remained under such circumstances. It was \n     fear that kept me\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n     there. . . . I had been on an island for eight years. Where \n     would I go? I had no money, no home, no job, and no credit. \n     Although I had left good jobs to follow him from job to job, \n     at age 60 who would hire me? Health insurance was my greatest \n     concern.\n\nWith a dependence on the abuser for financial support and physical \ncare, with a long history of emotional ties to that person, with the \nfear of being held up to ridicule, and with a sense of hopelessness \nabout finding a way out of the predicament, it is hardly surprising \nthat the elderly victim is often reluctant to report domestic assaults.\n  Domestic violence against older women is a complex problem about \nwhich we still lack adequate information. This has led to some \nerroneous assumptions. For example, it had been thought that assaults \nagainst the elderly usually result from caregiver stress, but while \nthis is a factor, its effect now appears to have been overstated. \nIndeed, according to a recent report, ``[a]busers are not identical in \ntheir behavior or their assumptions about abusive conduct.'' As the \nreport points out, this means that a ``cookie cutter'' approach will \nnot solve the problem.\n\n  Furhter complicating our efforts to deal with domestic violence \nagainst older women are the conflicting feelings and desires of many of \nthe victims. It is quite common for the victim to have a familial \nrelationship with the abuser, and thus, far more is likely to be \ninvolved in dealing with these situations that in dealing with an \nassault committed by a stranger. For understandable reasons, the older \nwoman may want to preserve the relationship while ending the abuse. \nFinding effective ways to accomplish this can be a formidable \nchallenge.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that Senator Durbin and I are \nintroducing today recognizes that complex problems defy simple \nsolutions. Thus, the Older Women's Protection from Violence Act does \nnot purport to contain a magic bullet that will eliminate this \nreprehensible conduct, but rather looks to a multi-faceted approach to \naddress a multi-faceted problem. Similarly, the bill does not offer \nrevolutionary solutions; instead, its message is that the time has come \nfor society to roll up its sleeves and engage in the hard work of \nprotecting those who have contributed so much to our individual and \ncollective well-being.\n  In keeping with the nature of the problem, the legislation provides \nfor training those who are in a position to identify cases of domestic \nviolence against older women. Consistent with the notion that we cannot \nstop or correct what we do not discover, the primary recipients of that \ntraining would be law enforcement officers and health professionals. In \naddition, the Attorney General is authorized to make grants to law \nschool clinical programs to include elder abuse cases.\n  The bill reauthorizes and expands programs that provide services to \nbattered older women. Such services include outreach, support, and \ncounseling. It also enhances their access to domestic violence \nshelters, something that can mean the difference between life and death \nin some cases. I should emphasize that the provision of these services \nwill be largely at the local level, with financial assistance from the \nfederal government.\n  Mr. President, in a prior position, I managed a state agency that has \nas one of its principal mandates that protection of Maine people, many \nof them elderly, from fraud and other financial abuses. Thus, I am \nespecially pleased that in addition to addressing violence against \nolder women, this bill seeks to shed light on a problem affecting the \nelderly that has received even less attention, namely, their financial \nexploitation by a caregiver or family member.\n  Two cases discussed at the Maine hearing illustrate my point. In one, \nan elderly gentleman from southern Maine went without food because his \ntwo nephews were stealing his money. Yet, he refused to send them away \nbecause they were ``family.'' In the second case, a 75-year old eastern \nMaine woman returned from the hospital after a severe stroke to find \nthat her daughter and son-in-law had changed the locks on her house. \nThe physical and emotional impact of the experience was so great that \nshe was unable to undertake the legal battle to reclaim her home.\n  This bill will shed light on this type of abuse by requiring the \nSecretary of the Treasury to conduct a study of the nature and extent \nof financial exploitation of older individuals. Our society simply \ncannot allow our senior citizens who have labored hard to build up a \nnest egg to have it wrongfully taken from them a the time they need it \nmost.\n  Mr. President, interest in elder abuse did not begin in our country \nuntil the late 1980s, long after we began to focus on child abuse in \nthe 1960s. This may be because these cases are among the least likely \nto be reported. It may also be because our culture tends to worship \nyouth, perhaps giving our older citizens the sense that we care less \nabout them. In any case, this must change, not only because of \ndemographic trends, but also because it is right.\n  This bill will contribute to that change by dealing specifically with \ndomestic violence against older women. In addition to providing \nservices to the victims of this conduct, it funds research into various \naspects of the problem to enhance our understanding and improve our \nability to respond. Our secret shame must not remain a secret.\n  Mr. President, in 1996 the average age of elder abuse victims was 78. \nThere can be no justification for letting these older Americans, who \nhave reached the point in life where they deserve peace, comfort, and \nrespect, to be the victims of domestic violence or any other form of \nabuse. This bill is designed to prevent that, and I trust that my \ncolleagues will support us in the effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2115. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \nscholarship program and an education loan debt reduction program to \nfacilitate the employment of primary care and other health care \nprofessional by the Veterans Health Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\ndepartment of veterans affairs primary care providers incentive act of \n                                  1998\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to \nintroduce the following legislation, ``The Department of Veterans \nAffairs Primary Care Providers Incentive Act of 1998.'' This \nlegislation is intended to revitalize the VA's Health Professionals \nEducation Assistance Program, thereby reducing waste, targeting primary \ncare professions and under-served areas, and making the VA more \ncompetitive with private employers for skilled personnel. I am pleased \nto be joined by my respected colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nin this effort. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  The VA health care system is in the midst of a major reorganization \nthat is simultaneously reducing the current workforce and creating the \nneed for more primary care health professionals. This reorganization \nhas dramatically changed the way the VA delivers health care, by \nshifting the emphasis to outpatient rather than inpatient care. As part \nof this process, the Department of Veterans Affairs has set a goal of \ndoubling the number of primary care providers in the VA health care \nsystem, and we want to assist them. There are two good ways to hire and \nkeep highly skilled professionals--offer incentives to current \nemployees to get training in new areas of need by providing \nscholarships, and recruit new primary care providers by offering \nassistance in paying off student loans. This legislation, which \nincludes both a scholarship program and an education debt reduction \nprogram, can help.\n  The VA needs educational assistance programs such as these to \neffectively recruit and retain trained primary care health \nprofessionals. In the VA hospitals and clinics, some of the most \ndifficult positions to fill are those of nurse practitioners, physical \ntherapists, and occupational therapists. In my home state of West \nVirginia, for example, at one of the VA hospitals there has been a \nvacancy for an occupational therapist for over twelve years! Two of the \nVA hospitals have no physical therapists at all. This is simply \nunacceptable.\n  The plain fact is that the VA cannot offer the same starting salaries \nas those available in private practice. The Education Debt Reduction \nProgram included within the Primary Care Providers Incentive Act gives \nthe VA a financial recruitment tool that will be\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nan enormous help in making the VAMCs more competitive for these much-\nneeded and highly skilled individuals. This program was first designed \nby Senator Mikulski in 1993 in recognition of this very problem. It was \nneeded then, and it is still needed now.\n  Recruitment is only half the problem in building a new workforce that \nis geared toward providing primary care. Retention of trained people, \nespecially in the face of low morale due to budget cuts, is equally \nimportant. The scholarship program in this legislation is designed to \nanswer this very need. Eligibility is limited to current VA employees, \nthus enabling VA to build staff morale. The scholarship program \nprovides a means for vulnerable employees to protect themselves against \nfuture RIFs by acquiring training in the new areas of need. And, VA \ngets the workforce they need, composed of motivated and loyal \nemployees.\n  Professional associations representing primary care health workers, \nVAMC human resources personnel, and past recipients of VA scholarships \nare strongly in support of this legislation. Although this is a time of \nbudget reductions in health care, these programs are a worthwhile \ninvestment, enhancing morale of the VA health care providers in the \nshort term, while building a workforce that matches VA's needs and \nimproves veterans' health care in the long run.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am cosponsoring with \nSenator Rockefeller, the DVA Primary Care Incentive Act of 1998.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill will ultimately benefit our \nveterans. It will help the Department of Veterans Affairs in its effort \nto provide the highest quality of care that our veterans deserve.\n  Mr. President, this bill will create a new Education Debt Reduction \nprogram, and an Employee Incentive Scholarship Program. The Debt \nReduction Program will aid the VA in its efforts to increase its number \nof primary care professionals. Preference will be given to those \nchoosing to serve at rural or under-served sites, and to those \nprofessionals in hard to fill specialties. The bill provides the \nSecretary of the VA with the discretion to determine priority needs \nwith respect to profession, and locations with the greatest need. Debt \nReduction program recipients will have to serve a term with the VA \nequivalent to the length of the repayments. A key component of the Debt \nReduction Program is that each years repayments won't begin until a \nperson has completed a corresponding year of service to the VA. This \nrequirement is critical to ensuring that our veterans get the service \nthey deserve, and that taxpayers get a return on their tax dollars \ninvested.\n  Mr. President, I introduced a debt reduction bill in 1992 because I \nrecognized the need to provide the VA with adequate resources to \nrecruit the professionals it needs. And I realized that some who may \nwant to get the training to help our veterans may not have all of the \nnecessary means to do so. I applaud Senator Rockefeller for including \nan updated debt reduction component to this bill.\n  The second component of the bill is the Employee Incentive \nScholarship Program. This is designed to help meet the VA's need for \nmore primary care professionals and to help retain and retrain some of \nthe VA's current employees. Like the Debt Reduction program, priority \nwould be given to those willing to serve in under-served areas and in \nhard to fill specialties. Recipients would also have to serve at a VA \nclinical site for a term equivalent to the scholarship term. The \ndifference is that the Scholarship program would be open only to \ncurrent VA employees with a minimum of two years of service. We want to \nensure that those benefiting from the Scholarship program have \ndemonstrated a commitment to the VA. We also want to provide the \nopportunity structure for those employees who want to expand their \nskills and move into new fields.\n  In 1996, Veterans Health Administration Under Secretary for Health, \nDr. Kenneth Kizer, published a work called ``Prescription for Change''. \nIn it, he noted the VA's goal to increase the\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nnumber of VA non-physician primary care providers by 200 percent by \n1998. While the VA has made progress, it has not met its goal. This \nbill seeks to provide another tool in the VA's tool belt that will \nallow it to meet its goal.\n  Mr. President, I have been an advocate for our nation's veterans for \nyears. I firmly believe that promises made to our nations veterans must \nbe promises kept. Our veterans risked their lives for our freedom and \nthe protection of democracy. I believe that we as a nation are \ncommitted to providing the services that our veterans need.\n  As the VA continues its move to more outpatient primary care, we must \nmake sure that the VA can attract and retain the type of professionals \nwho can give our veterans the medical care and treatment they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues' support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2116. A bill to clarify and enhance the authorities of the Chief \nInformation Officer of the Department of Agriculture; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\nthe usda information technology reform and year-2000 compliance act of \n                                  1998\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I introduce the USDA \nInformation Technology Reform and Year-2000 Compliance Act of 1998. \nThis legislation aims to centralize all year 2000 computer conversion \nand other information technology acquisition and management activities \nwithin the Officer of the Chief Information Office of the Department of \nAgriculture. Centralization is the most efficient way to manage the \ncomplex and important task of ensuring that all critical computer \nfunctions at the department are operational on January 1, 2000. It is \nalso a wiser and more cost effective way to construct an information \ntechnology infrastructure to enable USDA's hundreds of computer systems \nto interoperate, which unfortunately they cannot now do.\n  The Department of Agriculture is charged with enormous \nresponsibilities and its year 2000 readiness is crucial. It has a \ndiverse portfolio of over 200 federal programs throughout the nation \nand the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs. \nIt is the fourth largest federal agency, with 31 agencies and offices. \nThe department is responsible for the safety of our food supply, \nnutrition programs that serve the poor, young and old, and the \nprotection of our natural resources. Since forty percent of the non-tax \ndebt owed to the federal government is owed to USDA, the department has \na responsibility to ensure the financial soundness of taxpayers' \ninvestments.\n  The dentralized approach to the year 2000 issue at USDA has led to a \nlack of focus on departmental priorities. In fact, none exist. No \nplanning to assure the continuation of the overall mission of the \ndepartment has occurred. Each agency has been allowed to determine what \nservices, programs and activities it deems important enough to be \noperational at the end of the millennium. This decentralized approach \nhas also led to a lack of guidance, oversight and the development of \ncontingency plans. At a hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry on May 14th, the General Accounting Office \nreported that eighty percent of the work remains to be done in the ten \ncomponent agencies reviewed. Responsibility for keeping the mission-\ncritical information technology functioning should clearly rest with \nthe Chief Information Officer.\n  In fiscal year 1998 alone, USDA plans to spend approximately $1.2 \nbillion on information technology and related information resources \nmanagement activities. The General Accounting Office has chronicled \nUSDA's long history of problems in managing its substantial information \ntechnology investments. The GAO reports that such ineffective planning \nand management have resulted in USDA's wasting millions of dollars on \ncomputer systems.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 805, a bill to reform the information \ntechnology systems of the Department of Agriculture. It gave the Chief \nInformation Officer control over the planning, development and \nacquisition of information technology at the department. Introduction \nof that bill prompted some coordination of information technology among \nthe department's agencies and offices. However, component agencies are \nstill allowed to independently acquire and manage information \ntechnology investments solely on the basis of their own parochial \ninterests or needs. This revised legislation is now needed to \nstrengthen that coordination and ensure that centralized information \ntechnology management continues in the future.\n  This legislation further requires that the Chief Information Officer \nmanage the design and implementation of an information technology \narchitecture based on strategic business plans that maximizes the \neffectiveness and efficiency of USDA's program activities. Included in \nthe bill is authority for the Chief Information Officer to approve \nexpenditures for information resources and for year 2000 compliance \npurposes, except for minor acquisitions. To accomplish these purposes, \nthe bill requires that each agency transfer not less than five percent \nof its information technology budget to the Chief Information Officer's \ncontrol.\n  The bill makes the Chief Information Officer responsible for ensuring \nthat the information technology architecture facilitates a flexible \ncommon computing environment for the field service centers based on \nintegrated program delivery and provides maximum data sharing with USDA \ncustomers and other federal and state agencies, which is expected to \nresult in significant reduction in operating costs.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill whose time has come. Unfortunately, \nUSDA's problems in managing information technology are not unusual \namong government agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. \nI commend the attention of my colleagues to this bill designed to \naddress a portion of the information resource management problems of \nthe federal government and ask for their support of it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2117. A bill to authorize the construction of the Perkins County \nRural Water System and authorize financial assistance to the Perkins \nCounty Rural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, in the \nplanning and construction of the water supply system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n             PERKINS COUNTY RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce \nlegislation to authorize a critically important rural water system in \nSouth Dakota, the ``Perkins County Rural Water System Act of 1998.'' I \nam pleased to have my good friend and colleague from South Dakota, \nSenator Daschle, as an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation, which I had introduced during the 104th Congress as a \nMember of the House of Representatives. Congressman Thune of South \nDakota is the sponsor of similar legislation in the House during this \nCongress. This legislation is also strongly supported by the State of \nSouth Dakota and local project sponsors, who have demonstrated that \nsupport by agreeing to substantial financial contributions from the \nlocal level.\n  Like many parts of South Dakota, Perkins County has insufficient \nwater supplies of reasonable quality available, and the water supplies \nthat are available do not meet the minimum health and safety standards, \nthereby posing a threat to public health and safety.\n  In addition to improving the health of residents in the region, I \nstrongly believe that this rural drinking water delivery project will \nhelp to stabilize the rural economy as well. Water is a basic commodity \nand is essential if we are to foster rural development in many parts of \nrural South Dakota, including the Perkins County area.\n  The ``Perkins County Rural Water System Act of 1998'' authorizes the \nBureau of Reclamation to construct a Perkins County Rural Water System \nproviding service to approximately 2,500 people, including the \ncommunities of Lemmon and Bison, as well as rural residents. The \nPerkins County Rural Water System is located in northwestern South \nDakota along the South Dakota/North Dakota border and it will be an \nextension of an existing rural water system in North Dakota, the \nSouthwest Pipeline Project. The State of South Dakota has worked \nclosely with the State of North Dakota over the years on the Perkins \nCounty connection to the Southwest Pipeline Project. A feasibility \nstudy completed\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\nin 1994 looked at several alternatives for a dependable water supply, \nand the connection to the Southwest Pipeline Project is clearly the \nmost feasible for the Perkins County area.\n  Mr. President, South Dakota is plagued by water of exceedingly poor \nquality, and the Perkins County rural water project is an effort to \nhelp provide clean water--a commodity most of us take for granted--to \nthe people of Perkins County, South Dakota. I am a strong believer in \nthe federal governments role in rural water delivery, and I hope to \ncontinue to advance that agenda both in South Dakota and around the \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support this important rural water \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move forward on \nenactment as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe tax on vaccines to 25 per dose; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        legislation lowering the federal excise tax on vaccines\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nreducing the excise tax on vaccines from seventy-five cents to twenty-\nfive cents per dose. I am introducing this bill along with my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee, Senators Breaux, Mack and \nRockefeller as well as Senators Daschle, Murkowski, Cochran, Inouye, \nLugar, Bumpers, Frist, and Santorum.\n  Vaccines are a modern miracle--preventing disease and illness often \nfor a lifetime with just a few doses. Vaccines have virtually \neliminated the scourge of smallpox in the world. Polio as a wild virus \nhas been eliminated in the western hemisphere. Measles, mumps, rubella, \npertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis vaccines have saved \nthousands of lives. Technology in vaccines is on the brink of \npreventing other diseases ranging from Lyme disease to widespread \nrotavirus in the third world.\n  Unfortunately, there is a small minority of children whose systems \ncannot handle vaccines and become injured. Recognizing this problem and \nacknowledging that childhood vaccination is required, Congress in 1986 \nset up a Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund into which federal \nexcise taxes are paid. This modified no-fault system allows parents of \nvaccine-injured children to receive compensation for their children if \nthe vaccine is covered by the fund. Childhood vaccines recommended by \nthe federal government for routine use in children are covered (1) once \napproved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, (2) added \nto the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), and (3) included on \nthe list of vaccines on which the tax is imposed by Congress.\n  When the trust fund was established there was no experience with what \nclaims would commit to and what the size of the tax should be. \nEstimates were made and different tax levels were established for each \nvaccine.\n  By 1993, it was apparent that the tax levels were far too high and a \nsurplus was building up in the fund. Today that surplus totals 1.2 \nbillion dollars. The Ways and Means and Finance Committees directed the \nAdministration to study the system and develop a proposal that solves \nthe overfunding problem.\n\n  A consensus proposal was drafted and signed on to by all sectors of \nthe public health community--physicians, manufacturers, parent's groups \nand health departments. That plan called for a new flat tax of 51 cents \nper antigen (or disease). But even this new rate was far more than was \nnecessary to fund the system. For example, the guardian of the fund, \nthe Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, recommended 25 cents per \nantigen even when the surplus was half its level today.\n  Last year, as part of the balanced budget bill, Congress established \na single rate tax structure but did so at a level of seventy-five cents \nper dose. The seventy-five cents per dose amount was chosen to satisfy \nthe revenue neutrality goals of the overall bill. Congress did not \nsolve the overfunding problem and the result was that while some \nvaccine taxes were reduced dramatically, others were increased. Three \nnew vaccines were added to the program at the seventy-five cents per \ndose rate.\n  At the beginning of this year, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust \nFund had a balance of 1.2 billion dollars. If you assumed that future \noutlays from the fund would be twice as large as the fund's average \nover the past eight years, it would take more than 20 years to exhaust \nthe assets in the trust fund, even if no excise tax revenues were \ncollected from this date forward. Stated another way, the interest \nearned on the trust fund assets is more than enough to pay annual \nclaims and administrative cost. As with many other trust funds within \nthe federal budget, these taxes are being used for other federal \nspending.\n  This proposal will also provide significant benefits to the states. \nWhen states purchase vaccines they pay the excise tax. Our bill would \nsave the States $52 million annually. For my home state of Rhode \nIsland, that would amount to 353,000 dollars annually. By lowering \nthese taxes we can lower health care costs to vaccine recipients and \nproviders while saving states and the federal government the money they \nnow pay in excise taxes when they buy vaccines.\n  This proposal is supported by physicians, state health departments, \nmanufacturers and parental groups. Most significantly, the Advisory \nCommission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) which Congress created to make \nrecommendations on changes to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, \nstrongly supports this proposal.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important \nhealth initiative.\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, a very important bill for America's \nchildren. Our bill, the Vaccinate America's Children Now Act, will cut \nthe excise tax on all vaccines to twenty-five cents per dose. Lowering \nthe price of vaccines against such deadly and crippling diseases as \npolio and meningitis will not only result in lower health care costs, \nbut also greater immunization rates. As a result, fewer American \nchildren will ever have to know the pain and devastation of childhood \ndisease.\n  Federal excise taxes on vaccines were first enacted in the late 1980s \nto fund a vaccine injury compensation fund to pay for those rare \ninjuries associated with vaccination. Since enactment, this \ncompensation fund has accumulated a surplus of $1.2 billion and the \nsurplus continues to grow. However, claims against the fund have been \nfalling as a result of safer vaccines. The interest alone on this fund \nis now enough to pay the anticipated claims and costs each year. \nLowering the excise tax rate on vaccines will not endanger the solvency \nof the vaccine injury compensation trust fund in any way. In fact, the \nguardian of the trust fund, the Advisory Commission on Childhood \nVaccines has unanimously endorsed our proposal.\n  Lowering the vaccine tax rates will, however, reduce health care \ncosts and make immunization more affordable. Our bill will save states \nmoney because\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nstates pay these excise taxes when vaccines are purchased for state \nimmunization programs. For example, our bill will save my own State of \nLouisiana approximately $1 million. Nationwide, reducing the excise tax \nwill save the states almost $53 million. These cost savings are one \nreason why the Association of States and Territorial Health Officers \nwhich represents all of the state health departments also supports our \nbill.\n  Vaccines are a modern miracle--preventing disease and illness often \nfor a lifetime with just a few doses. Vaccines have virtually \neliminated the scourge of smallpox in the world. Polio as a wild virus \nhas been eliminated in the western hemisphere. Measles, mumps, rubella, \npertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis vaccines have saved \nthousands of lives. We must do every thing that we can to ensure that \nchildren continue to be immunized. Our bill will make these vaccines \nmore affordable and more available to all of America's \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 2119. A bill to amend the Amateur Sports Act to strengthen \nprovisions protecting the right of athletes to compete, recognize the \nParalympics and growth of disabled sports, improve the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee's ability to resolve certain disputes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           olympic and amateur sports act amendments of 1998\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Olympic and \nAmateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998, a bill to update the federal \ncharter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the framework for Olympic and \namateur sports in the United States. Senator Campbell joins me as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  This framework is commonly known as the ``Amateur Sports Act,'' \nbecause most of its provisions were added by the Amateur Sports Act of \n1978 (P.L. 95-606). The Act gives the U.S. Olympic Committee certain \ntrademark protections to raise money--and does not provide recurring \nappropriations--so therefore does not come up for routine \nreauthorization.\n  The Amateur Sports Act has not been amended since the comprehensive \nrevision of 1978--a revision which provided the foundation for the \nmodern Olympic movement in the United States.\n  Key components of the 1978 Act included--\n  (1) measures to expand the authority of the U.S. Olympic Committee to \nallow it to better serve as the coordinating body for amateur sports;\n  (2) criteria for the selection of national governing bodies, and \nmechanisms to allow NGBs to be replaced if they are doing a poor job;\n  (3) and perhaps most importantly--comprehensive measures to protect \nthe right of athletes to compete.\n  The 1978 Act was based on recommendations of President Ford's \nCommission on Olympic Sports, which had worked from 1975 until 1977 to \ndetermine how to correct factional disputes between sports \norganizations which were depriving many athletes of the opportunity to \ncompete.\n  I served on the Commission, along with Senators Culver and Stone. \nWhen the Commission's report was delivered to Congress, Chairman Warren \nMagnuson asked me to head up the Commerce Committee's review. In \naddition to numerous working sessions, we spent two full days of \nCommerce Committee hearings on October 18 and October 19, 1977 \ndiscussing the report and the bill implementing it.\n  Our bill was enacted into law on November 8, 1978. It was a \ntremendous achievement, which had the consensus support of all entities \ninvolved--a rarity even then. It is a resilient statute which, to the \ncredit of all involved, served its purposes for 15 years before showing \nsigns of needing a tune-up.\n  Based on the review we've just completed, I can say that the Act is \nstill fundamentally sound and that it will serve the United States \nadmirably into the 21st century. However, the significant changes which \nhave occurred in the world of Olympic and amateur sports since 1978 \nwarrant some fine-tuning of the Act.\n  Some of the developments of the past 20 years include:\n  (1) that the schedule for the Olympics and Winter Olympics has been \nalternated so that games are held every two years, instead of every \nfour--significantly increasing the workload of the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee;\n  (2) that sports have begun to allow professional athletes to compete \nin some Olympic events;\n  (3) that even sports still considered ``amateur'' have athletes with \ngreater financial opportunities and professional responsibilities than \nwe ever considered in 1978; and\n  (4) that the Paralympics--the Olympics for disabled amateur \nathletes--have grown significantly in size and prestige.\n  These and other changes led me to call for a comprehensive review of \nthe Amateur Sports Act in 1994. The Commerce Committee has held three \nhearings since then.\n  At the first and second--on August 11, 1994 and October 18, 1995--\nwitnesses identified where the Amateur Sports Act was showing signs of \nstrain. We postponed our work until after the 1996 Summer Olympics in \nAtlanta, but on April 21, 1997, held a third hearing at the Olympic \nTraining Center in Colorado Springs to discuss solutions to the \nproblems which had been identified.\n  By January, 1998, we'd refined the proposals into possible amendments \nto the Amateur Sports Act, which we discussed at length at an informal \nworking session on January 26, 1998 in the Commerce Committee hearing \nroom.\n  The bill that Senator Campbell and I introduce today reflects the \ncomments received in January, and excludes proposals for which \nconsensus appeared unachievable.\n  Some measures in the bill may need further refinement, and if \nnecessary, I will ask for unanimous consent to issue a star print on \nJune 4, 1998. As with the 1978 Act, I believe we will have broad \nconsensus on the bill, and I expect to present the bill to the Commerce \nCommittee for its consideration during June.\n  I will include a longer summary of the bill for the Record, but will \nbriefly explain its primary components:\n  (1) the bill would change the title of the underlying law to the \n``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act'' to reflect that more than strictly \namateurs are involved now, but without lessening the amateur and grass \nroots focus reflected in the title of the 1978 Act;\n  (2) the bill would add a number of measures to strengthen the \nprovisions which protect athletes' rights to compete;\n  (3) it would add measures to improve the ability of the USOC to \nresolve disputes--particularly close the Olympics, Paralympics, or Pan-\nAmerican Games--and reduce the legal costs and administrative burdens \nof the USOC;\n  (4) it would add measures to fully incorporate the Paralympics into \nthe Amateur Sports Act, and update the existing provisions affecting \ndisabled athletes;\n  (5) it would improve the notification requirements when an NGB has \nbeen put on probation or is being challenged;\n  (6) it would increase the reporting requirements of the USOC and NGB \nwith respect to sports opportunities for women, minorities, and \ndisabled individuals; and\n  (7) it would require the USOC to report back to Congress in five \nyears with any additional changes that may be needed to the act.\n  Mr. President, I am the only Senator from President Ford's Commission \nstill serving--and of the Commerce Committee members involved with the \n1978 Act, only myself and Senators Hollings, Inouye, and Ford remain on \nthe Committee.\n  It has therefore been very helpful to have Senator Campbell--an \nOlympian himself in 1964--involved in this process. Senator Campbell \nand I are hopeful the rest of the Senate and Congress will appreciate \nthe need for the relatively minor improvements we propose today, and \nwill help us enact these changes before the end of this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both my summary and the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

SPECIAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       Five years from the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     United States Olympic Committee shall submit a special report \n     to the Congress on the effectiveness of the provisions of \n     this Act, together with any additional proposed changes to \n     the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act the United States Olympic \n     Committee determines are appropriate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Short Summary of Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998\n\n\n                              title change\n\n       The bill would amend the title of the federal statute which \n     is the charter of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) \n     and national framework for amateur sports activities so that \n     it would be called the ``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act'' \n     (section 2(a) of the bill). The title of the bill, itself, is \n     the ``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998.''\n       The original federal law incorporating the USOC (Public Law \n     81-805) was enacted in 1950 and is presently known only as \n     the ``Act to incorporate the United States Olympic \n     Association.'' In 1964, not long after the USOC name was \n     changed from ``United States Olympic Association'' to \n     ``United States Olympic Committee,'' technical and conforming \n     changes were made to the 1950 Act through Public Law 88-407. \n     In 1978, the 1950 Act was substantially expanded and \n     rewritten into its present form through amendments made by \n     the landmark statute, the ``Amateur Sports Act of 1978.'' \n     Because the amendments made by the 1978 Act so greatly \n     changed and expanded the 1950 Act, the 1950 Act, as amended, \n     is now commonly referred to as the ``Amateur Sports Act,'' \n     though its title was never changed.\n       Section 2(a) of the bill would rename this original 1950 \n     law, as amended by the 1964 and 1978 changes, as the \n     ``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.'' The addition of the word \n     ``Olympic'' to the popularly used title ``Amateur Sports \n     Act'' is meant to take into account the participation of \n     professional and quasi-amateur athletes in some of the sports \n     of the Olympic Games and Pan-American Games, but at the same \n     time continue to reflect the unique role the USOC and \n     national governing bodies have in the national framework of \n     truly amateur sports activities. By giving the entire \n     underlying body of law a new title (replacing the simple \n     descriptive title of the original 1950 Act mentioned above), \n     the amendment would leave in place in federal statute the \n     title of the ``Amateur Sports Act of 1978'' for historic \n     reference.\n\n\n                     protection of athletes rights\n\n       Athletes' Advisory Council/Athlete Membership on USOC \n     Board--Section 5(a) of the bill would amend the Act to \n     require the creation of an Athletes' Advisory Council (AAC), \n     which is currently created as part of the USOC constitution \n     and bylaws and not recognized in the Act. Section 5(a) would \n     also amend the Act to require that at least 20 percent of the \n     membership and voting power of the USOC Board of Directors \n     and other USOC committees and entities be comprised of \n     athletes. This, too, is presently only required under the \n     USOC constitution and bylaws.\n       Ombudsman--Section 9(b) of the bill would require the USOC \n     to hire an ombudsman for athletes to provide free advice to \n     athletes about their rights under the Act and under \n     the constitution and bylaws of the USOC and their NGB, and \n     in particular, their rights in any dispute involving an \n     opportunity to compete. The USOC would hire and pay an \n     individual nominated by the AAC to serve as the ombudsman, \n     and could only fire or reduce the pay or administrative \n     expenses of the ombudsman with the consent of the AAC. \n     This restriction is intended to protect the objectivity \n     and autonomy of the ombudsman. The AAC would be expected \n     to consent to the termination of an ombudsman for conduct \n     which would lead to the termination of other USOC \n     employees. The USOC would be required hire another \n     ombudsman nominated by the AAC in the event of a vacancy.\n       Arbitration--Section 11(b)(1) of the bill would amend the \n     Act to clarify that NGB's must agree to arbitration using the \n     Commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in \n     disputes with athletes, but that these rules may be modified \n     by the Corporation, with the consent of the AAC. In addition, \n     section 11(b) would clarify that NGB's must agree to submit \n     to arbitration at the request of an amateur athlete \n     regardless of whether the USOC has demanded such arbitration. \n     It is anticipated that these amendments would precipitate a \n     review of the arbitration rules used for NGB/athlete \n     arbitrations under the Act, and that the USOC, AAC, and NGB \n     Council would reach agreement with respect to: (1) the relief \n     available under arbitration; (2) the point during a dispute \n     at which an athlete may obtain arbitration; and (3) the \n     standard of review to be used by arbitration panels.\n       Due Process/Fairness--Section 11(b)(2) of the bill would \n     amend the Act to clarify that the hearing required under the \n     Act before an NGB can declare an athlete ineligible to \n     participate must comport with basic concepts of fairness, due \n     process, and the presumption of innocence.\n       Athlete Membership on NGB Boards--Section 11(b)(3) of the \n     bill would amend the Act to allow NGBs individually to \n     establish the criteria and selection procedures for ``active \n     athletes'' in satisfying the existing statutory requirement \n     that 20 percent of NGB governing boards be comprised of \n     amateur athletes. However, the bill would require that both \n     the AAC and USOC approve the criteria and selection process \n     used by an NGB. In addition, the bill would change the Act to \n     require that only 20 percent of the voting power, rather than \n     20 percent of the voting power and membership, be held by \n     amateur athletes. These amendments are intended to provide \n     flexibility so that the different characteristics of NGB \n     boards and athletes in various sports can be taken into \n     account. The amendments would allow the amateur athlete \n     membership of some NGB boards to dip below 20 percent, but it \n     is expected that this would occur only where the \n     characteristics of the sport or of the governing board make \n     it very difficult to meet a 20 percent membership standard. \n     Under no circumstances would the voting power of amateur \n     athletes on the board of an NGB be allowed to be below 20 \n     percent. It is anticipated that further clarification may be \n     needed as to whether the 20 percent threshold will provide \n     adequate athlete voting power on existing NGBs which become \n     the NGB for a sport on the program of the Paralympic Games.\n       Distribution of Information--Section 12(a) of the bill \n     would make it a specific duty of NGBs to disseminate and \n     distribute in a timely manner to athletes, coaches and others \n     in the sport the rules--and any changes to the rules--of the \n     NGB, the USOC, the appropriate international \n     sports federation,\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n     the International Olympic Committee, the International \n     Paralympic Committee (as appropriate), and the Pan-\n     American Sports Organization.\n\n\n                             usoc authority\n\n       Jurisdiction--Section 4(e) of the bill would amend the Act \n     so that the USOC could be sued only in federal court for \n     issues pertaining solely to the Act. This amendment is not \n     intended to affect the existing law with respect to private \n     actions.\n       Trademark Protection--Section 6 of the bill would provide \n     the USOC with the same trademark protection for the \n     Paralympic Games, Pan-American Games and symbols and words \n     associated with those games as it presently has for the \n     Olympics. It would also give the USOC the exclusive power to \n     authorize the use of these names and symbols in order to \n     raise funds to carry out the Act.\n       Service of Process--Section 7 of the bill would require the \n     USOC have a designated agent in the State of Colorado to \n     receive service of process, rather than an agent in every \n     state. Requiring an agent in only one location is consistent \n     with the service requirements of many other patriotic \n     societies which are catalogued in title 36 of the United \n     States Code. As with these other entities, notice to or \n     service on the agent--or mailed to the business address of \n     the agent--would be considered notice to or service on the \n     USOC.\n       Report to Congress--Section 8 of the bill would require the \n     USOC to submit a formal report to Congress only once every \n     four years (instead of annually under the present Act) to \n     conform more closely with the four-year budget cycle of the \n     USOC and to reduce administrative burdens. The report would, \n     however, be required to include data on the participation of \n     women, disabled individuals and racial and ethnic minorities, \n     including a description of the steps that have been taken to \n     encourage increased participation by these groups of people \n     in amateur sports.\n       Injunction Immunity--Section 9(a) of the bill would prevent \n     a court from granting injunctive relief against the USOC in a \n     dispute involving the participation of an athlete within 30 \n     days of the beginning of the Olympics, the Paralympics, or \n     the Pan-American Games if the USOC has stated in writing to \n     the court that its constitution and bylaws cannot provide for \n     the resolution of the dispute before the beginning of the \n     games. The provision is intended to give the USOC the ability \n     to decide who will represent the United States in the rare \n     NGB/athlete dispute which may arise too close to Olympics, \n     Paralympics, or Pan-American Games to be resolved prior to \n     the beginning of those games. It would not take away any \n     other type of relief that may be available, or injunctive \n     relief for disputes which may be resolved under the \n     constitution and bylaws prior to the beginning of the \n     Olympics, Paralympics, or Pan-American Games.\n       Complete Teams--Section 10 of the bill would give the USOC \n     the authority to send an incomplete team for a sport if not \n     enough athletes have met the eligibility standards of at \n     least one of: the USOC, the NGB, the IOC, or the national \n     federation for the sport. The USOC could send a complete \n     team in that circumstance, but would not be required to \n     send a complete team. The bill (in section 11(b)(4)) would \n     specify, however, that NGB's cannot have eligibility \n     criteria for participation in the Olympics, Pan-American \n     Games or Paralympics which are more restrictive than the \n     criteria for the international sports federation for their \n     sport.\n       Flexibility for Paralympic NGBs--The bill (see summary of \n     the Paralympic provisions below and section 11(c) of the \n     bill) would give the USOC full flexibility to minimize the \n     potential burdens, financial or otherwise, of integrating the \n     Paralympics into the USOC framework.\n\n\n                       NATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES\n\n       NGB Selection Hearings--Section 11(a)(3) would require that \n     at least two public hearings be held (instead of one) prior \n     to the recognition of a new NGB.\n       Written Notice of NGB Hearings--Sections 11(a)(4) and \n     13(b)(3) would require the USOC to send written notice to \n     known amateur sports organizations in the sport at least 30 \n     days prior to an NGB selection hearings (including a hearing \n     on an application to replace an existing NGB) and to include \n     a copy of the application in the notice.\n       Participation Critera--Section 11(b)(4) of the bill would \n     prohibit NGBs from having eligibility criteria that is more \n     restrictive than its international sports federation for \n     participation in events at the Olympic Games, Paralympic \n     Games, and Pan-American Games. The amendment in part would \n     help provide balance with an amendment (see above) allowing \n     the USOC not to send a complete team under certain \n     circumstances.\n       NGB Notification--Section 14(a) of the bill would \n     specifically require the USOC to notify an NGB of the actions \n     the NGB must take to correct violations of the Act if the \n     USOC has placed an NGB on probation after a complaint has \n     been filed.\n\n\n                              PARALYMPICS\n\n       Recognition of Paralympic Games--The bill would make \n     amendments in a number of places in the Act to provide for \n     the recognition of the Paralympic Games. Under the \n     amendments, the USOC would have same duties as with the \n     Olympic Games to, among other things, ``either directly or \n     [by delegation to NGB]'': select athletes for U.S. teams, \n     represent the United States in relations with the \n     International Paralympic Committee, organize and finance U.S. \n     teams, as well as to provide equitable and fair dispute \n     resolution procedures for disabled athletes. In addition, the \n     USOC would be required: to allow Paralympic sports \n     organizations to join USOC; and to use and protect the \n     trademarks of Paralympics.\n       Disabled Amateur Athletes--Section 3(c) of the bill would \n     eliminate references in the bill to ``handicapped \n     individual'' and insert instead the term ``amateur athlete \n     with disabilities.'' The use of the new words would update \n     terminology and, more importantly, make clear that disabled \n     athletes are ``amateur athletes'' under the Act's existing \n     definition, provided that they meet the eligibility standards \n     of their NGB, as required by the existing definition of \n     ``amateur athlete''.\n       Paralympic NGBs--Section 11(c) of the bill would make it \n     the first priority of the USOC to merge sports on the program \n     of the Paralympic Games with existing able-bodied NGBs. Where \n     it is not feasible or in the best interest of a Paralympic \n     sport to put it under an able-bodied NGB, the USOC would be \n     allowed to recognize another amateur sports organization as a \n     new NGB for the Paralympic sport, except that the USOC would \n     be allowed to waive the requirements, duties, and powers of \n     the NGB as necessary to meet the objects and purposes of the \n     Act. In addition, a Paralympic NGB could govern more than one \n     sport on the program of the Paralympic Games with the \n     approval of the USOC. By giving the USOC the authority to \n     waive normal NGB requirements, the bill is intended to allow \n     a smooth transition as Paralympic sports become integrated \n     under the USOC umbrella, and to allow the USOC to prevent any \n     severe financial impacts on existing NGBs. The provisions in \n     the bill are largely consistent with the general direction \n     the USOC has taken already with respect to Paralympics.\n       World Games for the Deaf--It has been suggested that both \n     the bill and the Committee report which eventually \n     accompanies the bill include language in support of the World \n     Games for Deaf and of deaf athletes. It is anticipated that \n     this issue will be addressed by consensus before the bill \n     becomes enacted.\n\n\n                         Restricted Competition\n\n       The bill does not amend section 206 of the Act, which \n     addresses the jurisdiction of amateur sports organizations \n     over competitions restricted to certain classes of athletes \n     (such as high school students, college students, etc.). A \n     number of concerns were raised and discussed during the \n     Commerce Committee hearings about section 206, and it has \n     been suggested that the Committee report which eventually \n     accompanies the bill should discuss these concerns.\n\n\n                       Special Report to Congress\n\n       Section 15 of the bill would require the USOC to report to \n     Congress after five years on the effectiveness of the new \n     provisions added to the Act by the bill, as well as any \n     additional suggested changes to the Act that the USOC \n     believes are needed. The report would provide an occasion for \n     Congress to review the implementation of the amendments and \n     any modifications proposed by the USOC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 2120. A bill to improve the ability of Federal agencies to license \nfederally--owned inventions; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n           TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER COMMERCIALIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, today with my colleague Senator \nFrist, I introduce the Technology Transfer Act of 1998. This bill would \nmake technical changes and clarifications to the legislation which \ngoverns the transfer of intellectual property from the federal \ngovernment to the private sector.\n  The original Technology Transfer Improvements Act (TTIA), which I was \nauthor of in 1995, allowed for easier and quicker access to \nintellectual property which the government owns and private industry \nwants. It created a win-win situation. The government gets royalties \nfrom these licenses, private industry gets the intellectual property \nthat it needs, and Americans get jobs from the production of inventions \nbased on this intellectual property.\n  This bill builds on the strong positive response from TTIA. It \nreduces the requirements for obtaining a non-exclusive license in order \nto allow as many companies and individuals as possible access to the \ninformation. It also addresses private industry's concerns about \nmaintaining confidential information within applications.\n  However, this does not come at the expense of the government being \nable to keep control of its property. This bill also clarifies the \nability of the licensing agencies to terminate a license if certain \ncriteria are not met. Furthermore, it allows the government to \nconsolidate intellectual property which is developed in cooperation \nwith a private entity so that the package can be relicensed to a third \nparty.\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\n  Technology transfer is a vital part of our national economy. It is \nwhat allows our industries to remain at the leading edge in their \nfield. This bill clarifies and adjusts current legislation to allow for \nan even better working relationship between the federal government and \nprivate industry. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Technology Transfer \n     Commercialization Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.\n\n       Section 12(b)(1) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology \n     Innovation Act of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a(b)(1)) is amended by \n     inserting ``or, subject to section 209 of title 35, United \n     States Code, may grant a license to an invention which is \n     Federally owned, made before the signing of the agreement, \n     and directly related to the scope of the work under the \n     agreement,'' after ``under the agreement,''.\n\n     SEC. 3. LICENSING FEDERALLY--OWNED INVENTIONS.\n\n       (a) Amendment.--Section 209 of title 35, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 209.

TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO BAYH-DOLE ACT.\n\n       Chapter 18 of title 35, United States Code (popularly known \n     as the ``Bayh-Dole Act''), is amended--\n       (1) by amending section 202(e) to read as follows:\n       ``(e) In any case when a Federal employee is a co-inventor \n     of any invention made under a funding agreement with a \n     nonprofit organization or small business firm, the Federal \n     agency employing such coinventor may, for the purpose of \n     consolidating rights in the invention----\n       ``(1) license or assign whatever rights it may acquire in \n     the subject invention to the nonprofit organization or small \n     business firm; or\n       ``(2) acquire any rights in the subject invention from the \n     nonprofit organization or small business firm, but only to \n     the extent the party from whom the rights are acquired \n     voluntarily enters into the transaction.''; and\n       (2) in section 207(a)--\n       (A) by striking ``patent applications, patents, or other \n     forms of protection obtained'' and inserting ``inventions'' \n     in paragraph (2); and\n       (B) by inserting ``, including acquiring rights for the \n     Federal Government in any invention, but only to the extent \n     the party from whom the rights are acquired voluntarily \n     enters into the transaction, to facilitate the licensing of a \n     federally-owned invention'' after ``or through contract'' in \n     paragraph (3).\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to encourage the development of more cost effective \ncommercial space launch industry in the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                space launch cost reduction act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to rise to \nintroduce a piece of legislation, which I will send to the desk. It is \ncalled the Space Launch Cost Reduction Act of 1998.\n  The commercial space launch industry is an essential part of the U.S. \neconomy and opportunities for U.S. companies are growing as \ninternational markets expand. United States trading partners have been \nable to aggressively lower their commercial space launch prices either \nthrough direct cash payments for commercially targeted product \ndevelopment or with indirect benefits derived from nonmarket economy \nstatus. Because United States incentives for launch vehicle development \nhave historically focused on civil and military rather than commercial \nuse, and as a result U.S. launch costs have remained relatively high, \nthe U.S. share of the world commercial market has decreased from nearly \n100% twenty years ago to approximately 40% in 1998. This is very \nserious erosion.\n  The key to regaining United States leadership in the world market is \nnot another massive government program, but rather provision of just \nenough government support to enable the more cost effective private \nsector to build lower-cost space launch vehicles. Private sector \ncompanies across the United States are already attempting to develop a \nvariety of lower-cost space launch vehicles, but lack of sufficient \nprivate financing has proven a major obstacle, an obstacle our trading \npartners have chosen to remove by providing direct access to government \nfunding. Given the unique strength of private industry in the United \nStates, a more effective alternative to the approach of our trading \npartners is for the U.S. government to provide limited financial \nincentives in the form of loan guarantees, which would help qualifying \nprivate-sector companies secure otherwise unattainable private \nfinancing, while at the same time keeping government involvement at an \nabsolute minimum.\n  The purpose of the Space Launch Cost Reduction Act of 1998 is, \ntherefore, to ensure availability of otherwise unattainable private \nsector financing for private sector development of commercial space \nlaunch vehicles with launch costs significantly below current levels. \nAs a result, it will be possible to: increase the international \ncompetitiveness of the United States space industry, encourage the \ngrowth of space-related commerce in the United States and \ninternationally, increase the number of high-value jobs in United \nStates space-related industries, and reduce United States Government \nspace launch expenditures.\n  Commercialization of space is an issue of importance not only to our \nnation as a whole but also to the state of Louisiana. Louisiana is \nalready an active participant in the American space effort. For \nexample, the Michoud Facility in New Orleans has been selected as the \nfabrication center for the experimental X-33 space vehicle's liquid \noxygen tanks. The fuel tanks for the Space Shuttle are also built at \nMichoud, and Shuttle engines are tested at the Stennis Space Center in \nneighboring Mississippi. Furthermore, NASA has entered a partnership \nwith the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette to establish \na Regional Application Center for commercial remote sensing technology. \nLooking toward the future, Louisiana is clearly well positioned to \nparticipate actively in the commercialization of space and to benefit \nfrom the Space Launch Cost Reduction Act of 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2122. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat certain liquidating distributions of a regulated investment \ncompany or real estate investment trust which are allowable as a \ndeduction shall be included in the gross income of a distributee; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in coordination with the Treasury \nDepartment, Senator Moynihan and I are introducing a bill today to \neliminate an unwarranted tax benefit which involves the liquidation of \na Regulated Investment Company (``RIC'') or Real Estate Investment \nTrust (``REIT''), where at least 80 percent of the liquidating RIC or \nREIT is owned by a single corporation. Identical legislation is being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Archer.\n  The RIC and REIT rules allow individual shareholders to invest in \nstock and securities (in the case of RICs) and real estate assets (in \nthe case of REITs) with a single level of tax. The single level of tax \nis achieved by allowing RICs and REITs to deduct the dividends they pay \nto their shareholders.\n  Some corporations, however, have attempted to use the ``dividends \npaid deduction'' in combination with a separate rule that allows a \ncorporate parent to receive property from an 80 percent subsidiary \nwithout tax when the subsidiary is liquidating. Taxpayers argue that \nthe combination of these two rules permits income deducted by the RIC \nor REIT and paid to the parent corporation to be entirely tax-free \nduring the period of liquidation of the RIC or REIT (which can extend \nover a period of years). The legislation is intended to eliminate this \nabusive application of these rules by requiring that amounts which are \ndeductible dividends to the RIC or REIT are consistently treated as \ndividends by the corporate parent.\n  RICs and REITs are important investment vehicles, particularly for \nsmall investors. The RIC and REIT rules are designed to encourage \ninvestors to pool their resources and achieve the type of investment \nopportunities, subject to a single level of tax, that would otherwise \nbe available only to a larger investor. This legislation will not \naffect the intended beneficiaries of the RIC and REIT rules.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na technical explanation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DEDUCTIBLE LIQUIDATING \n                   DISTRIBUTIONS OF REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES \n                   AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 332 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to complete liquidations of subsidiaries) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Deductible Liquidating Distributions of Regulated \n     Investment Companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts.--If a \n     corporation receives a distribution from a regulated \n     investment company or a real estate investment trust which is \n     considered under subsection (b) as being in complete \n     liquidation of such company or trust, then, notwithstanding \n     any other provision of this chapter, such corporation shall \n     recognize and treat as a dividend from such company or trust \n     an amount equal to the deduction for dividends paid allowable \n     to such company or trust by reason of such distribution.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) The material preceding paragraph (1) of section 332(b) \n     of such Code is amended by striking ``subsection (a)'' and \n     inserting ``this section''.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) of section 334(b) of such Code is amended \n     by striking ``section 332(a)'' and inserting ``section 332''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions after May 21, 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n\n                         Technical Explanation\n\n       The bill provides that any amount which a liquidating RIC \n     or REIT may take as a deduction for dividends paid with \n     respect to an otherwise tax-free distribution to an 80-\n     percent corporate owner is includible in the income of the \n     recipient corporation. The includible amount is treated as a \n     dividend received from the RIC or REIT. The liquidating \n     corporation may designate the amount treated as a dividend as \n     a capital gain dividend or, in the case of a RIC, an exempt \n     interest dividend or a dividend eligible for the\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\n     70-percent dividends received deduction, to the extent \n     provided by the RIC or REIT provisions of the Code.\n       The bill does not otherwise change the tax treatment of the \n     distribution under sections 332 or 337. Thus, for example, \n     the liquidating corporation will not recognize gain (if any) \n     on the liquidating distribution and the recipient corporation \n     will hold the assets at a carryover basis.\n       The bill is effective for distributions on or after May 22, \n     1998, regardless of when the plan of liquidation was adopted.\n       No inference is intended regarding the treatment of such \n     transactions under present law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 2125. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the tax treatment of section 42 housing cooperatives and the \nshareholders of such cooperatives, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               low-income housing tax credit legislation\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nwill create a new homeownership opportunity with a proven method of \nbuilding affordable housing. Current low-income housing production in \nthe United States is driven largely by the low-income housing tax \ncredit. The credit supports the development of 94 percent of all \nfederally assisted multi-family affordable housing construction. Under \ncurrent law, however, only rental housing can be developed with the \ncredit. Everyone would agree that building homeownership is better than \nsimply building homes for people. Homeowners are invested in their \ncommunities, take pride in their property, and will do what it takes to \npreserve the security and appearance of their homes.\n  The legislation that I propose today will enable housing cooperatives \nand mutual housing associations to be developed with the credit. With \nthese types of multi-family homeownership, tax credit investors can \nbecome non-resident shareholders of the developed property while \nallowing the residents to own their share of the property as well. From \nthe very start, the residents will have a real ownership stake and \ncontrol over their homes.\n  A study undertaken by Abt Associates, Inc., commissioned by the \nNational Cooperative Bank found that this legislation could result in \nthe annual production of 1,600 units of low-income housing within five \nyears of enactment. That means as many as 15,000 renters could be \nhomeowners within five years.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nlegislation to help bring the American dream of homeownership to many \nmore Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nbill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \ncommemorate 100 years of relations between the people of the United \nStates and the people of the Philippines. It is especially fitting for \nCongress to recognize our special relationship with the Philippines \nbecause this year is also the centennial of Philippine independence \nfrom Spain. Senators Helms, Biden, Thomas, Inouye, Roth, Lugar, Boxer, \nCochran, Coverdale, and Murray have joined me in submitting the \nresolution.\n  Our country's friendship with the Philippines began in 1898, a year \nwhich also marked a growing U.S. interest in the Pacific region. Over \nthe years, the Philippines has modeled its governmental institutions \nafter the United States and has demonstrated a growing commitment to \ndemocracy, human rights, and a free market economy.\n  Until the end of the Cold War, the United States maintained major \nmilitary facilities in the Philippines, which played a significant role \nin preserving regional peace and stability. The United States has \nimportant strategic, economic, and political interests in Southeast \nAsia and regional stability remains an overriding U.S. concern. To this \nend, Filipino soldiers have stood shoulder to shoulder with American \ntroops on the battlefields of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam to \nprotect and advance mutual interest. Today, the Philippines remains an \nimportant partner in guarding the peace and maintaining stability in \nSoutheast Asia.\n  In the twelve years since the peaceful ``people power'' revolution \nrestored democracy to the Philippines, President Aquino and Ramos \nestablished a democratic government and instituted market-based reforms \nwhich placed the Philippines--politically and economically--on a strong \nfoundation for the 21st century. Economic growth exceeded 6 percent \nlast year and is forecast to grow at 3 percent in 1998.\n  In many ways the Philippines has emerged as a model for her Asian \nneighbors. Political stability and democratic institutions were \nstrengthened by free market and trade reforms. In turn, deregulation, \nlower tariffs and government debt, financial transparency, and respect \nfor the rule of law provide a healthy economic foundation for the \nPhilippine's future.\n  It was not long ago that the Philippine economy was far behind the \neconomic tigers of Asia. The Filipino people's love of democracy and \npolitical vitality were blamed in large part for this circumstance. \nCritics cited the absence of so-called ``Asian values'' in the \nPhilippines, namely a willingness to make democracy secondary to \nprosperity and order. History has proven these commentators wrong, and \ntoday the Filipino model inspires advocates of democracy throughout \nAsia. Stability relies upon democracy and prudent economic policies.\n  Last month when President Clinton and President Ramos met at the \nWhite House they reaffirmed the friendship between our nations. The \nleaders promised to continue close cooperation in responding to the \nAsian financial situation and conducted a frank discussion on bilateral \nissues, including remediation efforts at the former Subic and Clark \nbases and benefit parity for Filipino-American veterans.\n  During this special year in which we observe the centennial of our \nrelationship with the Philippines and the centennial of their \nindependence, we have much to celebrate. First, we recognize the \nvaluable contributions of Filipino-Americans to our nation. Filipino \nAmericans helped to build and create the modern Hawaiian economy and \nhave contributed greatly to the cultural diversity that is celebrated \nin my state. My good friend, Governor Ben Cayetano, is the first \nFilipino-American governor in the United States. In addition, we \nreflect on our close friendship and cooperation with the Philippines in \ntimes of war and peace.

Res. 236\n\n       Whereas English is the most widely used language in the \n     areas of finance, trade, technology, diplomacy, and \n     entertainment, and is the living library of the last 100 \n     years of scientific and technological advance;\n       Whereas there are more speakers of English as a second \n     language in the world than there are native English speakers, \n     and the large number of English language schools around the \n     world demonstrates that English is as close as any language \n     has been to becoming the world's common language;\n       Whereas English is the common language of the United \n     States, is important to American life and individual success, \n     and 94 percent of United States residents speak English \n     according to the 1990 decennial census;\n       Whereas immigrants to the United States have powerful \n     incentives to learn English in order to fully participate in \n     American society and the Nation's economy, and 90 percent of \n     all immigrant families become fluent in English within the \n     second generation;\n       Whereas a common language promotes unity among citizens, \n     and fosters greater communication;\n       Whereas there is a renaissance in cultural assertiveness \n     around the world, noting that the more interdependent nations \n     become economically, the more interested the nations are in \n     preserving and sharing cultural identity;\n       Whereas the reality of a global economy is an ever-present \n     international development that is fostered by international \n     trade and\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\n     the creation of regional trading blocs, such as the European \n     Union, Mercosur, the North American Free Trade Agreement and \n     the Association of Southeast Asian Nations;\n       Whereas knowledge of English, Spanish, French, Italian, \n     German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, African \n     languages, Farsi, sign language, and the many other languages \n     of the world, enhances competitiveness and tremendous growth \n     in world trade;\n       Whereas the United States is well postured for the global \n     economy and international development with the United States' \n     diverse population and rich heritage of languages from all \n     around the world;\n       Whereas many American Indian languages are indigenous to \n     the United States, and should be preserved, encouraged, and \n     utilized, as the languages were used during World War II when \n     the Navajo Code Talkers created a code that could not be \n     broken by the Japanese or the Germans;\n       Whereas Spanish exploration in the New World began in 1512 \n     when Ponce de Leon explored the Florida peninsula, and \n     included the expeditions of Francisco Coronado throughout \n     California to Kansas and across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, \n     and Oklahoma from 1540 to 1542;\n       Whereas the Nation will commemorate the 400th anniversary \n     of the first Spanish Settlement of the Southwest (Ohkay Yunge \n     at San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico) with official visits from \n     Spain, parades, fiestas, masses, and other celebrations to \n     emphasize the importance of the first encounters with \n     American Indian cultures and the subsequent importance of \n     encounters with other European cultures;\n       Whereas Hispanic culture, customs, and the Spanish language \n     are a vital source of familial and individual strength;\n       Whereas the Bureau of the Census estimates that 1 in 5 \n     Americans will be of Hispanic descent by the year 2030, and \n     the future cultural, political, and economic strengths of \n     this country are clearly dependent upon our Nation's ability \n     to harness the talents and skills of this large and growing \n     segment of the American population;\n       Whereas it is clearly in the interest of the United States \n     to encourage educational opportunity for and the human \n     potential of all citizens, and to take steps to realize the \n     opportunity and potential;\n       Whereas a skilled labor force is crucial to the \n     competitiveness of the Nation in today's global economy, \n     foreign language skills are a tremendous resource to the \n     United States, and such foreign language skill enhances \n     American competitiveness in global markets by permitting \n     improved communication and understanding;\n       Whereas one of the common bonds of Hispanic people is the \n     Spanish language, and promoting the use of Spanish at home \n     and in cultural affairs will benefit not only the growing \n     Hispanic population of the United States but also the \n     economic interests of the entire Nation; and\n       Whereas knowledge of other languages and other cultures is \n     known to enhance the United States diplomatic efforts by \n     fostering greater communication and understanding between \n     nations, and can promote greater understanding between \n     different ethnic and racial groups within the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Government should pursue \n     policies that--\n       (1) support and encourage Americans to master the English \n     language plus other languages of the world;\n       (2) recognize the importance of English as the unifying \n     language of the United States, and the importance of English \n     fluency for individuals who want to succeed in American \n     society;\n       (3) recognize that command of the English language is a \n     critical component of the success and productivity of our \n     Nation's children, and should be encouraged at every age;\n       (4) recognize that a skilled labor force is crucial to \n     United States competitiveness in a global economy, and the \n     ability to speak 1 or more languages in addition to English \n     is a significant skill;\n       (5) recognize that knowledge of Spanish, in particular, is \n     vital for building future cultural and economic bridges to \n     Latin America;\n       (6) support literacy programs, including programs designed \n     to teach English, as well as those dedicated to helping \n     Americans learn and maintain other languages in addition to \n     English; and\n       (7) develop our Nation's linguistic resources by \n     encouraging citizens of the United States to learn and \n     maintain Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, \n     Korean, Vietnamese, Farsi, African languages, sign language, \n     and the many other languages of the world, in addition to \n     English.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am proud to be joined by \nSenators McCain, Hatch, DeWine, Chafee, Lugar, Hagel, Grassley, and \nAbraham in submitting a Senate Resolution entitled ``English-Plus.'' By \nthis, we simply mean to reaffirm the importance of mastering the \nEnglish language plus other languages of the world, such as Spanish, \nItalian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and many, many more.\n  As English becomes the world language of finance, trade, technology, \ndiplomacy, and entertainment, the reality of international markets and \ninternational learning require a greater sensitivity to local \nlanguages. In our hemisphere, Spanish is clearly a dominant language.\n  In my home state of New Mexico, 37 percent of the people are Spanish-\nAmericans or Mexican-Americans. These days, the term ``Hispanic \nAmericans'' is used to include Americans whose roots are in Spain, \nMexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central America, and South America. As U.S. \nNews reported in the May 11, 1998, issue, ``the label Hispanic obscures \nthe enormous diversity among people who come (or whose forebears came) \nfrom two dozen countries and whose ancestry ranges from pure Spanish to \nmixtures of Spanish blood with Native American, African, German, and \nItalian, to name a few hybrids.''\n  U.S. News also reported in the same issue that ``The number of \nHispanics is increasing almost four times as fast as the rest of the \npopulation, and they are expected to surpass African-Americans as the \nlargest minority group by 2005.'' In the October 21, 1996, issue, U.S. \nNews reported that ``Nearly 28 million people--1 American in 10--\nconsider themselves of Hispanic origin.'' This 1996 estimate was based \non 1994 Census data. Current estimates are that there are 29 million \nHispanics in America, or 1 in 9 Americans. By 2050 projections are that \n1 in every 4 Americans will be Hispanic.\n  As our world economy barges into the next century, it has become \nclear the ``domestic-only market planning'' has been replaced by the \nera of international trade agreements and the creation of regional \ntrading blocs. In 1996, the total volume of trade with Mexico was \nestimated at $130 billion. Our trade with the rest of Latin America \nthat same year was $101 billion.\n  Spanish is clearly a growing cultural and economic force in our \nhemisphere. It is also the common language of hundreds of millions of \npeople. New Mexico is the only state that requires the use of both \nEnglish and Spanish on every election ballot.\n  As the son of an Italian immigrant, I can personally testify to the \nimportance of English Plus. My father did not read or write in English, \nyet he insisted that I learn English and do my best at some Italian. My \nparents both spoke Spanish--a skill which they found very useful in \nestablishing a wholesale grocery business in Albuquerque.\n  Tens of thousands of New Mexico families still speak Spanish at home. \nSpanish remains a strong tie to their culture, music, history, and \nfolklore. After decades of being taught to learn English first, most \nNew Mexico Hispanic families also know English very well.\n  It is ironic that recent economic trends of this decade show Latin \nAmerica as the most promising future market for American goods and \nservices. An article in The Economist of April 21, 1998, stresses the \nvalue of the Spanish language to America's fastest growing minority \ngroup.\n  ``America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful \nresources.'' The Economist, however, also goes on to note that, ``The \nSpanish language, which is their glory, also consigns too many of them \nto jobs not far removed from indentured slavery.''\n  ``Although they often meet discrimination, they have little taste for \nthe politics of quotas or compensation. And although they have always \nsupported `affirmative action' programmes, they now loathe bilingual \neducation, the programme most specifically devised to give them a leg-\nup into American life.''\n  ``Even poor Latinos retain a sturdy distrust of government preferring \nto rely on their families. Relatively few Latinos are on welfare; most \nbelieve that a man ought to help himself first by his own efforts.''\n  It is no longer accurate to say that we are perched to enter a global \neconomy--rather, we are well into it. With Latin America as the next \ngreat market partner of the United States, those Americans who know \nboth English and Spanish will have many new grand opportunities. \nMexico's recent hiring and celebration of its one-millionth maquiladora \nworker in international manufacturing plants mostly along our border, \nthe value of knowing two languages to function with the hundreds\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\nof Fortune 500 companies now manufacturing in Mexico is unquestioned.\n  Mr. President, I have long believed that New Mexico and other border \nstates are uniquely poised to create the focal point of North American \ntrade with South America. I agree with The Economist observation that \n``America's Latinos are rapidly becoming one of its most useful \nresources.'' I predict that English Plus Spanish will be one of the \nmajor marketable skills for the next century.\n  In conclusion, I would like my colleagues to see the shallowness of \nthought behind the idea that ``English Only'' should be the wave of the \nfuture. If we want to miss our best potential markets in Mexico, \nCentral America, and South America, then ``English Only'' should be our \nintent. If we want to become a more powerful cultural and economic \nAmerican force in the world--including both North and South America \ninto the meaning of ``America''--then we should adopt ``English Plus'' \nas approach.\n  As stated in our resolution, ``English Plus'' includes many if not \nall of the languages of the world. No one disputes the importance of \nEnglish as the leading language of science, technology, the internet, \nfinance, and diplomacy. By acknowledging our heightened abilities \nthrough the addition of other languages to our national strengths, the \nUnited States will benefit greatly by expanding its cultural life and \neconomic potential through the application of the notion of ``English \nPlus'' other languages of the world.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my several of my \ncolleagues from the Hispanic Task Force to submit a Resolution on \nEnglish-Plus. This resolution is intended to express the importance of \nthe English language in our society, PLUS the importance of knowing, \nunderstanding and speaking other languages in addition to English.\n  As a member of the Hispanic Task Force, I have been working closely \nwith my colleagues, Senators Domenici and Hatch, in developing this \nresolution. Many of our colleagues may be curious to know what we mean \nwhen we say ``English Plus.'' ``English-Plus'' reflects our firm belief \nthat all members of our society need to recognized and understand the \nimportance of being fluent in English, Plus one or more additional \nlanguages.\n  Everyone agrees that all Americans must be fluent in English in order \nto succeed in today's society. Not only is English the common language \nof our nation, it is also the most popular and widely used language \ninternationally in the areas of finance, trade, technology, diplomacy \nand entertainment. This is why it is critical that we continue \nencouraging all members of our society to be fluent in the English \nlanguage.\n  However, I believe it is equally important for each of us to \nencourage all members of our society to study and develop an \nunderstanding of, if not a fluency, in one or more languages in \naddition to English. Individuals who have the capability to communicate \nin multiple languages have access to a wealth of opportunities \neconomically, socially, professionally and personally.\n  Encouraging our citizens to be bilingual or multilingual serves as a \ntremendous resource to the United States, because it enhances our \ncompetitiveness in global markets by enabling communication and cross-\ncultural understanding while trading and conducting international \nbusiness. In addition, multilingualism enhances our nation's diplomatic \nefforts and leadership role on the international front by fostering \ngreater communication and understanding between nations and their \npeople.\n  Foreign language skills also serve as a powerful tool for promoting \ngreater cross-cultural understanding between the multitude of racial \nand ethnic groups in our country. One in five Americans will be of \nHispanic descent by the year 2030. According to the 1990 Census, \nSpanish is the second most widely used language in the world. It is my \nfirm belief that developing a greater knowledge of the Spanish language \nwill benefit the economic and cultural interests of our entire country. \nBeing proficient or fluent in languages besides English, combined with \nan understanding of various cultures, will significantly enhance \ncommunication and understanding between the various racial and ethnic \ngroups in our country.\n  This resolution highlights the importance of implementing policies in \nour country which support and encourage all Americans to master \nEnglish, plus one or more other languages of the world. It is critical \nthat we continue supporting policies and programs which stress the \nimportance of English but we should also encourage all Americans to \nstudy, learn and familiarize themselves with the languages of many \nother cultures.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution, which sends a clear \nmessage to our citizens and the people of the world that Americans are \ncommitted to encouraging proficiency in English as well as other \ninternational languages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5457-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5459-S5460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 237--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                 SITUATION IN INDONESIA AND EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past few days, the world \nhas watched in disbelief as Indonesia has unraveled. Barely two days \nago, in response to mounting domestic and international pressure, \nPresident Suharto, Indonesia's authoritarian ruler for 32 years, \nannounced his resignation. For the moment, power has been transferred \nto Suharto's longtime confidant, the former Minister of Research and \nTechnology, Vice President, B.J. Habibie.\n  Mr. President, it is too soon to tell whether this transition will \nsatisfy the demands of the students and other Indonesians who have been \nprotesting Suharto's rule for the past three months. To be honest, I \ndoubt it. These students want real political reform, and I believe all \nof Indonesia's people deserve such reform.\n  I hope Indonesia's new leadership will exercise restraint during this \nperiod of\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\ntransition, and will use the present circumstances to enact policies \nthat appropriately address the needs of all Indonesians.\n  At the same time, I think these circumstances present a unique \nopportunity to deal with one of Indonesia's most vexing problems, and \none that I have been actively engaged in since before I joined the \nSenate--the question of the political status of East Timor.\n  Mr. President, today my colleague from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] and I \nare submitting a resolution encouraging a solution to the political \nstatus of East Timor. This resolution is similar to H. Con. Res. 258, \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Nita Lowey and \nothers.\n  This resolution says simply: the United States should support an \ninternationally supervised self-determination referendum in East Timor.\n  Indonesia has sustained a brutal military occupation of East Timor \nfor more than 20 years, and thousands of East Timorese have lost their \nlives as a result. Human rights organizations from around the world, as \nwell as our own State Department, continue to report substantial human \nrights violations by the Indonesian military--including arbitrary \narrest and detention, curbs on freedom of expression and association, \nand the use of torture and summary killings of civilians.\n  Immediately after the Indonesian occupation of East Timor in 1975, \nand again in 1976, the United Nations Security Council called for \nIndonesia to withdraw from the region and called for the recognition of \nEast Timorese self-determination. From 1976 to 1982, the U.N. General \nAssembly adopted eight separate resolutions calling for the withdrawal \nof Indonesian armed forces from the territory. In the past few years, \nseveral nations, including the European Union and the Australian \nSenate, have delivered strong statements condemning the actions of the \nIndonesian government in East Timor and calling for a process of self-\ndetermination.\n  As you know, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, co-winner with Jose Ramos \nHorta of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, has long called for the self-\ndetermination of his people and reiterated his plea for a self-\ndetermination referendum immediately after receiving news of his Nobel \nprize.\n  Even President Clinton, who has not engaged on this issue in the \npast, expressed interest in the idea of a United Nations-sponsored \nself-determination referendum in a December 1996 letter to me.\n  Mr. President, as we know, although the larger political crisis in \nIndonesia has been brewing for sometime now, events of recent days have \ntaken on a surreal intensity. Since the early part of this year, there \nhad been relatively peaceful protests taking place largely in Jakarta, \nthe capital. For the most part, these demonstrations were led by \nstudents and confined to university campuses. But while the protests \nwere triggered in response to the economic turmoil caused by the larger \nfinancial crisis in Asia, they quickly gave voice to political dissent \nof a sort not seen in Indonesia for decades. As the students slowly \nrealized they had a political voice, they began to speak out more \nforcefully, and the demonstrations increased--moving out to more cities \nand spilling off of the campuses.\n  Now, the situation has become dangerous, fatal for some, as \nwidespread riots and looting have spread across Jakarta and elsewhere. \nThe economy is nearing a standstill and the military is beginning to \nshow signs of stress and fracture. Reports of the dead and injured \ncontinue to grow. Hundreds of people have been arrested.\n  And of course no one really knows what to expect during the unfolding \npolitical drama of Indonesia.\n  This crisis clearly has affected all of Indonesia and will have \nserious implications for the country's future, but I am particularly \nconcerned about the impact of these recent events on East Timor.\n\n  As my colleagues well know, I have been monitoring the situation in \nEast Timor for more than six years. What particularly worries me now, \ngiven this larger political crisis, are reports of increasing numbers \nof troops in some of East Timor's major cities. This is extremely \ndestabilizing, coming on the heels of a dire humanitarian situation on \nthat captive island because of poor access to food.\n  The resolution Senator Reed and I are submitting today is important \nat this time because it is clear that whatever happens in Jakarta over \nthe next weeks and months will no doubt have profound implications for \npolitical and military development in East Timor. The great irony of \nthe latest crisis in Indonesia is that it may actually present us with \nan opportunity once and for all to help the people of East Timor \nexercise their right to self-determination. Habibie, or any other \nleader that succeeds him--through legitimate means or by brutal coup--\nwill have to reevaluate Indonesia's relationship with East Timor. It is \nmy sincere hope that any successor will recognize that Indonesia's \nbrutal occupation of the territory is entirely unsustainable and will \nlook to the natural solution of a self-determination referendum to help \ndetermine East Timor's political status.\n  Mr. President, the East Timorese deserve the support of people of \nconscience all over the world, and the United States should use it \nworld leadership position on their behalf. The United States should \nbegin immediately to encourage the process of self-determination in \nboth Indonesia and in East Timor.\n  It is long overdue.\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, submitting this resolution which \naddresses the unfolding events in Indonesia.\n  On Thursday, President Suharto resigned his position after leading \nIndonesia for thirty-two years. His action was a response to civil \nunrest and economic turmoil which reached a crescendo in the past few \nweeks. President Suharto is to be commended for heeding the call of the \nIndonesian people for change, for avoiding further bloodshed, and for \npermitting a change of leadership in accordance with the constitutional \nprocesses of Indonesia.\n  Now, it is time for change. The people of Indonesia and the world \nhave called for it. The United States should do everything in its power \nto encourage and support the new political leadership of Indonesia to \nimplement reforms.\n  Most importantly, we are on the threshold of the chance to resolve \nthe question of East Timor. In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor. For \nover two decades that land has been wracked by fear, suppression, \ntorture and death. Approximately one third of the population has been \nkilled. The United Nations has called again and again for a just, \ncomprehensive and internationally acceptable solution in East Timor, \nbut to no avail.\n  Mr. President, we must seize this opportunity. The oppression of East \nTimor must end. The people of East Timor have a right to self-\ndetermination. They, and the people of Indonesia, deserve to live \nsecurely in economic, political and physical freedom.\n  Against overwhelming odds, the people of Indonesia and East Timor \nhave bravely fought for their rights and caused a powerful leader to \nresign. The United States if obligated to support them and encourage \nthe new leadership of Indonesia to institute genuine democratic and \neconomic reforms, promote and protect the human rights of the citizens, \nand respect the right of the people of East Timor to self-\ndetermination. I join Senator Feingold in urging the Senate to adopt \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5459-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5460-S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            IRAN MISSILE PROLIFERATION SANCTIONS ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LEVIN AMENDMENT NO. 2444\n\n  Mr. LEVIN proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 2709) to impose \ncertain sanctions on foreign persons who transfer items contributing to \nIran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 2, beginning on line 15, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n       On page 6, beginning on line 24, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5460-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5460-S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            IRAN MISSILE PROLIFERATION SANCTIONS ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LEVIN AMENDMENT NO. 2444\n\n  Mr. LEVIN proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 2709) to impose \ncertain sanctions on foreign persons who transfer items contributing to \nIran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 2, beginning on line 15, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n       On page 6, beginning on line 24, strike out ``August 8, \n     1995--'', and insert in lieu thereof ``January 22, 1998--''.\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5460-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       INHOFE AMENDMENT NO. 2445\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. INHOFE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 2057) to authorize appropriations for the fiscal year 1999 \nfor military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 347, below line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2833.

Mr. President, on Saturday, April 18, 1998, an \narticle ran in the Rochester Post Bulletin in Rochester, MN that \nillustrates very well the tremendous child care challenges facing \nfamilies. This is a story about a child with disabilities and her \nparents who are having increasing problems finding quality child care. \nMr. President, I will ask that this article be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, at the age of six months, this young child--Christina \nBarth--developed infantile spasms or epilepsy. Christina is not alone. \nMore than two million Americans have some form of epilepsy. More than \none fourth of them are children under the age of 18.\n  Upon her diagnosis, Christina was treated with many different types \nof medication. Unfortunately, none of the treatments worked \nsuccessfully. Then, at the age of three, Christina underwent a partial \nlobotomy on the right side of her brain. The surgery successfully \ntreated her disease for almost two years. But then, the symptoms \ndeveloped on the left side of her brain. Since that time, Christina has \nlived with epilepsy.\n  Now Christina is 11 years old. She attends a special education class \nat Gage Elementary School. She functions on the cognitive level of an \n18-month-old child. Her family hopes and prays that a cure for epilepsy \nwill be found someday.\n  Like most other families with special needs children, Christina's \nparents face daily challenges in caring for their child. Identifying \nhigh quality child care is among the most difficult challenges her \nparents face.\n  Finding a child care provider--whether it be a commercial day care \ncenter or an in-home care giver--is becoming more and more difficult. \nThis point was made by a witness who recently testified before the \nFinance Committee about the challenges of finding child care for a \nchild with disabilities.\n  Most child care providers tend not to enroll special needs children \nbecause often the child needs one-on-one care. And, the fear of the \nunknown presents an added risk to an already demanding job.\n  In Christina's case, a state funded agency has helped her family \nlocate an in-home care giver that cares for Christina while her parents \nare at work.\n  But, Mr. President, access is only the first hurdle in finding child \ncare. Quality is equally important. Unfortunately, in Christina's case, \nher child care providers have not been adequately trained to handle or \neven recognize when Christina has an epileptic attack.\n  At one time, Mr. President, the agency that placed the providers with \nChristina called her parent's to warn them of an employee and told them \nto call the police if she came to their home.\n  This raises a question Mr. President. Who is watching the watchers?\n  Mr. President, in the national debate about child care it seems to me \nthat not enough is being said about the challenges facing families with \nchildren who have disabilities.\n  Child care policies must address issues of access and quality as it \nrelates to special needs children. Many of the bills introduced this \nyear do not address special needs issues. In fact, Senate bill 1610 \nasks for more than 20 billion dollars through fiscal year 2003 to \nimprove the affordability of child care and an additional three billion \ndollars through fiscal year 2003 for enhancing the quality of child \ncare and early childhood development. However, there are no provisions \nregarding an increase of availability, affordability, and quality Of \nchild care for children with special needs.\n  It is our duty, Mr. President, to make sure that these special needs \nchildren and their parents have the same opportunities as other \nchildren and families. Today I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to make sure that children with special needs are not left out or \nforgotten in any legislation regarding child care that comes before \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from the Rochester Post \nBulletin be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n       Special Needs Child Care Is ``Accident Waiting To Happen''\n\n                            (By Mary Divine)\n\n       Julie Sauer's daughter was only 6 months old when she began \n     shaking and quivering uncontrollably. No reason, no \n     explanation.\n       For the next two years of her life, little Christina Barth \n     experienced almost constant seizures, said Sauer, a lab \n     technician at Mayo Clinic. Finally, when she was 2\\1/2\\, \n     Christina underwent a partial lobotomy at UCLA's Medical \n     Center.\n       Christina, now 11 and a student at Gage Elementary School, \n     is mentally disabled and has an intractable seizure disorder. \n     She functions at the level of an 18-month old child, Sauer \n     said.\n       Because of her special needs Christina needs specialized \n     child care, child care that Julie Sauer said isn't available \n     in Rochester.\n       ``Our dilemma is finding child care for her before school, \n     for non-school days and for the upcoming summer vacation,.'' \n     Julie Sauer said.\n       Sauer and her husband, Bob Sauer, the owner of Rochester \n     Drain-Rite, have been in touch with the School-Age Child Care \n     program. Child Care Resource and Referral, Arc Olmsted \n     County, Hiawatha Homes and a home day care provider. Child \n     Care Resource and Referral found that area day care centers \n     and School-Age Child Care did not have enough staff to \n     provide the one-to-one care Christina requires, Julie Sauer \n     said.\n       ``If only there were a place that was capable of taking \n     care of her, like a day care center,'' Julie Sauer muses as \n     she strokes her daughter's hair.\n\n\n                          Unsatisfactory care\n\n       Since the beginning of the school year, the Sauers have \n     relied on before and after school care provided by a personal \n     care attendant. But the Sauers say the care isn't \n     satisfactory.\n       ``We had five new people in one week.'' Bob Sauer said ``We \n     have people who never even showed up.''\n       The turnover in staff is confusing to Christina, Julie \n     Sauer said. ``She doesn't want to\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\n     get off the bus because she doesn't know them.''\n       If a snow day is called, the Sauers panic.\n       But they panic on other days as well. Once, they came home \n     to find blood on the carpet and a shower rod in the upstairs \n     bathroom ripped from the wall. Christina was fine, but the \n     personal care attendant on duty that day was never allowed \n     back into their home.\n       Often, they have Bob Sauer's daughter from a previous \n     marriage watch the personal care attendant who is supposed to \n     be caring for Christina.\n       ``Sometimes I think that it's Christina who should be \n     watching them,'' he said.\n       One attendant didn't realize Christina was having a seizure \n     until Sauer's son told her, Sauer said.\n       ``We have strangers coming into the house who just don't \n     have a clue,'' he said. ``There have been people in this \n     house that we have never met. Once, they called and warned us \n     about one of the PCAs. They said, `If she comes to the door, \n     don't let her in. And if she will not leave, call 911.' It's \n     an accident waiting to happen.''\n       Julie Sauer has written area legislators about the lack of \n     child care for special needs children.\n       Hiawatha Homes provides respite care, but the children must \n     stay overnight to be reimbursed by the state, she said.\n       ``I want to take care of my daughter for as long as I \n     can,'' Julie Sauer said. ``I am not looking for money to pay \n     for someone to take care of my daughter, only help in finding \n     a place that will be equipped for special needs children in \n     our community.''\n\n\n                         Shortage of employees\n\n       Tom Davie, director of Community Education, oversees the \n     School-Age Child Care program, which serve some special-needs \n     children.\n       ``Our challenge becomes one of having adequate staffing'' \n     he said. ``We have taken children who have not required one-\n     to-one care. Many times, because of our numbers, School-Age \n     Child Care is not the best choice for a child with special \n     needs.''\n       Arc Olmsted County used to provide a day care program for \n     children with special needs, but the organization \n     discontinued it, said Buff Hennessey, Arc's executive \n     director.\n       About 3 percent of the population is identified as having a \n     developmental disability, she said.\n       ``There are home health care agencies that provide PCA \n     services, although a couple are no longer providing services \n     to families with young people,'' she said. ``There are \n     reimbursement problems and then with the way the labor market \n     is. Our industry as a whole has a crisis shortage of \n     employees. There have been efforts to train additional \n     providers, but the numbers have been pretty limited.''\n       Hennessey said some families have given up employment \n     opportunities to have one parent stay home with the special-\n     needs child.\n       That's not an option for the Sauers, both of whom work \n     full-time, they say.\n       ``We want to raise her as much as we can,'' Bob Sauer said, \n     ``but our options are to put up with this or give her up \n     completely.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5461-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD C.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Richard \n(Dick) Marbes, who is retiring from the full time position of Wisconsin \nState Adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV). As Mr. Marbes \nretires, it seems an appropriate time to acknowledge his distinguished \ncareer and extraordinary contributions and service to veterans and the \nDAV.\n  During the 1950's, Dick served his country proudly in the Air Force. \nHe is a long time active member of DAV chapter 3 in Green Bay and he \nhas served as Wisconsin State Adjutant for over ten years. In 1993-\n1994, Dick was elected and served as the National Commander of the DAV \nwhere he spearheaded an effort to change some pre-existing policies, \nhelping to reestablish the DAV as one on the strongest and most \ninfluential Veterans groups. Dick was recognized as the DAV's National \nAmputee of the year, and is also a member of the Wisconsin Board of \nVeterans affairs.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in offering \nour congratulations to Dick Marbes and his wife Mary Jane and four \nchildren, Pam, Susan, Amy, and Tim. Dick has dedicated his time, \ntalents and energy to serving Veterans and we are indeed indebted to \nhim for his efforts. I am proud to salute Dick for a job well done, and \nI send him my best wishes for the future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5462-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5462-S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE PAPARAZZI\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein, in introducing this \nlegislation to combat the efforts of a few overzealous individuals to \nimproperly intrude upon other's privacy rights. I am cosponsoring this \nlegislation, in large measure, as a tribute to the efforts of \nCongressman Sonny Bono, who brought this issue to the fore. As we all \nknow, long before he was elected to Congress, Representative Bono \nachieved celebrity status in the music business and on television. He \nwas thus acutely aware, from an early age, of the costs of fame. A cost \nthat some, such as rising television star Rebecca Schaeffer, had to pay \nin blood, and others, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Spielburg, \nJodie Foster, David Letterman, and Elizabeth Taylor, to name but a few, \nhave had to pay with a loss of privacy and an inability to freely \nmingle in public.\n  Unfortunately, certain individuals within the generally responsible \nmedia corps have forced many of these well-known figures to hide behind \na veil of high-priced security systems and bodyguards. I know that some \nso-called celebrities have openly questioned whether their fame is \nworth the price of sacrificing their privacy and their ability to live \nnormal lives.\n  I know, too, that my colleague, Senator Feinstein, was herself once \nthe target of a stalker. So I know that this legislation means a great \ndeal to her on a personal level. As public figures, whether as actors \nor musicians or yes, even Senators, we must expect a certain amount of \nmedia attention. Indeed, most of my colleagues on the Hill relish such \nattention--particularly in election years! Press coverage--some of it \nfavorable, some of it not so favorable--is all a part of the system. \nIndeed, it is an important part of our democratic system. So important \nthat the Constitution's framers bestowed upon us the First Amendment \nprotections of free speech and press. And lest we condemn those who \nhave followed recent infamous criminal trials too closely, I would note \nthat the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a public trial. The \nglare of the spotlight is an unavoidable, and in most cases, laudable, \nfeature of a free democratic-republic.\n  Unfortunately, just as the right to swing one's fist may end at \nanother man's nose, the right to aim one's camera at another person's \nface may end where that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. \nUndoubtedly, the privacy expectations of public figures are \nconsiderably different from that of private individuals. That is a \nreality that all who walk in the glare of the camera come to expect and \nlearn, for the most part, to deal with. But when the media become too \nintrusive, or cross lines of general decency or responsibility, \nsomething must be done.\n  It is one thing for the media to attend a press conference where I \nintroduce this legislation--it is quite another thing, however, for the \nmedia to follow me home and train their cameras on my windows. I know, \nfor example, that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver did not \nappreciate the attempts of some in the media, shortly after Mr. \nSchwarzenegger had been released from the hospital after undergoing \nopen heart surgery, to stop their van on the street as they were taking \ntheir children to school, in an attempt to get photographs. I don't \nthink any of us here would appreciate it if someone tried to harass our \nspouses or fathers or mothers as they left the hospital after having \nhad major surgery. Public figure or not, some things simply cross the \nbounds of responsible journalism or media coverage.\n  I think the recent death of Princess Diana focused efforts to deal \nwith an overly intrusive media--even if it is unclear whether the media \nhad anything to do with that tragedy. In fact, some people overreacted \nto that horrible event, pointing fingers at the press before the facts \nwere established. Regardless of the media's role in that accident, the \nmere fact that people recognized that she had long been harassed by an \noverly aggressive media, and that it was not such a stretch to believe \nthat the paparazzi could have played a role in her tragic death, \ndemonstrates the seriousness of this problem.\n  In the wake of Princess Diana's death, Representative Bono and \nSenator Feinstein began a tireless crusade to see Federal legislation \nenacted to protect people from the so-called stalkarazzi. We are now \nwitnessing the fruits of their efforts--I only wish that Representative \nBono had been here to see this legislation introduced.\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\n  I want to say to Senator Feinstein that I commend her for advocating \nthis legislation. Indeed, I am ready to roll up my sleeves and work \nwith her to address this problem. I am committed to moving this \nlegislation through the Judiciary Committee. At the same time, however, \nwe must take care to craft legislation that will be respectful of our \nFirst Amendment rights and of any federalism concerns. In fact, I hope \nthe States will view this bill, as it is refined in committee, as a \nmodel for adopting similar reforms. And I am confident that we will be \nable to strike a reasonable balance between the press' First Amendment \nrights to seek information about public figures and the right of those \nindividuals to their reasonable expectations of privacy. After all, we \nmust take care that the solution to this admitted problem does not \ntrample on important rights. With these concerns in mind, I intend to \nwork with Senator Feinstein to ensure that we have the best legislation \npossible. We hope to hold hearings to identify the extent of these \nproblems and to determine how best to combat attempts by some \noverzealous members of the media in their efforts to profit by \nintruding on others' privacy. I believe that this legislation is an \nimportant first step in that process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5462-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING THE 12TH ANNUAL ENTREPRENEURIAL WOMAN'S CONFERENCE\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to \nrecognize an organization from my home state of Illinois that has been \nan invaluable resource for and promoter of women-owned small \nbusinesses. I am speaking of the Women's Business Development Center, \nwho will hold their 12th annual Entrepreneurial Woman's Conference on \nSeptember 9, 1998 in Chicago.\n  Since 1986, the WBDC, a nationally-recognized nonprofit women's \nbusiness assistance center, has assisted more than 30,000 women \nbusiness owners in establishing and expanding small businesses \nthroughout our country. The Women's Business and Finance Program, the \nWomen's Business Enterprise Initiative, the Entrepreneurial Woman's \nConference and the Women's Business and Buyers Mart are a few of the \nmany programs and services of the WBDC that support female small \nbusiness ownership and help to strengthen the entire U.S. economy.\n  As the first permanent female member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nI know firsthand of the obstacles faced by women when attempting to \nestablish a foothold in the world of commerce. The WBDC and its two \nfounders, Hedy Ratner and Carol Dougal, have made great progress \ntowards tearing down these obstacles.\n  Today, women-owned small businesses are an integral part of the \ncurrent success of the American economy. Currently, there are over 7.7 \nmillion women-owned businesses in the United States, generating $2.3 \ntrillion in sales. In Illinois, there are over 250,000 women-owned \nbusinesses. These businesses mean more jobs for American workers. In \nfact, women business owners employ one of every four U.S. company \nworkers. Certainly, some of this success is due in part to the programs \nand services offered by the WBDC in Illinois and similar programs in \nIndiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Despite this \nsuccess, there is still more to be done. I am confident that with help \nfrom organizations such as the WBDC, the number of women entrepreneurs \nwill continue to rise.\n  The Woman's Entrepreneurial Conference is the centerpiece of the \nWBDC's activities. The Conference provides women business owners with \nthe opportunity to network, attend informative panel discussions, and \npursue business opportunities in an environment that is supportive of \nthe needs of female small business owners. It is my pleasure to welcome \nthe conferees to Chicago, and to congratulate the WBDC for their work \nand dedication to increasing female ownership in the American \nmarketplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5463-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF CLARK AND SUSAN DURANT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nU.S. Customs Service and the Departments of Treasury and Justice for \none of the most important victories they have had in the war on drugs \nto date.\n  I would like to thank Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of the \nTreasury Robert Rubin, and Undersecretary of the Treasury for Law \nEnforcement Ray Kelly for their leadership in this important endeavor \nand the two hundred U.S. Customs agents, who put their lives at stake, \ndiligently and tirelessly for thirty months, to establish this \nnecessary beachhead in the war on drugs. It is a testament to the \ndedication and the ability of our law enforcement personnel that they \nwere able to complete this difficult and dangerous operation.\n  On Monday, May 18, Secretary Rubin and Attorney General Reno \nannounced the arrests of 112 people involved in illegal drug money-\nlaundering in Mexico, which resulted in the seizure of an anticipated \n$157 million in over 100 accounts in the United States, the Caribbean \nand Europe. Furthermore, 4 tons of marijuana and 2 tons of cocaine were \nseized during this 30-month undercover investigation. The indictments \ninclude officials from 12 of Mexico's 19 largest banks, who stand \naccused of knowingly abetting drug traffickers to launder hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  As a result of this investigation, for the first time ever, Mexican \nbanks have been directly linked to money laundering and have been \nindicted as institutions due to their complicity in money-laundering, \nthe significant number of employees involved, the large number of \nillegal transactions, and the institution-wide profiting from these \nillegal transfers, which brought a 4-5% fee per transfer. Bancomer, \nMexico's second largest bank, Banca Serfin, Mexico's third-largest \nbank, and Confia, also among the top twenty, were the three banks \ninvolved.\n  This investigation, known as ``Operation Casablanca'', involved two \nhundred undercover Customs agents, targeting the Cali cocaine and \nheroine syndicate in Colombia, the Juarez cartel in Mexico, and the \ninvolvement of Mexican banks. Two hundred individuals face arrest \nwarrants as the investigations continue, including warrants issued for \nthe Juarez cartel money manager, Victor Alcala Navarro and one of its \nleaders, Jose Alvarez Tostado.\n  I would also like to show my support for the Federal Reserve's \nissuance of ``cease and desist'' orders suspending the U.S. operations \nof Banca Serfin, Bancomer, Banamex, Bital of Mexico and Banco Santander \nof Spain, because of ``serious deficiencies in their anti-money \nlaundering programs.'' These banks must institute new and tougher \ncontrols to resume business in the United States.\n  Despite Mexico's lax enforcement of its own money-laundering \nstatutes, it is good to see that the United States is not afraid to use \nits own resources to address this serious problem.\n  I hope that operations like these will continue to bleed the powerful \ndrug cartels. The American and the international drug war has benefited \nfrom this peek into the intricacies of drug-related money laundering.\n  However, Mr. President, I cannot help but see this latest good news \nin relation to my concerns about Mexico's insufficient counternarcotics \ncooperation with the United States. The Mexican government was not \ninformed of this 3-year, extensive investigation\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nuntil the same morning the press was. Why not? It would seem that this \nwould have been a perfect opportunity to engage in a cooperative law \nenforcement effort.\n  The Administration's certification of Mexico for its counternarcotics \ncooperation in March certainly suggests that a major investigation like \n``Operation Casablanca'' would have been a joint effort. However, the \nreality is that distrust between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement has \nstrained relations and hurt earlier cooperative efforts.\n  Undersecretary Ray Kelly, who has been nominated to be the chief of \nthe Customs Service, answered this question in an article of The \nWashington Post on May 19th. The Mexican authorities were not informed, \n``Because of fear of compromising the operation and placing the lives \nof U.S. agents in danger.''\n  Since the announcement of the indictments this week, the Mexican \ngovernment has made statements in support of this operation, and the \nMexican Attorney General indicated that his office will investigate \nthese banks as well.\n  I just hope that this will result in tougher Mexican laws against \ndrug traffickers and money-launderers and progress toward real \ncooperation to halt the flow of drugs across our borders, rather than \nthe erratic and insufficient cooperation that we have seen until now. \nLet the Mexican government take this opportunity to prove their \ncommitment to fighting the spread and profit of drugs. Let this be the \nstart of a new concerted and cooperative effort to rid our countries of \nthis menace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5463-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in observance of the tenth \nannual National Foster Care Month, May, 1998--a month when the nation \ncommemorates the outstanding contributions that foster parents make \nevery day to the lives of some of our most vulnerable young people.\n  Children are our nation's greatest hope and responsibility. Every \nchild deserves a loving, permanent family. Unfortunately, nearly half a \nmillion American children find themselves without a family to count on, \nvictims of violence, drugs, or neglect. With the help of foster \nparents, these children can live in an environment that is safe, \nstable, and full of love. Yet all too often, the compassion and caring \nof foster parents go unrecognized.\n  Let me tell you about an Idaho family who have been foster parents \nfor ten years. Arthur and Janet Mayer have fostered more than 140 boys \nthroughout those years. It is impossible for most of us to imagine--\nmuch less imitate--the tremendous commitment of time and energy these \nfine people have made to their foster children. Later this month, they \nwill be recognized in my state with the Lifetime Achievement to Foster \nCare Award. I am pleased to express my admiration of Arthur and Janet, \nand my appreciation for their dedicated service to children and \nfamilies.\n  National Foster Care Month gives us an opportunity to commend not \nonly the Mayers, but also the more than 100,000 foster parents across \nthe nation who have opened their homes and hearts to young people in \nneed of temporary refuge. Whether they help 140 children or one, these \nindividuals are making a critical contribution that will resonate long \ninto the future. I hope all of my colleagues will join with me in \nencouraging families in their own states to participate in the foster \ncare program and applauding the important work of our nation's foster \nparents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5464-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO DR. D.H. MCDONALD--45 YEARS AS COMMUNITY PHYSICIAN\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding career of Dr. D.H. McDonald, who is retiring after 45 years \nof dedicated service to the health of the people of Winneconne, \nWisconsin.\n  As a young boy growing up during the Great Depression, Dr. McDonald \nalways dreamed of one day being able to take care of others. He took \ngreat pride in his father's hard work and accomplishments, and \ncherished the educational opportunities available to him. His desire to \nhelp people, hard work ethic and determination to do his best led Dr. \nMcDonald to serve in the medical corps of the U.S. Army Air Force \nCommand as a hospital administrator during World War II.\n  During his time at Marquette University Medical School, Dr. McDonald \ntook advantage of every opportunity he had, not only to learn about \ndiverse areas of the medical field, but also to volunteer in the \ncommunity. He worked at St. Mary Hill Psychiatric Hospital in Milwaukee \nand volunteered in the disadvantaged areas of Chicago where he made \nhome deliveries of babies under the supervision of specialists.\n  In 1952 Dr. McDonald established the McDonald Clinic. In an effort to \naccommodate the needs of the patients, Dr. McDonald used his clinic as \na 24 hour, seven days a week walk-in clinic.\n  Mr. President, Dr. McDonald has remained extremely close to the \nWinneconne community for over 45 years. Throughout the years, he has \ncontributed to many of the events that have taken place within the \ncommunity and will always be remembered for his commitment to the \nhealth and well-being of the people of Winneconne, Wisconsin.\n  As he retires from the practice of medicine to the community which he \nhas spent most of his life serving, we wish him the best of luck and \nthank him for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5464-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5464-S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 1998\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to say thanks to \nthose who have gone before us. Monday marks the 130th year of our \ncountry's official observance of Memorial Day. It is a day America \ndedicates to remember all those who fell in defense of this country. On \nMonday, many across the land will bow their heads in silence for a few \nmoments and remember the patriots of our past.\n  There is no way to measure the impact on the lives of those who have \nlost someone to war. Certainly on this Memorial Day, many will mourn \nthe youth and joy of loved ones lost. This is a day for the heroes, \nknown and unknown, who died on the field of battle so we might be free. \nMr. President, I salute every soldier, airman, marine, coast guardsman, \nmerchantman and sailor who put themselves in harms way and who \nforfeited their lives so that members of future generations would have \nthe opportunity to stand in this chamber, on a day like today, and \nspeak without fear.\n  I have never, nor do I ever wish to know, the fear and suffering that \nmany of these brave men and women surely experienced. It has been said \nand I would agree, that it is best we leave the understanding of their \nsacrifice in God's hands--only He can truly know the full measure of \nwhat was lost and what was gained. Our responsibility is to acknowledge \ntheir sacrifice--to remember that it was made and the reasons for which \nit was made. Monday, Memorial Day, is the day that our country should \nunite in one spirit to remember those who purchased the freedom we and \nour loved ones enjoy.\n  Former President James A. Garfield, at the first national Memorial \nDay observance, said ``we do not know one promise these men made, one \npledge they gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up \nand perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and \ncitizens. For love of country, they accepted death, and thus resolved \nall doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and virtue.''\n  We should all pause with great gratitude on Monday and look to the \nfuture with the greatest of expectations for what the 21st Century \nholds for us, our children, and our children's children. Our fallen \npatriots gave everything they had to extend freedom beyond the reach of \nmost of our lifetimes. Mr. President, Memorial Day is not only about \nremembering the men and women who made the Supreme sacrifice while \ndefending the American way. It is about acknowledging and protecting \nthe ideals they died for, so that their sacrifice shall not have been \nmade in vain.\n  Brave Alabamians have been among those who have fought so valiantly \nand are among the hundreds of thousands who died in World War I, World \nWar II, Korea, Vietnam, Lebanon, Panama, Grenada, and the Persian Gulf. \nThey deserve our deepest respect and honor.\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\nGod bless these fallen heroes. And may God continue to bless the United \nStates of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5464-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  U.S. AGRICULTURE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that last night the \nSenate approved S.Con. Res. 73, which emphasizes the importance of \nagriculture in our trade discussions with the European Union. This \nresolution tells the U.S. Trade Representative two things: The \nelimination of trade restrictions imposed on U.S. agriculture exports \nshould be a top priority in any trade talks with the E.U. And no trade \nnegotiations should occur, at all, if they will undermine our ability \nto eliminate these trade restrictions in the next round of ag talks at \nthe World Trade Organization in 1999.\n  Mr. President, on Monday the president announced in London that the \nUnited States and European Union will begin negotiating a new bilateral \ntrade agreement. While I generally applaud any initiative to further \nreduce barriers to trade, I was dismayed to see agriculture included on \nthe agenda in only a very narrow sense. The many outstanding trade \nbarriers the Europeans have erected to our agriculture exports have \nbeen left off the bargaining table.\n  Currently, the trade in agriculture between the U.S. and E.U. is very \none-sided. The Europeans keep out our pork. They keep out our beef. \nThey keep out our feed grains that are genetically modified. Their \nprotectionist policies hurt our farmers. And the Europeans desperately \nwant to keep these policies in place at the expense of our farmers.\n  So it's understandable why the Europeans want to avoid discussions on \nagriculture. But I'm surprised the Clinton Administration is willing to \nmove forward with this trade agreement and ignore all the problems we \nhave in agriculture. They appear so anxious to move the trade agenda \nforward, perhaps to account for their inability to gain fast track \nauthority, that I'm afraid the prospect for further liberalization of \nagriculture trade will be damaged in the process.\n  In 1999, a new round of agriculture negotiations are to begin at the \nWorld Trade Organization. These negotiations will be critical to \nsetting the rules for global ag trade for the next several years. It is \na chance to build on what was begun in the Uruguay Round Agreement--\nwhich was the first major trade agreement to address agriculture \ntariffs, subsidies and nontariff trade barriers.\n  The United States has much to gain in these talks. We have the most \nproductive, efficient agriculture system in the world. Our farmers can \ncompete with the farmers of any other country. So if trade barriers to \nag exports are removed, our farmers will export more of their \nproduction, their income levels will rise, rural communities will \nprosper and the trade deficit will be reduced.\n  The Europeans, on the other hand, fear open competition in \nagriculture. They continue to impose high barriers to U.S ag products \nand to heavily subsidize their own farmers. Many Europeans view the \nnext round of talks as a threat to their agriculture industry. They \nwould rather avoid the negotiations.\n  So we must use all available leverage to gain concessions from the \nEuropeans. But I'm afraid we will surrender some of our leverage in \nthis new bilateral agreement. In other words, if we give away \nconcessions now, we'll have less leverage when we turn to the ag talks \nin 1999.\n  And that would give the Europeans, who don't want free trade in \nagriculture, the upper hand. And reduce the likelihood that agriculture \ntrade barriers will be eliminated in the 1999 talks. That's what this \nresolution says. Do nothing that will weaken our negotiating position \nin 1999.\n  But the resolution also says something else. It says make the \nelimination of restrictions on agriculture exports a top priority in \nany discussions with the European Union. To me, this is just common \nsense.\n  The United States has a trade surplus in agriculture products. The \nrest of the world wants to buy the food and fiber our farmers produce. \nSo there is no doubt that our farmers produce safe, wholesome, high-\nquality products. Yet the European Union does everything it can to keep \nthese products out of their countries. Products sold all over the world \nare not allowed into the European Union. So doesn't it make sense that \nthe U.S. would seek to negotiate to remove these trade barriers?\n  But these barriers are not on the agenda for the upcoming trade \nnegotiations. And I think that is wrong. I think it is unfair to our \nfarmers. It tells them that their issues aren't important. We're just \ngoing to sweep them under the rug. And go on to negotiate other trade \nissues.\n  Well, Mr. President, now the entire Senate is on record. The Senate \nhas stated firmly: Our farmers deserve better. We will not stand by \nidly and let you ignore the problems of our farmers any longer.\n  I hope the administration takes notice of our actions here today. And \nI hope they immediately press the European Union to put agriculture \nback on the bargaining table.\n  Again I thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5465-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO ROSS PENDERGRAFT\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof a long time friend, Ross Pendergraft. He was a good and decent man \nwho helped make his community and State a better place. I extend my \ncondolences to his family and friends, but especially his lovely wife \nDonnie.\n  Ross passed away Sunday at the age of 72 in Fort Smith, Arkansas, a \ncity he called home and where he was a former executive vice president \nand chief operating officer of the Donrey Media Group, which owns five \nfine newspapers in my State and more than fifty nationwide. Donrey owes \nits great success in a tough business in large part to the efforts of \nRoss Pendergraft.\n  I knew Ross long before I entered public life. He was a man of great \npersonal integrity and professional accomplishment. He was a man of \nwit, humor, and compassion who made a deep impact on the life of his \ncommunity. He will be terribly missed by those in the newspaper \nbusiness and by the thousands people whose lives he touched not only in \nFort Smith but throughout Arkansas.\n  Born in Abbott, Arkansas, Ross was a World War II veteran, and \nattended Arkansas Tech University at Russellville on the GI Bill, like \nso many of us did. In 1948 he joined the advertising staff of the \nSouthwest Times-Record newspaper in Fort Smith, and so began his rise \nthrough the ranks of the Donrey organization. In 1961 he was named \ngeneral manager of the Times-Record and by 1990 he oversaw all Donrey \nnewspapers in the continental U.S. and Hawaii. Three times he was named \n``Man of the Year'' by the Arkansas Press Association.\n  But he also found the time and energy to serve his community. He was \nthe first vice chairman of the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, a \ncharitable trust. He was a chairman of the Fort Smith United Way, a \npresident of the city's Chamber of Commerce, a former member of the \nArkansas Highway Commission, and he served on the Arkansas Action \nCommittee as well as countless other civic and charitable \norganizations.\n  Ross worked tirelessly to get better roads in western Arkansas and to \npromote economic development in Fort Smith, which is now among the \nfastest growing regions in the United States.\n  Though Ross was a man who oversaw more than 50 newspapers and bought \nnewsprint and printers ink by the ton, he was never one to seek the \nlimelight or use his position for personal aggrandizement. So many of \nhis good works took place quietly, behind the scenes, out of the public \neye. He was a man who loved his family, loved his community, and loved \nthe newspaper business. And while my State is diminished by his loss, \nit has been and will continue to be enriched by the work that he did, \nthe causes he served and the example he set.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5465-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5465-S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO B.L. ``BUD'' FREW\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on January 31, 1998, a long time \nfriend and a true hero of the agriculture world retired. I rise today \nto pay tribute to B.L. ``Bud'' Frew who presided over\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nMFA, Inc. for twelve years as President and CEO. Bud has been a most-\ntrusted advisor when it comes to policy and issues that impact \nproduction agriculture and rural America.\n  Bud says that one of the most important accomplishments of his tenure \nwas to instill the idea that everyone has the opportunity to make a \ncontribution to MFA. He felt that the honor in farming had reached a \nlow in the 1970's. Bud took it upon himself single handedly to raise \nthe pride of farmers back to the level of old days when a handshake was \na handshake and your word was your word. Maybe that is why he received \nMissouri Farm Bureau's highest award, Agricultural Leaders of \nTomorrow's Recognition of Leadership Award, Ag Leader of the Year from \nMissouri Ag Industries and Man of the Year for Agriculture from \nMissouri Ruralist magazine.\n  He is experienced, wise, practical, honest, reflects the collective \ncommon-sense views of rural Missourians' and has the courage to fight \nfor a position that may not be fashionable. Additionally, he has the \nquality that any doer and great leader has. He knows how to pick his \nbattles and he knows how to win those battles he picks. Those closest \nto him know that Bud has the two things it takes to be a successful \nbusinessman: character and integrity.\n  I am sorry to see him go because he has been a hero for MFA and a \ncritical leader for Missouri agriculture. However, besides all this, \nBud is my friend so I am glad that he may have some time for himself \nand his family. I hope I am on his fishing invitation list. However, I \nwarn him that he will still be called upon by me and my staff when the \ntough questions arise. On behalf of rural Missouri, I say to Bud, \ncongratulations and thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5465-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN ANTICIPATION OF THE UNIQUE SOUTH DAKOTA-MANITOBA EXCHANGE CONCERT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, as a physician and surgeon, I've had \nthe opportunity to witness everyday the remarkable difference that \nmedical science and technology have made in people's lives.\n  In just the short space of time that I've been practicing medicine--\nless than 20 years--I've seen how the products of medical research and \ndevelopment--lasers, mechanical cardiac assist devices, mechanical \nvalves, automatic internal defibrillators--have not only saved but \nvastly improved the quality of hundreds of thousands of lives every \nyear.\n  And as a physician, I can envision a future in which science and \ntechnology will roll back the current frontiers of medical knowledge, \nidentify the causes, and eliminate most of the effects of the diseases \nthat now plague mankind. It's absolutely astounding to contemplate.\n  However, as a Senator, I've been afforded a different opportunity. \nAnd that's the opportunity to see, and learn, and understand -- not \njust medicine--but America. And, as a Senator, I can envision the \ndifference that science and technology will make in the life of our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, as a country of immigrants we are a people drawn from \ndiverse backgrounds and ideas. And there is no doubt that this unique \namalgamation is one source of our remarkable strength and resiliency. \nBut as diverse as our individual heritages are, a common thread runs \nthrough all of us. That thread is our common heritage as Americans, and \nit unites and strengthens us as well.\n  Our forefathers came to this land to build a new life. Not \nsurprisingly, they in turn created a nation of builders. We build \nhomes. We build communities. We build factories and businesses. But \nmost of all, Mr. President, we build futures--because we also build \nhope.\n  As a people, Americans rise to a challenge. And as a nation --to \nevery challenge we've ever faced. At no time was this more apparent \nthan during World War II when we were forced to make drastic sacrifices \nto survive. The legacy of those choices has driven our economy and our \npolicies ever since, and one of those legacies is the federal \ninvestment in science and technology.\n  Science and technology have shaped our world in ways both grand and \nsmall. We've put men into space and looked into the farthest corners of \nthe known universe. We've broken the code of the human genome and begun \nto dismantle previously incurable disease. We've created a virtual \nworld and a whole new realm called cyberspace. Yet, technology also \nsurrounds us in millions of little ways we no longer even notice: the \ncomputers that run our cars; the cellular phones that keep us in touch; \nthe stop lights, the grocery store checkouts, the microwaves that help \nour lives run smoother and faster.\n  In my Senate office alone, technology has made a tremendous \ndifference--both in terms of helping me keep in touch with the people \nof Tennessee, and by helping them access important information.\n  For example, while in the past Senators kept in touch by phone, \nletter, and trips to the state, today I regularly schedule video \nconferences with Tennessee schools--from the elementary to the \nuniversity level. In March I spoke to the entire student body of George \nWashington Elementary School in Kingsport. Certain students were \nselected by their teachers to ask questions, and the rest watched on \nclosed-circuit television. In April, I visited with students from \nAustin Peay State University in Clarksville. So, it no longer takes a \nweek-end to speak with my constitutents face-to-face. At 11:50 that \nmorning I was voting on the floor of the United States Senate; at noon, \nI was having a conversation with students in Tennessee.\n  And thanks to the Internet--another remarkable product of federal \nresearch funds--this one funded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency)--my Senate Website not only allows me to share my \nvoting record, press releases, and speeches with constituents, it \nallows them to voice their opinions and concerns and ask questions \nabout issues before the Senate.\n  Our office also uses a digital camera--which allows photographs to be \ndownloaded, printed, and disseminated almost instantly. On a recent \ntrip to Bosnia, for instance, I took pictures of our troops from \nTennessee, downloaded them into my laptop, e-mailed them to local \nnewspapers in Tennessee, as well as to my Washington office where they \nwere posted on the Web for all to see. The whole process took only a \nfew minutes.\n  As we can see, today's world runs on technology, and through its \ninvestment in research and development, the federal government has \nplayed a significant role in creating it. In fact, more than 56 percent \nof all basic research is produced with federal funds.\n  Much of our economy runs on technology as well. Half of all U.S. \neconomic growth is the result of our technical progress. Technology \nhelps provide new goods and services, new jobs and new capital, even \nwhole new industries.\n  Developments in chemicals technology, for example, have lead to the \nproduction of new petrochemicals,\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\nagrochemicals, food and pharmaceuticals, and advanced health care \nmaterials such as those used in skin grafts.\n  Information technologies have spawned whole new industry segments in \ncellular communications, electronic commerce, and global information \naccess.\n  The space imaging and remote sensing technology that produced the \nU.S. Global Positioning System, has in turn become a core technology in \nseveral industries key to the U.S. economy, including agriculture, \naviation, construction, land use, transportation, and mining. And those \nindustries have themselves produced dramatic advancements. In \nagriculture alone, GPS- enabled precision farming has allowed more \nlimited applications of pesticides and fertilizers, which in turn have \nresulted in less environmental damage at lower costs with more precise \ncrop yield determinations.\n  Without a doubt, technology is the principal driving force behind our \nlong-term economic growth and our rising standard of living. In fact, \naccording to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), \ntechnology is the single most important factor in sustained economic \ngrowth. Not only is the performance of U.S. businesses and their \ncontributions to economic growth directly linked to their use of \ntechnology, but as cited in a study conducted by the Department of \nCommerce, manufacturing businesses that used eight or more advanced \ntechnologies grew 14.4 percent more than plants that used none--and, \nproduction wages were more than 14 percent higher.\n  For any who might still remain unconvinced that our federal \ninvestment in science and technology has not produced phenomenal \nreturns, let me give just two quick examples.\n  Over the last three decades, the Department of Defense has funded $5 \nbillion in university research in information technology. Those \nprograms alone created one-third to one-half of all major breakthroughs \nin the computer and communications industries. Today, those businesses \naccount for $500 billion of GDP--a return on our investment of 3,000 \npercent! In fact, studies of just one university alone--MIT--found that \nin Massachusetts MIT grads and faculty founded over 600 companies that \nproduced 300,000 jobs and $40 billion in sales. In Silicon Valley, MIT \ngrads founded 225 companies which produced 150,000 jobs and more than \n$22 billion in sales.\n  In one industry alone--biotechnology--government's $43 million annual \ninvestment has not only produced the human capital of the biotech \nindustry--scientists, engineers, managers--and new knowledge that's led \nto an understanding of the molecular basis of disease, but also new \ncompanies and new wealth. To, again, use MIT as an example, in \nMassachusetts alone, MIT-related companies have produced 10,000 new \njobs, $3 billion in annual revenues, and 100 new biotech patents \nlicensed the U.S. companies that have induced investment of $650 \nmillion. Those companies now produce nine of the 10 FDA-approved \nbiotech drugs that stop heart attacks and treat cancer, cystic fibrosis \nand diabetes, and we've only just begun to tap the potential returns of \nthis rapidly advancing new field.\n  But universities are not just the fountainhead of innovation. The are \nthe wellsprings that provide the intellectual underpinning of future \nprogress. They train the people who will translate new discoveries into \nnew products and processes and industries.\n  For example, Jennifer Mills, a physics undergraduate from Portland, \nOregon, wrote much of the computer code responsible for the remarkable \nimages sent back to Earth by the Hubble telescope. James McLurkin, an \nundergrad engineer, created a tiny robot that may well revolutionize \ncertain kinds of surgery--enabling surgeons to operate inside the body \nwithout ever touching the patient!\n\n\n      america's investment in science and technology must continue\n\n  Clearly, America's investment in science and technology must \ncontinue. The two central questions that Congress must ask and answer, \nhowever, are: (1) Will science and technology continue to be as great a \nCongressional priority in the future as it has been in the past; and \n(2) Will the kind of financial investment necessary to sustain future \nprogress ever be possible in light of our other growing financial \ncommitments?\n  Mr. President, the history of the last five decades has shown us that \nthere is a federal role in the creation and nurturing of science and \ntechnology, and that--even in times of fiscal austerity--that \ncommitment has been relatively consistent.\n  However, the last three decades have also shown us something else: \nfiscal reality. The simple truth is there's just not enough money to do \neverything we'd like to do.\n  It took some time for us to realize that, and by the time we did, we \nfound ourselves in a fiscal situation that is only now being addressed. \nAnd--budget surpluses notwithstanding--discretionary spending is under \nimmense fiscal pressure.\n  One only has to look back over the last 30 years to confirm the \ntrend. In 1965, mandatory federal spending on entitlements and interest \non the debt accounted for 30 percent of the federal budget. Fully 70 \npercent went toward discretionary programs--research, education, roads, \nbridges, national parks, and national defense.\n  Today-- just 30 years later-- that ratio has been almost completely \nreversed: 67 percent of the budget is spent on mandatory programs and \ninterest on the debt; leaving only 33 percent for everything else, \nincluding research. In fact, total R spending today as a percentage \nof GDP is just .75 percent--as compared to 2.2 percent in the mid-1960s \nwhen superpower rivalry and the race to space fueled a national \ncommitment to science and technology. As the BabyBoom generation begins \nto retire and the discretionary portion of the budget shrinks even \nfurther, this situation will only grow worse.\n  Thus, Mr. President, we have both a long-term problem: addressing the \never-increasing level of mandatory spending; and a near-term challenge: \napportioning the ever-dwindling amount of discretionary funding.\n  The confluence of this increased dependency on technology and \ndecreased fiscal flexibility has created a problem too obvious to \nignore: Not all deserving programs can be funded; Not all authorized \nprograms can be fully implemented.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the luxury of fully funding science \nand technology programs across the board has long since passed. We must \nset priorities.\n\n\nfrist vision for the future: how we ensure federal support for science \n                             and technology\n\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senators Gramm, Lieberman, \nDomenici, and Bingaman, for commencing a debate on funding for science \nand technology that is long overdue. I firmly believe that Congress \nmust reaffirm our national commitment to science and technology, and \nredouble its efforts to ensure that funding is not only maintained but \nincreased. However, I also believe that funding levels alone are not \nthe answer.\n  What we really need, Mr. President, is a strategy for the future--a \nvision that not only provides adequate levels of funding, but ensures \nthat that funding is both responsible and sustainable over the long \nterm.\n  I believe we do it by establishing and applying a set of first or \nguiding principles that will enable us to consistently ask the right \nquestions about each competing technology program; focus on that \nprogram's effectiveness and appropriateness for federal funding; and \nmost importantly, make the hard choices about which programs deserve to \nbe funded and which do not. Only then can Congress be assured that it \nhas invested wisely and well.\n  What are these first principles? There are four:\n  First, federal R programs must be good science. They must be \nfocused, not duplicative, and peer-reviewed.\n  Because there is strength in diversity, they must support both \nknowledge-driven science--which broadens our base of knowledge and \nadvances the frontiers of science; and mission-driven science \nrequirements--which push the state-of-the-art in specific technology \nfields.\n  Second, programs must be fiscally accountable. Especially in today's \nfiscal environment, wasteful administrative habits can't be tolerated.\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\n  Third, they must have measurable results. Programs must achieve their \naims. Their effectiveness must be evaluated-- not on the basis of \nindividual projects which can have varying rates of success -- but on \nbasis of the entire program.\n  Fourth, they must employ a consistent approach. Federal policy must \nbe applied consistently across the entire spectrum of federal research \nagencies. High quality, productive research programs must be encouraged \nregardless of where they are located.\n  Accompanying the four first principles, are four corollaries:\n\n       (1) Flow of Technology. The process of creating technology \n     involves many steps. However, the current federal structure \n     clearly reinforces increasingly artificial distinctions \n     across the spectrum of research and development activities. \n     The result is a set of programs which each support a narrow \n     phase of research and development, but are not coordinated \n     with one another.\n\n  Government should maximize its investment by encouraging the \nprogression of a technology from the earliest stages of research up to \ncommercialization, through funding agencies and vehicles appropriate \nfor each stage. This creates a flow of technology, subject to merit at \neach stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a bureaucratic \nmaze.\n\n       (2) Excellence in the American Research Infrastructure. We \n     must foster a close relationship between research and \n     education. Our investment at the university level creates \n     more than simply world class research. It creates world class \n     researchers as well. We must continue this strong to a \n     research infrastructure, and find ways to extend the \n     excellence of our university system to primary and secondary \n     educational institutions.\n       (3) Commitment to a Broad Range of Research Initiatives. \n     Revolutionary innovation is taking place at the overlap of \n     research disciplines. We must continue to encourage this by \n     providing opportunities for interdisciplinary projects and \n     fostering collaboration across fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among Industry, Universities, and Federal \n     Labs. Each of these has special talents and abilities that \n     complement the other. Our federal dollars are wisely spent by \n     facilitating the creation of partnerships, in effect creating \n     a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n  These first principles and their four corollaries, Mr. President, \nprovide a framework that will not only guide the creation of new, \nfederally funded research and development programs, but validate \nexisting ones. Taken together, they create a powerful method for \nelevating the debate by increasing Congress' ability to focus on the \nimportant issues; decreasing the likelihood that it will get \nsidetracked on politically-charged technicalities; and ensuring that \nfederal R programs are consistent and effective. They will also help \nus establish both a consistent set of national goals, and a vision for \nthe future.\n\n\n                         looking to the future\n\n  However, Mr. President, even if we are to accomplish all that we \nhope-- in terms of setting and fully funding our current science and \ntechnology priorities, creating a vision for the future, and developing \na strategy for attaining it--our work will still be incomplete if we \nfail to accomplish one more thing: We must prepare the next generation \nfor the century to come.\n  We must create a scientifically-literate work force capable of \nprospering in a world not only driven by a science and technology \neconomy, but dependent upon science and technology excellence.\n  Yet as evidenced by the results of the latest TIMSS (Third \nInternational Math and Science Study) study, America's high school \nseniors are among the industrial world's least prepared in math and \nscience. And in math and physics, no nation performed more poorly than \nthe United States.\n  Why? Part of the reason is teacher qualification--28 percent of all \nhigh school math teachers, and 55 percent of all physics teachers \nneither majored nor minored in these subjects.\n  Part of the reason is unrealistic curricula--which forces teachers to \nteach a little bit of everything, but nothing in depth.\n  Part of it has to do with textbook publishers who seem to be more \nconcerned with continually adding new material than with advancing \nstudents' skills.\n  And part of it, no doubt, has to do with the fact that, in many \ncases, we simply have not fostered in our children the same spirit of \nwonder that was fostered in us.\n  Mr. President, it's time to, once again, get America excited about \nscience.\n  It's time we recovered our heritage, and became again a nation of \npeople who build the future--a future filled with hope and promise.\n  And it's time we inspired the next generation to continue the process \nof exploration and innovation that made America possible in the first \nplace, and that will take her into a 21st century future brighter than \nany point in her past.\n  Mr. President, as a physician, as a scientist, as a Senator, those \nare my goals. I hope they are the goals as well of every Member of this \nbody. For whether we, as a nation, use and develop the knowledge we \ngain to its highest potential for the benefit of ourselves, our Nation, \nand our fellow man depends, in large measure, on whether we are able to \nachieve them.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5466-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5468-S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. ``A nation reveals itself not only by the men \nit produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.'' What \nbetter way to pay tribute to America's veterans on this Memorial Day \nthan to quote our former President, John F. Kennedy. He knew then, in \n1963, that it was imperative we honor and remember our veterans, as \nshould know today. We must not forget the sacrifices of the many men \nand women who gave so much for the sake of this great country, and we \nmust honor them with our gratitude.\n  I stand before you today to salute these veterans. In my home state \nof West Virginia, generations of veterans have served in the Armed \nForces, and many have lost their lives. This country would not be the \nworld power that it is today had it not been for these men and women \nwho fought so bravely. Let us not just know that this day is Memorial \nDay, let us take a moment to put names, faces, on these veterans. \nHusbands, wives, mothers, fathers, and children. Friends to us all; \nfriends who fought for our freedom. Freedom that we share every single \nday of our lives. Freedom that makes America as great as it is.\n  Stand proud when you see the American flag waving high in the air. \nSing along to the Star Spangled Banner. Nod your head in respect when \nyou pass by a veterans' cemetery. Behind these symbols of America are \nthe people who have made them so remarkable, the veterans of this \ncountry. They deserve our gratitude on this day and everyday.\n  So many veterans gave their lives for this Nation. We cannot forget \nwhat they did for us. The lives that were lost and the lives that were \nchanged forever. It does not matter whether they served in combat or \npeace time. Each left behind familiar surrounds, undertook risks, and \nfaced the unknown. We should honor them all for their courage. They \njoined the Armed Forces of this country to defend and protect it, to \nmake it safe for their, and our, loved ones.\n  We vowed to take care of our veterans when they returned home to us. \nIn many ways, we have, by setting up a benefits program and a health \ncare system, creating two Committees in Congress to oversee these \nefforts, devoting enormous amounts of resources to their health and \nwell being. But I am forced to say that the recent record of this \nadministration, and of many in Congress, has deteriorated in the area \nof protecting veterans' benefits. Our commitment to meeting the needs \nof veterans has been eroded, and we can and must do better. There are \nstill many areas that need improvement. It is not a perfect system. We \nmust strive to better it and not let any of our veterans be \nshortchanged of the benefits and care they so dearly earned and \ndeserve.\n\n  I would like to speak about just a few of the ordeals that our \nveterans have had to face after their return from service. I do this to \nacknowledge these problems and to pledge to continue in my fight for \nsolutions.\n  Gulf War veterans. Even though the war is over, many are struggling \nwith illness, often undiagnosed, but nevertheless debilitating. Seven \nyears have passed since the end of the Gulf War, and DOD and VA still \ndo not know what is wrong with the veterans who\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nfought in this war. We need to be able to answer the questions of ``How \nmany veterans are ill?'' and ``Are our ill veterans getting sicker over \ntime?''\n  We also need to provide a permanent statutory authority to compensate \nthese veterans. That is why I have introduced legislation, S. 1320, \nthat targets these important issues. It took our government 20 years \nafter the Vietnam War to assess the effects of Agent Orange and 40 \nyears after World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed \nveterans. We must learn from the lessons of the past and act. We cannot \nallow our Gulf War veterans to keep waiting for the benefits and care \nthat they earned seven years ago.\n  Or take atomic veterans, who were exposed to ionizing radiation \nduring service. I have serious concerns about the way atomic veterans' \nclaims are being handled and the way regulations to administer those \nclaims are being created. These veterans were intentionally placed in \nharm's way, sworn to secrecy, and abandoned by their government for \nmany years. It is critical that we search for a better way to address \ntheir compensation claims.\n  I recently cosponsored legislation that would authorize health care \nfor veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation, veterans \nwho have so far been excluded from access to VA services. These \nveterans, primarily Navy submariner and Army Air corps pilots, received \nnasopharyngeal radium treatments in the 1940's and 1950's to treat and \nprevent inner ear problems that developed due to the inadequate \npressurization of their respective vessels. Unfortunately, the health \neffects of the treatments that were given to these veterans are \nunknown. However, when such high levels of exposure are sustained, we \nmust be concerned about long-term health effects, and thus, we have a \nresponsibility to ensure these veterans' access to health care. Simply \nput, it is the right thing to do.\n  We owe these veterans. They risked everything for us--their health \nand sometimes even their lives. We should, at least, give them \nappropriate research, health care, and compensation. At least.\n  An important issue concerning veterans at this time is the VA budget \nfor benefits and health care. I would like to share with America where \nthese issues stand.\n  First, the benefits side of the budget. The administration this year \nrequested a very modest increase of $565 million in funds for benefits \npayments, just what is needed to cover cost-of-living allowances. VA \nhas also requested $850 million--$63.5 million above the FY 98 level--\nfor the account that funds the administration of nonmedical benefits. \nAlthough these amounts appear to be an increase, VA's benefits delivery \nstaff will lose 45 FTE. In a time when it takes VA 157 days to decide a \nnew compensation claim, and years longer in appeals cases, it concerns \nme greatly that VA is seeking funds that will not allow it even to \nmaintain, at the very least, its current level of staffing.\n  I am particularly troubled by the proposal by the administration, \nadopted this very day by the Congress, which cut $10.5 billion from the \nveterans' benefit account over the next five years. This was done by \nremoving VA's existing authority to pay compensation to veterans who \nsuffer from tobacco-related illnesses, based on the nicotine dependence \nthey developed while in the service. The money saved from cutting this \nbenefit will be put into more highway spending.\n  Although I support a strong highway bill, I firmly believe that it \nshould not be funded by cuts in veterans benefits, particularly a \nprogram cut that totally bypassed the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. That is why I offered an amendment to the Budget Resolution to \nprotect the funding to the veterans account. Unfortunately, my \namendment was defeated by a vote of 52-46.\n  On the health care side, the VA budget request for medical care is \n$30 million less than last year. The base appropriated funding level of \n$17.03 billion would be supplemented by approximately $560 million from \nveterans' copays and collections from insurance companies. When the \nbase funding level is combined with these collections, the VA health \ncare system would have $17.6 billion to spend next year--approximately \nwhat it is spending this year. Unfortunately, this flatlined budget \nmakes no allowance for cost-of-living increases for VA employees and \nother rising costs due to inflation.\n  The VA health care system is a system in transition. Recent changes \nin lines of authority, resource allocations, and methods of health care \ndelivery, as well as downsizings and facility integrations, have \nbuffeted the system. While all this reorganization is underway, I am \nconcerned that VA have good systems in place to ensure that high \nquality health care is the standard practiced at all VA facilities, \nregardless of where they are located around the country. I will \ncontinue my efforts to make sure that VA, as the nation's largest \nhealth care provider, upholds the highest standards of quality of care.\n  What is clear is that we still have a lot of work to do for our \nveterans. We have come a long way, but there are still many miles to \ncover.\n  They promised us they would risk their lives. We promised them we \nwould take care of them. Caring for our veterans is the least we can \ndo.\n  On this day, ladies and gentlemen, be proud of the men and women--\nveterans and service members from every branch and action--who have \nserved our nation with courage. And, my colleagues, match your pride \nwith a pledge to maintain the nation's commitment to them.\n  Veterans have earned our respect and admiration. I am committed to \nupholding their honor the offering them the thanks they so richly \ndeserve. I ask you, America, to do no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5468-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LEHIGH VALLEY AND HEALTH NETWORK\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, on May 29th, I will be in Port \nArthur, Texas, helping to celebrate the City of Port Arthur's \nCentennial Day Celebration as well as the tenth anniversary of the \nGolden Triangle Veterans' Memorial Park. Port Arthur, a city born at \nthe dawn of the 20th century, enters the 21st century confident in its \nstride as a growing and vibrant community on the Texas' Gulf Coast, not \nfar from my home town of La Marque. Port Arthur, a corner of what some \ncall Texas' Golden Triangle, plays a key role in our national security \nby contributing to our energy independence through its oil exploration \nand petroleum refining activities. Nearly every American has benefited \nfrom the products that enter the world market from Port Arthur--\npetrochemicals and oil in particular.\n  The City of Port Arthur is named for Arthur E. Stillwell, originally \nof Rochester, New York. In 1895, Mr. Stillwell was searching for a site \nfor the southern terminal of his proposed railroad from Kansas City to \nthe Gulf of Mexico. He chose a site on the north shore of Lake Sabine, \nwhere Port Arthur stands today. The railroad to Port Arthur, which \neventually became known\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nas the Kansas City Southern Railroad, was completed in 1897. The city \nof Port Arthur was incorporated on May 30, 1898, one hundred years ago \nthis month.\n  The next year, the original ship canal to the Gulf was opened. Today, \ncargo tonnage out of the Port of Port Arthur averages about 23,000,000 \ntons per year. But it was on January 10, 1901, that the destiny of Port \nArthur changed forever when a well dug by Anthony Lucas at Spindletop, \nonly ten miles away from Port Arthur, struck black gold. Nearly a \nmillion barrels of crude oil are refined in the area daily, justifying \nPort Arthur's claim--``We Oil the World.''\n  Today, Port Arthur is the home of three major refineries and the \nstill important terminus of the Kansas City Southern railroad. The town \nof one thousand people a hundred years ago has grown to almost 60,000, \nand a diverse economy guarantees Port Arthur's growth into its second \ncentury. In addition to its energy industries, Port Arthur has become a \nyear-round fisherman's paradise where thousands of anglers catch more \nthan twenty-five varieties of freshwater and saltwater fish. Other \npopular local attractions include the Museum of the Gulf Coast, the \nMcFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges, the Sabine Pass \nBattleground State Historical Park, and Sea Rim State Park.\n  I'd like to talk for a moment about the tenth anniversary of the \nGolden Triangle Veterans' Memorial Park, which we will also be \ncelebrating next week. This is the only park in the United States that \nrecognizes all veterans, including those that served during times of \npeace. It was built by members of the community, financed and \nconstructed through donations and over 55,000 volunteer man-hours. The \npark contains walls of honor for all our nation's past wars. The park's \nten-year anniversary celebration is part of a week's worth of \nactivities recognizing the Port Arthur Centennial.\n  I want to congratulate Jefferson County Judge Carl Griffith, Port \nArthur Mayor Robert Morgan, Jr., and the people of Port Arthur on this \nhistoric occasion. Together, we look forward to what their community \nwill accomplish in the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5469-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING PETE LYONS UPON RECEIVING A NEW MEXICO DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC \n                             SERVICE AWARD\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, every year, New Mexico recognizes \nsome of their own citizens who have contributed to their communities in \nextraordinary ways. Today, along with the citizens of New Mexico, I am \ngrateful for this opportunity to recognize Dr. Pete Lyons for his civic \nservice. As a Legislative Fellow in my office he serves as my science \nadvisor and during his time with me, I have benefitted from his good \nadvice and diligent work.\n  Service to one's community can be expressed in many different forms. \nHowever, it is rare to find someone as dedicated to so many diverse \nactivities as Pete Lyons. He is a 29-year employee of Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory while serving for 16 years on the Los Alamos School \nBoard. Whether it is his scientific work, his initiative to help rural \ncommunities, his dedication to education and young people, or his work \nto improve policy in the international area, Pete shows the same \nintegrity, insight and old-fashioned hard work.\n  Pete moved to New Mexico 29 years ago to work for the Laboratory as a \ntechnical staff member. He went on to serve in a number of management \npositions. In his career at the Lab he was the first Director of the \nIndustrial Partnership Office where he expanded and created programs to \nencourage economic diversity in Northern New Mexico. He continued \nefforts to improve cooperation with the surrounding community through \nthe Lab's office of Regional Economic Development and Technology \nCommercialization Office. Through a wide range of critical projects \ninvolving issues from telecommunications infrastructure, to \ntelemedicine capability to improve rural health care, to technical \nassistance for water quality his work has been hallmarked by a \ndedication to the entire community both related and unrelated to the \nLaboratory. Since the Lab's beginning during World War II, it has been \na stark contrast to the economy and cultures of the surrounding region. \nThrough this work, Pete has helped to bridge that gap to begin a new \nera of cooperation and interaction for the Laboratory and the nearby \ncommunities.\n  In addition, I believe his service that is the most commendable is \nhis active involvement in education. Pete recognizes that our \nchildren's future, our nation's future, is dependent upon the quality \nof our education system. During his sixteen years on the Los Alamos \nSchool board, he was instrumental in helping to create University of \nNew Mexico-Los Alamos Branch College. He represented the Laboratory \nduring negotiations with the local school district to form a foundation \nto provide financial support from the Lab and the Department of Energy \nto provide financial support for school districts where lab employees \nlived. During his time in my office, he has worked to bring attention \nto our nation's need to improve science and technology education so \nthat America will remain competitive well into the next century.\n  Pete also knows that personal involvement can mean so much to young \npeople. He has spent several years coaching soccer, sponsoring Boy \nScouts, and serving as deacon in his church.\n  In a sense, Pete continues his civic service as a congressional \nfellow in my office. Over the months, he has proven to me his immense \nvalue to New Mexico and the nation. Whether the issue be rural economic \ndevelopment or nuclear non-proliferation, Pete brings thoughtful \nknowledge and keen insight to the table. He is willing to tackle \ncontroversial issues with a open mind and commitment to truthful \ndialogue.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and my fellow New Mexicans to \nrecognize this remarkable American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5470-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5470-S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FRANCES C. RICHMOND MIDDLE SCHOOL: BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate the students, teachers, and staff of the Frances C. \nRichmond Middle School in Hanover, New Hampshire for being recognized \nby the United States Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School.\n  Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools that have strong leadership; \na clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected \nwith the school; high quality teaching; challenging, up-to-date \ncurriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment \nconducive to learning; solid evidence of family involvement; evidence \nthat the school helps all students achieve to high standards; and a \ncommitment to share best practices with other schools. This honor is \nvigorously sought by thousands of schools across the nation, and only \n166 schools are so recognized.\n  The Richmond School is part of the Dresden School District, the first \ninterstate district in the United States. The school educates sixth \ngraders from Hanover, New Hampshire, and seventh and eighth graders \nfrom both Hanover and Norwich, Vermont.\n  The curriculum of the Richmond School focuses on the academic, social \nand developmental transitions which take place at each grade level. \nSpecial care is taken as the Hanover sixth graders move from elementary \nto middle school, as the Norwich seventh graders join them one year \nlater, and as the eighth graders take their place as school leaders and \nbegin planning for high school. The Richmond School takes pride in the \nfact that students have individual schedules built around their choices \nfor academic and elective courses. A foundation of their program is the \nfine and practical arts program, which allows students to choose from \nover 25 elective courses each quarter. Community service is required \nfor all eighth graders to introduce students to the pleasures and \nresponsibilities of contributing to their community.\n  The school has grown from 286 students to 460 students in the past \nten years, and this has presented the school with a number of \nchallenges. A creative and challenging administrative response to the \ngrowing student population has been to divide leadership roles among \nthe staff. Rather than simply hiring assistants in the central office, \nthe administration asked teachers and other professionals to take on \nthe role of leadership in budget development, curriculum articulation,\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nschool climate and technology planning. These initiatives on the part \nof the staff have resulted in lively staff debates, enriched staff \ndevelopment opportunities, better communication from grade to grade, \nand more frequent interaction with parents and community.\n  As a former teacher and school board chairman, I recognize the \nchallenges involved in providing students a quality education. I \ncommend the teachers and staff for their effort and innovation that \nhave built a top-notch school. I am pleased that they have been \nrecognized for their success, and it is with great pride that I \nrepresent them in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5470-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HOOSIER HERO TRIBUTE TO ROBERT MOHR\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize \nRobert Mohr of Peru, Indiana, for his outstanding accomplishment this \npast week.\n  You see, Mr. President, on May 12, 1998, Mr. Mohr, a conductor for \nNorfolk Southern railroad, and engineer Rod Lindley were guiding their \n96-car freight train through a residential area of Lafayette, Indiana, \nwhen they noticed a small child on the train tracks. With only a short \ndistance between the train and the child, these men slowed the train to \n10 mph and blasted the horn, but 19-month-old Emily Marshall still \nremained on the tracks.\n  Robert Mohr acted immediately and selflessly. Risking his own safety, \nhe climbed onto the front of the train, reached out, and pushed the \ntoddler out of harm's way. Thanks to Robert's quick reaction, Emily \nMarshall was returned to her family with only a cut on her head and a \nswollen lip.\n  Mr. President, I commend Robert Mohr for this brave and selfless act, \nand that is why I am honoring him as a Hoosier Hero.\n  I began the Hoosier Hero award in order to single out Hoosier men and \nwomen who have made significant contributions to Indiana history or \nlife, while at the same time serving as an inspirational example for \nthe entire nation. I can think of no greater contribution to life than \npreserving the life of a small child, such as young Emily.\n  Emily Marshall, an innocent toddler who wandered onto the train \ntracks, will probably not realize for several years what Robert Mohr \ndid for her. However, through Robert Mohr's courageous act, Emily now \nhas the opportunity to grow healthy and strong. Emily's future is a \nbright one, full of promise because of the heroic decision Robert made \non that spring afternoon.\n  Thank you, Robert Mohr, for your courage, your bravery, and your \nselfless act of saving the life of young Emily Marshall. You are an \ninspiration to all, a true Hoosier Hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5471-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MUSICIANS WEEK\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it gives us great pleasure to \nbring to the Senate's attention one of the new premier events in the \nworld of music: Chet Atkins' Musician Days.\n  Known by many as ``Mr. Guitar,'' Chet Atkins is the most recorded \nsolo instrumentalist in music history. As a studio musician, his work \nhas gilded the records of artists from Elvis Presley to the Everly \nBrothers to Hank Williams. Chet has been named Musician of the Year \nnine times by the Country Music Awards and has won thirteen Grammies, \nmore than any other artist in the history of country music.\n  Now it's no secret that the State of Tennessee has provided the world \nwith more than its share of great music, from the blues of Memphis' \nBeale Street to the bluegrass of Appalachia to the country sounds of \nNashville. But it's also true, even in Tennessee, that we sometimes \nforget the performers who stand just outside of the spotlight, the \nmusicians who accompany the stars but rarely take center stage. That \ngave Chet Atkins an idea: organize an event to honor the musicians, or, \nas Chet puts it, ``the people who make the singers sound good!'' I now \nyield to my colleague from Tennessee.\n Mr. FRIST. And so, an idea was born. Last June, Nashville saw \nthe debut of Chet Atkins' Musician Days, a celebration of the \ncontribution of musicians from around the world in every genre of \nmusic. Over four days, a total of 169 acts comprised of 604 artists \nfrom seven countries performed at 43 venues throughout the city. From a \nstar-studded concert featuring 90 performers at the historic Ryman \nAuditorium, former home of the Grand Ole Opry, to a myriad of informal \nacoustic jam sessions at smaller stages all over the city, it was an \nevent that few will soon forget.\n  A big part of Musician Days is its focus on the future of music. \nThroughout the festival, budding musicians are encouraged to bring \ntheir instruments for impromptu sessions with the pros. Proceeds from \nlast year's inaugural event went to the Chet Atkins Music Education \nFund, to be distributed to organizations that encourage the musical \neducation of our nation's young people.\n  The success of Chet Atkins' Musician Days in 1997 led to plans for an \neven bigger event this year. Next month, thousands of music lovers will \nagain descend upon Music City USA for several days of first-rate \nconcerts, musical workshops, and good fellowship. As we anticipate this \nyear's repeat performance, it seems fitting for us to proclaim the week \nof June 22-28 as ``National Musicians Week'' in honor of these silent \nheroes, the players behind the stars, and the critical role they play \nin the musical legacy we all enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5471-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5471-S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF MELINDA HUBBARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nthe outstanding academic achievement of a resident from my home state \nof Oregon, Ms. Melinda Hubbard. A senior at Country Christian High \nSchool, Melinda was recently named as the Oregon State Winner of the \nCitizens Flag Alliance Essay Contest for her essay entitled ``The \nAmerican Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People * * * the \nRight Thing to Do.''\n  I agree with Melinda that the time has come to protect our nation's \nflag with a Constitutional Amendment. I am requesting that her essay be \nprinted in the record immediately following my remarks so that every \nAmerican can have the opportunity to read it.\n  In addition, I have requested the Sergeant at Arms Office to fly a \nflag over the Capitol on Flag Day, June 14, 1998, in recognition of her \nachievement.\n  The essay follows.\n\n The American Flag Protection Amendment: The Right of the People . . . \n                         the Right Thing To Do\n\n   (By Melinda S. Hubbard--A Senior at Country Christian High School)\n\n       The American flag. The stars and stripes. Old Glory. The \n     Star-Spangled Banner All of these are names for the most \n     widely known symbol of our great nation. These are names that \n     have inspired patriotism in many people. But what do they \n     mean to us now?\n       In years gone by, many people have sacrificed their lives \n     for the principles upon which the United States of America \n     was founded and for which our flag is a symbol. The flag is a \n     symbol of what our nation was as well as what it has become. \n     Because of this symbolism, the flag of the United States of \n     America should be honored and respected. This is why a flag \n     protection amendment is necessary.\n       The United States of America has long been viewed as the \n     greatest country in the world, not only by its citizens, but \n     by many other nations as well. Part of the reason that it is \n     viewed thusly is due to the fact that its Constitution and \n     form of government have survived for so long. While it is \n     true that America is a relatively young country when compared \n     with European nations, America has known a stability that few \n     other nations have known. Consider France or Italy. In the \n     past two hundred years, France has experienced seven \n     completely different forms of government, and Italy has seen \n     fifty-one forms. The stability of the United States comes \n     from our nation's foundation, which was on the principles and \n     morals of the Christian men who founded our great nation.\n       In his farewell address on September 19, 1796, George \n     Washington said, ``Of all the dispositions and habits which \n     lead to political prosperity, Religion and morality are \n     indispensable supports . . . 'Tis substantially true, that \n     virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular \n     government.'' Before we are able to look at what our nation \n     symbolizes, we must first look to the men who founded it. \n     They were the Puritans. But what were the Puritans looking \n     for? The Puritans were looking for a land of freedom, a land \n     where they could worship their Lord and Savior as they \n     believed He should be worshipped. It was for this reason that \n     they fled England. They wanted a country whose churches could \n     not be dictated to by the nation's leaders. Not only were \n     they looking\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n     for a country where they would be allowed to worship, but \n     they were looking for a land where they could speak \n     out against what contradicted their beliefs and where they \n     could have a voice in who was to lead their country. For \n     these reasons, they toiled in a new land, carving their \n     homes from wilderness. Without the discipline, mortality, \n     and virtue of the founders, our nation's government would \n     not have endured for as long as it has.\n       For more than two hundred years, the United States has been \n     a land of freedom and opportunity, thanks to the diligence of \n     its founders. But with those same freedoms and opportunities \n     comes responsibility, a responsibility to the memories of \n     each and every man, woman, and child that has given a part of \n     their life as a sacrifice for their country. This \n     responsibility is one that, as America grows stronger and \n     more prosperous, few wish to share.\n       Since the time when everyone held the same beliefs and \n     moral standards, people's convictions and ways they are \n     taught have changed. The citizens of the United States are \n     now being taught to believe many opposing codes of conduct \n     such as ``There's no definite right or wrong; there is only \n     what you feel'' and ``There is accountability to God, your \n     country, and your family.'' While everyone is most definitely \n     free to believe as they choose, these contrasting \n     philosophies lead to different opinions on how the flag, the \n     symbol of our nation, should be treated.\n       The freedoms which the founding fathers toiled to establish \n     and for which our flag is a symbol are an important part of \n     our nation's heritage. Without these freedoms, we would be \n     lost and would become just as any other country, a people who \n     are devoid of hope. When a person desecrates the flag of the \n     United States, he is not only scorning our nation, but he is \n     also desecrating the memory of every person who ever served \n     in a war or sacrificed their own life in order to maintain \n     the freedoms of our nation.\n       We must protect our nation's heritage and foundation. Also, \n     we need to honor the memories of those who have given their \n     lives to save the freedoms of the United States. The flag of \n     the United States, as a symbol of these, should be cherished \n     as dearly as our lives, if not more so. This is why I believe \n     there needs to be a flag protection amendment.\n       According to Article 5 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, there are four ways to amend the Constitution. The \n     first way is for Congress to propose an amendment, then have \n     the legislatures of three-fourths of the states approve it. \n     Secondly, Congress can propose the amendment, and special \n     conventions in three-fourths of the states can approve the \n     addition. Thirdly, two-thirds of the states' legislatures can \n     request a special national convention to propose an \n     amendment, and three-fourths of the states' legislatures \n     ratify the amendment. Fourthly, two-thirds of the states' \n     legislatures can call for a special national convention to \n     propose an amendment, and special conventions in three \n     fourths of the states ratify the amendments.\n       While these amendment procedures are not easily \n     accomplished, it is possible with persistence. We need to \n     preserve our heritage and our flag, honoring both. The only \n     way to be sure that the flag will always be a protected \n     symbol of our nation's heritage is for this amendment to be \n     passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5471-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LORRAINE W.

Mr. President, every year Ebony magazine pays \ntribute to thirty leaders ages thirty and younger who are working for \nthe betterment of their communities. They all represent the caliber of \ntalent that is being groomed to move to the fore front of society and \nlead the United States of America into the 21st century. This year \nMetro East Family Church of East St. Louis, Illinois will be honoring \nthe ``30 Young Leaders of the Future,'' featured in the December 1997 \nissue of Ebony Magazine. It is a great honor to congratulate each of \nEbony magazine's selection of young leaders of the future, but \nespecially the two from my home State of Missouri.\n  Reverend Eric Mason, 25, is the pastor of Administration at the Metro \nEast Family Church. Formerly, he was a case manager at the Nebraska \nHealth and Human Services Department, then an assistant pastor and \neducation director at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church and was \nappointed by the Governor of Nebraska to the Affirmative Action \nCommission as chaplain. He served as the Chair of the Omaha Police \nDepartment, on the Legal Redress Committee, was a member of Omaha \nNAACP, and the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. Reverend Mason \npersonifies everything positive in the St. Louis community and I am \nexcited to learn of his influential leadership.\n  Faustenia Morrow, 25, is the development administrator for Team \nSweep, a youth-at-risk program run by the City of St. Louis. She also \nis President of Young Organized Political Action Committee and \nfundraising chairperson of Metropolis St. Louis, an organization with \nthe goal of attracting and retaining professionals in St. Louis. In \naddition, Ms. Morrow is assistant campaign advisor for Missouri State \nRepresentative Betty Thompson, founding member of the Sisters of High \nTea, an organization of professional women and a member of the \nProfessional Organization of Women. Her continuing commitment to the \nSt. Louis community is a positive example for all and I am extremely \npleased to have her as a role model for others.\n  Dedication to one's community has become an increasingly rare quality \nin our society. However, Ebony's selection of young leaders has shown \nthat the most effective approach to enriching a community is to give \nback rather than to take. Their unselfish commitment has set a \nprecedence for the generations before and after them to follow and \nimplement. I salute the contributions made by these leaders, and join \nthe Metro East Family Church of East St. Louis in paying tribute to the \n``30 Young Leaders of the Future.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5472-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5472-S5473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1997 CONCERNING THE REPEAL OF \n                                 PUCHA\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as the Congress continues to address \nthe important work of reducing government spending, eliminating layers \nof bureaucratic waste, and increasing efficiency, we should focus on \neliminating those regulations and programs which are no longer needed \nand are outdated. As Republicans, we must strive to enact legislation \nthat embraces less government, less spending and more freedom. S. 621 \nis a bill that embodies these important principles.\n  This bill would reduce the unnecessary federal requirements included \nunder the Public Utility Holding Act of 1935. Originally enacted to \ncorrect the abusive practices of holding companies during the 1920's \nand 30's, PUCHA is now an outdated law that is simply no\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\nlonger needed. It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, which implemented the Act has \nurged its repeal for several years. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, along with many state public utility commissioners, also \nrecognize the inefficiency of PUCHA's obsolete provisions and therefore \nsupport its repeal.\n  It is widely recognized that the redundant and burdensome regulations \nof PUCHA have resulted in higher cost for consumers. These regulations \nnot only restrict the ability of electric producers to compete in a \nfree market economy, but also restrict these companies from responding \nto the seasonal nature of electric demand.\n  Many States have begun to address this issue by moving forward to a \nfully competitive electric market that allows consumer choice. Due to \nthe cumbersome regulatory structure imposed upon them under the PUCHA \nsystem, States will not be able to achieve the full benefits of \ncompetition.\n  S. 621 seeks to correct this while retaining essential consumer \nprotections. Further, this bill allows the utility industry the \nflexibility to invest, diversify, and respond to current consumer \ndemand. By passing S. 621 we can reduce burdens on utilities and create \nsavings which would then be passed on to ratepayers.\n  Mr. President, the time to act on S. 621 is now. There is simply no \nreason why we should delay action on repeal when the passage of this \nbill clearly preserves the fundamental principles of free enterprise \nand capitalism on which our great country was founded. I thank the \nchair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5472-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO ROBERT BOWEN\n              WINNER OF 1998 VITA WIRELESS SAMARITAN AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Robert Bowen for receiving the 1998 VITA Wireless \nSamaritan Award. The award is given by the Cellular Telecommunications \nIndustry to recognize the contributions of individuals who used their \ncellular phone to heroically help their communities. Robert is a clear \nexample of how matching emergency situations with technology can impact \npeople's lives.\n  Robert Bowen is a police officer who is the head of the Keene Crime \nWatch Bike Patrol. Robert was on patrol one day when the local police \nreceived a frantic call reporting a missing child. The police, in turn, \nalerted Robert on his wireless phone. An eight-year-old, who had run \naway from home, was nowhere to be found and was in need of his daily \nmedication. Robert headed out on the wooded trails to an area he knew \nwas a popular congregation spot for area children. He quickly spotted \nthe boy and doubled back to alert the boy's father. The father and son \nwere reunited, and Robert called the police department on his wireless \nphone to let them know they could call off their search.\n  The Keene Crime Watch Bike Patrol, armed with wireless phones, has \nfound lost children, stopped crimes and brush fires and assisted in \nsimilar emergency situations for the past two years. I congratulate \nRobert for his courage and for demonstrating how police forces are \nutilizing modern technology to protect their communities. I am very \nhonored to have Robert Bowen as a police officer in the Granite State, \nand it is with great pride that I represent him in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5473-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5473-S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                                      U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, FOR TRAVEL FROM JAN. 1, TO MAR. 31, 1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison:\n    Germany................................

(New Position)\n\n            statement on the nomination of patrick a. mulloy\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of Patrick A. Mulloy to the position of Assistant \nSecretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance in the \nInternational Trade Administration (ITA). I believe his many years of \nexperience in dealing with international trade policy issues and his \nunswerving commitment to public service equip him well for this \nchallenge.\n  For over a dozen years, Mr. Mulloy has had major responsibility for \nthe development of all legislation dealing with international trade and \nfinance in the Senate Banking Committee. His expertise spans export \nadministration, export promotion, exchange rates, foreign investment, \ninternational banking, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He played \na lead role in developing the Export Enhancement Act of 1993 and has \ndemonstrated an ability to work with lawmakers on both sides of the \naisle. For many years, he also has served as the Banking Committee's \nadvisor to U.S. negotiating teams at the GATT and WTO and contributed \nto the successes achieved during these negotiations.\n  Patrick Mulloy's diverse career experience, spanning the State \nDepartment, Justice Department and the Senate Banking Committee, have \ngiven him an unusual depth of perspective on international economic \npolicy issues. I am confident that, as Assistant Secretary of Commerce, \nhe will work diligently to help ensure that U.S. businesses are given \nevery opportunity to compete freely and fairly in the global \nmarketplace of the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Patrick Mulloy to be Assistant Secretary \nof Commerce for Market Access and Compliance.\n  I have known Pat since he came to work for the Senate Banking \nCommittee in 1983 as a Congressional Fellow from the Justice \nDepartment. Pat made such a strong impression during his fellowship \nthat the then ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, Senator \nProxmire, hired him to be Minority General Counsel, a position which he \nheld from 1984 to 1986. After the Senate changed hands in 1987, Pat \nbecame General Counsel for the majority and served in that capacity \nuntil 1989. When Senator Proxmire retired in 1989, Pat became Senior \nCounsel and International Affairs Advisor to the new chairman, Senator \nRiegle. Since 1992 he has served as Chief International Counsel for the \nDemocratic members of the Committee. Since 1995, when I became ranking \nDemocrat on the Banking Committee, Pat has worked directly for me.\n  The first point I want to make about Pat is that he is a career \npublic servant. He holds a B.A., Magna Cum Laude, from Kings College \nPennsylvania, an M.A. in International Politics from Notre Dame where \nhe was a University Fellow, a J.D. degree with Honors from George \nWashington Law School, and an LL.M. from Harvard Law School. He began \nhis professional career as a Foreign Service Officer in the State \nDepartment, where he served from 1965 to 1973. From 1973 to 1977 he \nserved as a Trial Attorney in the Land and Resources Division of the \nJustice Department, and from 1979 to 1982 he served as Senior Attorney \nin the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. It was from that \nposition that Pat came to work for the Senate Banking Committee.\n  During his tenure on the Banking Committee, Pat has played a lead \nrole in every major international finance and trade issue the Committee \nhas\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\ndealt with. These include enactment of the International Lending \nSupervision Act; amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, the Export Administration \nAct, and the trade promotion programs of the Commerce Department; and \nthe exchange rate, third world debt, and foreign investment provisions \nof the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. He helped draft \nthe Export Enhancement Act of 1992 which established the Trade \nPromotion Coordinating Committee. He was intimately involved as a \nCongressional Advisor in the negotiation of the recently concluded \nagreement on trade in financial services in the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  I can think of no one better prepared or suited to serve in the \nposition of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and \nCompliance. Pat brings a deep background and expertise in international \ntrade and finance. He has served in the executive branch and the \nCongress, and in both capacities has worked closely with private sector \nbusiness and labor groups affected by trade policies. He also brings a \npassionate personal commitment to opening foreign markets to U.S. \nexports and expanding job opportunities for American workers.\n  Pat is a person of the highest intelligence, integrity, and \ncommitment to public service. He has been an enormously effective \nmember of the staff of the Senate Banking Committee, and I have come to \nrely with great confidence on his judgment and expertise. The fact that \nSenator D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, as well \nas myself introduced Pat at his confirmation hearing before the Senate \nFinance Committee suggests the deep professional and personal regard in \nwhich he is held by members of the Senate Banking Committee on both \nsides of the aisle. Pat has my unreserved support for confirmation to \nthis important position.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nspeak briefly on behalf of a fellow Virginian, Patrick Mulloy, who is \nthe Administration's nominee for Assistant Secretary for Market Access \nand Compliance at the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n  In this position, Mr. Mulloy will play a critical role in shaping our \nnation's future. International trade continues to become increasingly \nimportant to our own economic development and it is vital that we \nstrive to improve access to overseas markets for American businesses. \nThe Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance will also play \na primary role in strengthening the overall international trade and \ninvestment position of the United States.\n  Mr. Mulloy has worked for many years in the public sector. He served \nas a foreign service officer at the Department of State and as an \nattorney at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division before coming \nto Capitol Hill in 1983. During his time on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mulloy \nhas worked on most of the international trade and finance issues within \nthe jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs, such as third world debt, international economic coordination \nand exchanges, trade promotion, export controls and international \nbanking.\n  I'm confident that Pat Mulloy will serve with distinction as \nAssistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance. As a long-time \nCounsel for the Senate Banking Committee, he has already contributed a \ngreat deal to much of the legislation that has guided our trade \npolicies. I know that the Banking Committee staff will miss Pat Mulloy, \nbut I'm pleased the nation will continue to benefit from his excellent \nservice at the Department of Commerce.\n  I urge my Colleagues to approve his nomination.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Senate has just confirmed the \nnomination of Patrick A. Mulloy for Assistant Secretary of Commerce for \nmarket access and compliance. I strongly support his nomination and \nbelieve the country will be well served by his appointment.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I was given a seat on the Senate \nBanking Committee where Pat was a senior staff member. Pat's knowledge \nof the rules and procedures of the Senate was invaluable to me. Many a \nSenator has drawn upon Pat's expertise and institutional memory, and he \nis widely respected on both sides of the aisle.\n  Pat is recognized as one of the Senate's leading experts in \ninternational trade and finance matters. He has spent countless hours \nworking on international trade agreements that are helping open up \nforeign markets to the U.S. financial services industry. Few people \nhave fought as hard for our interests as has Pat. The Senate will \nsorely miss him.\n  The Commerce Department will benefit from Pat's enthusiasm, \nintelligence and personal warmth. The country is fortunate to have some \nwith Pat's commitment to public service. I wish him the best of luck in \nhis new endeavor and look forward to continuing to work with him on \nimportant issues facing the country.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto support the nomination of Pat Mulloy for the position of Assistant \nSecretary for Market Access and Compliance at the Department of \nCommerce. He will be a real asset to the Department of Commerce.\n  Pat Mulloy has been a key member of the Banking Committee staff for \nabout thirteen years, and he has played a major role in all of the \ninternational economic and trade legislation acted on by the Committee \nover that period. I and my staff have worked closely with Mr. Mulloy on \nissues such as the Export Enhancement Act of 1993, which, among other \nthings, reauthorized Eximbank's charter. He has the respect of all of \nthe Members of the Banking Committee, both Democratic and Republican.\n  Pat Mulloy not only has extensive legislative expertise with \ninternational economic and trade issues, he also has considerable \neconomic and international experience in the executive branch of the \nfederal government. Before coming to the Banking Committee, Mr. Mulloy \nwas an attorney with the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, \nand a foreign service officer at the State Department.\n  Mr. Mulloy has the background and the kind of good judgement that is \nso needed. The Commerce Department will benefit from his real \ncommitment to principle, and dedication to public service.\n  In closing, Mr. President I would like to relate a story Mr. Mulloy \ntold the Finance Committee during his nomination hearing. Mr. Mulloy \nstated that when he went off to grade school each morning, his mother \nwould put the sign of the cross on his head and say ``Goodbye, good \nluck, and God Bless You, and grow up to be President.'' While his new \nposition will not take him to the White House, I am sure his mother \nwould join us in saying goodbye, good luck, and God Bless You. We wish \nyou well. I encourage all of my colleagues to support Pat Mulloy's \nnomination.\n\n\n             statement on the nomination of joan a. dempsey\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend to my colleagues \nthe nomination of Joan A. Dempsey, the former Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and most recently \nthe Director of Central Intelligence's Chief of Staff. Ms. Dempsey is \nthe first nominee for the newly created position of Deputy Director of \nCentral Intelligence for Community Management.\n  Although Ms. Dempsey was nominated by the President just before the \nSenate adjourned last November, the Vice Chairman and I have waited to \nconsider the nomination until outstanding issues regarding other \npositions created by the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1997 were resolved.\n  We have reached an accommodation with the Director of Central \nIntelligence on these other positions, and we expect the President to \nput forward a nominee for the position of Assistant Director of Central \nIntelligence (ADCI) for Administration, soon. We have also agreed to \nallow the DCI to fill the positions of ADCI for Collection and ADCI for \nAnalysis and Production without exercising the Senate's right for \nadvice and consent, for up to one year, while we assess the new \nmanagement structure.\n  Ms. Dempsey appeared before the Committee in an open hearing on May \n21, 1998. It is apparent that Ms. Dempsey is a well qualified career \nintelligence professional. The Committee is confident that she is \nentirely capable\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nof doing a fine job as the Deputy DCI for Community Management.\n  The Intelligence Community is facing a time of revolutionary change \nthat is driven by the explosion of information technology. These rapid \nchanges in technology must be assessed, evaluated and quickly \nintegrated into all phases of the intelligence cycle. The Community \nmust also have the flexibility to quickly focus on new and sometimes \nnon-traditional targets. This requirement for flexibility was most \nrecently underscored by the failure to anticipate the nuclear tests \nconducted by India. These events caught the Intelligence Community by \nsurprise despite plenty of strategic warning that Indian leaders \nplanned to revise their nation's nuclear policy. I do not agree with \nthose who say that ``we weren't surprised'' by the tests because, in \nhindsight, they logically followed from what was being said publicly.\n  This was a huge intelligence failure. As Zbigniew Brzezinski said in \na recent editorial: ``India's nuclear weapons tests . . . signal a \ntruly consequential intelligence scandal.'' He went on to say: ``. . . \nit is the task of the intelligence community to detect, in a timely \nfashion, major foreign initiatives or programs that bear either on \nAmerican security or affect American foreign policy interests.'' More \npointed than my own recent criticisms, Mr. Brzezinski concluded that \n``the failure . . . in the case of India suggests significant and truly \ndisturbing incompetence both on the level of collection and analysis \nwithin the intelligence community.'' Mr. president, we can debate the \nnature of the failure, but it was a failure nonetheless.\n  Did the Community fail because of the way collection priorities were \nassessed and assigned? Was there too much reliance on certain types of \nintelligence collection and information? Is the ``Intelligence \nCommunity'' acting cohesively as a community, or is it resisting truly \neffective integration because of concerns over bureaucratic turf? Who \nbrokers potential disputes over such turf and who has the authority to \narbitrate agreements that are honored? These are all very important \nquestions and the Intelligence Committee is seeking answers.\n  In my view, the issues facing the Intelligence Community today are \nnot solely a function of the level of resources that are available, \neven though this is a significant part of the problem. The Intelligence \nCommunity is still in many ways reacting to a changing world and not \nyet anticipating it. The Intelligence Community often displays the \nsymptoms of an entrenched and calcified bureaucracy. This, Mr. \nPresident, must change.\n  In the final analysis, our Intelligence agencies are accountable to \nthe American people for two basic things: (1) to alert them to external \nthreats; and (2) to spend their tax dollars efficiently and \neffectively. A great deal of the responsibility for these matters will \nrest on this nominee's shoulders. The Committee believes that she \npossesses the knowledge and leadership qualities that this new position \nwill demand. We look to Ms. Dempsey to assist the DCI in ensuring that \nthe Intelligence Community attains these goals and lives up to the \nhighest standards of accountability as they work toward them.\n  Mr. President, the Committee has reported the nomination of Joan A. \nDempsey to be Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and we recommend \nthat the nomination be confirmed. I urge my colleagues to support the \nrecommendation of the Committee and vote in favor of Ms. Dempsey's \nnomination. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I stand today to join Chairman Shelby in \npresenting the nomination of Ms. Joan Dempsey to be Deputy Director of \nCentral Intelligence for Community Management.\n  The President has chosen well. In my view, there is no one in the \ncountry more qualified to be Deputy DCI for Community Management than \nJoan Dempsey. I recall when Congress created these new confirmable \npositions there was concern voiced in some quarters that they would be \nfilled by political people rather than by professionals. Ms. Dempsey \nproves the concern groundless. In fact, she is the consummate \nintelligence professional. She has managed a major national \nintelligence budget. She has brought together the strands of different \nintelligence disciplines to produce finished intelligence to support \nour military. She has overseen all the national intelligence agencies \nwhich are also combat support agencies of the Defense Department. She \nknows this business.\n  Community management means allocating resources and work among the \ndifferent agencies in the optimistically-titled ``intelligence \ncommunity,'' and then combining the product of different agencies and \ndisciplines into a piece of intelligence that helps keep the country \nsafe. The Director of Central Intelligence has the responsibility to \nperform this function for national intelligence, and he has a staff to \nhelp him do it. Congress has believed for several years that he needed \nthe clout of several Presidentially-appointed, Senatorially-confirmed \nofficials to help him execute this management responsibility, and today \nwe consider the nominee for the first and most senior of these \npositions.\n  Success in this position will require the full range of management \ntraits, but professional knowledge will probably be the most necessary: \nknowing the strengths and limitations of each agency in the community, \nknowing the technologies to improve analysis, production, and \ndissemination, knowing the needs of the many and varied customers for \nintelligence, from the President right down to the combat pilots \ngetting briefed for a mission. You don't get this kind of knowledge out \nof a book. You get it from years of experience and the constant \nchallenges of the real world of intelligence. Ms. Dempsey has that \nexperience and has met those challenges.\n  Intelligence is an essential element of our national power. \nIntelligence has always had the task of warning our policymakers and \nour military so they can deter war. Intelligence is also a force \nmultiplier for our military, particularly now that intelligence rides \nand guides America's smart weapons. Really complete intelligence \ncoverage provides a sense of American omniscience in the minds of our \nadversaries, and this sense alone can have a deterrent effect. We are \nsometimes well short of omniscience, as in the recent case of India's \nnuclear tests. But knowledge superiority should be our constant goal, \nand the position for which Ms. Dempsey has been nominated has a central \nrole in achieving it.\n  Technology has changed, the threats have changed, but the requirement \nfor the best intelligence is as acute as ever. I am certain Ms. Dempsey \nwill help us achieve that goal.\n\n\n              STATEMENT ON THE NOMINATION OF FRED HOCHBERG\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I strongly support the nomination of Fred Hochberg to \nbecome Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA). \nThe Deputy Administrator oversees the day to day operations of the \nimportant financial business education and procurement assistance \nprograms of the SBA to ensure that they are run efficiently and \neffectively. With more than 20 years of business experience, Fred \nHochberg is perfectly suited to step right in and assist the SBA to \nrefine its management structure to insure the SBA is an effective \nfinancial institution in the next century, capable of and dedicated to \noffering genuine help to entrepreneurs and small businesses that are \nthe engine of our free enterprise economy.\n  Fred Hochberg has lived the American dream and will bring that \nexperience to the Small Business Administration. His parents immigrated \nfrom Europe at the beginning of this century. In 1951, Lillian Vernon, \nFred's mother, started the Lillian Vernon Company with $2,000 she \nreceived from her wedding. With Lillian's hard work and persistence the \nsmall business grew over the years. Fred Hochberg joined the business \nafter receiving a Masters in Business Administration degree from \nColumbia University and has served as President and Chief Operating \nOfficer. Under Fred Hochberg's tenure as President and with his \nmother's help, the Lillian Vernon Company built a sophisticated \ninternational mail order company that today serves more than five \nmillion customers.\n  Fred Hochberg has mastered the challenges of developing a small \nbusiness into an international corporation. He managed the complex \ntransition of a family-run business into a publicly held corporation. \nToday, the Lillian\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\nVernon Company has 1,400 employees and has annual sales of $250 \nmillion. No one better knows the problems facing small business today \nthan someone who has been involved in a family-owned business for the \npast 20 years.\n  When Fred Hochberg appeared before the Senate Small Business \nCommittee earlier this month for his confirmation hearing, he told the \nCommittee ``I understand what American entrepreneurs put into their \nenterprises: the seven-day weeks, the hard work and sweat equity--\nbecause that's where I come from. I intend to bring these values to my \nwork at the SBA.'' Now he will bring the talent, experience and hard \nwork to lead the SBA and its wide array of programs into the 21st \ncentury.\n  I congratulate the President for this nomination. I thank Chairman \nBond and Majority Leader Lott for agreeing to bring this nomination \nbefore the Senate. And I look forward to Fred Hochberg's arrival at the \nSmall Business Administration where I believe he will make a very \nconsiderable contribution to the small businesses of our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5481-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Treaty should be an effective \ntool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, \nincluding terrorism, other violent crimes, drug trafficking, money \nlaundering, and other ``white-collar'' crime. The Treaty is self-\nexecuting.\n  The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal \nmatters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: \nlocating or identifying persons or items; serving documents; taking \ntestimony or statements of persons; transferring persons in custody for \ntestimony or other purposes; providing documents, records, and articles \nof evidence; executing requests for searches and seizures; immobilizing \nassets; assisting in proceedings related to forfeiture of assets, \nrestitution, and criminal fines; and providing any other assistance \nconsistent with the laws of the Requested State.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, May 22, 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\nTo The Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Inter-American Convention for the \nProtection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, with Annexes, done at \nCaracas December 1, 1996, (the ``Convention''), which was signed by the \nUnited States, subject to ratification, on December 13, 1996. I also \ntransmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nSecretary of State with respect to the Convention.\n  All species of sea turtles found in the Western Hemisphere are \nthreatened or endangered, some critically so. Because sea turtles \nmigrate extensively, effective protection and conservation of these \nspecies requires cooperation among States within the sea turtles' \nmigratory range. Although the international community has banned trade \nin sea turtles and sea turtle products pursuant to the Convention on \nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the \nConvention I am transmitting is the first multilateral agreement that \nactually sets standards to protect and conserve sea turtles and their \nhabitats.\n  In section 609 of Public Law 101-162, the Congress called for the \nnegotiation of multilateral agreements for the protection and \nconservation of sea turtles. In close cooperation with Mexico, the \nUnited States led a 3-year effort to negotiate the Convention with \nother Latin American and Caribbean nations. Once ratified and \nimplemented, the Convention will enhance the conservation of this \nhemisphere's sea turtles and harmonize standards for their protection.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Convention and give its advice and consent to its ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, May 22, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/22/senate-section/article/S5485-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AUTHORIZING THE FLYING OF THE POW/MIA FLAG\n\n  Mr. ENZI.
