Mr. President, before I talk about today's schedule, I do \nwant to commend a number of Senators who have been doing yeomen's work \nover the past 2 days. Even though we haven't had a lot of recorded \nvotes, we have been making good progress. I remind the Senate that we \ndid come to an agreement after actually at least 3 years of going back \nand forth on a bipartisan Amtrak bill, which passed on Friday on a \nvoice vote. That now will be in conference, and I think there is even a \nchance that we could get an agreement on that conference report before \nwe go out. If we don't, it will be something we should reach early \nagreement on in conference when we come back after the first of the \nyear.\n  Also, the Senate did agree to pass a fix with regard to ISTEA, or the \nhighway infrastructure bill, which is now before the House for their \nconsideration.\n\n                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   N O T I C E                                                  \n                                                                                                                \n     Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \n    the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on (the 31st day after adjournment), in order to  \n                                permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.                              \n       All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the   \n       Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or ST-41 of the Capitol), no later than 10 days following      \n    adjournment.

I think this will be, frankly, one of the things \nthat we will be most proud of when this year is concluded. We did that \nlast night. Once, again, after a lot of hard work and good cooperation, \nthat passed last night on a voice vote.\n  Today, continued effort will be made to get an agreement in \nconference for the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. Probably \n12 or 14 times we reached agreement and closed the conference, all to \nfind that something was misplaced along the way or the agreement was \nnot what others had thought it would be, and so it is still alive. I \ntalked again to interested Senators this morning, and they will be \nworking on it today. This, again, is something we need to do before we \nleave. So there is a lot happening in terms of Senators meeting; in the \ncase of FDA reform, the House and Senate Members meeting on the \nconference report. I am looking forward to that agreement being \nreached.\n  Later on today, there is a good possibility that we will consider an \nomnibus appropriations bill to be offered by the chairman and the \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee. We do not now have a \nfixed time agreement, and there is no certainty whether or not there \nwill be a rollcall vote or when that would be. There is still some \ndiscussion going on with regard to that bill. But in any event, once a \ndecision is made on that legislation, if a rollcall vote is required, \nSenators will be notified 1 hour prior to that first vote.\n  We are also continuing to work to see if we can get an agreement to \nmove the District of Columbia appropriations bill through the Senate on \na voice vote and through the House, so it can go down separately for \nthe President's consideration to sign or veto it or to line-item veto \nthe scholarship portion of it, which I think would be a big mistake. \nThat still could come up either on a voice vote or perhaps a recorded \nvote would be required on that, as well as the omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  In addition, the Senate could expect to consider other Legislative or \nExecutive Calendar items. The Executive Calendar now is down to just a \nvery few nominations. Several of them are being held at this time \nbecause of holds on other nominations. Today is the day when Senators \nneed to consider if, in fact, they want to hold these nominations up \nfor the remainder of the year and over into next year. We have worked \nvery assiduously with interested Senators on both sides of the aisle. \nThe administration tried to clear as many of these as possible, and we \nwill do so again today.\n\n  The House of Representatives is, at this point, scheduled to consider \nthe fast-track legislation late this afternoon or early evening. I have \nspoken to House leaders. There is no certainty at this time as to when \nthat vote will occur. It looks to me like it will certainly be late \nafternoon or into the night. Therefore, the Senate can do nothing more \nreally on fast track other than await the action in the House. If they \nshould not pass the bill, then it would be my intent, and I believe it \nwould be agreed to by leaders on both sides of the aisle, not to go \nfurther in the Senate with fast track. If it passes, then we have to \nmake an assessment as to how we can bring it to a conclusion in the \nSenate. That could be tonight, it could be Monday, or it could be \nsomething else, which I don't even want to mention at this point.\n  We also have the three remaining appropriations bills--Commerce, \nState, Justice; District of Columbia; and foreign operations. All of \nthose still have an item or two that are in contention. We don't know \nwhether we will move on the omnibus appropriations bill or whether the \nHouse will decide to go ahead and act on the bills separately and send \nthem to us. But we will be working throughout the day to try to \nascertain when we will get those appropriations bills and in what form.\n  I think then the bottom line is, we do not expect a recorded vote any \ntime soon. Senators will be notified 1 hour in advance should a \nrecorded vote be required this afternoon. All Senators should be aware, \nand they need to keep their schedules clear, so that we can perhaps \nstill have an opportunity to conclude this year's session today or \ntonight.\n  I now ask that there be a period for the transaction of morning \nbusiness----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before he does that, will the majority \nleader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold, and I will be glad to yield, Mr. President, to \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend from Mississippi has raised the \nissue of the appropriations bills. Senators, as he knows, have been \nworking very, very hard on that--the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Stevens, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Byrd, and \nthose of us who are either ranking or chairmen of the appropriate \nsubcommittees that are involved, in this case three key ones.\n  Mr. President, I note, as we have discussed privately, that there \nwill not be a perfect piece of appropriations legislation, I say to my \nfriend from Mississippi, from anyone's point of view. It is not \nprecisely what he would write if he were to write it solely by himself; \nit is not precisely what I would write if I wrote it solely by myself, \nand we could say that with the other 98 men and women in this body.\n  At some point, when you are down to the last few hours of the \nsession, we have to allow the committee system and the leadership \nsystem to work, where senior Members, especially of appropriations, \nwhere senior Members in both parties, in both bodies have to come \ntogether and reach an agreement, realizing that not every single Member \non the left or on the right is going to like it. But you have to trust \nat some point some question of seniority in putting this together.\n  I didn't care much for the seniority system when I came here 23 years \nago, but having studied it for 23 years, I understand it so much better \nnow. I say to my friend, the majority leader, and I think he would \nagree with me, that in the last few days of the session, especially \nwith appropriations, you are not going to get a bill that is going to \nplease every single Member 100 percent, but we have to get something \ndone because at some point you have to fish or cut bait.\n  I just mention that because I know the distinguished majority leader \nhas been working as hard on this as anybody else to get us to this \npoint.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have used those exact words, I might say, ``fish or cut \nbait.''\n\n  I will note again, we made tremendous progress in the past week on \nappropriations bills and other issues. I mentioned Amtrak, the highway \nbill, FDA, adoption and foster care, and I believe even on \nappropriations bills basically everything has been worked out but one \nissue. Obviously, we concluded an acceptable compromise on the Labor-\nHHS appropriations conference report involving the testing language.\n  I believe we have an agreement worked out with regard to the census \nlanguage that would be incorporated in the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill.\n  I believe the two remaining issues for the year boil down to this: \nCan the House get the votes for fast track, since the Senate has \nalready spoken overwhelmingly with votes of 68 and 67 for cloture \nmotions to limit the debate so we can get to final passage, and the \nother one is the foreign operations bill, which includes a number of \nvery important issues. Obviously, it involves the funds for our foreign \noperations; it involves the agreement with regard to how much would be \npaid for the U.N. arrearages; it involves the State Department \nauthorization and reform and reorganization bill; it involves funds for \nthe International Monetary Fund. But the one issue that is holding it \nall up, basically, boils down to whether or not the taxpayers' dollars \nwill be used to promote and encourage foreign governments to encourage \nabortions. The bill that I thought we had agreed to provided a waiver \nwhere the President could waive that, but it would affect the funds.\n  It has gotten down to a very narrow issue. You are right, we are not \ngoing\n\n[[Page S12219]]\n\nto come to an agreement that every Senator will agree to, but I think \nwe are close enough on that issue that we ought to be able to reach \nagreement and bring the foreign operations appropriations conference \nreport to a conclusion. And if we can get that agreement and fast \ntrack, we will have completed the year on a very high note and one that \nthe American people, I think, will be proud of and of which we could be \nproud.\n  The taxpayers of the United States have had a pretty good year. We \nwould like to end up with agreements on these important issues. \nCertainly, it won't be perfect, as the Senator has said, but we have \ntried compromise after compromise after compromise. So far, none of \nthem have taken hold. But I have faith that on Sunday, we will find a \nway to do that. Certainly, I do think that senior Members and leaders \nhave to step up to these challenges and get the job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12217-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I will be very brief because I see other \nSenators waiting to take the floor. I will note a couple of things. The \ndistinguished majority leader has mentioned that it is Sunday. The \nguest Chaplain today, Father Paul Lavin of St. Joseph's Church, is my \npastor when I am away from my home in Vermont, which is not often on a \nSunday.\n  But this Sunday is extraordinary, that is, being in Washington and \nnot in Vermont.\n  Father Lavin also prayed for, in the mass this morning which my wife \nand I attended, the Congress and the Government, and so forth, as we \nall do.\n  Sometimes we have to be careful we don't get too much of what we pray \nfor, but I think it would probably be safe to say, as I look around at \nthe staff and everybody else here, that they were probably praying that \nit would come to a conclusion.\n  In that respect, I note, Mr. President, as I have in other years, \nthat while I may joke about Senators being nothing but constitutional \nimpediments to the staff, the fact is, the U.S. Senate, the greatest \nparliamentary body in the world, could not exist without the \nextraordinarily talented men and women who work on Capitol Hill for \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, for committees, for the Senate \nitself, and those who take the notes of our proceedings, to those who \nkeep the procedures of the Senate moving.\n  I say a special compliment to the young men and women who come here \nand serve as pages, come from all over the country and serve here as \npages. I have been fortunate to have had a series of some of the most \nexemplary young men and women from Vermont who have served here as \npages. They go through a rigorous screening process. Only the best get \npicked. And they go back to be the best among our citizens in our own \nState.\n  The people in this country ofttimes do not realize the extraordinary \ndedication of the men and women who work here who sometimes put in \nliterally around-the-clock hours and days, who literally give of \nthemselves more than any private industry could ever expect of anyone. \nAnd that is what makes the Senate work.\n  My friend from Mississippi and I were discussing earlier putting \ntogether this last-minute legislation. Well, we can make some policy \ndecisions, but it is these people who have to then pull it together. \nFor Foreign operations, Tim Rieser, from my staff, carries out my \nduties as ranking member on that. There are dozens of others on both \nsides that have to do this--Robin Cleveland for Senator McConnell, who \nis the chairman of that subcommittee.\n  And it is the same with all the subcommittees, trying to pull these \npieces together and actually have the paper. We stand up and say \n``aye'' or ``nay,'' but they have to have the papers on the floor in \nperfect condition for us to vote on them.\n  Then, whether it is the people in the Cloakroom, the people back at \nour offices, or anybody else, they also give up their family time to be \nhere for the good of the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12219-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOREIGN AID\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope we can complete these foreign aid \nbills. I would also say to my friend from Mississippi, he mentioned \nwhether we should use taxpayers' money for abortion in the foreign aid \nbill. There is a specific prohibition against any U.S. dollars being \nused for abortions abroad in the foreign aid bill.\n  In fact, as Senator Mark Hatfield, former chairman of the \nAppropriation Committee, and I pointed out on the floor earlier--he was \nvery much a right-to-life, antiabortion Senator, consistent in that--\npointed out that the family planning moneys that have gone in the \nforeign aid bill have dramatically decreased the number of abortions in \nthose areas where they were used.\n  An example was Russia where abortion was used as a form of birth \ncontrol, where we gave them family planning money and the number of \nabortions dropped dramatically.\n  So I hope that we will continue to do that and realize, while family \nplanning is something available to most people in the United States, in \na lot of other countries it is not available because of costs, because \nof techniques, because of training, for whatever reason. Unfortunately, \nin those countries ofttimes abortions are a means of family planning. \nSo I hope that those who are against abortion would realize family \nplanning money can help us prevent that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12219-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12219-S12222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then lastly, Mr. President--I will probably speak on this \nagain this afternoon. If we go out, it means there will not be a chance \nto confirm a number of judges who are pending, who have been pending \nfor a considerable period of time; one in particular, who has been \nvoted out of our committee twice, once last year and again this year, \nMargaret Morrow, one of the most qualified people, man or woman, ever \nto be nominated to be a district court judge.\n  We also have what I think is the shocking situation of Bill Lann Lee, \nwho has been subjected to some of the most scurrilous charges--charges, \nunfortunately, repeated even by Members of the Senate. The charges have \nbeen refuted, but need to be refuted in a hearing. We have asked for a \nfurther hearing on Bill Lann Lee just so those charges can be refuted. \nWe have been told that we cannot have that hearing.\n  I renew the request. We should have it.\n  We talk about civil rights in this country. The civil rights of this \ncountry are determined by having strong laws and strong people to \nenforce those laws. I do not believe in the better natures of our souls \nas Americans that all of us would support the civil rights of all \nothers simply in a vacuum. Many of us would; others do need the \nrequirement of a law to do that.\n  I would like to think that I am a person who would never break into \nan unlocked, unguarded warehouse in the middle of the night to steal \nthings. But we have laws and locks to prevent others who may not feel \nas strongly motivated to obey the commandment: ``Thou shalt not \nsteal.''\n  By the same token, we set up laws that say: ``You shall not \ndiscriminate. You shall protect the civil rights of all Americans.'' \nThose laws need to be enforced. We do not have a chief enforcer now. \nThe President has nominated Bill Lann Lee, a most qualified person for \nthat position.\n  Unfortunately, the debate on this fine nominee took a decidedly \npartisan turn when the Speaker of the House chose to intervene in this \nmatter and urge the Senate Republican leader to kill this nomination. \nHe waited until after the confirmation hearing to raise and \nmischaracterize a case about which no member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Republican or Democrat, had asked a single question. Indeed, \napparently unaware of the decision of his\n\n[[Page S12220]]\n\nparty leaders to defeat this nominee, Chairman Hatch predicted on the \nweekend news programs following the hearing that the nomination would \nbe reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee but might face tough \ngoing on the Senate floor.\n  In his unfortunate letter, Speaker Gingrich unfairly criticized Mr. \nLee and accused him of unethical conduct. Since that letter Speaker \nGingrich's charges have been repeated over and over again. Indeed, \nSenator Hatch devoted an entire section of his statement last Tuesday \nopposing Mr. Lee to the Tipton-Whittingham case. Because of the \nmischaracterizations of this case and the misstatements of Mr. Lee's \nrecord and because Republican opponents are now distorting and \ncontorting Mr. Lee's views, testimony and work, I thought it \nappropriate to request an opportunity for Bill Lee to respond to the \nfalse charges and impression being espoused by his opposition. I \nthought it only fair.\n  On behalf of and along with the other minority members of the \nJudiciary Committee, I sent Senator Hatch a letter yesterday formally \nrequesting such a hearing. The chairman refused our request for a \nhearing. That is unfortunate. He explained on a Sunday talk show \nmorning that all the questions that would be raised at an additional \nhearing had already been covered and implied that questions about the \nTipton-Whittingham case had been asked in the extensive written \nquestions to Mr. Lee that followed the hearing.\n  In fact, no Senator asked a single question about the Tipton-\nWhittingham case at the October 22 hearing and, although, Mr. Lee was \nsent page after page of written questions following the hearing, only \nSenator Hatch asked about the case. Unfortunately, Senator Hatch's \nquestion and its answer have been ignored by those opposing Mr. Lee. \nSpeaker Gingrich and others are making false charges and the nominee \nhas been given no fair opportunity to set the record straight.\n\n  Let me explain what the Tipton-Whittingham case is about. I regret \nhaving to discuss this matter at all since it remains a pending matter \nin the District Court for the Central District of California. The case \nincludes serious allegations of sexual harassment and gender and racial \ndiscrimination involving the Los Angeles Police Department arising in \npart from an association of officers, called ``Men Against Women,'' \nwhich was apparently organized by former Los Angeles Police detective \nMark Fuhrman.\n  The allegations of wrongdoing carelessly lodged against Mr. Lee are \ncontradicted by the Republican mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, \nas well as the vice-president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, T. \nWarren Jackson, the assistant city attorney, Robert Cramer, and the \ncity attorney, James K. Hahn. I ask unanimous consent that their \nletters be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recall when times were different. I \nrecall when charges were raised against Clarence Thomas and the \nJudiciary Committee held several days of additional hearings after that \nnomination had already been reported by the Judiciary Committee to the \nfull Senate. There was a tie vote in committee on the Thomas \nnomination, which would not have even been reported to the Senate had \nwe not also voted virtually unanimously, with six Democrats joining \nseven Republicans, to report the Thomas nomination to the floor without \nrecommendation. Of course, ultimately the nomination of Judge Thomas to \nbecome Justice Thomas was confirmed by the Senate.\n  Over the last decade and one-half Republicans have pioneered and \ndeveloped procedures whereby the Judiciary Committee has reported to \nthe Senate for its consideration nominations on which the committee had \ncome to a tie vote and even, in the case of Judge Bork's nomination to \nthe Supreme Court, an overwhelmingly negative vote.\n  I recall for example the nomination of Daniel Manion which was \nreported to the Senate after a tie vote and was ultimately approved by \nthe Senate. I recall, as well, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the \nSupreme Court which was reported after a tie vote and ultimately \napproved by the Senate.\n  Time after time during the Reagan and Bush years the Republicans on \nthe Judiciary Committee urged that the full Senate be permitted to \ndecide these questions. Senator Thurmond argued in favor of reporting \nan executive branch nomination on which the committee had voted \nnegatively, noting:\n\n       As long as I am a member of this Committee, I will give an \n     opportunity, whether it is majority or minority, to send the \n     nominations to the Senate. I think the Senate is entitled to \n     the recommendation [of the Committee], and you made the \n     recommendation by the vote just taken. But I think the Senate \n     is entitled to a vote on this matter, I think the President \n     is entitled for the Senate to vote, and I think the country \n     is entitled for the Senate to vote. I would hope it would be \n     sent to the Senate and let the full Senate act.\n\n  I have been one, frankly, who has not always supported such action. \nIt took a while to bring me around. But I joined in voting to report \nthe Thomas nomination after a tie vote.\n  It remains my hope that we will find a way to show Bill Lee the same \nfairness that we showed Clarence Thomas and allow his nomination to be \ndebated and voted upon by the U.S. Senate. It would be ironic if, after \nthe Senate proceeded to debate and vote on the Thomas nomination--one \nthat included charges that he engaged in sexual harassment, the \nRepublican leadership prevented the Senate from considering a nominee \nbecause he has worked to remedy sexual harassment and gender \ndiscrimination.\n\n  I feel confident that this nomination, the first Asian-American to \nhead the Civil Rights Division, would be confirmed by the majority of \nthe Senate. I believe that when the facts and record are reviewed \nfairly and dispassionately he will be confirmed. When the country has \nhad an opportunity to focus on this important nomination and Senators \nhave had a chance to consider how their constituents feel, I am \nconfident that a positive outcome will be assured.\n  From all that I have seen over the past week, it appears to me that \nthe Republican leadership is intent upon seeking to kill this \nnomination and determined to kill it in this committee and never give \nthe Senate an opportunity to consider it. I do not think that it is \nfair or right or right for the country. We need Bill Lee's proven \nproblem-solving abilities in these difficult times.\n  No one can argue that the President has sent to us a person not \nqualified by experience to lead the Civil Rights Division. Bill Lee's \nrecord of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor \nand when he said to this committee that quotas are illegal and wrong \nand that he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about \nhis resolve to do what is right. The Senate should be given the \nopportunity to debate and vote on this outstanding nominee and then \ngive Bill Lee the chance to serve the country and all Americans.\n  I think the Senate has committed a great wrong to him in blocking his \nnomination, that is absolutely wrong.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                              City of Los Angeles,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, March 20, 1997.\n     Erskine Bowles,\n     Chief of Staff, Office of the President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Bill Lann Lee, Candidate for Assistant Attorney General, \n         Civil Rights Division, United States Department of \n         Justice.\n       Dear Mr. Bowles: I am writing to support the appointment of \n     Bill Lann Lee to the United States Department of Justice \n     position of Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights \n     Division. Throughout his distinguished career as a civil \n     rights lawyer, Mr. Lee has worked to advance the civil rights \n     progress of the nation and of our richly diverse city of Los \n     Angeles.\n       In my opinion, Bill Lee is an astute lawyer who is superbly \n     qualified to enforce our national civil rights laws. Mr. \n     Lee's candidacy offers the President an excellent opportunity \n     to reaffirm his strong support of women's rights and civil \n     rights laws.\n       Mr. Lee first became known to me as opposing counsel in an \n     important civil rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los \n     Angeles. As Mayor, I took a leading role in settling that \n     case. The work of my opponents rarely evoke my praise, but \n     the negotiations could not have concluded successfully \n     without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.\n       I know that his expertise is the result of working twenty-\n     two years in the ``All Star'' leagues of civil rights \n     litigators. His track record is nationally renowned and \n     speaks for\n\n[[Page S12221]]\n\n     itself. Beyond the many victories, what makes his work \n     special is that he has represented clients from every \n     background, including poor whites, women and children \n     suffering from lead poisoning. His admirable ability to win \n     the trust of so many communities is evident in the broad \n     coalition of civil rights and women's rights experts who are \n     backing his candidacy for this position.\n       Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does \n     not believe in quotas. He has pursued flexible and reasonable \n     remedies that in each case were approved by a court.\n       Mr. Lee is an outstanding citizen of Los Angeles. He has my \n     enthusiastic support and strongest recommendation for the \n     position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard J. Riordan,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Los Angeles Police Commission,\n\n                                Los Angeles, CA, November 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As Vice-President of the Los Angeles \n     Police Commission, and a Governor Wilson appointee to the \n     California Fair Employment & Housing Commission (the state's \n     civil rights enforcement agency), please allow me to clarify \n     the record and give my unqualified support for Bill Lann Lee \n     to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The \n     clarification involves a case entitled Tipton-Whittingham, et \n     al. v. City of Los Angeles, wherein allegations of sexual \n     harassment and sex discrimination in the Los Angeles Police \n     Department (``LAPD'') have been asserted. This case appears \n     to have become an issue in the nomination of Mr. Lee.\n       The allegations in Tipton-Whittingham, while disputed in \n     some respects, are serious matters that the LAPD are \n     committed to addressing. Issues of gender bias and harassment \n     have been raised not only by these plaintiffs but also by \n     independent and respected voices such as the Christopher \n     Commission. The parties engaged in arms length negotiations \n     for more than a year before a proposed partial consent decree \n     was submitted for approval to the Los Angeles City Council \n     and then the Court.\n       The proposed decree was presented to the federal magistrate \n     only after being vetted by the Police Commission, the Mayor's \n     office, the City Council and the City Attorney's office. \n     While members of the Police Commission, including this \n     Commissioner, and the Mayor's office initially objected to \n     specific provisions of the proposed consent decree, those \n     objections were fully heard and addressed before the decree \n     was presented.\n       As you know, that proposed consent decree has not been \n     approved by the Federal Court. In the meantime, the parties \n     are engaged in mediation before Charles G. Bakely, Jr. in the \n     hopes of reaching a complete settlement of the lawsuit. \n     Hopefully, any settlement will ensure that the LAPD of the \n     future is free of racial and gender bias and sexual \n     harassment, and any consent decree will neither on its face \n     nor in operation require or induce unlawful preferences. I \n     hasten to add, however, that the proposed partial consent \n     decree previously submitted to the Federal Court had that \n     same objective.\n       As a final matter, in my role as Assistant General Counsel \n     for Hughes Electronics responsible for labor and employment \n     law matters, I have opposed Mr. Lee in employment litigation. \n     I was then and continue to be impressed by his balance, \n     ethics, intelligence and commitment to reaching practical \n     solutions. In my view, he would be an outstanding addition to \n     the Department of Justice.\n       Should you have any questions regarding the above, please \n     do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                T. Warren Jackson,\n     Vice-President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Office of the City Attorney,\n\n                                Los Angeles, CA, October 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Bill Lann Lee Confirmation.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As an Assistant City Attorney for \n     the City of Los Angeles--and opposing counsel to Bill Lann \n     Lee in recent federal civil rights litigation--I read with \n     concern the October 27 letter to you from the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives. I believe the Speaker has been \n     misinformed about many of the facts set out in that letter, \n     and therefore the conclusions he reaches about Mr. Lee's \n     fitness for public office, and in particular for the position \n     of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, are \n     unwarranted.\n       The Speaker's letter begins by asserting that Mr. Lee \n     ``attempted to force through a consent decree mandating \n     racial and gender preferences in the Los Angeles Police \n     Department.'' This assertion is erroneous. In the course of \n     representing the City of Los Angeles, I have for the past \n     seventeen years monitored the City's compliance with consent \n     decrees affecting the hiring, promotion, advancement, and \n     assignment of sworn police officers. I have negotiated on the \n     City's behalf two of those decrees. Of those two, Mr. Lee was \n     opposing counsel on the first, and was associated with \n     opposing counsel on the second. None of these decrees \n     mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact, \n     each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of such \n     preferences.\n       For the same reasons, the Speaker's statement that the use \n     of racial and gender preferences ``would have been a back-\n     door thwarting of the will of the people of California with \n     regard to Proposition 209 (the California Civil Rights \n     Initiative)'' is inapposite. Because the decrees with which \n     Mr. Lee was associated do not call for racial or gender \n     preferences, and in fact forbid them, these decrees do not \n     violate the requirements or the intent of Proposition 209.\n       Of particular concern to me is the Speaker's reference to \n     ``the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently employed dubious \n     means to try to circumscribe the will of the judge in the \n     case.'' Thus allegation is wholly untrue. The case being \n     referred to is presently in litigation in the district court. \n     Mr. Lee was not at any time a named counsel in the case, but \n     was associated with opposing counsel because of his \n     involvement in the negotiation of a related consent decree. \n     Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing counsel attempted in any \n     fashion to thwart the will of the judge supervising the \n     litigation. The matter had been referred by the court to a \n     magistrate judge appointed by the court to assist in the \n     resolution of the case. Each counsel had advised the district \n     judge at all points about the progress of the matter. Upon \n     reconsideration, the district judge elected to assert direct \n     control over the litigation. Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct \n     reflected any violation of the court's rules, either in fact \n     or by appearance.\n       Bill Lann Lee and I have sat on opposite sides of the \n     negotiating table over the course of several years. Although \n     we have disagreed profoundly on many issues, I have \n     throughout the time I have known him respected Bill's candor, \n     his thorough preparation, his sense of ethical behavior, and \n     his ability to bring persons holding diverse views into \n     agreement. He would, in my view, be an outstanding public \n     servant and a worthy addition to the Department of Justice.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Robert Cramer,\n     Assistant City Attorney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                City Attorney,\n\n                                Los Angeles, CA, November 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As City Attorney of the City of Los \n     Angeles I feel compelled to correct the inaccurate and \n     defamatory allegations in the October 27th letter from \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich about Bill Lann Lee.\n       The Speaker's letter charges that Mr. Lee ``attempted to \n     force through a consent decree mandatory racial and gender \n     preferences in the Los Angeles Police Department.'' That \n     assertion is wrong. Mr. Lee participated in two lawsuits \n     against the Los Angeles Police Department several years ago \n     that were resolved by consent decrees, but neither decree \n     mandates the use of racial or gender preferences. In fact, \n     each of them contains provisions forbidding the use of \n     preferences.\n       What is most outrageous about Mr. Gingrich's letter is his \n     reference to ``the allegation that Mr. Lee apparently \n     employed dubious means to try to circumscribe the will of the \n     judge in the case.'' There is simply no truth to this \n     allegation. The facts are these. This case, known as Tipton-\n     Whittingham, is presently in litigation in district court. \n     There are serious allegations of discrimination and \n     harassment being made by the plaintiffs in this case who are \n     women police officers in LAPD. Mr. Lee was not at any time a \n     named counsel in the case, but was associated with opposing \n     counsel because of his involvement in the negotiation of a \n     related consent decree. Neither Mr. Lee nor any opposing \n     counsel attempted in any fashion to thwart the will of the \n     judge supervising the litigation. The matter has been \n     referred by the court to a magistrate judge appointed by the \n     court to assist in the resolution of the case. Each counsel \n     had advised the district judge at all points about the \n     progress of the matter. Upon reconsideration, the district \n     judge elected to assert direct control over the litigation. \n     Nothing in Mr. Lee's conduct reflected any violation of the \n     court's rules, either in fact or by appearance.\n       Bill Lann Lee and I have been on opposite sides of the \n     negotiating table over the years and we have not always \n     agreed. Yet I respect him for his keen intellect, his \n     profound sense of ethics, and his ability to negotiate an \n     outcome that achieves justice and fairness.\n       The United States Senate should not countenance the kind of \n     character assassination based on erroneous information that \n     has occurred in this confirmation process. I'm glad I can \n     help clear the record in this regard.\n       Bill Lann Lee is an outstanding lawyer who embodies the \n     highest ethical traditions of that profession and will be \n     vigilant in his defense of the Constitution and the laws of \n     the United States. He should be confirmed as Assistant \n     Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    James K.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate the fact that one of our finest and brightest and best-liked \nmembers of staff, from the State of Mississippi, is leaving the Senate \nand going back to Mississippi at the end of this month to join one of \nthe leading law firms in our State. I am talking about John Lundy, who \nis chief of staff for my distinguished State colleague, Senator Lott.\n  John Lundy came to Washington in 1987 to work as a legislative \nassistant on the House side of the Capitol. He distinguished himself \nright away with his hard work, his ability to get along with staff \nmembers and Members of the House on both sides of the aisle, as well as \nwork effectively with Senate staffers from our State and Members of the \nSenate.\n  He had a lot to do with the writing of the 1990 farm bill as a member \nof the staff of Larry Combest, Congressman from Texas, who is a Member \nof the Agriculture Committee in the House.\n  John is originally from Leland, MS. He graduated from Mississippi \nState University in 1983 with a degree in agricultural economics. After \ngraduation, he went to work as a research assistant at the Mississippi \nState University Delta Branch Agricultural Experiment Station in \nStoneville, MS, near his hometown of Leland. He then worked for a while \nas a loan officer with a farm credit institution in the Mississippi \nDelta.\n  When he joined Senator Lott's office, he became someone with whom I \nhad an opportunity to work closely over the years. When Senator Lott \nwas elected majority leader, he made John Lundy his chief of staff. \nJohn has been one of my favorites and a good friend to me and to all of \nthe Members of our delegation. We are going to miss him and his lovely \nwife, Hayley, very much, and their daughter, Eliza. They are moving to \nJackson, as I indicated, toward the end of this month.\n  But I wanted to take this opportunity to let other Senators know \nabout his decision to go back to Mississippi and to congratulate him on \nhis distinguished service here in the U.S. Senate as a member of our \nstaff and the House of Representatives staff as well, and to wish him \nall of the best in his new undertaking. I am confident that he will be \na tremendous success in his new association with the law firm in \nJackson.\n  We wish him well. We will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in one of the newspapers I was reading this \nmorning, there was an editorial speaking about the U.S. position in \nsaying that they will work to lead an effort toward the demining of \nantipersonnel landmines around the world, an effort that is already \nwell underway in a number of countries, which is supported partly by \nthe United States in the millions of dollars in humanitarian demining \nefforts.\n  I agree with the President. I agree with the administration's efforts \nto seek more money for demining.\n  We have so many millions of landmines in the ground in 60 to 70 \ncountries that nobody even knows how many landmines are out there. Very \noften the way we find out where they are is when a child or some other \nnoncombatant steps on a landmine, touches a landmine, and is either \ncrippled, maimed, or killed from the explosion.\n  We also know, whether these are $3, $4, or $5 antipersonnel landmines \nstuck in the ground, they can cost a considerable amount of money to \ntake them back out depending on where they are --anywhere from an \naverage of $100 on up to as much as $1,000 per landmine.\n  I agree that the United States, as the most powerful and wealthiest \nNation on the Earth, should do everything possible to try to take \nlandmines out of the ground. But I note the obvious, Mr. President. It \nis like trying to bail out the ocean, if you continue to put new \nlandmines down.\n  Next month, in Ottawa, over 100 nations will come together to sign a \ntreaty banning the placement and use of antipersonnel landmines. One of \nthe most notable exceptions to the signers will be the United States of \nAmerica. I think that is a bad mistake. I think if the United States \nwishes to have leadership and credibility on this issue they should do \nboth--help in the demining, but do the right thing, and that is help \nstop further mining.\n  Until the use of antipersonnel landmines is treated the same way we \ntreat the use of chemical weapons then we will continue to see them and \nwe will continue to see the use of antipersonnel landmines against \ninnocent civilians. They have become more and more--if not exclusively, \nat least primarily--a weapon against civilians. Worse than that, they \nare weapons that stay long after the war is over. Peace agreements are \nsigned, tanks pull away, guns are unloaded, armies march away, and 5 \nyears later a child on the way to school is destroyed and nobody even \nremembers who was fighting, nobody knows who put the weapon there.\n  I just mention, Mr. President, while I support our continued efforts \nto demine and while I take pride in writing much of the legislation to \nget the money for the United States to be involved in humanitarian \ndemining up to this point, I note it falls short of the ultimate goal \nuntil we have a real ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Our friend and colleague, Senator John \nGlenn's historic Friendship 7 mission was launched from Cape Canaveral. \nSo were Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins on their way \nto the first manned Moon landing.\n  For the last 16 years, the world has watched intently as dozens of \nspace shuttle missions have started at the Kennedy Space Center.\n  But as we prepare for the increasingly high-technology, dynamic world \nof the 21st century, space will be more than just a place of \nexploration. In the 4 decades since the Soviet Union launched sputnik \nin October 1957, space has become a site for tremendous scientific \ninnovation. Ball-point pens, velcro, and numerous other consumer \nproducts that make our lives easier are a direct result of the space \nprogram.\n  Medical research has also reaped tremendous benefits from our time in \nspace. And satellite technology has led to revolutionary advances in \nthe way we forecast weather, protect the environment, and communicate \nwith each other.\n  Space may also revolutionize the way we transport goods and services \nand pursue other economic and business opportunities. In recognition of \nthese advances, Senator Connie Mack and I are introducing the \nCommercial Space Act of 1997.\n  Cape Canaveral is also home to the Florida Spaceport Authority, which \nis set to launch its first commercial payload from Launch Complex 46 in \nJanuary 1998. This will be a milestone event in our State's history, \nand the bill that I am introducing today aims to modernize the laws \nthat govern the United States' emerging commercial space industry.\n  It is urgent that we develop a clear Federal policy for this \nimportant enterprise. For much of the last 40 years, our Nation's \nexperiment in space has been in the exclusive domain of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration [NASA].\n  The legislation I am offering today recognizes that space is now a \npublic\n\n[[Page S12223]]\n\nand private sector place and enterprise. It aims to create a stable \nbusiness environment for an industry that employs thousands of \nAmericans and generates billions of dollars in economic activity each \nyear.\n  Our bill pursues this goal in several important ways.\n  First, it will reduce the bureaucracy and redtape that plagues our \nregulation of the commercial space industry. Currently, the oversight \nof space-related businesses is scattered among multiple federal \nagencies, and burdens businesses with complex, confusing, and often \nconflicting rules. It is not an environment that encourages progress \nand innovation.\n  This bill takes the first step toward clarity by requiring each \nrelevant federal agency to clearly state its requirements for \ncommercial space licensing. That requirement will help space businesses \nin their efforts to raise capital, develop a consistent business plan, \nand create new job opportunities within the commercial space industry.\n  Second, our bill encourages federal agencies to act in a more \nefficient manner by increasing the private sector's involvement in \nservicing and launching space hardware, in addition to their current \nrole in building rockets and satellites. This will bolster the \nexpansion of the commercial space industry, while at the same time \nreducing Government costs and saving tax dollars.\n  For example, this legislation would call for NASA to look at the role \nthe private sector may play in operating, maintaining, and supplying \nthe international space station. It would also encourage the conversion \nof old ballistic missiles into launch vehicles, a use that will reduce \nstorage costs and provide for less expensive commercial space launches.\n  Finally, it is imperative that we update existing Federal law to \nreflect the rapid pace of technological change. Mr. President, we \ncannot hope to prepare for the high-tech 21st century if the Federal \nGovernment maintains a 20th century mentality. Our laws should be \nflexible enough to adapt to a world in which new science and technology \nis created every minute.\n  These goals will be difficult to achieve, however, if we do not \nrecognize the role of State and local governments in reducing space \ncosts. This is especially relevant to Florida, I am hopeful that our \nlegislation will spur a robust and energized commercial space industry. \nWithin 8 years, the number of launches in Florida are expected to \ndouble. But this potential growth can only be achieved if there exists \na productive working relationship among all entities involved in the \ncommercial space industry, including state and local governments.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell you exactly what \nthis legislation will accomplish:\n  This bill will require NASA to submit a report that identifies and \nexamines the prospects for commercial development, augmentation, or \nservicing of the international space station by the private sector. \nPrivate sector involvement in the commercial space industry is likely \nto reduce the costs of operating, maintaining and supplying the space \nstation and will allow State governments to act as potential brokers in \nreducing space station costs.\n  We amend the Commercial Space Launch Act and to give the Federal \nGovernment the authority to license commercial space reentry \nactivities. This is an essential portion of the bill. Without this \nlegal authorization, commercial reusable launch vehicles will not be \nallowed to re-enter the atmosphere, a restriction that would stymie the \nrealization of important technological developments and investments by \nthe commercial space industry.\n  This bill reaffirms our Nation's plans to make the Global Positioning \nSystem [GPS] a world standard. GPS is a space-based system that \nindividuals can use to determine their precise position on Earth. \nAlthough it began as a military/defense system, the GPS applications \nhave expanded to other sectors. In addition, foreign governments are \ninterested in entering this lucrative global market. Therefore, in an \neffort to protect our economic interests and our national security, it \nis imperative that the we encourage our President to enter into \nregional agreements with foreign governments to secure U.S. GPS as the \nunquestioned global standard.\n  The legislation further requires the Federal Government to purchase \nboth space hardware and transportation services from the private \nsector. This will encourage innovation within the commercial space \nindustry, while simultaneously promoting greater cost efficiency and \nprotecting our national security.\n  This legislation allows the conversion of excess ICBM's into space \ntransportation vehicles. These missiles cannot be used for defense \npurposes due to the START treaty. The conversion of these missiles \ncould save taxpayer dollars by eliminating storage costs and providing \ncost effective launches for small scientific and educational payloads.\n  Mr. President, I was extremely pleased when the House passed its \nversion of this legislation earlier this week. It is my understanding \nthat this legislation will be a priority for the Senate Commerce \nCommittee when Congress returns from recess in 1998.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman McCain, subcommittee Chairman \nFrist, my colleague, Senator Mack, and other members of the committee \nand the Clinton administration, to enact this important commercial \nspace legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12222-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise to address an issue which has far-\nreaching concerns for our Nation. Many of our colleagues have heard of \nthe improving economy and have participated in the improving economy \nand recognize as a result of this improving economy it is likely that \nthe Federal Government will incur a budget surplus in the very near \nfuture. This comes about because of a lot of hard work by this \nCongress, especially this Republican Congress, in controlling the rate \nof growth of the Federal Government. It is something that is unusual, \nobviously, not having occurred in the last 25 years.\n  Not only will we have a budget surplus, but it is projected by OMB \nthat the budget surplus will continue well into the first decade of the \nnext century.\n  So, I think that we need to discuss how we address this issue. This \nis an unfamiliar situation, as I mentioned, for Washington. We \ncertainly do not have much experience in dealing with surpluses so \nthere is naturally some perplexity as to how best to address it. To my \nmind the answer is pretty clear: The surplus should result in relief to \nthe American taxpayers.\n  Needless to say this is the right answer on economic grounds. If the \nGovernment takes in more revenue than it needs to finance its \noperation, the answer is not for the Government to spend that; rather, \nit only makes economic sense to return the extra revenues to the \nprivate economy that bears the burden of supporting the Government. Not \nonly that, but in this particular case, the appropriateness of tax \nrelief could not be more clear. Let none of us forget what has enabled \nCongress to accomplish this goal of balancing the budget. It has in \nlarge part been the dramatic growth of the economy.\n  If the private sector in this country had not come through with a \nsurge of productivity, then the budget negotiators might not have been \nable to reach the agreements necessary to accomplish a surplus to reach \na balanced budget. It would, therefore, be ungracious of us, at the \nleast, not to return that surplus to the taxpayers who have earned it.\n\n  I rise, Mr. President, today to voice a specific hope--that this \nCongress will consider, when that time comes, when we have reached a \nsurplus, including a cut in the payroll tax as the appropriate way to \naddress the returning of this surplus to the American taxpayer.\n  There are several reasons for this--all of them, I believe, noble. \nFirst of\n\n[[Page S12224]]\n\nall, the payroll tax is the most regressive component of our tax \nburden. There are no deductions, no personal exemptions in figuring of \nthe payroll tax. It's assessed directly on the first dollar of workers' \nwages, and from there it goes upward until it reaches the wage cap.\n  Moreover, the payroll tax has been the fastest growing component of \nthe Federal tax burden. When one includes the employer's share of this \ntax, we find that the majority of Americans pay more in payroll taxes \nthan they do in income taxes. The payroll tax has grown dramatically \nfrom a level of approximately 1 percent for each employee and employer \na little more than a generation ago, to today where it is approximately \n15.3 percent. So while Federal revenues have stayed roughly constant as \na percentage of the National economy, an ever-larger proportion of the \nburden of taxes has been carried by the wage earner in the form of \npayroll taxes.\n  But an equally important point is that these payroll taxes were never \nintended to finance the general operations of Government, as it is \ndoing today. Quite the contrary. The payroll taxes are supposed to \nfinance the operations of the Social Security system and the Medicare \nsystem.\n  I know my colleagues do not need to be reminded of the enormous \nunfunded liability that exists with respect to the long-term \nobligations of the Social Security and Medicare systems. These enormous \npayroll tax burdens, I regret to say, are not being used to reduce that \nlong-term liability. Surplus payroll taxes today are used to buy \nGovernment securities, which must be redeemed by the Federal Government \nin the future to pay back Social Security programs. That money will, of \nnecessity, come from taxation again, to create the general revenues \nnecessary to redeem the bonds.\n  A review of the figures is startling. Right now, Social Security's \ntotal income is $451.3 billion and total outflow is $370.8 billion. \nThis leaves a surplus in the Social Security funneled of $80 billion. \nOf that total, $43.6 billion is in the form of interest payments by the \nFederal Government to itself, and the other $36.9 billion represents \nthe annual operating surplus in the Social Security trust fund.\n  So each year, we run an annual operating surplus in Social Security \nthat is slightly more than 1 percent of the national payroll. That \nsurplus is combined with interest payments to increase the size of the \nSocial Security trust fund. That trust fund is projected by the \ntrustees to grow each year until it reaches a peak value of $2.89 \ntrillion in the year 2019.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about what that $2.89 trillion means. \nThat $2.89 trillion is not only assets owned by Social Security; more \nimportantly, it is a debt owed by the Federal Government to Social \nSecurity. In order to pay the benefits to future beneficiaries, the \nFederal Government will need to tax the American public, through \ngeneral tax revenues, to come up with this $2.89 trillion.\n  Every year that we collect these surplus payroll taxes, we create \nseveral significant events. We add to the trust funds, and thus we add \nto the debt owed by the Federal Government. We take payroll taxes from \nhard-working Americans today and, instead of really saving them, we \nconvert them into a tax burden on the Americans of tomorrow. This \ncertainly is no way to run a government, a country--or a railroad, for \nthat matter.\n  In order to fully understand the bizarre situation in which we are \nplacing ourselves, I ask my colleagues to consider the trustees' \nprojections for the period 2012 through 2019. In the year 2012, we will \nsee the first year of operating deficits within the Social Security \ntrust fund. That means that, in that year, annual Social Security \nrevenues will amount to less than promised benefits.\n  In other words, it will require cash from the general Treasury in \nthat year just to meet the current benefit payments to Social Security \nrecipients.\n  Yet, in that same year, interest compiled by the Social Security \ntrust fund will be an enormous $140 billion. So we will need to take $9 \nbillion of that interest payment from the general fund and use it to \npay beneficiaries immediately. The other $131 billion will be credited \nto the Social Security trust fund, so that the trust fund will grow, \ntheoretically at least, from $2.2 to $2.4 trillion in that year, even \nas the program is running annual operating deficits. This obviously \ndoesn't work.\n  Think about what will be happening at the same time. We will need \nmoney from the general Treasury just to pay current beneficiaries, and \nbillions in assets will be added to the Social Security trust fund--but \nthat doesn't exist--and the trust fund, continuing to grow, will earn \neven more interest in the next year, to be paid from the general \nTreasury.\n\n  So each year--from 2012 through 2019--the Federal Government will \nmake larger and larger contributions to Social Security, in current \nbenefit payments and interest payments. In the year 2018, for example, \nthe Social Security operating deficit will be $147 billion. That means \nit will have to pay out $147 billion more than it takes in. So, of the \n$171 billion in interest payments that will be due that year from the \nFederal Government, $147 billion will be needed right away to pay \nbenefits, and only the remaining $24 billion will continue to build the \ntrust fund.\n  It's in the year 2019, however, that the roof really starts to fall \nin. Then, even with all the interest payments from the general Treasury \nand all the current payroll taxes and benefit taxation, there will \nstill not be enough money to pay the Social Security beneficiaries, and \nwe will have to begin to redeem the principal on Social Security trust \nfund T-bills in order to pay the benefits.\n  Every year that we continue to collect surplus payroll taxes, and \nthus swell the size of the trust fund, is a year that we add to the \nunfunded liabilities that we are piling on the heads of our children \nand their children, the American taxpayers to come.\n  It is largely for this reason that I believe that payroll tax relief \nis needed. I have introduced a piece of legislation, S. 321, that would \ngive 1 percent of the payroll tax back to the wage earners; in other \nwords, it would be a tax cut, to be saved in an individually owned \nretirement account. This would give us a Head Start on prefunding some \nof the massive liability, by moving it off the Government ledger and \ninto genuine savings, because, you see, the basic problem here is that \nthe Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system. That creates a \nhuge unfunded liability. Until we start to prefund that liability, we \nare not going to get out from underneath that unfunded liability. The \nbest way to prefund that liability is to take the surplus that we are \npresently running in the Social Security system, cut taxes, give wage \nearners back their money, and allow them to save it for their \nretirement so that they have a savings account, identified to them, in \ntheir name, which they can use to benefit them at retirement and, thus, \nturn a contingent liability into an actual savings vehicle.\n  If we were to pass this bill today, S. 321, we would not solve all of \nSocial Security's problems, but it would eliminate approximately 78 \npercent of Social Security's projected insolvency. That is a pretty \ngood chunk. We would, however, vastly reduce the burden on tomorrow's \neconomy. For example, whereas, under present law, Social Security will \nabsorb more than 17 percent of the national payroll tax base by the \nyear 2030, under this legislation, it would absorb closer to 14 \npercent. That is a major drop--3 percent--in our national economy, \nwhich will at that time be multiple trillions. That is part of the gain \nthat comes from prefunding Social Security's liability, instead of \nsimply continuing to collect and spend surplus payroll taxes, leaving \ntomorrow's obligations for another day.\n  It is critical, as we debate the issue of the surplus which is \ncoming, that we make a thoughtful decision on how to handle it. I think \na thoughtful decision involves some obvious facts. What is our most \nsignificant, looming fiscal problem as a nation? It is the burden of \nour pension plans, which are unfunded. What is the most significant \nunfunded pension plan in America? It is the Social Security system.\n  The second logical effort that should be addressed in addressing the \nsurplus is, who gave us the money in the first place? Who has the best \nright to claim that money? That is clearly the taxpayers of America. We \ncan address both of these issues by following the course that I have \noutlined here today--cut\n\n[[Page S12225]]\n\nthe Social Security tax, return it to the wage earner, allow the wage \nearner to start to preinvest, to presave for their retirement, with the \ntaxes which are now going into a fund that is on a cash-flow basis. The \ntaxes are now being used to operate the Government, the general \nGovernment, instead of being used and identified as the savings of the \nSocial Security recipients. This is a good policy approach to what is \nlooming as one of the major policy debates that we will confront as a \nCongress as we move toward the next century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Illinois \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I thank my \ncolleague for his statement on the future of Social Security. He is \nrecognized in this Chamber as one who has studiously addressed himself \nto this and many other challenges.\n  I hope that next year my colleague will lead a bipartisan effort to \ntake a serious look at the future of Social Security and Medicare, and \nso many entitlement programs that we worry about, in terms of long-term \nsolvency. I thank my colleague for his remarks. Though I may not agree \nwith every particular, I certainly do respect the fact that he \ncontinues to stick with this issue through thick and thin, as he \nshould. The Senate should address it, and, hopefully, we can do it \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate that kind comment. The Senator \nfrom Illinois has certainly made a serious effort in a number of areas \nin this Chamber. I have enjoyed working with him, for example, on the \ntobacco issues. And I look forward to working with him on this. I also \nbelieve this must be resolved in a bipartisan manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12223-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12225-S12227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JUVENILE CRIME\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am, as you know, concluding my first \nyear in the U.S. Senate. Within a few days, we may be able to go home, \nand the sooner the better.\n  As I reflect on my first year, I think back on one particular issue, \nwhich I didn't anticipate being of great importance and now has turned \nout to be of major importance on my legislative agenda. I was appointed \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee and, as a result of that appointment, \nI decided to really focus on the issue of crime, particularly juvenile \ncrime, in the United States.\n  This past year, I made my visits back to Illinois coincide with an \neffort to study the problem of juvenile crime. During the course of \n1997, I visited jails and prisons, detention centers, have met with \njudges and law enforcement officials, have been to drug rehab \nfacilities, have been to many, many schools in the State of Illinois, \nhave met with young people and their parents, and I have tried as best \nI could to come to grips with some of the problems that we have in this \nNation as it relates to crime.\n  I find it very curious to consider the following: The United States \nhas one of the strongest economies in the world. I daresay that you \ncould not travel across the world and find another country so widely \nadmired as the United States. No matter where you go, people talk about \nus--the way we live, our music, our art, our culture, our economy. We \nshould take great pride in that. We also know for a fact that, if we \nwere to lift all restrictions on immigration and say the borders of the \nUnited States are wide open, we would be inundated with people from all \nover the world who would walk away from their cultures, their families, \nand their traditions, many of them just hoping they would have a chance \nto come to America and be part of this great democratic experiment.\n  Having said that, though, the one thing that is curious to me, \ndespite all of these positive things, is, why is it that the United \nStates of America has the largest percentage of its population \nimprisoned, incarcerated, of any country in the world except one--\nRussia? Why is it, over the last 10 years, we have seen such a dramatic \nincrease in incarceration and imprisonment in America? Is there \nsomething genetic about living in America that leads more people to \ncommit crime? I question that. I don't think that's true. But what is \nit about our country that is engendering more imprisonment and more \nincarceration?\n  Now, let's be fair and look at both sides of the ledger. We have \nfound that, as incarceration rates have gone up and the State and \nFederal prisons have grown in size, the crime rate has gone down.\n  So there is a positive side to this. If people who are committing \ncrimes are being taken off the streets to make those streets safer for \nour families, our communities, and our neighborhoods, that is a \npositive development. I do not want to suggest at all that we should \nstep back from that commitment. If someone is guilty of crime, they \nshould do the time. It is not just the slogan; it is a fact. And in \nAmerica, more and more people are doing time.\n  But is there an answer to this dilemma, or challenge, which goes \nbeyond the obvious, the enforcement of crime, the imprisonment of \ncriminals? Can we as a nation aspire to a goal where we see a continued \nreduction in crime and a reduction in incarceration? Because \nimprisonment is a very expensive undertaking for a society. First, we \nmeasure it in dollar terms. In the Federal prison system it is probably \n$20,000 a year to keep a prisoner there. Roughly the equivalent of what \nit takes to go to some of the best colleges and universities we spend \neach year to put men and women in prison and keep them there at the \nState level. It goes as high as $30,000 in my own State of Illinois. It \nis an expensive commitment.\n  Don't forget this important fact. There is not a person in prison \ntoday who didn't get there because he or she created a victim. So in \norder for that process to work its way through, someone was victimized. \nSomeone may have been killed, assaulted, raped, or burglarized--\nwhatever it might be.\n  So when we talk about reducing prison populations, it is more than \nsaving money. It is also a question of sparing victims, but doing it in \na way that still reduces crime.\n  I have taken a look in my State at some of the things that are being \ndiscussed. I have talked to some of the leaders across the Nation. I \nhave come up with some things that I hope this Congress can address on \na bipartisan basis. Let's start at the very beginning.\n  We now know through research, which has been proven time and again, \nthat one of the most critical areas in the life of an individual is the \nvery first few months of life. We used to think that those gurgling, \nbabbling little kids were so cute. We would diaper them, feed them, \nlaugh at them, try to guess who they looked like in the family, and we \ndidn't realize that while we were doing that, this child's brain was \ndeveloping at a rapid pace. In fact, in the first 18 months of life, \nsome 75 percent of a child's brain has developed.\n  The reason I raise that is because I think there is a link between \nthe development of our children, how well they develop, and what they \nturn out to be. My parents believed that. I believe that. My wife and I \ndid, as do our children. I think it is a fact.\n  When I visited the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center about 6 \nmonths ago and saw the hallways filled with teenage kids, mainly boys, \nwalking back and forth, it looked like a high school with 14- to 15-\nyear-olds filing back and forth in uniform. But, of course, these \nweren't just high-school-age kids; these kids had been convicted of a \ncrime.\n  I asked the prison psychologist. I said, ``Who are these children?'' \nHe said, ``Senator, these children I could describe in about four or \nfive characteristics.'' First, they come from broken homes, almost \ninvariably. Second, they have a learning disability. They were falling \nbehind in school. They weren't learning as well, either because of poor \nnutrition before they were born in their mother's womb, or poor \nnutrition after they were born, exposure to narcotics, exposure to \nabuse. These children are basically ``unattached.'' That is a term that \nis used in psychology about which many people would just shake their \nheads and say, ``How could this be?'' But it basically means a child \ncoming into this world does not receive the most fundamental and basic \nemotional bonding with a parent or a loved one.\n  How many parents automatically, instinctively grab that baby, pull \nthe\n\n[[Page S12226]]\n\nbaby up to their arms and cradle it while they are feeding the baby, \nnursing the baby, feeding it with the bottle, with the warmth of the \nmother, or even the father, and a little communication going on there \nas part of this bonding attachment? These kids missed that. These kids \ndidn't go through this emotional maturation that leads to a normal \nfunctioning adult, and, as a sequence of this, they are missing a piece \nof that.\n  He said there is something else about these kids, too. He said these \nkids ``don't know how to resolve conflicts.'' You ``Dis me, I kill you. \nI've got a gun to do it.'' In America everybody has a gun to do it, \nunfortunately.\n  So when I started looking into these ``problem children,'' as we \nmight call them, and then back to the beginning, I started thinking \nabout what we can do as a society to address it. Clearly, we have to \nstart at the beginning.\n  Now, with more than half of the mothers in America working and \nrelying more and more on custodial care, whether it is day care or \nbabysitters, shouldn't we be asking a very fundamental question as to \nwhat kind of care our kids are receiving when they are in custodial \ncare?\n  I don't think it is any accident that this au pair case \nin Massachusetts attracted so much national attention. It is a sad \nreality that we lose children in America every day to abuse and \nneglect. Yet, this case, which was so prominent in the headlines, \ncaptured America's attention for weeks, I think, because more and more \npeople instinctively are worried about their own children in custodial \ncare. You leave them there 8 or 10 hours a day. What is happening to \nthem? Are they safe? Are they being treated right?\n\n  So, when the President calls a national conference on child care, I \nhope that we will look beyond the fact that it is a political setting \nto the fact that this is a very real family challenge. It is \ninteresting in this Nation that we decided that public education was so \nimportant to the future of this country that we are going to make a \npublic commitment to it. We understood that some wealthy parents could \nafford to educate their own children, but most parents could not. So we \nsaid, if we are going to have well-educated children who become good \ncitizens, we as a nation will commit to them. We will commit at every \nlevel--local, State, and Federal level--to make sure we have a system \nof public education.\n  We have a new challenge, my friends. What about the years before \nkindergarten? What about these developmental years? What commitment are \nwe prepared to make as a nation to make certain that those \ndevelopmental years are right?\n  Some children are blessed to have a parent who can stay home and \nraise them. I count myself as one of the fortunate parents. My wife was \nable to do that. I don't think we could have given our children a \nbetter gift than to have her there every day while they were growing \nup, reading to them, living experiences with them, teaching them. But \nin some homes that can't happen for economic reasons and other reasons \nthat a parent can't stay home.\n  So, that parent wants to make sure that his or her child also gets \ngood care. You look at day care in America today, and it is a very \nmixed bag. There are some extraordinarily good day care centers--some \nprivate, some public. But let's be honest. There are some that aren't \nvery good at all. There are some that are mere babysitters--diapers, \nbottles, and little more.\n  You look at the training requirement. In Illinois, for example, a day \ncare worker needs 2 years of college--an associates degree. That is \ngood, but it could be a lot better. We could be making sure that the \nmen and women in day care really understand what is going on in that \nyoung mind and bring these children along as they should be. But it \nwill cost money. You can't bring people in for that kind of \nprofessional training and professional care without paying. Working \nfamilies say, ``That is great, Senator; a great idea. Who is going to \npay for it? Who will pay? What is the bottom line?'' Honestly, we \nexpect the families to contribute, and they do--many of them making \ngreat sacrifices for day care. But clearly there must be more. We as a \nnation must make a contribution to this, too, to make certain that \nthese children have a fighting chance.\n  There is another element that I think is important, too. As I \ntraveled around Illinois, I visited a program called Lincoln's \nChallenge. It is in 15 different States now. The National Guard in \nIllinois runs this program and invites in 400 students who are high \nschool dropouts in the State of Illinois. They must come voluntarily. \nThey must be between the ages of 14 and 18. They must be drug free and \nnot pregnant. If they then come into the program, they are in for 10 \nweeks of military style training. They are in uniforms. They shine \ntheir shoes every morning, make their beds. It is ``yes, sir''; ``no, \nsir'' and they go to class. These high school dropouts that other \npeople have given up on are brought into classrooms. In the course of \n10 weeks, 71 percent of these kids, high school dropouts, earn the GED \ndegree--in 10 weeks. All of a sudden, they are out of the neighborhood. \nThey are focused. They are in a disciplined environment. And they have \npeople who care around them. It works.\n  Kids who would have been casualties on the streets of Chicago, or \nSpringfield, now have a chance because of one other factor. One of the \nimportant features of this program is one that I have come to believe \nis essential if we are going to deal with reducing crime and saving our \nkids. When those young men and women finish this program, they go back \nto their hometowns, but with one important difference. Each one has an \nadult mentor. Each one has an adult outside their family that they can \ncall on for advice or encouragement or support, for counsel. ``How am I \ngoing to get a job? Can I get into the Army? What should I do next if I \nwant to go to the community college?'' So there is somebody who cares. \nOf all of the programs I have seen, the most successful I have run into \ntime and again--whether government programs or private sector--are \nmentoring programs.\n  We had a juvenile court judge from the State of Georgia, from the \ncity of Atlanta. I am sure Senator Wellstone remembers when she spoke \nto our conference of Senate Democrats. She told the story of coming out \nof private law practice and becoming a juvenile court judge and going \nback to the big law firm in Atlanta and saying, ``I want you lawyers, \nwhether you are corporate or criminal lawyers, to volunteer to come to \nmy courtroom and represent these kids.'' She knew the kids would get \nbetter representation. She also knew something else. Relationships \nwould begin. Attorneys meeting young men and women would start to care. \nThose young men and women, sensing that caring, would finally have a \nvoice that they could listen to, someone they could talk to.\n\n  So, I have come to believe that, as we talk about reducing crime and \nhelping kids, it is not just early childhood development, but making \ncertain that kids, particularly those facing problems, have an \nopportunity for mentoring.\n  We also need to think about some basics. Why in God's name do schools \nquit at 3 in the afternoon? This might have made sense 50 years ago \nwhen kids went back to Ozzie and Harriet settings, and mother was home \nwith milk and cookies. But, boy, that is the exception, not the rule. \nMost kids who are turned loose at 3 in the afternoon have two options: \ntelevision or trouble. We have to start thinking about school days that \nreflect the reality of America's families.\n  Most American families come in at probably 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock, if \nthey are lucky, weary from a day of work. That is the time when they \ncan finally give their children a little bit of attention and, \nhopefully, have some good time with them. But what happens between 3 \nand 6? What is happening with these kids? In more communities, more and \nmore that I visit, schools are doing things after the regular school \nhours: some recreation, some arts and crafts, and music, and some, of \ncourse, regular school activities, but a safe environment. Shouldn't \nthat be the first rule that we as a nation adopt? Our kids are going to \nbe safe all day long?\n  One of the last points I want to make is about prisons themselves. I \nvisit a lot of them. In fact, I went down to the Marion Prison in \nsouthern Illinois. It is rather infamous--or famous, depending on your \npoint of view--as having been in a lockdown for almost 5 years now. Two \nprison guards were killed, and, as\n\n[[Page S12227]]\n\na result, most of the prisoners who are brought there spend most of \ntheir time in their cells. In fact, the only prisoners there have, \nfirst, committed a violent crime to get into prison, and, second, \nbroken a law once they were in prison. So these are a pretty tough \nbunch of characters.\n  Listen to what they do when they come to the Marion Federal Prison. \nThe first year of their life there is very predictable. The first year \nof their life, out of a 24-hour day they will spend 23 hours of that \nday in a cell alone. They get 1 hour to come out of their cell, but \nwith no socialization. They don't speak to anyone. The guard watches \nthem as they walk around the yard. If they get through that year and \nthey have not broken the rules, then they start bringing them out and \ngiving them a chance to take a little course here on this, or go to a \nprison industry, or maybe eat in a room with some other prisoners.\n  They have a dramatic success rate. You can imagine this is pretty \ntough. It is one of our toughest Federal prisons.\n  As I talked to the warden and the officers there--and I want to give \nhigh praise to them because I think they run a very good operation--and \ntalked to people in other prisons about who these prisoners are and \nwhether they are likely to come back, there is one factor that just \ncomes roaring through at you. That factor is this: If you invest in \neducating these prisoners while they are in prison, the likelihood that \nthey will return to prison is cut dramatically. There is one in four \nchances that they will be recidivists, commit another crime and come \nback, if you educate them.\n  Unfortunately, we as a nation for whatever reason, budgetary or \notherwise, have not made this commitment to education. We somehow think \nthat we are punishing the prisoners by not making education classes \navailable so that they can become literate, so that they can develop a \nskill. I am not so sure we are punishing the prisoners as much as we \nare punishing ourselves. These prisoners, most of them, will be back on \nthe street and without an education and without basic skills, I am \nafraid they are destined to commit crimes. In fact, statistically we \nknow they are, by a rate of 4 to 1, from those prisoners who pick up \neducation and skills. We have not made that commitment in our prison \nsystem and we should. It is absolutely essential that we do it.\n  I went to the juvenile maximum prison in Illinois and met with the \nprincipal of the high school there. And I looked at all of the young \nmen who were in the classrooms at this prison, and I said, ``How is \nthis working out?'' He said, ``Well, amazingly well. Most of these \nyoung men''--all men at this prison--``missed something in their basic \neducation and became so frustrated that they basically dropped out; \nthey stopped paying attention and fell behind.'' He said, ``We test \nthem to find out what they missed. We go back,'' he said, ``and fill in \nthat gap and they come roaring forward toward a GED.'' To many of them, \nit is sad that it took this track for them to reach this fulfillment, \nbut it is a fact and one that we should reflect on, how time spent in \nprison, if it is done constructively, can start to turn a life around, \ncan make this a safer America and reduce the number of victims that we \nmight see.\n  People think that in an age where all we talk about is balancing the \nbudget many of us in Washington really don't reflect enough on some of \nthe important social goals we should have in this country. I don't \nthink there is anything more important than our children, and if it \nmeans making certain that we have quality day care for childhood \ndevelopment, if it means making certain that we are committed to a \nschool day that reflects the reality of our families, if it means \nmaking certain that the kids who need someone to talk to have an \nopportunity, whether it is through Big Brother, Big Sister, the Boys \nand Girls Clubs, whatever it happens to be, if it means making certain \nthat our prison system now starts to be more responsive to real human \nneeds, I think those are things we as a Senate and a House should \naddress.\n  I hope that next year, even in a busy election year, we have the time \nto do just that.\n  I want to address two other topics very quickly. I see my friend from \nMinnesota is here. I just want to address them very quickly because \nthey are important and I hope somewhat timely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12225-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12227-S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, late this week we will have an executive \ncommittee meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. We will return to \na nomination made by President Clinton, one that I think has become a \nsource of major controversy. The gentleman's name is Bill Lann Lee. Mr. \nLee has been named by the President to be head of the Civil Rights \nDivision of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  I had never met Bill Lann Lee until about a month ago when he came by \nmy office. He made a very positive impression in the short time we had \nto speak to one another. Then I read his background and sat through his \nconfirmation hearing, and I want to say that I hope Mr. Lee will get \nthe chance he deserves.\n  Bill Lann Lee is the son of Chinese immigrants who came to this \ncountry to New York virtually penniless. His mother and father started \na hand laundry. He and his brother, who is now a Baptist minister, \nworked in that laundry with their parents. His mother sat, as he said, \nin a front window of the laundry every day at a sewing machine. His \nfather was back doing washing and ironing, refusing, incidentally, to \nteach his sons how to iron. That's the major skill in a hand laundry. \nHe didn't want his sons to know how to iron. He didn't want them to \nwork there. He wanted them to think beyond the laundry.\n  When World War II started, Bill Lann Lee's father, who was 36 years \nold and could have escaped the draft just by claiming an age deferment \nbut did not do it, volunteered and went in the Army Air Corps and had a \nvery interesting experience because he came back from the war to his \nfamily and said, ``That was a good thing to do, not just for the Nation \nbut good for me.''\n  For the first time, Bill Lee's father said, he was treated like an \nAmerican, not like someone from China living in America. But when he \ncame back from the war, as a returning veteran after World War II he \nfound that job discrimination and housing discrimination was still \nvery, very strong against Chinese-Americans. So he returned to his hand \nlaundry but more determined than ever that his sons would have a better \nchance.\n  When Bill Lann Lee reached college age, it happened that Yale \nUniversity decided they wanted to diversify their student body. They \ngave him a chance and said come to Yale and see if you can prove \nyourself. Well, he sure did. He graduated from Yale with high honors \nand then went to Columbia Law School and graduated with high honors.\n  With that kind of background, Bill Lee could have easily gone with a \nmajor law firm in New York, Los Angeles, wherever he happened to want \nto live, but he didn't. Bill Lee had learned a lesson in life, a lesson \nfrom his parents, and he decided that he wanted to fight \ndiscrimination. So for 23 years he has worked for the NAACP legal \ndefense fund filing lawsuits when people are discriminated against.\n  The interesting thing about it is, when you think of these lawsuits, \nmany times they are the most controversial lawsuits you can imagine. \nYou know the headlines in the papers when they start talking about \nhousing questions and school questions and questions involving gender \nor race or religious persuasion. Those are tough cases. But out of 200 \ncases that Bill Lee handled, only six ever went to trial. He was able \nto work out agreements in all the other cases.\n  In fact, one of his leading opponents, Richard Riordan, who is the \nRepublican mayor of Los Angeles, wrote a letter about Bill Lee and \nsaid, ``I was on the other side of a lawsuit, and I want to tell you \nsomething. We never would have settled it without Bill Lee there. He \npractices mainstream civil rights law.''\n  I tell you, my friends, he is exactly the kind of person we need \nserving in the Department of Justice as the representative of the \nOffice of Civil Rights. But I am sorry to report to you that in the \nlast week some extreme political folks have set their sights to try to \nnail Bill Lee. They are trying to stop his appointment as the head of \nthe\n\n[[Page S12228]]\n\nCivil Rights Division, and that is an unfortunate development. It is \nunfortunate because, first, all he is asking is to be judged fairly. \nThat is all he has ever asked in his life. And second, the things they \nare saying about him really do stretch the truth.\n  One of the leading conservative columnists in America, George Will, a \nman whom I really respect not just because he was raised and went to \nschool in Illinois but because I think he is a pretty bright fellow, \nwrote a column in the middle of October and said we should turn down \nBill Lee as ``a payback''--his words, ``a payback''--because the Senate \nDemocrats, when they controlled the Judiciary Committee, turned down \none of the civil rights appointments of a Republican President 10 years \nago.\n  Please, let us not do that to Mr. Lee. Let us not do that to the \nSenate. Let us give him his chance to stand on his own feet and have an \nopportunity to serve this country. And so I hope those of you who think \nthat when the Senate goes home and the House adjourns our work is done \nwill realize there are still many men and women waiting for \nconfirmation and one of the most important and highest is Bill Lann \nLee. He would be the highest-ranking Asian American ever appointed, and \nI am glad that the President has named him and I hope that we can find \njust two, just two Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee who \nwill join the Democrats in supporting his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12227-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONSOLIDATION OF FEDERAL FOOD INSPECTION SERVICES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced with Senator \nTorricelli a bill, which I hope the Senator from Minnesota will join me \nin sponsoring, that would consolidate all of the food inspection \nservices of the Federal Government in one independent agency.\n  Mr. President, 33 million Americans each year have some sort of a \nfoodborne illness, and out of that number some 9,000 will die. You read \nabout the cases, whether it is E. coli or salmonella. We have a good \nfood inspection system but it can be much better. Our food inspection \nsystem evolved from Upton Sinclair's novel ``The Jungle,'' when we \ndecided the Federal Government had to step in and make sure the food, \nmeat in particular, that came to our table was safe for our families. \nBut now I am afraid we have gone overboard. We have 12 different \nFederal agencies involved in food inspection--12--6 in a major way.\n  I am joining with Congressman Vic Fazio of California to consolidate \nthese into one independent agency which will be guided by the best \nscience in keeping food safe for Americans. I hope that this, too, will \nbe part of our agenda next year when we return to Washington, DC. It is \nan important issue, not just for the industries that are affected but \nfor every family that wants to be certain when they buy that meat or \npoultry, fish or whatever product it might be, fruits and vegetables \nand beyond, it is safe for their family to consume.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask what the parliamentary situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding we are in \nmorning business. Senators are allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before I start, I also wanted to find out how long we \nwill be in morning business and whether or not there will be \nopportunities to introduce amendments to the fast-track bill?\n  In other words, I understand the amendment will be laid aside, but I \nwant to know whether there are opportunities to introduce the \namendments to fast track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is a parliamentary issue that will be \nhandled by the majority leader. We are not prepared to answer that \nquestion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will just say in the Chamber and I will check with \nthe leader, I do have an amendment on human rights that I would like to \noffer. We may or may not get to fast track, but this would be an \nopportunity I think to have the discussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12228-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12228-S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WELFARE, HEALTH CARE, AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to take this time Sunday \nafternoon as we approach the end of this session to talk about some \nunfinished business for the Congress and I think for the Nation. I \nreally was moved, and I do not usually use that word, by the eloquence \nof my colleague, Senator Durbin, from Illinois. As I came in, I heard \nSenator Durbin talk about children and talk about early years and talk \nabout early childhood development and talk about whether or not we as a \nnation are going to make a commitment to affordable child care.\n  I want to talk about a really difficult issue for the Senate, for the \nCongress, and I think for the White House, and when we come back for me \nthis will be one of the first items of business. I want us to have \ndiscussion and I would like to see whether or not we would be willing \nto perhaps take some important action.\n  I am talking about the bill that was passed which was called welfare \nreform. Mr. President, some of what was in that bill represented over \n$50 billion of cuts in the name of deficit reduction in the major food \nnutrition program in the country, food stamps--20 percent cut for \nfamilies, most of them working families, most of the recipients \nchildren. And the other part was the cuts in benefits to legal \nimmigrants, some of which has been corrected, some of which has not.\n  What worries me--and I have traveled the country and spent quite a \nbit of time in low-income communities. I haven't just focused on \nwelfare, but I have been to the delta in Mississippi with Congressman \nBennie Thompson; I have been to eastern Kentucky, to Letcher County, \nWhitesburg, KY; I have been to Chicago in housing projects, and, of \ncourse, I have been in Minnesota, both urban and rural, and I have been \nto L.A., East L.A., and Watts. One of the things that worries me is \nthat I see in many articles and too much of the media coverage and \ncertainly too much of what I hear from both Democrats and Republicans \nin Washington that welfare reform has been a success as defined by \nreduction of caseload. Any Democrat, any Republican, or any fool can \nknock people off the welfare rolls. That has nothing to do with reform. \nThe only way reform can be defined is not by reduction of caseload but \nby reduction of poverty. Are these families, in the main headed by \nwomen and children, better off?\n  I heard my colleague from Illinois talk about child care, and if my \ncolleague was here I would tell him about some just very emotional \nexperiences that I have had, meeting with some of the women who have \nnow been told they are to work, and they work. But their concern is \nabout what happens to their children. You know, just because they are \npoor, just because they are welfare mothers, doesn't make them, or \ndoesn't make their children, any less worthy, any less important.\n\n  In Los Angeles, for example, in L.A., one city, they have a waiting \nlist of 30,000 families for affordable child care. That is before the \nwelfare bill. The question I ask colleagues is, where are these \nchildren? Fine, the mothers are now working. Do we know where the \nchildren are? Where are they? Who is taking care of them? Is it \ndevelopmental child care? Is it just custodial? Or are they even in \nharm's way? We don't know. But we should know. We passed the \nlegislation.\n  I met a woman, and this story of this one mother unfortunately is the \nstory of other mothers. She said to me, ``I want to work.'' By the way, \nalmost all the people I meet want to work. That's a big thing to people \nin our country, to be able to work and make a decent wage and support \nyour family. And also to be able to give your children the care you \nknow they need and deserve. But I am meeting some of these mothers. We \ntold them we would sort of delegate this to the States and they would \nwork.\n  Here is what they say to me, what this one mother in L.A. said. I \nthen visited actually where she lived, public\n\n[[Page S12229]]\n\nhousing in east L.A. She said to me: ``I want to work but I am so \nfrightened because my first grader goes home alone every day. I worry \nabout what happens to her from the time she leaves school to when she \ngets back to the apartment''--public housing. ``There are gangs, there \nis violence. I tell her to go into the apartment, lock the door, and \ndon't take any phone calls.''\n  I would like to ask Senators, how many of you would like for your \nfirst graders, whether they are your children or your grandchildren, to \ngo home alone? Actually, to go home to wherever you live, much less in \nthe neighborhoods and communities that are so dangerous. In the debate \nthat we had on welfare reform, did anybody ever talk about these \nchildren? I never heard a word.\n  We talk a lot about early childhood development, which is very \nimportant. We talk a lot about after-school programs for teenagers, \nwhich is critically important. But what about these first and second \ngraders? I think there are too many children in our country right now, \nbecause of what is happening around the country, who are in danger. And \nI think it is our responsibility to know what is going on. Speeches do \nnot suffice.\n  When I was in Letcher County, KY, I spent quite a bit of time with \nCarroll Smith, who is the county executive, Republican--county Judge, \nwhich is like the county executive; just a great, great guy. It was \ninteresting, though. He and others were saying to me, did anyone ever \nmention the word ``rural'' when you all passed that bill? Because in \nthe absence of access to capital and our seeing economic development in \nour community, we don't know where the jobs are going to be.\n  The Wall Street Journal had--I haven't even had a chance to read the \narticle from cover to cover--a very long, extensive piece about Delta, \nMS, where lots of people can't find jobs, or have to drive 60, 70 \nmiles. Again, you have two things going on here. No. 1, there are not \nthe jobs where people live in rural America. No. 2, the jobs that quite \noften these women are getting maybe pay $6 an hour. They are going to \nbe worse off than they were before, because there will not be health \ncare after a while, and they don't know what to do by way of child \ncare.\n  It seems to me that one of the things that we need to do is at least \ncall on the States to provide us with an evaluation, maybe every 6 \nmonths or every year, on how families are doing toward attaining the \ngoal of economic self-sufficiency. Because if we don't do that, 4 years \nfrom now all these families are off all assistance. Don't you think, \nbefore we have some tragedy, we ought to at least know what is going \non? I am going to have an amendment, a piece of legislation which I \nwill bring to the floor of the Senate and we will have that vote.\n  Mr. President, I go to the communities. It has been very moving. I \nhope to get a chance to write a long piece about what I have learned \nfrom people. But I don't find that the issues that people in low-income \ncommunities are talking about are really different than issues that \nother working families are talking about. The first question is: Where \nare the jobs that pay a decent wage? This is still one of the most \nimportant challenges for most families in our country. It is an \nimportant challenge in poor communities: Where are the jobs? And we are \ngoing to have to have an urban jobs program if we are serious about \nreducing poverty and making sure that families have a chance. Also, we \nare going to have to do a lot better by way of making sure that, if \npeople work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they are not poor. If \npeople play by the rules of the game and they work hard, they ought not \nto be poor. That is where child care fits in. That is where health care \nfits in. And not just for low-income families, but for the vast \nmajority of families in our country.\n  I heard my colleague from Illinois speak. I was so pleased to hear \nwhat he said. But I would like to challenge both Republicans and \nDemocrats, because I think that what is going on here is we have a \ndebate that, in a way, may take us nowhere, or at least certainly not \nconnect very well with a lot of people in our country.\n\n  On the one hand my friend Jeff Faux has written a very interesting \npiece where he argues this. I will take a piece of what Jeff says. On \nthe one hand, for example, we have the majority party, the Republican \nParty, which argues--at the risk of getting the Chair angry at me--\nwhich argues, when it comes to some of these most pressing issues, for \nexample affordable child care, there is nothing the Government can or \nshould do. My argument is that is a great philosophy if you own your \nown large corporation and you are wealthy, but it doesn't work for most \nof the people in the country. On the other hand, you have the \nDemocratic Party that says we are all for the children, we are all for \neducation, we are all for job training. But, do you know what? \nPolitically there is not anything we can do either. We just have to cut \ntaxes because politically that is the only way we can make it. In which \ncase neither party has a whole lot to say to the very families we are \ntalking about, at least if you get beyond speeches and conferences.\n  We have had enough speeches. We have had enough conferences. The \nquestion is whether or not we are going to go beyond the speeches and \nthe conferences and dig into our pockets and make the kind of \ninvestment that we need to make as a nation. I think the question for \nall of us is how can we renew our national vow of equal opportunity for \nevery child in America? That is the goodness of our country. That ought \nto be the central goal of public policy here in the Congress. I make a \ncommitment, as a Senator from Minnesota, to bring that kind of \nlegislation out on the floor, working with others, with the financing, \nwith the investment, so this isn't empty rhetoric. We ought not to \nseparate the budgets we introduce from the words that we speak.\n  Finally, let me make one other point. My training is as a political \nscientist--I was a college teacher before I became a U.S. Senator--not \nas a political economist, although I am interested in political \neconomy. There is something very interesting and very important going \non in our country, which is now we have reports about record low levels \nof unemployment. The GDP looking great. Productivity is up. But real \nwages of most families are down. The economy of American families is \nnot measured by GDP, it is not measured by all these official \nstatistics. It is measured by real family income. It is measured by \nwhether or not people can purchase the things that make life richer in \npossibilities. It is measured by opportunities. It is measured by \nsecurity or insecurity. And it is measured by our expectations for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. And by that criterion, a whole lot of \nfamilies could be doing better and we could be doing better as a \nnation.\n  One of the issues that I think is a living-room issue in America, a \nkitchen-table issue, that we are going to have to have the courage to \ntake on, is health care. We can have patient protection--I am all for \nthat. We can have provider protection--I am all for that. We can try to \ncontrol some of these large insurance companies that own and control \nmost of the managed care plans--I am all for that. But the fact of the \nmatter is, we have now moved from 40 to 44 million people or \nthereabouts without any health insurance since we first started talking \nabout this 3 years ago; more than twice that number of underinsured, \nand the vast majority of people in the country, not just low-income--\neither people are not old enough for Medicare, and Medicare doesn't \ncover prescription drug costs, it doesn't cover catastrophic expenses, \nor people aren't poor enough for medical assistance and they are not \nlucky enough to be able to work for an employer who provides them with \ngood health care coverage.\n  We ought to have humane, dignified, affordable health care for every \nman, woman, and child in our Nation. For me, next session, that will be \nmy priority--with the financing, clear with people in the country how \nyou pay for it. But I am telling you, large insurance companies don't \nlike it. And there are a whole bunch of other powerful interests that \ndon't like it. But the majority of people in this country know that \nthis system is in big-time crisis. It is time we get back to this issue \nas a Congress.\n  I really do think that, as we think about what we have done and what \nwe have not done--I will just talk a little bit about what we haven't \ndone in the\n\n[[Page S12230]]\n\nfew minutes I have left. I think these standard of living issues are \nthe critical issues. I think, unfortunately, Jeff Faux is right, \nneither party is telling the story that gives people any confidence \nthat much is going to happen that is good for them. And I think we \ncould do better, all of us.\n  And in addition, the one other issue that we did not get the job done \non, and it is critically important, is campaign finance reform. When I \ngo into cafes in Minnesota, this is one thing I don't gloat about. I am \nnot even pleased to say it, but it is true. Because it is aimed at me. \nIt is aimed at all of us. The vast majority of people I talk to in \ncafes believe both parties now--they just sort of view the Government \nas being controlled by wealthy financial interests. They just feel \nlocked out. They feel like it is for big players and heavy hitters. \nAnd, you know what, all of us have to raise money. That's what we have \nto do. That's not the point. I did. We all do. That's the system right \nnow.\n\n  We should change this. We didn't, not this time. We come back to it \nnext year. But this is a real important issue and it is not that people \ndon't care about it. They care about it deeply and desperately. And I \nthink they want to believe in the political process. They want to \nbelieve in Government. But we are going to continue to see a tremendous \namount of cynicism and apathy and disengagement and disillusionment \nunless we get as much of this money out of politics as possible. We \nknow what the criterion is. We have talked about it enough. It is time \nto really move forward. It can't just be like a piece of legislation \nwhere we maybe do one thing but then all the money shifts somewhere \nelse. Then people will just be even more disillusioned. I think this is \na core issue.\n  There are a lot of good things all of us could do here. A lot of good \nthings get trumped by big money in politics.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude--how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 41 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just conclude by thanking all the conferees on \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill, especially \nfor all the women and men in the Parkinson's community who worked so \nhard to make sure that we have some clear directive to NIH about making \nsure that there will now be some real investment of resources in \nresearch to find the cure to Parkinson's disease. It has been one of \nthe greatest lobbying efforts I have ever seen here. It was citizen \nlobbyists, people who struggle with this disease, who once upon a time \nwere kind of embarrassed to be public and be out and about. People have \nbeen there.\n  All of you in the Parkinson's community, you have set a really good \nmodel for the Nation. Because if we had more people like you coming to \nWashington, DC, it would be a better Congress.\n  We need to get a lot more ordinary citizens coming to Washington or \nmeeting with us back in our States. I just hope more and more people \nwill be like that. It was a really fine victory.\n  Mr. President, I presume then there will not be an opportunity--my \ncolleagues are on the floor as well--we are not going back to fast \ntrack, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And there is not an opportunity to offer amendments? I \nask the majority party as to when I might have an opportunity to offer \nan amendment to fast track? I will do it later--I see my colleagues on \nthe floor--but will there be an opportunity?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As was indicated to the Senator, the Chair \ndoes not think that has been arranged, and it will depend upon the \ninstructions from the leader.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12228-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed immediately to H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring Act of 1997 by \ndischarging this legislation from the Senate Finance Committee to which \nit was referred on Thursday; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to object to the unanimous-consent \nrequest made by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey. The \nprocess of his seeking a UC agreement and my objecting is into its \nfourth day now. I do want to say publicly that I appreciate the civil \nand courteous manner in which the process has unfolded.\n  It is my opinion that what unites Senator Kerrey and me is more \nsignificant than what divides us. His successful commission has done \nessential work in uncovering weaknesses and shortcomings within the \nIRS. The 3 days of hearings we held in the Finance Committee disclosed \nothers. Both of us are well aware of the changes that must be made \nwithin the agency.\n  Senator Kerrey is right when he says the vast majority of our \ncolleagues would vote to pass the legislation which passed the House by \na vote of 426 to 4. Indeed, when one looks at the abuses and \ninefficiency of the IRS, it is hard to resist the argument that any \nreform is better than no reform at all. Senator Kerrey is correct in \nsaying that the legislation he proposes would make important reforms to \nthe IRS, but he is also right in saying that the legislation is not \ncomplete. It has weaknesses, and I must emphasize very, very serious \nweaknesses.\n  Mr. President, the simple truth is that I am not willing to \ncompromise on real reform. I am not willing to rush into legislation \nthat does not go far enough to address the changes that must take place \nwithin the agency, especially when rushing in will adversely impact the \npotential of passing real reform later. The fact is, this reform falls \nshort of what we need to accomplish.\n  The New York Times reports that ``tax experts across the country say \nthe practical benefits of the [legislation advocated by Senator Kerrey] \nwill be minor.'' According to Stuart E. Seigel, a former chief counsel \nof the IRS, ``Most of the bill's provisions are very limited and will \nnot have a significant impact on most taxpayers.''\n  Senator Kerrey suggests that each day the Senate delays in passing \nwhat the New York Times calls minor changes, some 150,000 people will \nbe affected as they continue to receive notices from the IRS. Yet, \nanother report in the Times makes it clear that ``the provisions in \n[this `watered down'] bill are [so] narrowly drawn [that it] would \naffect relatively few people.''\n  Senator Kerrey himself has made it clear that ``this [bill] doesn't \ngo far enough.'' The Wall Street Journal of November 3, 1997. And \nNewsweek reports that the strong measures aimed at reform have been \neviscerated.\n  The question all of this begs is simple: Why compromise? If Senator \nKerrey suggests this bill doesn't go far enough, if we have a growing \nconsensus among tax practitioners, taxpayers, and the media that the \nbill is deficient, and if we have the conviction in Congress and the \nsentiment at home that something significant must be done, why are we \nwilling to compromise?\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that I am not willing to \ncompromise. Some would suggest that half a loaf is better than none; \nthat we can come back and stiffen up this legislation later.\n  Well, we know where that will lead. If we pass this reform \nlegislation, then those who are not anxious to pass further reforms \nwill resist a new bill. The truth is that we will get only one real \nchance to reform the IRS, and we had better do it right.\n\n  There are several significant issues we need to address. We should \nbegin by giving the oversight board called for in this legislation, and \nif we adopt such a board, the authority to look at audit and collection \nactivities. More than 70 percent of Americans think poor treatment in \naudits occurs fairly regularly, yet this legislation expressly \nprohibits the oversight board from having jurisdiction over audits and \nenforcement.\n\n[[Page S12231]]\n\n  This is just the beginning, Mr. President. Let's include a provision \nto ensure that all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS does not \nabusively use its liens-and-seizure authority. Let's give the taxpayer \nadvocate greater independence. Likewise, the IRS should have the \nbenefit of an independent inspector general. Let's strengthen the \nlegislation to require signatures on all IRS-generated correspondence, \nand let's curb the use of false identifications by agency employees and \nban the use of statistics and goals in determining their performance.\n  These changes are only a beginning of what needs to be done. Yet, the \nlegislation advocated by my distinguished colleague does not address \neven these most fundamental needs. If we are unprepared at this time to \nadd these things, then let's be patient. Let's not pass a bill that \nSenator Kerrey has already suggested ``doesn't go far enough.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, let me return the \ncompliment. I have high praise for the chairman. He has done \nexceptional work on this issue, especially the 3 days of hearings which \npenetrated the section 6103 veil and issues that are protected under \nnormal circumstances by privacy laws.\n  Let me also respectfully disagree with his characterization of this \nas a watered-down bill, citing the Washington Post, the New York Times, \net cetera. They are apt to object to many of the things that the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware wants to do as well.\n  This piece of legislation has the full endorsement of America's \naccountants, America's enrolled agents, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, the National Treasury Employees Union. It is by \nno means small reform. I intend this afternoon to go through the bill. \nIt was sitting at the desk a couple of days ago. We could have taken \nthis thing up a couple of weeks ago and had a full debate on it. We \nwould have had plenty of opportunity to amend it, to improve it and to \nchange it, but we didn't. I am going to go through this bill and let my \ncolleagues decide on behalf of their taxpayers whether or not they want \nto change the law.\n  It looks like we only have a day or two left, but all we have to do \nis bring it up here to the floor. All we have to do is have no \nobjection raised, and we can pass this piece of legislation. I am going \nto show some of the new things this law would provide to the American \ntaxpayers as they consider whether or not this piece of legislation is \nwatered-down.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding. I have \nanother matter to attend to in a short period of time. I wanted to come \nto the floor and spread on the Record of this Senate that the Senator \nfrom Nebraska should be commended and applauded for the work that he \nhas done on this issue. He chaired the Entitlement Commission, of which \nI had the good fortune to serve as a member. It was a tremendous \nexperience. One of the things I will never forget is the testimony that \nwas taken during those hearings about the Internal Revenue Service.\n  We have heard figures that it costs at least $200 billion a year just \nfor people to fill out their forms. That is only part of it. We had \ntestimony during those hearings that the cost of the Internal Revenue \nCode itself is up to $400 billion. It is lots of money, we recognize \nthat.\n  I worked hard to write the taxpayer bill of rights. It is now the \nlaw. It was a help, but it didn't go far enough. We need to do better.\n  What this legislation will do--which has received the almost \nunanimous support of the House of Representatives, 426 to 4, and the \nPresident of the United States supports this legislation--this \nlegislation would give the Internal Revenue Service some meaning. The \nemployees of the Internal Revenue Service support this legislation, \nformer Commissioners of the Internal Revenue Service support this \nlegislation. The Senator from Nebraska has done the right thing by \nmoving beyond the Entitlement Commission, to the Kerrey-Portman \nCommission which studied specifically the Internal Revenue Service, and \nnow is responsible for the bill having passed the House and now in the \nSenate where it should pass.\n  This is good, elementary legislation. It is legislation that will \nmake the American people feel good about an important institution of \nGovernment, the Internal Revenue Service, which is now a hiss and a \nbyword. People should not feel that way about the Internal Revenue \nService, even though they do. This legislation, which should be passed \nby unanimous consent, would allow the American public to feel better \nabout the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n  So I say to my friend from Nebraska, you are on the right track again \nwith this legislation. This is something that is necessary, it is \nimportant, it is important because it creates this oversight board. It \nis important because it allows recovery of attorneys fees. It allows \nrecovery of damages. There is a toll free number to register \ncomplaints. It improves the operation of the Taxpayer Advocate Office. \nIt is good legislation. I do hope the Senator will go through this \nlegislation and explain to the American public why it is so important \nwe pass it and pass it now.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from Nevada, especially for his \nearlier work on the taxpayer bill of rights and taxpayer bill of rights \nII. Prior to the enactment of those laws, the taxpayer had almost no \nauthority at all coming up against the IRS. With the enactment of those \ntwo bills, the taxpayer now has a substantial amount of power which was \npreviously denied, and those who predicted there would be a big decline \nin collections --which, as you know, was the case--those predictions \ndid not turn out to be true.\n  This really gets right to the heart of it. This is not just an agency \ncollecting money in order for us to be able to pay the bills, whatever \nit is we declare in law we are going to use taxpayer money to pay for. \nThis really gets to the heart of Government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people. If people don't trust that they are getting \na fair shake with the tax laws, with those 8 out of 10 who voluntarily \ncomply--actually 83 percent of the American taxpayers comply, down from \n93 percent 10 years ago. To those 83 out of 100 who voluntarily comply, \nthey need to know, are they going to get the information they need to \npay their taxes; are they going to get a fair shake if there is a \ndispute; are they going to face an agency that has the capacity to be \nmanaged in a way that is comparable to what the private-sector \nfinancial institutions demonstrate on their behalf?\n  The answer right now is no in all three cases. More people pay taxes \nthan vote in this country and their dissatisfaction with this agency is \nbroad, it is deep and it is urgent, not just for the sake of being able \nto say we have done all we can to get this agency running correctly, \nbut it is essential for the sake of people's confidence in their \nGovernment that we enact these changes.\n  I heard, again, the distinguished chairman of the committee, whose \nwillingness to hold hearings on this subject has been terribly \nimportant to examine beyond the privacy veil some of the additional \nproblems that go on with the IRS, say this is a watered-down piece of \nlegislation. That is not true, Mr. President. It may be true in the \neyes of people who are opposed to the bill. Indeed, of the four \nopponents of the legislation in the House--426 voted in favor of it, 4 \nvoted against--the people who voted against it thought it went too far.\n  He cited yesterday, and again today, editorials that were objecting \nnot to the bill because it didn't do enough, but because it went too \nfar. These are people who don't want change at all. That don't want any \nchange in the way the IRS is run. They think it is run just fine.\n  So for those of us who have heard our citizens say that they call the \nIRS up and they can't get an answer to what becomes one of the most \nimportant questions they have when they are doing financial planning--\nwhich is, how much do I owe the Government? --for those citizens who \nfind themselves in receipt of a notice of collection because they have \nbeen told that\n\n[[Page S12232]]\n\nthey haven't paid enough and find themselves wondering whether or not \nthey are going to be able to withstand the IRS's assault on them, and \nfor those who watch this agency continue to try to come into the \nelectronic world and fail time after time after time, for all those and \nmany more besides, this piece of legislation solves their problems. It \nsolves their problems, Mr. President.\n\n  I suspect that it is not likely that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are going to come down here and say, ``For gosh sakes, \nlet's get this thing passed.'' I mean, on the House side it has the \nsupport of the Speaker, of Dick Armey, of Bill Archer. In fact, the \npercentage of Republicans supporting it in the House is 100 percent. \nThe only people who opposed it are those who believe this legislation \nhas gone too far, not that I did not go far enough.\n  There are five titles, Mr. President, in this piece of legislation. \nIt is again worth noting, for those who say, ``Well, can't we just hire \na private-sector person, as we just did with Mr. Rossotti to run the \nIRS? Isn't that enough? Don't we just need to manage it a little \nbetter?'' you know, this is a nation of laws. The IRS doesn't exist \nbecause somebody decided to put it out there. It was created by the \nU.S. Congress. It operates as a consequence of what the law says, not \njust the Tax Code but the other laws that enabled that agency to be \ncreated in the first place. So it is a creature of law. It is the law \nthat determines whether or not we are going to be able to get \nsatisfaction for our citizens.\n  So for those who are wondering why we are talking about the law here, \nwe are talking about the law because the IRS was created by the law, \nand many things that people have come and asked for, the IRS can't do \nbecause the law does not allow it. So we have to change the law in \norder to be able to do the things that people have been coming to us \nsaying needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, title I is called the ``Executive Branch Governance \nAnd Senior Management of the Internal Revenue Service.'' It sounds \ninnocuous enough. Indeed, most of the debate about this piece of \nlegislation, regrettably, has been focused on the first half of title \nI, and that is the executive branch governance.\n  There was resistance early to having a public board governing the IRS \nand have control and authority over the IRS. We finally persuaded the \nPresident that this was a good idea. This public board does have real \nauthority to develop a strategic plan to make budget recommendations \nand make comment on the acceptability of the IRS Commissioner--\ntremendous authority under the law.\n  There are some people who would like to go further. As I said, most \nof the people that have looked at this, if they have any objection at \nall, they object to it going too far. They object and say that the \nPresident should not have agreed to it, that he should not have said \nyes to us in this regard.\n  We felt that having a public board--in this case a 9-person public \nboard--with authority over the developing and strategic plan was \ncrucial in order to be able to develop some consensus between the \nCongress and the executive branch about what the IRS was going to do.\n  What is the plan? If you don't have a plan, then it is going to be \nvery, very difficult to have any kind of an implementation strategy.\n  The distinguished chairman says they want to be able to go and look \nat audit information. I do not believe this board ought to be looking \nat returns, nor do I think it ought to be getting into the details of \naudits. Should it be able to look at the standards of audits? \nAbsolutely.\n  Indeed, in one of the other titles of this legislation we require the \nIRS to publish the standards of audits. If people say, ``Gosh, don't \nthey already?'' I say, no. I say to citizens who are concerned about \nthis, we had only one full study on the basis of audits, the way audits \nare conducted by the IRS, only one study by a woman at the University \nof Syracuse who got the information through a Freedom of Information \nAct request.\n  And every time she publishes her report, which is highly critical of \nthe IRS--saying that the audit is done on one basis in Arizona and a \ndifferent basis in Nebraska, that their subjective determinations are \nrampant throughout, that there does not appear to be consistency from \none State to another, that it depends on where you live as to whether \nor not you are going to be audited, all kinds of criticism of this \naudit-- every time she surfaces those criticisms, the IRS attacks her. \n``Oh, no. You're wrong. You're just some flake up there at Syracuse. \nDon't trust the information.'' We have all heard that before.\n  When you have an agency like the IRS, they are able to say they have \nthe power. Since they have the information, they can just say the \ncitizen is wrong.\n  This law requires the IRS to publish the standards of their audits. \nLet us decide. Let the citizens decide. Let the people examine this \ninformation to determine whether or not there is an objective basis for \nthe audit and whether or not the public supports it. Don't let the IRS \nsort of do it on their own because it leaves open the possibility that \nyou get what we have right now, which is a very substantial lack of \nconfidence from one State to the next as to whether or not the citizen, \nthe taxpayer is getting a fair shake. Again, back to what I said \nbefore, this is the way the IRS strikes at the heart of \ncitizen confidence in Government of, by, and for the people.\n\n  We are not talking about reform in the EPA here or the USDA that \ntouches a much smaller number of people or even the Federal Election \nCommission that touches only individuals who chose to run for office. \nThis agency touches almost every single household. Every single \nAmerican has some contact with the IRS on an annual basis.\n  The second half of this title which is crucial--and this is one that \nif I ever come down here and offer my unanimous consent request, and \nthe bill gets discharged, and we vote on it, my guess is it is going to \ngo 100 to nothing, or close to it. And one of the reasons I believe \nthat is the section in title I that deals with management of the \nInternal Revenue Service senior management.\n  People are surprised when they hear that the Commissioner has no \nauthority to hire, to fire, to bring on their own team. Now, we make \ncertain that veteran preferences are maintained, that the Commissioner \nhas to follow the employment regulations of the Federal Government, \nespecially the civil rights regulations. But significantly, though, \nthis strengthens the Commissioner's ability to be able to manage, to be \nable not only to use punitive penalties for those who are not doing a \ngood job but put positive incentives in place.\n  Mr. Rossotti is from the private sector who came and talked to the \nSenate Finance Committee, when we held his confirmation hearings, and \ntold us all the wonderful things he was going to do to manage the \nagency. The law does not give him the authority to do it, does not \nenable him to do the things he wants to do. We said, you can hire 25 \nmore people. We gave him the authority to hire 25 more people, the only \nthing is they won't have any authority.\n  Those of us who have had the opportunity to serve our country in the \nArmed Services understands one of the first things we were taught is \nthe difference between responsibility and authority; that I can \ndelegate authority, but responsibility always stays with me. One of the \nworst situations you can have in life is to be given a lot of \nresponsibility but no authority.\n  And that is what he has. He has the responsibility--everybody comes \nto him and complains when the agency isn't being run right--but he does \nnot have the authority under the law to manage the agency, either with \npenalties or with affirmative incentives in place to reward people for \ndoing a good job, to reward people for their high-performance in \nmeeting the objectives and performance standards that he has set out in \nthis law to present to the board and to present to the Congress.\n  Title II deals with electronic filing. I can see why some people who \nhave been commenting on this bill, as if they have read it, ignore this \nparticular section. It is kind of boring--electronic filing. Electronic \nfiling does not sound like it is a very exciting piece of information.\n  I tell you, for the American people who pay for this agency, $7.3 \nbillion a year to run it, and for those who are filing tax returns out \nthere, who spend $200 billion a year to complete the forms, electronic \nfiling is a big deal.\n\n[[Page S12233]]\n\n  Why? It is a big deal, Mr. President, because we discovered --our \nrestructuring commission that held 12 public hearings and thousands of \nmeetings with employees and with former employees, as well as with all \nthe people that help private-sector people, citizens to fill out their \ntax returns--we discovered that the error rate in the paper world is 25 \npercent and the error rate in electronic filing is less than 1 percent. \nAnd we change that in this law.\n  We still have a provision in there that requires under law that you \nhave to actually put a signature document with your electronic filing, \neven though when we went down and visited the service centers and we \ntalked to service center employees about this signature document--this \npiece of paper that has to still be filed, it is a requirement of the \nDepartment of Justice. The truth is, if you sign in black, the copiers \nare not so good anymore and it will not stand up in a court of law as \nto whether it is the real signature or a copy. So these stacks of \npapers they have down there are not worth anything. It is still \nrequired under law, but it is a nuisance to the taxpayer. Even with \nthat paper having to be filed, the error rate is less than 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to doing any piece of work, whether it \nis preparing your own or trying to make the tax collection agency run \nefficiently, an error is money. It costs the taxpayers twice. It costs \nthem first in an agency that is more inefficient than it ought to be, \nand it costs them a second time because it adds to the $200 billion. \nSome fraction of that $200 billion is there because it is inefficient, \nbecause it is difficult to get the information, because it takes longer \nthan it otherwise would have.\n  For those who sort of are trying to, in their own minds, scratch \ntheir head and figure out what I am talking about--which is not \naltogether easy sometimes--most of us in our billfolds, our purses will \nhave a thing called an ATM card, a little piece of plastic that the \nprivate sector has developed. They developed it to make it easier to \nmake financial transactions, to do business with your bank or financial \ninstitution. Lord knows, it is a lot easier. It is lots more \nconvenient. It enables you to do things that otherwise you would have \nto actually physically go in while the bank was opened to get done.\n\n  Well, you ask yourself, ``How come the IRS has not done that?'' The \nanswer, Mr. President, again, is the law. There are insufficient \nincentives and there is no way to achieve consensus.\n  We started this thing in 1995, 2 years ago, when Senator Shelby and I \nstood on the floor managing the Treasury-Postal bill. And we fought \nagainst the IRS because they had just been determined by the General \nAccounting Office to have wasted $4 billion in purchasing computers.\n  We discovered in our restructuring commission these computers can't \neven talk to one another. You have a stove pipe organization, and one \nstove pipe doesn't talk to the other stove pipe, and it doesn't talk to \nthe other stove pipe, and you can't get the information you need. It \ncan take months and months and months to get information you need.\n  Mr. President, time for the American taxpayer is money. And they pay \nfor it twice. So this section in here, electronic filing. Again, I \nunderstand why it has been ignored by people who write editorial \npieces, because it is not very glamorous. It is not, you know, a very \nhot issue. It is not the sort of thing that sort of gets the blood \nboiling. But it is the sort of thing that will save taxpayers an awful \nlot of time and an awful lot of money.\n  Let me get to the third title. Those who say, ``Well, how about all \nthose concerns we hear in the Finance Committee that taxpayers were \nraising?'' Title III deals with taxpayer protection and rights. I am \nwilling to go further. Had this bill been brought to the floor a couple \nweeks ago, we could have, in fact, strengthened the Taxpayer Advocate \nOffice.\n  I am willing to make it more independent than it currently is even in \nthis law, which gives the Taxpayer Advocate a lot more independence and \na lot more power than they currently have. Hardly watered down, hardly \ninsufficient, hardly minor if you are one of the taxpayers who get \naffected in here. We shift the burden of proof when you go to Tax \nCourt--a big deal.\n  Today the presumption is that the taxpayer is guilty. If you get a \nnotice, if you are one of the 135,000 people every single day who \nreceived, in addition to other sorts of things in the mail, a little \nthing that says ``Internal Revenue Service,'' there isn't any feeling \nquite like that to wake you up in the morning. You get that little \npiece of notice in the mail and your hands shake. And you open it up, \nand it says, you owe $100, you owe $500, $1,000, whatever the number \nis.\n  Under current law, the presumption is you are wrong; they are right. \nThe burden is on you. You have to prove they are wrong, if you want to \ntry to prove it. If you agree with them, fine, you send them a check. \nBut if you say, ``My gosh, I did this myself. I had an accountant help \nme. I had somebody else help me. I didn't make any mistake. I don't owe \nany additional money,'' welcome to the club. Now it is for you to prove \nthat you are right, they are wrong.\n  We did not go as far as some would have liked to say, that you go \nimmediately and shift the burden of proof so that the IRS has to prove \nyou are wrong, because we felt that would punish and penalize the 83 \nout of 100 people who voluntarily comply who aren't receiving a notice; \nbut we said, if you reach Tax Court, if you are unable to settle this \nthing and you reach Tax Court, it does shift now to the IRS. They have \nto prove that you are guilty, as is the case in every other court of \nlaw. This is not a minor change. Even though it was only several \nthousand people a year that end up in Tax Court, Mr. President, I will \nguarantee you, if you are one of those several thousand people, this is \nnot a small change. This is a big change. And it will likely have a \ntremendous impact on your capacity to get a fair hearing before a U.S. \nTax Court.\n  In subtitle B of title III there are a number of things dealing with \nwhat is called proceedings by taxpayers. It expands the authority to \naward costs and fees. We earlier had a discussion yesterday of this.\n  Today, you cannot get your attorney fees if you are found not to owe \nanything. Under this provision, the answer would be you would get \nattorney fees. You have the opportunity to be awarded up to $100,000 of \ncivil damages if the IRS can be demonstrated to be negligent. Today, if \nthe IRS is negligent or the IRS makes a mistake or the IRS is at fault, \nthey don't have to worry about it. There is no penalty in place under \nthe law to the IRS if they make a mistake.\n  Under this law there would be. It changes their attitude. It puts \nthem in the frame of mind of saying, ``My gosh, if I'm going to send a \nletter out to somebody and say they owe money, I better make sure they \nowe money, I better be reasonably certain I can make the case in Tax \nCourt and better be reasonably certain, because if I'm demonstrated to \nbe wrong, we could be out of some dough here. And if I'm negligent,'' \nwhich is very often the case, ``if I'm negligent, we're going to have \nto pay a price for it.''\n  We all understand that there needs to be some sort of negative \nsanction against behavior that could put people at risk. This law does \nthat in a reasonable, responsible way, but certainly not in an \ninsignificant way for those individuals out there--again, 135,000 every \nsingle working day--that are going to receive a notice of collection. \nThis is not a small item for them.\n  There is a title in here called ``Elimination of Interest Rates \nDifferential on Overlapping Periods of Interest on Income Tax \nOverpayments and Underpayments.'' I will not go into this at length on \nthe floor here this afternoon. Again this is not a small item. We have \ntaxpayers out there saying, ``My gosh, I don't understand it. You have \ngiven me a bill, I am in dispute, and I have to settle early because if \nI don't there is a possibility I could end up with a huge penalty.'' In \nno court of law do you have that. In no court of law do you have a \nsituation where a citizen says, ``I better make up my mind in a hurry \nhere, otherwise I could end up with an enormous penalty. I could be \npenalized as a consequence of trying to make my case.''\n  Other titles here are ``Protections for Taxpayers Subject to Audit or \nCollection Activities,'' ``Privilege of confidentiality extended to \ntaxpayer's\n\n[[Page S12234]]\n\ndealing with nonattorneys authorized to practice before Internal \nRevenue Service,'' ``Expansion of authority to issue taxpayer \nassistance orders,'' ``Limitation on financial status audit \ntechniques,'' ``Limitation authority to require production of computer \nsource code,'' ``Procedures relating to extensions of statutes of \nlimitation by agreement,'' or ``Offers-in-compromise,'' ``Notice of \ndeficiency to specify deadlines for filing Tax Court petition,'' \n``Refund or credit of overpayments before final determination,'' \n``Threat of audit prohibited to coerce Tip Reporting Alternative \nCommitment Agreements.''\n  Mr. President, these are not small items. I would be surprised if \nthere is a single Senate office that has not heard a taxpayer bring \none, if not several, of these things to the attention of a Member. \nThese are not small. These are not insignificant. These are changes \nthat could shift and cause taxpayers to say, ``Finally, you are doing \nsomething that makes sense.'' The IRS cannot do it today. They are \nprohibited from doing these things. Again, we are a nation of laws, and \nonce the laws are changed, the IRS will behave in the way the law \ndirects.\n  There is a subtitle, ``Disclosures to Taxpayers.'' What is the big \ndeal? We had at least one witness before the Senate Finance Committee, \na woman, who came and said she was surprised to discover that after her \nhusband had divorced her and hit the road, she ended up being liable \nfor his tax bill. We all heard it and said it was terrible, it \nshouldn't be the case. She was terrorized by the IRS. They put her and \nher new husband in jeopardy. She ended up getting divorced, Mr. \nPresident, over this because she was better off divorced. It is \nterrible. Change the law.\n  Well, bring the bill up and vote on it. You want to wait until next \nyear? You want to put these people at risk? You don't want to solve a \nproblem you know you can solve by changing the law? I don't understand \nit. I simply don't understand it. I don't understand what benefit is \ngained by delaying. We have a bill that we can bring up today--today. \nAll it would take is the majority leader persuading the Republicans on \nthat side. Every single Democrat is ready to bring it up. As I say once \nit is here for a vote, my guess is it is unanimous. Once people start \nlooking at the details of the bill and see what is in this bill itself, \nI don't think they will object to this. I don't think they will come \ndown here and say, gee, these are small, these are insignificant, these \naren't anything that is going to have an impact on people.\n  Subtitle G is called ``Low Income Taxpayer Clinics.'' I say there are \npeople who are working, people in the work force, people out there \ntrying to figure out how to read the Tax Code. There must be something \nout there available to them. The answer is there is not. We are not \nspending a lot of money, but we are saying keep the playing field \nlevel, give people the opportunity to get their questions answered in \nthe same way you can get a question answered if your income is high \nenough that you can hire an accountant to get the job done for you.\n  Mr. President, these are not small items in this legislation.\n  The next title in this bill is ``Congressional Accountability for the \nInternal Revenue Service.'' As I said earlier, as much praise as I got \nfrom the chairman after 3 days of hearings, we discovered for the first \ntime in 21 years the subcommittee held a hearing. We had people \ncriticize us. I guess every 21 years is too often. This is a \nrequirement every 6 months for the Joint Tax Committee to meet and hold \na hearing with this new public board. Why? Not just for oversight, but \nso we can get consensus on what the strategic plan is going to be.\n  Every single private-sector person, every other government agency \nthat talked to us about the technology investments, Mr. President--that \nis the key question. How do you make an investment in computers, and \nespecially the software and operating system, for this 110,000-person \nagency that processes over 200 million returns a year? How do you do it \nwhen the processing occurs over a 150- or 180-day period? Every person \nthat came to us said, unless you know where you are going, unless you \nhave consensus on a strategic plan and understand the IRS currently has \na board of directors that includes every single Member of Congress, 535 \npeople on its board of directors--we heard witness after witness come \nto us and say the problem very often is not the IRS, but the Congress.\n\n  You have to give better oversight, more consistent oversight so they \nknow what they are supposed to do. Congress is giving permission. We \nare not saying there will be a blank check. Congress still retains the \nauthority to cut, to do whatever it wants, in response to things it \nsees the IRS doing or not doing. Congress still retains the authority \nto authorize and appropriate money. We have to have a mechanism to \nimprove the oversight that Congress gives the IRS.\n  You say it is a small item. It is a big item. Mr. Rossotti will tell \nyou it is a big item. There is one speed bump, and he is heading for \nNiagara Falls. When he will have 200 million returns filed, he hits one \nspeed bump and he will come before six committees--three in the Senate \nand three in the House--to answer questions about what he did or didn't \ndo and why he didn't solve the problems that he was supposed to solve.\n  Mr. President, this piece of legislation has many other things, and I \nwill probably have an opportunity to talk further about this. Members \nneed to understand what is in the bill. You have heard complaints and \nconcerns coming from citizens at home. This piece of legislation will \nsolve an awful lot of those concerns. You will go home and your \ntaxpayers will say to you, ``For gosh sakes, what did you gain by \ndelay?'' I stand here and predict the statements didn't go far enough. \nWe need to do more. My guess is all we are doing by waiting another 150 \nor whatever the days are, and we will pass a piece of legislation \nroughly the same. This is a very strong piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an IRS reform \nindex that shows the cost of delay and shows the kind of support it has \non the House side and the kind of support it has in the private sector.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          The IRS Reform Index\n\n       As of Sunday, November 9, number of consecutive days on \n     which Senate Republican leadership has blocked Senator Bob \n     Kerrey's attempt to bring up his IRS reform bill: 4.\n       Number of Senate Democrats who have urged Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott to pass Kerrey bill before adjournment: 42.\n       Number of collection notices the IRS has mailed since \n     Senate Republican leadership first blocked consideration of \n     Kerrey bill: 396,000.\n       Number of taxpayers who have tried to call the IRS during \n     that time: 825,000.\n       Number of collection notices that will be mailed before \n     Senate returns January 26, the next date at which IRS reform \n     could be considered if Republican leaders continue to block \n     consideration of Kerrey bill: 9,504,000.\n       Number of taxpayer calls before Senate reconvenes: \n     19,800,000.\n       Number of those callers who, according to national \n     averages, will be unable to get through: 9,702,000.\n       Number of those who do get through whose questions will be \n     answered incorrectly: 807,840.\n       Vote by which House version of Kerrey bill passed: 426-4.\n       Percentage of House Republicans, including Newt Gingrich, \n     Dick Armey and Bill Archer, supporting that bill: 100.\n       Amount Majority Leader Trent Lott called the ``teeny'' \n     price of a phony ``poll'' Republicans propose to send out \n     with all tax returns to assess taxpayer attitudes toward the \n     same IRS they are objecting to reforming: $30 million.\n       Number of Nebraskans whose entire annual income tax bills \n     would be required to finance that ``teeny'' sum: 11,033.\n       Number of members of Congress who ought to know their \n     constituents are fed up with the IRS without spending between \n     $30 and $80 million on an unscientific survey: 535.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I hope in the time remaining, all it will take is my \nfriends on the Republican side simply not objecting to bringing this \nbill up, for us to act on it and get it to the President with his \nsignature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12230-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12234-S12235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss Federal meddling in the internal affairs of my home State of \nOregon.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the people of my State have been \ndiscussing at length the concept of assisted suicide. In fact, the \npeople of Oregon have spoken twice on this issue. It is a very \ndifficult issue, and after months of thoughtful debate and intense \nmedia scrutiny, the voters of my State have voted to allow physicians \nto assist their terminally ill patients in ending their lives.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, let me say that I have deep personal \nreservations about the concept of assisted suicide. I have voted twice \nas a private citizen against assisted suicide, and once on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate I voted against Federal funding of assisted suicide. \nBut let me also say that the voters of my State in a recent ballot \nmeasure have voted no on the question of repealing the matter of \nassisted suicide they voted for earlier.\n  My question today is, what part of no does the Federal Government \nfail to understand? We saw just a few hours after the Oregon vote some \nof the most powerful Members of the U.S. Congress and the Clinton \nadministration looking to overturn the popular will of the people of \nOregon. Within hours of the Oregon vote, a letter emerged from the Drug \nEnforcement Administration to the Members of Congress who control the \nbudget for the Drug Enforcement Administration. In effect, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration indicates they want to declare war on \nphysicians in Oregon and those they serve by threatening to revoke the \ndrug dispensing privileges of any physician who abides by the law that \nOregon has now passed on two separate occasions. In effect, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration is interested in thwarting the will of \nOregonians.\n  Now, Mr. President and colleagues, let me repeat again, I have deep \npersonal reservations about assisted suicide. Going back to my days \nwith senior citizens as codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers, I have \nbeen most interested in looking at medical advances in pain management \nand hospice care, and I don't think there has even been a beginning at \nthose efforts, and certainly those are the first efforts that \ngovernmental bodies at every level ought to be trying to support.\n  But when the people have spoken, and in this case the people of my \nState have spoken twice, it is time for the Federal Government to back \noff. It is not as if this town doesn't have enough to do already on \nthis floor. It is obvious that important legislation needs to be passed \nas it relates to a number of Federal agencies. Certainly, the Drug \nEnforcement Agency has important work to do. I don't see any evidence \nthat they have stemmed the flow of cocaine and heroin and \nmethamphetamine to our kids. It seems to me the Clinton administration \nand the Drug Enforcement Administration has plenty to do right now \nother than to meddle in the internal affairs of the State of Oregon.\n  Now, I have great respect for the Members of Congress who are \ninterested in this issue. A number of them are personal friends and \nindividuals with whom I have worked on a bipartisan basis on health \ncare legislation such as the Food and Drug Administration and health \ncare legislation to protect our youngsters. I have great respect for \nthe Members of Congress, the leaders of the committees that have \njurisdiction over the budget for the Drug Enforcement Agency, and I \nrespect them and have worked with them on many occasions.\n  However, I say to those Members of Congress and to the Clinton \nadministration that it is an inappropriate exercise of our \nresponsibilities to impose personal or religious views on the voters of \nOregon. Those voters have spoken. My personal views notwithstanding, I \nwant the Federal Government to get that fairly simple concept known as \n``No.'' The people of Oregon have spoken on this issue, and it seems to \nme if there were a constitutional question involved, perhaps you could \nunderstand why the Congress and the Clinton administration would be \ninterested in this Oregon ballot initiative. But in fact, a Federal \ncourt has recently ruled against a constitutional challenge to Oregon's \nlaw, and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld that ruling.\n  Mr. President, the citizens of my home State have now made law with \nrespect to what they consider to be compassionate care on the part of \nOregon physicians. It was not a rush to judgment. There were two very \nextensive debates in my State, and I have already indicated that my \nview with respect to assisted suicide is that I still have deep \nreservations about the concept.\n  But the voters of my State have spoken. It would be wrong for those \nat the Federal level to meddle with that decision. It would be wrong to \noverride the judgment of Oregon voters. And it is my view, Mr. \nPresident, that neither this Congress, nor the Clinton administration, \nnor the DEA, should trample on the judgment of Oregon voters on an \nissue that the courts have already decided is a matter that should be \ndecided in my home State of Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12235-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12235-S12236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REDUCING THE RISK OF UNAUTHORIZED OR ACCIDENTAL LAUNCH OF BALLISTIC \n                                MISSILES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as hard as it is for me to believe, it \nwas 8 years ago this month that the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. Who \namong us can forget the stirring pictures of that moment? The entire \nworld watched as jubilant Germans, separated for 38 years by a man-made \nscar running the length of their country, breached this once \nimpregnable barrier. In so doing, they not only united Germany, they \nbrought together a continent.\n  The dismantlement of the wall dramatically symbolized to all that \ndemocracy had at last triumphed over totalitarianism. The fall of the \nwall set in motion a series of incredible events. In June 1991, Boris \nYeltsin became the first democratically elected Russian President. Two \nmonths later Yeltsin disbanded the Communist Party. By the end of 1991, \nthe Soviet Union itself ceased to exist. And the Warsaw Pact, the once \nfearsome military alliance established to counter and defeat NATO, was \nofficially dissolved.\n  After five decades of tension, the loss of thousands of lives, and \nthe expenditure of several trillion dollars, the cold war was over. \nHowever, as the euphoria of this historic occasion began to melt away, \nleaders in the United States, Europe, and Russia began to realize that \nthe national security paradigms they had used for nearly half a century \nno longer applied. They would be required to think anew--a task that \npresented both challenges and opportunities.\n  President George Bush took the first steps toward aligning our \nnational security posture with the emerging post-cold war realities in \nSeptember 1991.\n  Acting on the advice of Gen. George Butler, the commander in chief of \nthe U.S. Strategic Command, President Bush ordered the U.S. Air Force \nto stand-down the portion of our strategic bomber force it had kept \nready to fly at a moment's notice for most of the cold war. Shortly \nthereafter, the nuclear weapons on-board these planes were removed and \nplaced in storage. President Bush would also take off alert status \nthose strategic missiles earmarked for elimination under the START I \nTreaty.\n  President Clinton has also contributed to solving our post-cold war \nsecurity concerns. Under his leadership, the Senate ratified the START \nII Treaty, which limits the United States and Russia to no more than \n3,500 strategic weapons. President Clinton completed negotiations on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and secured the Senate's approval this \npast April. The CWC treaty would eliminate the scourge of chemical \nweapons from the face of the Earth. And finally, just 1 month ago, \nPresident Clinton submitted to the\n\n[[Page S12236]]\n\nSenate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If enacted, this treaty would \nbe a useful tool in our efforts to stem proliferation. I hope the \nSenate will be allowed to act on this treaty when we return.\n  While we have made some progress in realigning our national security \npolicies to more fully reflect the realities of the post-cold war \nworld, we still have much more to accomplish. Perhaps the most \nstartling and dramatic indicator of how far we have to go is the fact \nthat, as I stand here today--8 years after the fall of the Berlin \nWall--the United States and Russia still possess roughly 14,000 \nstrategic nuclear weapons and tens of thousands more tactical nuclear \nweapons. And even more alarming, both sides keep the vast majority of \ntheir strategic weapons on a high level of alert.\n  In a recent editorial, former Senator Sam Nunn and Dr. Bruce Blair \nassert that each nuclear superpower maintains roughly 3,000 strategic \nnuclear warheads ready to launch at a moment's notice. According to \nNunn and Blair, while this practice may have been necessary during the \ncold war, ``today [it] constitutes a dangerous anachronism.''\n  Mr. President, I believe we can and must do much more to address the \nthreat posed by nuclear weapons. On September 17, I sent a letter to \nthe Congressional Budget Office asking them to assess the budgetary and \nsecurity consequences of a series of measures designed to reduce the \nspread of nuclear weapons and the likelihood they would ever be used.\n  I expect to receive preliminary results from this inquiry by early \nnext year. In addition, I conducted a meeting earlier this week to \nexplore one particular means of reducing the risk of unauthorized or \naccidental use of nuclear weapons--removing from alert status some \nfraction of the strategic ballistic missile force.\n  As a result of this meeting and a series of discussions with Senator \nNunn, Dr. Blair, and General Butler, I am convinced that it is time to \nseriously consider de-alerting at least a portion of our strategic \nballistic missile. I say this for several reasons. First, the \nlikelihood of a surprise, bolt-out-of-the-blue attack of our strategic \nnuclear forces is unimaginable if not impossible in today's world.\n  Keeping large numbers of weapons on high alert status fails to \nrecognize this reality.\n  Second, concerns are growing about the reliability and condition of \nthe Russian early warning and command and control systems. United \nStates security depends on the Russians' ability to accurately assess \nthe status of United States forces and to control their own forces. \nPublic reports indicate their early warning sensors are aging and \nincomplete, their command and control system is deteriorating, and the \nmorale of the personnel operating these systems is suffering as a \nresult of the lack of pay and difficult working conditions.\n  It is in our interest to have Russian missiles taken off alert and \nRussian leaders given more time to interpret and respond to events.\n  Third, de-alerting a portion of our strategic missile force now could \nstrengthen the hand of those in the Russian Duma who support START II \nand other United States-Russian security measures. De-alerting some \nUnited States strategic missiles could send an important signal at a \ncrucial stage in Russia's consideration of the START II Treaty. In \naddition, when President Bush took unilateral action to de-alert a \nportion of our strategic forces, President Gorbachev reciprocated by \nremoving from alert a number of Russian land- and sea-based missiles.\n  Finally, de-alerting a portion of our strategic missile force would \nnot sacrifice U.S. security. The United States has already indicated a \nwillingness to reduce its total strategic force to as few as 2,000 \nweapons. Even if we were to de-alert the entire MX force, the United \nStates would retain roughly 2,500 weapons on alert status, and several \nthousand more could be made ready to launch. Moreover, should \ncircumstances warrant, the United States could reverse any de-alerting \nmeasures it may take.\n  Mr. President, despite the fact that the Soviet Union dissolved and \nthe cold war ended, the risks posed by nuclear weapons persist and \nevolve.\n  I plan to do what I can to explore options for reducing these risks. \nI believe de-alerting a portion of our missile force merits further \nstudy in this regard. I look forward to working with my colleagues and \nthe administration in the next session of Congress to fully explore \nthis measure as well as any other that could lessen the dangers of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of debate on the \nfloor over the last several days about fast-track authority, and a lot \nof it has run against my grain. I don't think it has been at a very \nhigh level. What I would like to do is respond to a few of the main \narguments that have been used against it that I have heard from some of \nmy colleagues about both the nature of fast-track authority and the \nneed for fast-track authority.\n  Before I begin I would like to say that West Virginia's economy \ndepends and will continue to depend enormously on strong growth in its \nexports. So any vote which is taken which does not support the \nproposition of promoting exports from West Virginia is one that I would \nquestion. Indeed, the U.S. economy is moving very strongly forward. I \ndon't believe myself that the growth will continue in West Virginia as \nstrongly as it might have if fast track does not pass this Congress, if \nwe do not give that authority to the President. West Virginia had $1.3 \nbillion in exports in 1996. That's about a 35-percent increase in \nexports since 1992. That is quite remarkable. West Virginia's specific \nexports to Japan, which is our second-largest export market, went up \n128 percent in 3 years. Just think about that, Mr. President--a 128 \npercent in 3 years; increasing exports increases West Virginia--and \nthat dramatic increase has been with just one country--Japan. And, in \nfact, that means West Virginia exports to Japan totaled about $116 \nmillion in 1996, which is not a lot in some States, but it is a lot in \nWest Virginia. U.S. exports increased by $125 billion last year alone--\na lot of this because of trade arrangements.\n  One thing is undeniably true--denying the President fast-track \nauthority will not create a single new job in West Virginia. Nobody can \nmake that argument with a straight face. It won't save a single job \neither to deny the President fast-track authority. It will only hamper \nour ability to sell goods to new markets, which is what this is about, \nand hurt the growth of a critical sector of our economy, and one that I \nhave personally been working on very hard over the last 10 to 15 years.\n  I think most of the arguments about the revolutionary provisions of \nfast track are highly overstated, and highly dramatized. Fast-track \nauthority isn't anything new. And, because it is a procedural \nmechanism, I don't think there is anything to be feared about it. I \nrecognize that others don't think so. Some have good arguments. Most \nhave rather poor arguments, I think. Fast track is a mechanism simply \nthat helps the United States keep up with the changing world economy \nand deal with our trading partners in 21st century management.\n  So, let me take a moment to respond to a few of the persistent \narguments which are used against fast track. These are just a few of \nthem.\n  Is there sufficient congressional consultation accompanying fast-\ntrack authority: Very big contentious deal. Right? We are ceding all of \nour authority to the President of the United\n\n[[Page S12237]]\n\nStates. We will no longer be a Senate. We will just be a tool of the \nPresidency.\n  That is ridiculous. Congressional consultation is required in order \nfor the administration to have and to retain fast-track authority and \nit has been significantly strengthened, I would say powerfully \nstrengthened, from what was required under the legislation granting the \nlast fast-track authority in 1988. New requirements for the \nadministration are imposed under this bill which the House, and some \nDemocrats in particular, don't seem to have the guts to be able to vote \nfor it. It has all been passed through the Senate Finance Committee in \norder to ensure the administration carefully coordinates and consults \nwith Congress at every stage of the process. Listen to me on this.\n  The 1988 act required that the President provide written notice to \nthe Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee of \nbilateral trade agreements at least 60 days before providing notice to \nthe Senate and the House of his intention to enter into an agreement--\nand, remember, this is the last fast-track authority--and to consult \nthe Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee \nregarding the negotiations.\n  The bill that we passed out of the Senate Finance Committee and which \nthe Senate has voted by a vote of 69 to 31 to take up, the President to \nprovide written notice to the Congress as a whole of his intention to \nbegin multilateral and bilateral negotiations at least 90 days in \nadvance.\n  That notice, Mr. President, must specify the date the President \nintends to begin such negotiations, the specific objectives of the \nnegotiations, and whether the President intends to negotiate a new \nagreement, or, on the other hand, to modify an old or existing \nagreement. Any failure of the President to provide notice can result in \nthe introduction and consideration of a ``procedural disapproval \nresolution'' which would deny fast track for the trade agreement, if \nthe resolution were approved.\n  This bill also requires the President to consult with the Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee, and with other \ncommittees, before and after providing the notice of his intention to \nbegin negotiations.\n  Already we are in advance of where we were in 1988.\n  The President must consult with all other committees that have any \njurisdiction or participation in this matter that request consultations \nif a committee wants to be consulted. If it wants to be consulted, it \ncan request consultation, and the President must consult with them in \nwriting.\n  In addition, the Senate Finance Committee's fast-track bill requires \nthe President to consult with the private sector advisory committees \nestablished under the 1974 Trade Act, as the President deems it \nappropriate, before beginning negotiations. This consultation takes \nplace before the trade negotiations have even begun.\n  Before the President is permitted to enter into a trade agreement, \nthe President must consult with the Senate Finance Committee, the House \nWays and Means Committee, as well as other committees of jurisdiction \nover legislation involving subjects that would be affected by the trade \nagreement, in addition to the consultation requirements of the 1988 \nact, which includes discussions about the nature of the agreement and a \ndetailed assessment of how the agreement meets the objectives and \npurposes of the act.\n  Now the Senate Finance Committee bill requires the President to \nconsult the Congress on all matters related to the implementation of \nthe agreement.\n  Free trade agreement negotiations must include an overview of the \nmacroeconomic environment of the countries with which the President \nintends to negotiate and a discussion of effects on exchange rates--on \nexchange rates. It is a good idea included in response to concerns \nraised by certain Members--and it is in the fast-track authority.\n  These consultations must be continuous as negotiations of the trade \nbill are continuous. What additional requirements for consultation do \nthe opponents of this want? Another new consultation requirement was \nadded in response to Senate Members' concerns about side agreements \nthat were entered into during previous free trade agreements, like \nNAFTA and the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The new \nrequirement mandates the President consult with respect to any other \nagreement he has entered into, or intends to enter into with the \ncountries party to the agreement.\n\n  This would include all kinds of agreements: Formal side agreements, \nexchange of letters, and any preagreed interpretations of the \nprovisions of a trade agreement entered into in conjunction with a \ntrade agreement.\n  Advisory committee reports are required.\n  What provision of the extensive consultation requirements am I on? \nNo. 7, No. 8? I have no idea what number I am on of all these new \nprovisions which give strength to the congressional role in forging \ntrade agreements.\n  Advisory committee reports are required to be submitted not more than \n30 days after the President notifies Congress of his intention to enter \ninto a trade agreement.\n  I know going through this amount of detail sounds arcane. But I just \nwant to in a sense ridicule the arguments that are being used that \nsomehow we are ceding all power to the President. Is it the U.S. Senate \nwhich is important in this, or is it jobs for workers in West Virginia \nand across the country which are important in this? What comes first \nhere?\n  Further, the Senate Finance Committee fast-track bill requires the \nUSTR to consult regularly, promptly, and closely with congressional \nadvisors for trade policies and negotiations, and with the Senate \nFinance and House Ways and Means Committee whole membership, and to \nkeep both the advisors and the committees fully informed every step of \nthe way through the negotiations process.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky is over there doing negotiating, which is \nreally done in secrecy--most of it.\n  No. 9. We have to be consulted on the progress of the negotiations of \nany trade agreement eligible for fast track so the Congress can \nevaluate the negotiations at each stage virtually at each hour.\n  I do not know what more Members might require in the form of \nconsultation.\n  Because negotiations traditionally become most intense at the \nconclusion of the negotiation process, the Senate Finance Committee \nfurther expects that the USTR will enter into a formal agreement in the \nform of procedures similar to those agreed by the executive branch in \n1975 that will ensure that congressional advice and committee advice \nwill be able to be fully taken into account as in the past.\n  Again, this next provision must be the tenth or eleventh requirement \nfor consultation----\n  As a condition of fast track authority, the U.S. Trade Representative \nwill commit to a set of procedures that afford Members and cleared \nstaff--not just Members but cleared staff--with necessary documents, \nclassified, or unclassified. They will have access to things such as \ncables, statements of executive branch position, and formal submission \nfrom other countries. The USTR staff will work with the Senate Finance \nCommittee to set up a system of briefings for Members during these \nnegotiations, and appropriate staff to be included in the final rounds \nof the trade negotiation agreement.\n  And the President is required to notify Congress before initialing a \ntrade agreement which might even be eligible for fast-track authority. \nHe can't even put his initials on it before he consults with Congress. \nOnce the agreement is initialed by the President, the President then \nhas 60 days to provide the Congress with any and all changes required \nto U.S. law to implement the agreement.\n  Well, I have another two pages on that, all of them, Mr. President, \nsimply showing that the Senate has adequate consultation--the question \nis how much negotiating room the President has with all these \nconsultation requirements. No problem with the Senate.\n  Now, some people make this argument. Some argue fast-track authority \nis not needed to move trade agreements. It is absolutely true that \nthere have been hundreds of trade-related agreements and declarations \nwhich the U.S. Trade Office has concluded during this administration. \nFrom January 1993 to just last month that has been the case.\n\n[[Page S12238]]\n\n  But, let me give my colleagues some examples of these many trade \ndeals that the opponents of this bill point to to suggest that trade \nagreements continue to be made and that fast-track authority is not \nreally necessary; in other words, you don't have fast track authority \nto have trade agreements. Well, a lot of these agreements which have \nbeen agreed to and negotiated are very peripheral in nature. One, a \nbilateral investment treaty with Albania. Great. And then an agreement \nregarding processed chicken quotas with Canada. A memorandum of \nunderstanding on trade in bananas with Costa Rica. Wonderful. A trade \nand intellectual property rights agreement with Estonia. Historic. An \nagreement on a temporary waiver of Hungary's WTO export subsidy \nschedule. Wow. Harmonized chemical tariffs with Japan. All right, \nthat's good. An agreement on trade in textiles and textile products \nwith Lesotho. Wonderful. And it goes on and on and on.\n  I hope that my colleagues will agree that as important as having \nbilateral agreements with any given country may be--and some of the \nexamples I listed have, in fact, real economic impact; they have real \nimpact on important industries in my State and other States--not many \nof these agreements are major trade deals. That is my point. In fact, \nvery few are major trade agreements in the sense they are not opening \nup new markets.\n  Here rests my argument. What we are talking about is opening up new \nmarkets. What the opponents are talking about is totally removed and \noff base.\n  I do not mean to say that negotiating with individual countries and \nestablishing bilateral agreements isn't a very important part of \nimproving the trade environment. These individual product or industry-\nspecific agreements with different countries do help improve U.S. \ntrade. I have no doubt about that at all. But they do not make \nsignificant expansions in our export markets that America and West \nVirginia need desperately in order to improve.\n  Ensuring that U.S. goods and services can be available on a level \nplaying field to the 96 percent of consumers in this world who are not \nAmericans happens to be very important. Trade agreements make sure that \nwe have access to new markets under reasonable conditions. In our \nincreasingly global world, that means we have to have multilateral \nagreements like GATT and the Uruguay round, and free trade agreements \nwith areas like Latin America and Asia are needed. Why? Because they \nare growing enormously, and their middle class is growing and their \nability to purchase goods is growing.\n  An up-or-down vote on a multilateral trade agreement makes sense to \nme because it how we expand our markets. As the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Charlene Barshefsky, told the Finance Committee, in the \ntwo fastest growing regions of the world, Latin America and Asia, \ngovernments are seeking preferential trade agreements. ``They are \nforming relationships around us, rather than with us, and they are \ncreating new exclusive trade alliances to the detriment of U.S. \ninterests.''\n  Then Ambassador Barshefsky goes on to say, ``In Latin America and \nAsia alone over 20 such agreements have been negotiated since 1992, all \nof them without us.''\n  Well, I can't imagine that doesn't bother the opponents of fast \ntrack. I care about the effect of trade on jobs in my State. And there \nis plenty of protection for the Senate and the Congress in this fast-\ntrack authority. You cannot negotiate a trade deal with 100 Members of \nthe Senate and a foreign country or set of countries. It cannot be \ndone. Fast track makes sense.\n  Can you imagine people coming in and saying, well, we have to.\n  What are other countries doing on trade agreements while the U.S. \ndebates fast track? Where is the United States at a disadvantage if we \ndon't pass fast track, as they may not in the House? Again, primarily \ndue mostly to my own party.\n  I have talked about the fact that major markets are negotiating trade \nagreements and the United States is not in the picture. Let's just look \nat the major world markets:\n  No. 1, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay have formed a common \nmarket called MERCOSUR. MERCOSUR has a GDP of about a $1 trillion and \nincludes a population of 200 million people. It wants to expand its \nmarket to the rest of South America. The sheer numbers of people and \ndollars in this market makes it the largest economy in Latin America. \nMERCOSUR has agreements with Chile and Bolivia, and is talking with \nColombia and Venezuela, in addition to Caribbean nations. The EU and \nMERCOSUR plan to complete a reciprocal agreement by 1999. We are on the \noutside of all that.\n  No. 2, Latin American nations are meeting with members of the Central \nAmerican Common Market [CARICOM] to discuss free trade negotiations.\n  No. 3, Chile, with one of South America's leading economies has \nalready signed agreements with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, \nGranada, Venezuela, and MERCOSUR countries. That means Chile has a \npreferential trading relationship with every major trading country in \nour hemisphere except the United States. How do the opponents of fast \ntrack feel about that?\n  There are seven members of the South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation [SARC]--Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and \nMaldives--they have set 2001 as the date they would like to create a \nfree-trade area. Right now, SARC is only 1 percent of world trade, but \nit has 20 percent of the world's population which means this is another \nimportant market to the United States in the future.\n  I talked about Latin America earlier and want to underscore why that \nmarket is so important to our trading future. Projections are that \nLatin America will exceed Western Europe and Japan combined as an \nexport market for the United States in the next decade--and that's \nunder current conditions where tariff barriers average three to four \ntimes the average United States tariff. Put simply, Latin America is \none of the largest emerging markets, of the 30 million people who join \nthe middle class annually, three-fourths of those 309 million people \nare currently in emerging markets and low- and middle-income markets.\n  I am almost at an end. The Asian Pacific Rim is our second fastest \ngrowing export market. Meanwhile, our industrial competitors continue \nto make agreements that put U.S. goods at a disadvantage. Canada has a \nnew trade agreement with Chile. The EU is in a position to take better \nadvantage of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe. \nThe EU is also working on getting a free-trade agreement with MERCOSUR.\n  China is zeroing in on Latin America and Japan is working on its ties \nto Asia and Latin America through closer commercial ties and a greater \ncommercial presence.\n  Mr. President, I simply make these remarks because I think it will be \nsuch high and deep folly if the House declines to vote on--or if \nvoting, votes down--fast-track authority. I think some of the arguments \nmade in this body have made it easier for Members of the House to say, \n``Look what so-and-so said in the U.S. Senate.''\n  It is a question: Do we want to expand trade? Or do we want to just \nkeep all inside of ourselves? This has been an age-old problem with the \nUnited States. We cycle back and forth from one view to another. This \nis the time to cycle for an expansionist trade point of view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had the floor, as I understand it, \nfollowing the conclusion of Senator Rockefeller's remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is correct. Under \nthe previous order, the Senator from California is to be recognized.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might I ask unanimous consent--I have \nbeen waiting here for some time to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Following my remarks?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, at the present time. I have been here on the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have been waiting for at least 2 hours, on and off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire of the Senator from California how long \nshe will be speaking?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would say about 15 minutes, I say to my friend.\n\n[[Page S12239]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then I ask unanimous consent that I might be recognized \nto speak up to 5 minutes at the conclusion of her remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, I may finish sooner \nthan that, and I will endeavor to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12236-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12239-S12240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LOOKING AHEAD\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller, made a very strong plea for giving the President \nfast track. I find it interesting that those who support fast track say \nthose who do not, in this case, oppose trade. I think the truth is \nthere are those who support fast track on any given occasion, and there \nare some who oppose it on every given occasion. I find myself in the \nmiddle of the road here, where I have given fast-track authority to \nPresidents when I felt it was in the best interests of our country, of \nour working people, and of our environment. That is usually when trade \nis being is being negotiated with countries that have decent labor \nstandards, decent prevailing wages, and decent environmental standards.\n  So on that topic, I think it is simplistic to say that either you are \nfor trade or against it. I think we are all for trade. I think the \nquestion is, is it fair to America? Will it result in good-paying jobs \nor will it put the squeeze on jobs? And should we give up our authority \nhere in the Senate and the House, should we give that up regardless of \nwhether it is a President of my own party or another party? Or should \nwe hold on to that authority so we can, in fact, stand up for American \nvalues and American workers and American interests?\n  As we reach the end of this session of Congress, I would like to \ncomment on a couple of the issues that we have taken up in the Senate \nand look ahead for some issues I hope we will take up when we return. \nAs one of the two Senators from the largest State in the Union, every \nsingle thing that we do here and every single thing we fail to do here \nhas a major impact on my State. It has 33 million people, more seniors \nthan any other State, more young people than any other State, more \nworkers than any other State, more women than any other State, more \ninfants than any other State. So whatever issue we turn to here impacts \nmy people enormously.\n\n  I share pride in knowing that I was able to work with a majority of \nmy colleagues to bring a balanced budget, but one with a heart, to the \nU.S. Senate and to the President's desk for signature. The march toward \nfiscal responsibility in this country was actually started when \nPresident Clinton took the oath of office. I remember that day because \nwe were filled with promise and hope that we could finally tackle some \nof our problems. And we did.\n  I might say it was a tough year for Democrats, because we didn't get \nany bipartisan help in that budget. But that budget in 1993 was the \nbudget that led us to fiscal responsibility. It took us down that \nfiscally responsible track. I remember, because I am on the Budget \nCommittee, hearing the comments of my Republican friends at that time \nthat this budget was a disaster, that President Clinton's policy would \nlead to unemployment, recession, depression--everything bad that you \ncould think of. We persevered and we believed in what we were doing, \nand I am happy to say that this year we finished the job with our \nRepublican friends. Gone are the days of Government shutdowns, because \nthe American people spoke out in that last shutdown and said: You were \nsent here to do your job. We want fiscal responsibility but we are not \ngoing to have our budget balance on the backs of our grandmothers and \ngrandfathers, our children, the most vulnerable people. We are not \ngoing to balance the budget while hurting education and the \nenvironment. So the budget agreement took all that into consideration. \nI think we all have a lot to be proud of.\n  As we moved forward on the fiscal responsibility front, unfortunately \nI saw us move backward in a number of areas. I want to touch on those.\n  In 1973, Roe versus Wade was decided. It is the law of the land. Yet \nthis Congress is constantly trying to roll the clock back to the days \nwhen women were in deep trouble in this country because abortion was \nillegal. We know that there is not the will to have a vote to outlaw \nabortion because the votes are not there, and the American people would \nbe stunned if a woman's right to choose was completely denied. So what \nthe opponents of a woman's right to choose have done is to chip away at \nthat right. And there are many women in this Nation who have their \nchoice imperiled. Who are these women? Women in the military, women in \nthe Federal work force, poor women in America--all women in America, \nbecause fewer and fewer hospitals are teaching doctors how to perform \nsafe, legal abortion.\n  I don't know why we have to keep turning back the clock to the days \nwhen women were in trouble in this country. Why don't we move on? I \nhave a bill that would codify Roe versus Wade. I am looking forward to \ntalking more about that next year. It seems like there is a group that \nwants to reopen that battle all the time. They want to reopen the \nbattle over Medicare. They want to fight us on issues that already were \nfought in the 1950's. That's when Dwight David Eisenhower said the \nNational Government ought to have a role in education. In the 1960's, \nthat's when President Johnson said Medicare is important. In the \n1970's, that's when President Nixon said we need an Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  I think America does better when we move forward. So I am hoping when \nwe get back here we will complete some unfinished business. First of \nall, we should fill up all the judgeships that are languishing. Justice \ndelayed is justice denied. We have very fine people waiting to be \nconfirmed by this U.S. Senate. I am very pleased that we did pass a \nnumber through, but there are a number left to go. I am very pleased \nSenator Lott has worked with Senator Daschle and we will have a vote on \nMargaret Morrow. But we need to do it. We must also confirm the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights. We cannot allow this important position to remain unfilled \nwhile such a superb nominee is ready, willing, and able to assume to \nthe job.\n  We also need the IRS reform that Senator Bob Kerrey spoke about so \neloquently. And we need passage of campaign finance reform, the McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n\n  Let's place some national standards on our HMO's and ensure that all \nAmericans enrolled in managed care plans receive quality treatment and \nare always treated fairly by insurance companies.\n  We need to pass the transportation bill, not just for 6 months, but \nfor 6 years. Our people need highways built. They need transportation \nsystems that work. We owe it to them.\n  We must make stopping gun violence a national priority. Junk guns \nhave no place on our streets. And we must ensure that all handguns in \nAmerica are sold with a safety lock. Taking this step would save \nhundreds of lives every year.\n  Let's make a national priority of health research. That is what the \npeople want. They want a cure for Alzheimer's, AIDS, breast cancer, \nprostate cancer, scleroderma, ovarian cancer--these are the things they \nso worry about with their families today. Let's make a priority of \nhealth research.\n  He is our leader on doubling the National Institutes of Health. He \nhas teamed up with Senator Connie Mack on this. It is time that we do \nthis. The American people need it.\n  We need some minimum standards for day care. Senator Durbin was on \nthe floor today eloquently speaking about the needs of those infants \nand those toddlers and how the brain develops. By age 3, 90 percent of \nthe brain is developed. Yet, we have no national standards for child \ncare in this Nation.\n  So I think it is time that we looked at certain issues. We say \nchildren are our priority. Let's pass the Children's Environmental \nProtection Act and protect them from pollution. We have seen a 30-\npercent increase in brain tumors among our young children in the last \n10 years.\n  We need national standards for education. We had a good compromise in \nthe U.S. Senate, and the House would not accept it. What are we afraid \nof? Why wouldn't we want our parents to have a chance to see whether \ntheir children are reading at the proper\n\n[[Page S12240]]\n\nlevel, doing math at the proper level? If we really care about our \nchildren, let's put some responsibility on the teachers, and this is \none way I think we ought to do it.\n  Superfund reform. We have toxic waste dumps all over this country. We \nneed to clean them up. The law needs to be refined. Too much money goes \nto attorneys and not enough to clean up the mess. The polluter has to \npay. We can't allow the taxpayers to pick up the tab. We need to move \nforward.\n  In closing, I want to say this. We are going to be celebrating \nVeterans Day on November 11. It is a special, special day. It also \nhappens to be my birthday, and I am very proud to share it with the \nveterans.\n  Year in and year out, we hear about how many of the homeless in our \nstreets are veterans. Mr. President, how can we, as the United States \nof America, celebrate Veterans Day knowing that so many of our vets \nhave been turned aside?\n  I hope we will move on that and on the gulf war syndrome. We cannot \nturn our back on veterans who served our Nation in wartime and came \nback sick.\n  We did it in Vietnam when our veterans were exposed to agent orange. \nWe did it again with gulf war syndrome. We ought to hold our heads up \nas a nation this Veterans Day.\n  I really look forward to coming back here and righting some of these \nwrongs. Senator Rockefeller has a great bill. It says if you are a gulf \nwar veteran and suffer from a disease, you don't have to prove anything \nexcept you were in that war theater and you are now disabled in order \nto qualify for disability benefits. It seems to me if we stand for \nanything around here, it ought to be standing by our veterans when they \nare sick and when they are homeless.\n  So I leave here with a good feeling about a lot of what we did and a \nlittle bit of regret about some other things I didn't agree with. But I \nam excited as I think about coming back here, because I think you heard \nme describe that there are a number of issues we ought to address that \nwill make life better for all of our people in the context of a \nbalanced budget that has a heart.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly two matters: First, the pending fast-track issue and, second, \nthe pendency of our judicial confirmations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12239-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FAST TRACK\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will begin on the question of fast \ntrack with a statement made by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia saying that it would be disingenuous to believe that trade \nagreements would not be rewritten in the U.S. Senate. I say to my \ncolleagues that I consider it unlikely that trade agreements would be \nrewritten in this body, considering how hard it is to get 51 votes \nagainst a committee report or against an administration position or \nthat we might have the structure on amendments made so that it would \nrequire passage of a bill then subject to veto by the President and \nthen subject to a two-thirds override. But if, in fact, trade \nagreements would be rewritten on the floor of the U.S. Senate or on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives, then it might be something which \nis desirable.\n\n  I oppose fast track, although I am not opposed to free-trade \nagreements, because I do favor such agreements and supported NAFTA, the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement, and GATT, notwithstanding very \nconsiderable constituent opposition in my own State. Being elected in \nPennsylvania, with 12 million constituents, it is my view that I ought \nto have standing as a Senator to offer amendments, and because we have \nhad a certain amount of wisdom coming from Members of Congress on \nissues of trade, which are matters of very, very considerable \nimportance.\n  I will analogize the activity of the Senate regarding trade \nagreements to what we do on treaties in general, where a two-thirds \nvote is required. If amendments could be offered to trade agreements, \nit could be of some substantial value to the President, and the \nexecutive branch in negotiating agreements with foreign powers saying, \n``Well, we understand your position, but you have to understand ours, \nand there are certain political realities in the U.S. Congress.''\n  We have a variety of protocols where you have executive agreements \nwhich look very much like treaties which are not subject to \nratification by the Senate. A very complicated agreement was entered \ninto with North Korea which involved very substantial issues on nuclear \npower. That was the subject of a letter from the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, the chairman of the Interior Committee and \nmyself, in my capacity last year as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, asking for Senate action. So there are precedents for having \nthe Senate exercise its judgment and I think we have some substantial \njudgment in the field.\n  I recall very well in 1984, when the International Trade Commission \ncame down with a decision which was in favor of the American steel \nindustry. At that time the issue arose as to whether President Reagan \nwould overrule the decision of the International Trade Commission. \nSenator Heinz, my late departed colleague, a great Senator, and I went \nto talk to then Secretary of Commerce Mack Baldrige who thought that we \nwere right, the American steel industry ought to have that favorable \ndecision from the International Trade Commission. Bill Brock, the trade \nrepresentative, agreed. We then talked to Secretary of State George \nShultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger who disagreed.\n  The President overruled the International Trade Commission and made \nthe decision which was based really on foreign policy and defense \npolicy. The American steel industry paid a very high price which should \nhave been paid out of the general revenues. Western Pennsylvania \nespecially, but eastern Pennsylvania, too, with Bethlehem Steel, \nsuffered very substantially.\n  Right now, my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, and I are \nworking very hard on trying to get Cigna fair access to the Japanese \nmarkets. Notwithstanding certain commitments by the executive branch \nand the trade representatives, we have not been able to accomplish \nthat.\n  So it seems to me that there is a very good reason on principle why \nmatters which come to the Congress on trade issues ought to be subject \nto amendment. We have some understanding of the trade issues, and we \nhave some understanding of our States' stakes. I think it would be \nentirely appropriate for us to be able to offer those amendments and \nnot to have to simply vote yes or no, take it all or leave it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12240-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MY GRANDDAUGHTER SILVI\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Judge Massiah-Jackson has a very distinguished record on the \nState Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County. Although some \nquestions have arisen, a couple of intemperate remarks, I think, do not \ndisqualify her. If intemperate remarks were disqualifiers, there \nwouldn't be any Federal judges, there wouldn't be any Senators or \nanybody in any other positions. Questions have arisen about her \nsentencing. Out of 4,000 cases, 95 appeals were taken and reversals in \nonly 14 cases.

Half hour; 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And then we will vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It will be a recorded vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No, it will not be. It depends on the body, but it is \nintended to be a voice vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thirty minutes of debate, a voice vote and then there \nwill be no pending business after that? What will the pending business \nbe after that voice vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the fast-track bill. \nMy understanding of the request of the Senator from Vermont was 30 \nminutes equally divided, plus an additional 5 minutes for the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since everybody else seems to be getting \nin line, I wonder if I can amend that to ask unanimous consent that \nafter the disposition of this bill, after the voice vote, which I \nunderstand is included in your disposition, after the disposition of \nthis bill, that the Senator from Iowa be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was wondering if we could ask for 40 \nminutes. I have a couple of Senators on our side who would like time, \nwho have been very active on this issue. Perhaps we could have a few \nmore minutes so that we could accommodate their requests. Would that be \nagreeable?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Does that include the Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. I have an objection to the request from the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could we have 40 minutes then on the \nbill?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

I ask unanimous consent that after disposition of this \nbill, the Senator from Iowa be recognized to speak on the fast-track \nbill. That is all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (S. 830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nregulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological products, and for \nother purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     830), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 9, 1997.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, before us is the conference report on S. \n830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. This is really \nan excellent moment to bring this up and consider what has been \naccomplished.\n  This bill represents the first major reform of the Food and Drug \nAdministration in some 30 years. For our committee, it is the second \nmajor reform\n\n[[Page S12242]]\n\nthat we have accomplished this session, the first one being special \neducation, which was the first major reform for that program in some 20 \nyears.\n  I am very pleased to be able to say to my colleagues that the FDA \nmeasure embodies the objectives we originally sought to accomplish.\n  This legislation achieves two important goals.\n  First, it helps the FDA to get medicine and medical devices to \npatients and doctors sooner and safer.\n  And, second, it will extend and improve the Prescription Drug User \nFee Act, commonly known as PDUFA.\n  I am pleased to report that the conference report has the unanimous \nsupport of the conferees. It deserves the unanimous support of this \nbody as well.\n  The conference report is the culmination of 3 years of hard work by \ndozens of Senators. It offers the most substantial reform of the Food, \nDrug and Cosmetic Act in decades and will have a positive impact on the \nlives of millions of Americans for decades to come.\n  Think how the world of medicine has changed over the past two or \nthree decades. The law that governs much of that world, and nearly $1 \nof every $3 spent by consumers, must change and adapt as well.\n  The measure makes scores of changes in the law that ensures the \nsafety of the food we eat, of the drugs we use to fight disease, and \nthe medical devices we use to improve the health of Americans. It will \nhelp patients gain access to new therapies sooner without weakening \neither safety requirements or the authority of the FDA. It gives the \nagency needed tools and resources to manage an increasing workload more \nefficiently. In addition, it contributes to our maintaining America's \ntechnological leadership in producing pharmaceuticals and medical \ndevices.\n  Achieving these reforms is a win-win-win situation for consumers, for \nthe FDA, and for manufacturers. It is a win for patients and consumers, \nwho will gain access to previously unavailable information and obtain \nbetter therapy sooner. It is a win for the FDA, which will receive new, \nsorely needed resources and streamlining and modernization of \nbureaucratic processes that have not changed in decades. And it is a \nwin for the manufacturers, who will have a certainty that the review \nand approval processes applied to their innovative products will be \napplied in a collaborative and consistent manner.\n  About 10 months ago, Mr. President, we embarked anew on an effort \nthat some characterized as foolish--an effort to modernize the \nregulatory processes of the FDA. Many thought it could not be done. \nSome urged we merely extend PDUFA or we tackle only a few issues \nrelated to drug regulation and leave the comprehensive modernization to \nanother day.\n  I am glad we did not choose either of these paths. Instead, we chose \nto forge a bill with broad, bipartisan support, one that took a broad \nview of the changes needed at the FDA.\n  In that regard, I particularly want to acknowledge the Democratic \nmembers of the Labor Committee, and especially Senators Dodd, Mikulski, \nWellstone, and Murray. They have made countless contributions to this \nlegislation, large and small. Their tireless support has been critical \nin our success.\n  This measure is the result of the process to consult with individuals \nof all points of view and to benefit from the expertise needed to craft \nlegislation on this complex issue. Patients, physicians, consumer \ngroups, the FDA, and the manufacturers of medical devices and \npharmaceuticals all contributed to this effort through their \nparticipation in hearings and in discussions with the staffs.\n\n  This effort was parallel to that of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, which, under the outstanding leadership of Chairman \nBliley, also produced a strong bipartisan bill with overwhelming \nsupport. The collaboration and consensus building has continued right \nup to the present, and the quality of this conference report we are \nconsidering today reflects that process.\n  Mr. President, we would not be here today if it were not for the \neffort of my predecessor as the chair of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, Senator Kassebaum. Her efforts to advance reform in the last \nCongress paved the way for our work here today. We owe her an enormous \ndebt.\n  This year, there have been many Members in both Chambers who have \ncontributed to this effort. Foremost among them has been Senator Coats. \nThe list of provisions of this bill that bear his imprint is far too \nlong to recite. But, as an example, the third-party review provision \nhas been developed under his leadership, and he has played an important \nrole in advancing FDA modernization throughout this process.\n  Senator Gregg is to be commended for his proposals to streamline the \nFDA process for consideration of health claims based on Federal \nresearch and his amendments to establish uniformity for the over-the-\ncounter, OTC, drugs and cosmetics. Senator McConnell also suggested \nimprovements in the regulation of food.\n  I am especially grateful to Dr. Frist. He and Senator Mack led the \nway to compromise on the issue of the dissemination of medical \ninformation to health professionals, an important advance forward.\n  Senator DeWine, joined by Senator Dodd, offered an important \namendment to establish incentives for the conduct of research into \npediatric uses for existing and new drugs, a needed change. The bill \nwas improved by Senator Hutchinson's amendment to establish a rational \nframework for pharmacy compounding, which respects the State regulation \nof pharmacy while allowing an appropriate role for the FDA. And Senator \nHarkin has made many contributions to this legislation.\n  Finally, the ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, has played an \nimportant role in bringing this conference report to the floor in a \nmanner that draws support from all quarters.\n  In the House, Chairman Bliley and Congressmen Dingell, Burr, Burton, \nGreenwood and Whitfield have contributed immense energy and leadership \nin reaching this agreement.\n  Mr. President, it has been a remarkable year, crowned by a \nremarkable, bipartisan achievement. And I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have waited a very considerable time \nfor this moment this afternoon in the U.S. Senate as well as action in \nthe House of Representatives and, hopefully, the President's signature \nin the next few days on a matter of very significant importance to the \nissues of quality health for the American people.\n  It has been a very considerable process that we have followed over a \nnumber of years to get to this point.\n  I congratulate the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, for \nhis leadership all along this long and difficult passage, because I \nthink without his perseverance, without his knowledge and awareness and \nhis strong commitment on this issue, we would not have this important \nlegislation available for the Senate and for the American people.\n  Mr. President, one could wonder why it has taken so much time. But we \nhave a natural tension between bringing new innovation and creativity \nand breakthroughs in the areas of pharmaceutical drugs and medical \ndevices to the market and, on the other hand, protecting the public by \napproving only safe and efficacious products. We have well-intentioned, \nbrilliant medical researchers in our country who are absolutely \nconvinced that their particular product can provide life-saving \nopportunities for our fellow citizens, members of our families, who are \nsuffering extraordinary illness. And we have brilliant researchers at \nFDA that examine scientific information and clinical studies and \nbelieve that a very significant potential danger is out there for those \nwho might use a particular pharmaceutical or medical device. Achieving \na balance between these two concerns is a difficult task.\n  The one who has really balanced these conflicting views has been our \nchairman, Senator Jeffords, working diligently with other members of \nthe committee, Democrats as well as Republicans, over a long period of \ntime.\n  I am convinced that as a result of this legislation the health of the \nAmerican people will be enhanced through faster availability to \npharmaceutical drugs and medical devices while maintaining important \nprotections for the\n\n[[Page S12243]]\n\nAmerican people. I join in supporting this landmark FDA conference \nreport.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. I think in many \nrespects this will be one of the most important pieces of legislation \nof this year, and possibly of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Chairman Bliley, John Dingell, as \nwell as Chairman Bilirakis, Sherrod Brown and other members of the \nHouse committee for their bipartisan work. We had a good conference \nwhere Members were knowledgeable and very committed in terms of finding \ncommon ground. I believe as a result of this conference we have an even \nstronger bill than was passed earlier.\n  In addition, I commend the Patients' Coalition and Public Citizen, \nwho worked to assure that the needs of patients were fully and fairly \nconsidered in the legislation. I appreciate the assistance of the \nMassachusetts biotechnology and medical device industries, who provided \nme with valuable insight into these complex issues and their concerns.\n  I also commend Secretary Shalala, the dedicated men and women at the \nFDA, and the Clinton administration for their skillful and impressive \nrole in developing so many aspects of these needed reforms.\n  The most important part of the bill is the extension of the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA] which was originally enacted in \n1992. PDUFA is one of the most important FDA reform measures ever \nenacted. It provides funds for FDA to hire hundreds of new reviewers \nwho, in turn, are able to expedite the review and approval of \npharmaceutical products. A critical element of PDUFA's success was the \nestablishment of measurable performance targets, which was negotiated \nbetween the industry and the FDA.\n  Under the PDUFA provisions in this bill, in addition to moving \nproducts through the regulatory process more quickly, the FDA and \nindustry will also establish a cooperative working relationship and \nshorten drug and device development times, which now represent the most \nsignificant delay in bringing new products to market.\n  In addition, the bill includes a number of other constructive \nprovisions to enhance cooperation between industry and the FDA to \nimprove regulatory procedures.\n  I am particularly gratified that the bill includes broader use of \nfast-track drug approval. The streamlined accessibility procedure now \navailable primarily to cancer or AIDS will be available for drug \ntreatments for patients with all life-threatening diseases.\n  The bill provides for expanded access to drugs still under \ninvestigation for patients who have no other alternatives. The \ncompromise combines protections for patients with expanded access to \nnew investigational therapies, without exposing patients to \nunreasonable risks.\n  The bill includes a new program to provide access for patients to \ninformation about clinical trials for serious or life-threatening \ndiseases.\n  It provides incentives for research on pediatric applications of \napproved drugs and for development of new antibiotics to deal with \nemerging, drug-resistant strains of disease.\n  It requires companies to give patients advance notification of \ndiscontinuance of important products. And in that connection, I am \ndisappointed that we were not able to address the issue of assuring \nthat asthma patients and others will not be put at risk by any abrupt \ndiscontinuance of inhalers containing CFCs. I have been informed by FDA \nthat no notice of proposed rulemaking will be issued before this \nsummer, which will give Congress plenty of time to return to this \nquestion, if necessary.\n  Mr. President, the current legislation is an improvement over the \nbill approved by the Labor Committee earlier this year--that bill \nincluded a number of provisions that as originally proposed could have \njeopardized public health.\n\n  The original bill provided a pilot program for third-party review \nunder which private third parties, certified by the Food and Drug \nAdministration but selected and paid by the manufacturer, would have \nreviewed the safety and effectiveness of medical devices to determine \nwhether or not they could be sold.\n  The original proposal would have included many of the most complex \nand risky devices, such as digital mammography machines, and a host of \nother devices to detect and treat cancer and other dread diseases.\n  Under the final bill, these devices may not be included in the pilot \nprogram.\n  The original bill required the Food and Drug Administration to \napprove devices for marketing even if the Food and Drug Administration \nknew defects in the manufacturing process would make the devices unsafe \nor ineffective. The final legislation eliminates this requirement.\n  The original bill would have prevented the Food and Drug \nAdministration from looking behind the label proposed by a device \nmanufacturer seeking approval of a product, even if the product was \nfalse or misleading. The final legislation assures that the Food and \nDrug Administration will be able to require full and complete \ninformation for physicians and consumers on any potential use of the \ndevice, not just the one claimed on the label submitted with the \napplication for approval.\n  And the final legislation preserves the State authority to regulate \ncosmetics, an area of significant potential hazard to consumers.\n  The legislation includes an important compromise on information on \noff-label use of drugs. This compromise will allow companies to \ncirculate reputable journal articles about off-label use of drugs but \nwill ultimately enhance the public health and safety because the FDA \nwill be given the opportunity to review, comment on, and approve \narticles which the companies will circulate. The compromise also \nrequires companies to undertake studies on the safety of their drugs \nfor the specific off-label use and submit applications to the FDA for \napproval of their drugs for these uses within 3 years. Currently, too \nmany off-label uses of drugs have never been reviewed for safety and \neffectiveness.\n  The bill assures the Food and Drug Administration will continue to \nconduct appropriate environmental impact statements, rather than be \nexempted from the standards that apply to every other governmental \nagency.\n  The compromise included in the bill assures the Nutrition Labeling \nAct is not undercut or weakened, and any health claims by food \nmanufacturers have to be substantiated.\n  The legislation maintains existing standards for approval of \nsupplemental use of drugs while streamlining the process by which they \ncan be approved.\n  In summary, the current legislation is a vast improvement over the \nbill approved by our committee earlier this year. As a result of \nextensive discussion since then, including the 3 weeks of debate in the \nfull Senate and our subsequent negotiations with the House, I believe \nevery one of these problem issues has been resolved satisfactorily.\n  The bill we enact will get safe and effective products to market \nwhile assuring the Food and Drug Administration will have the tools it \nneeds for public health. It is a landmark achievement. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my understanding is when this business is \ncompleted that Senator Harkin has unanimous consent for 20 minutes, and \nI ask unanimous consent, following Senator Harkin, I be permitted to \nspeak in morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, I don't intend to object, \nbut I know there is an effort underway to try and bring the omnibus \nappropriations bill forward and I know a lot of Members are waiting \naround so they can take that vote. In fact, I was discussing that.\n  This isn't my call, but I ask the Senator if he could withhold until \nwe can get some understanding of when that vote might be. It might be \nthat it won't come before the Senator's 20 minutes, but if we add time \nhere, 20 minutes there, and an additional 20 minutes, it could delay \npast the time when they now have commitments. I want to make sure we \ncheck that out.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I could allow my order to stand, I would be sensitive \nto\n\n[[Page S12244]]\n\nthe need for a vote, and if need be, I will respond.\n  Mr. COATS. I accept that, and withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 3 years of hard work, which was begun by \nSenator Nancy Kassebaum, have resulted in the passage of the conference \nreport to the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 in \nthe Senate today. This legislation represents the first major, \ncomprehensive reform effort since the initial amendments outlining \nregulation for drugs in 1962 and for medical devices in 1976. This \nmajor reform will help improve the FDA by strengthening its efficiency, \naccountability, and its ability to safeguard the public health.\n  There are several provisions contained in this bill that constitute \nsignificant reform and improvements to increase the efficiency of \nproduct review. For example, this legislation gives FDA authority to \nincrease its access to scientific and technical expertise outside the \nAgency by allowing interagency collaboration with Federal agencies such \nas the NIH and CDC, and with the National Academy of Sciences. Also, \nthe bill gives FDA the explicit authority to contract with outside \nreviewers and expand its current third party medical device review \npilot program.\n  To help alleviate the confusion and frustration that many applicants \nfeel when working with the FDA, the bill will require the FDA to codify \nevidence requirements for new drug and medical device application \nsubmissions and encourages improved communication between the agency \nand industry. And after 60 years, the FDA will be made more accountable \nby giving it a mission statement and requiring the FDA to develop a \nplan of action to meet its requirements under law. The bill will also \nreauthorize for 5 years the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, known as \nPDUFA, which has been tremendously successful in improving and speeding \nthe review of much needed pharmaceutical products.\n  Most importantly, the bill Congress sends to the President will help \npatients. Individuals with a serious life-threatening disease or \ncondition will have access to a new clinical trial database providing \ninformation on investigational therapies. Patients will benefit from \nthe expansion of the fast-track drug approval process for new drugs \nintended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions \nbuilt on the existing program for AIDS and cancer drugs. And, patients \nthat have no other alternative but to try an unapproved investigational \nproduct will have access to investigational therapies and medical \ndevices.\n  The bill also includes a provision that will allow reprints of \nscientifically, peer-reviewed medical journal articles and medical \ntextbooks about off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs and devices to be \nshared with physicians and other health care practitioners. This \nprovision will help get life-saving information to doctors, so they can \nbe better informed when making decisions about how to treat their \npatients.\n  As a physician, I have used off-label uses to treat my patients in \nthe past and understand its tremendous importance to the patient. Over \n90 percent of treatments for cancer patients are off-label and the \nAmerican Medical Association has estimated that between 40 percent and \n60 percent of all prescriptions are for off-label uses of prescription \ndrugs. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work on this \nprovision during the last few years by my friend, Senator Connie Mack \nand Mark Smith of his staff.\n  There are a number of people who worked hard to insure passage of \nthis reform effort. I would like to thank Senator Jeffords, the \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, for leading the \nbipartisan effort on FDA Reform in the Senate. I also acknowledge the \nleadership of Senator Coats, who has done significant work on \nprovisions affecting medical devices in the bill. I also thank Senators \nGregg, DeWine, Dodd, Milkulski, Kennedy and Harkin and their staffs for \ntheir hard work in conference. I would like to thank our House \ncolleagues and their staffs who worked with us in conference and I \nespecially recognize the able leadership of the chairman of the House \nCommerce Committee Representative Tom Bliley and the ranking member \nJohn Dingell. I would also like to acknowledge and thank Secretary \nDonna Shalala and the FDA for working with us to help modernize and \nimprove the FDA.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Jay Hawkins, Mark Powden, and \nSean Donahue of Senator Jeffords' staff, Vince Ventimiglia of Senator \nCoats' staff, and Kimberly Spaulding of Senator Gregg's staff who were \ncritical to the development of the bill. I thank them for their \ndedication and tireless effort on this important bill.\n  I especially want to thank the tireless work and outstanding \nleadership of Sue Ramthun, my staff director for health affairs, who \nhas been so instrumental in passage of this bill.\n  I believe we have made a step in the right direction that will \nimprove patient care and that this bill begins the debate on the long-\nterm investment necessary to move the agency forward in areas such as \nregulatory research, professional development, and collaborative \nefforts between Government and academia, and I hope to continue working \nwith my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to further improve the FDA in \nthe following years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am so happy this day has finally come, \nin which the U.S. Senate, and I believe the House, will pass a \nconference report to modernize the Food and Drug Administration and to \nbring it into a 21st century framework.\n  I want to thank Senator Jeffords for the patient leadership he has \nprovided in moving this bill, and a special thanks for the collegiality \nof his staff in working with mine. I also would like to acknowledge the \nspecial role that Senator Coats has played. I have enjoyed working with \nhim these last 3 years. We will miss him here as he undertakes next \nyear a new life in encouraging faith-based community groups to become \nmore involved. I think in this bipartisan collegial exchange we have \ncome up with an outstanding bill that is going to save lives, save jobs \nin the United States of America, give us a product to export around the \nworld that is translingual, transcultural, but certainly helps our \npeople and at the same time puts patients first.\n  I want to particularly thank my own staff, Lynne Lawrence, for the \nactive work she has done, and Roberta Haeberle and Kerry O'Toole in the \nexcellent backup they have provided.\n  Why do I like this bill? First of all, we reauthorize the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act. What this will mean is we will be able \nto have 600 reviewers who will be able to work at the Food and Drug \nAdministration making sure that we cut the review time, streamline the \nprocess, be able to move drugs, biologics and devices for clinical \npractice in a more expedited fashion, and at the same time be able to \nprotect safety and efficacy. We do protect safety and efficacy while we \nmove along at a quicker step with more people.\n  A reauthorization of PDUFA gives us the right people and now we have \nthe right legislative framework to do it. One of the important aspects \nof this legislation is the streamlining process, and yet at the same \ntime maintaining safety and efficacy upon the approval process so more \nand more clinical things will be able to go into clinical practice.\n  I am delighted that this day has finally arrived. It is a great day \nfor patients and physicians. They will get new medical products in a \nmore timely and efficient manner. It is a great day for American \nbusiness. They won't have to go through unnecessary regulatory hoops to \nget these new products on the market.\n  This legislation, carefully crafted between the House and Senate, \nrepresents a solid, bipartisan effort. We could not have reached this \npoint without the incredible dedication and persistence of the chairman \nof the Labor Committee, Mr. Jeffords. I thank him for his heartfelt \ndevotion to this bill, and for never giving up. I also thank his staff, \nJay Hawkins, Sean Donohue, and Mark Powden for all their hard work.\n  Let me also acknowledge the tremendous contributions of our ranking\n\n[[Page S12245]]\n\nmember, Mr. Kennedy. There is no doubt this is a better bill because of \nhis efforts. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of our \ncounterparts in the House, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Mr. \nBliley and the ranking member, Mr. Dingell. Many thanks also go to the \nfine staff of the Commerce Committee for their excellent work.\n  Mr. President, I have worked on FDA reform for a number of years. \nWhen I was a Member of the House of Representatives, we embarked, on a \nbipartisan basis, to ensure consumer protection and to prevent dumping \ndrugs that did not meet our standards on Third World countries.\n  Coming to the Senate, I joined with my colleague from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, in fashioning the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA]. PDUFA has enabled FDA to hire \nmore people to examine products that were being presented for \nevaluation and get them to patients more quickly.\n  The leadership of Kennedy-Hatch on PDUFA has not only stood the test \nof time, it has shown that we can expedite the drug approval process \nwhile maintaining safety and efficacy. I am so pleased that this \nsuccessful legislation will be reauthorized for 5 years.\n  But while PDUFA has made a huge difference, it became clear PDUFA was \nnot enough. More staff operating in an outdated regulatory framework, \nwithout a clear legislative framework, was deficient.\n  That is when we began to consult with experts in public health, \nparticularly those involved in drugs and biologics. While we were \nconsidering all this, the world of science was changing. We experienced \na revolution in biology. We went from a smokestack economy to a \ncyberspace economy. We went from basic discoveries in science from the \nfield of chemistry and physics to a whole new explosion in biology, in \ngenetics and biologic materials.\n  It became clear we needed an FDA with a new legislative framework and \na new culture. This is when we began to put together what we called the \nsensible center on FDA reform. We worked with Republicans and Democrats \nalike, because we certainly never want to play politics with the lives \nof the American people.\n  Senator Kassebaum chaired the committee during this initiative. We \ntook important steps forward. I say to Senator Jeffords, you assumed \nthat mantle, and you brought us to the point today where we will \nachieve final passage of FDA reform. I thank you for that.\n  What will this legislation do? Why is it so important? It streamlines \nand updates the regulatory process for new products. It reauthorizes \nthe highly successful Prescription Drug User Fee Act. And it creates an \nFDA that rewards significant science while protecting public health.\n  It will mean that new lifesaving drugs and devices will get into \nclinical practice more quickly. It will enable us to produce products \nthat we can sell around the world, and through this, save lives and \ngenerate jobs.\n  FDA is known the world over as the gold standard for product \napproval. We want to maintain that high standard. At the same time, we \nwant to make sure that FDA can enter the 21st century.\n  This legislation gets us there. It sets up a new legislative and \nregulatory framework that reflects the latest scientific advancements. \nThe framework continues FDA's strong mission to protect public health \nand safety. At the same time, it sets a new goal for FDA, enhancing \npublic health by not impeding innovation or product availability \nthrough unnecessary redtape that only delays approval.\n  There has been an urgency about reauthorizing PDUFA. Its authority \nexpires at the end of September. PDUFA has enabled FDA to hire 600 new \nreviewers and cut review times from 29 to 17 months over the last 5 \nyears. Acting now means that people who have been working on behalf of \nthe American people can continue to do their jobs. We won't risk losing \ntalented employees and slowing down the drug approval process.\n  Delay would have hurt dedicated employees, but more importantly, it \nwould have hurt patients. Patients benefit most from this legislation. \nSafe and effective new medicines will be getting to patients quicker.\n  We're not only extending PDUFA; we're improving it. Currently, PDUFA \nonly addresses the review phase of the approval process. Our \nlegislation expands PDUFA to streamline the early drug development \nphase as well.\n  Instead of a carload of paper--stacks and stacks of material--being \ndeposited at the FDA's front door, companies will be able to make \nelectronic submissions. This not only reduces paperwork, but actually \nprovides a more agile way for scientific reviewers to get through the \ndata.\n  Updating the approval process for biotech is another critical \ncomponent of this bill. Biotech is one of the fastest growing \nindustries in our country. There are 143 biotech companies like that in \nmy own State of Maryland. They are working on AIDS, Alzheimer's, breast \nand ovarian cancer, and other life-threatening infections such as \nwhooping cough.\n  The job of FDA is to make sure that safe and effective products get \nto patients. Our job as Members of Congress is to fund scientific \nresearch and to provide FDA the regulatory and legislative frameworks \nto evaluate new products and make them available to doctors and \npatients.\n  This is why I fought so hard for this. This is exactly why I fought \nfor this. My dear father died of Alzheimer's, and it did not matter \nthat I was a U.S. Senator. I watched my father die one brain cell at a \ntime, and it did not matter what my job was.\n  My father was a modest man. He did not want a fancy tombstone or a \nlot of other things, but I vowed I would do all I can for research in \nthis and to help other people along these lines.\n  Every one of us has faced some type of tragedy in our lives where we \nlooked to the American medical and pharmaceutical, biological, and \ndevice community to help us.\n  When my mother had one of her last terrible heart attacks that was \nleading rapidly to a stroke--there was a new drug that is so \nsophisticated that it must be administered very quickly. You need \ninformed consent because even though it is approved, it is so dramatic \nthat it thins the blood almost to the hemophilia level. I gave that \napproval because my mother was not conscious enough to do it.\n  Guess what? That new drug approved by FDA, developed in San \nFrancisco, got my mother through her medical crisis with the hands-on \ncare of the Sisters of Mercy in Baltimore at Mercy Hospital. Mother did \nnot have a stroke because we could avoid the clotting that would have \nprecipitated it.\n  Thanks to the grace of God and the ingenuity of American medicine, we \nhad my mother with us 100 more days in a way that she could function at \nhome, have conversations with us and her grandchildren.\n  Do you think I am not for FDA? You think I am not for safety? You \nthink I am not for efficacy? You bet I am. And this is what this is all \nabout. It is not a battle of wills. It is not a battle over this line \nitem or that line item. It is really a battle to make sure that the \nAmerican people have from their physicians and clinical practitioners \nthe best devices and products to be able to save lives. That's why I'm \nso pleased that we were able to achieve a bipartisan bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time. If I seem a little \nemotional about it, you bet I am. I love FDA. I am really proud they \nare in my State. I thank God for the ingenuity of the American medical \ncommunity. And that is why I am so pleased we will be voting on the \nconference report today.\n  All of us are happy that this bill will finally pass.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield Senator Coats 4 minutes. He is a \nman whose tenaciousness and ability have made this a better bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Vermont has said, this \nis the first reform in 30 years at FDA. Obviously, a lot has changed in \nthe industry. New drugs and new devices, new methods of bringing life-\nsaving and health-improving benefits to the American people, and the \npeople of the world. I think it is remarkable, particularly given the \nfact that it has been nearly 2\\1/2\\, 3 years now that we have been \nspecifically working on this legislation in the committee, through a\n\n[[Page S12246]]\n\nnumber of hearings, through a considerable, lengthy, and complex \ncommittee consideration, extensive floor debate. There were very \ndifficult procedural hurdles to overcome and a difficult conference. We \nnow arrive at this point with a bill that, very shortly, will be \npassed. This has only been done with a bipartisan effort.\n  I want to return the compliment to the Senator from Maryland. I thank \nher for that. I am not sure that everyone is going to miss me around \nthis place, given my role in this bill, in trying to bring it forward. \nBut I thank her for her kind words. Senators Dodd, Mikulski, Harkin, \nand Wellstone joined Republicans in the committee to produce a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, and they supported us on the floor. I \nthank Senator Jeffords and his leadership, and Senator Gregg, Senator \nFrist, Senator DeWine, and others on the Republican side, who \ncontributed to the effort in moving the bill forward.\n  I would be remiss not to acknowledge the extraordinary work of so \nmany staff people that helped to move this forward.\n  I thank my chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, and particularly Vince \nVentimiglia, someone whose tireless efforts and thorough knowledge of \nthe issues at hand, and at whose persistence we continued through all \nof the obstacles placed in the way of this legislation, and it was all \naccomplished in a manner of courtesy and respect, which is, \nunfortunately, all too rare around this place. He is an exceptional \nperson. I don't believe we would be here without his efforts--even \nthough he is not here right now; he is probably digging through the \nbill to make sure all the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted. He \nwas exceptional in this whole effort.\n  This bill provides help to the Food and Drug Administration, who did \nnot have the capacity nor, I believe, in the past, the managerial \nleadership that allowed FDA to keep pace with the marvelous \nbreakthroughs we have had in the pharmaceutical and medical device \narea, which brings life-saving benefits and health-improving benefits \nto people. Six-hundred additional people, paid for by the industry in a \ntax against them to reauthorize PDUFA, will help speed up the drug \napproval process.\n  Now, for the first time, we give assistance to FDA on medical devices \nbecause we have a procedure where outside parties can, with FDA \ncertification, approval and oversight, review medical device \napplications. This is going to provide for the medical device section \nwhat PDUFA provided for the drug section. This was a very critical part \nof the legislation, and I am pleased that it was retained in our \nefforts.\n  We are here and it is a victory for the American people. It took a \nlot of effort by a lot of people. It is a testament to the persistence \nof many, some of whom are speaking here on the floor today. I am proud \nto play a role in this effort because I believe we are addressing some \nfundamental concerns, going to the very health and safety and very \nlives of the American people and people throughout the world. Mr. \nPresident, it is with that, I yield whatever remaining time I have.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, but first I yield myself 15 seconds.\n  I want to give the assurance to my friend and colleague from Indiana, \nas one that didn't always see eye to eye with the good Senator on some \nof these issues, I pay tribute to him for the strength of his \ncommitment and the power of his logic and argument, and the passion \nwhich he has demonstrated out here.\n  I have enjoyed his friendship and have always valued the opportunity \nto exchange ideas with him.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. We have had some interesting \nexchanges of ideas.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and \nAccountability Act of 1997. This is an important bill with serious \nimplications for the protection of the health of the American people. \nAlthough I did not support this bill when it was first considered on \nthe floor of the Senate, I am pleased that significant changes have \nbeen made and that this final version of the legislation is worthy of \nsupport.\n  This FDA reform bill is the result of ongoing negotiations both prior \nto and subsequent to the Labor Committee's markup of the bill. Through \nthis process, a number of provisions that seriously threatened public \nhealth and safety were dropped or otherwise resolved. I am particularly \npleased that improvements made include important protections to the \nthird party review process. Significant changes and additions also \ninclude provisions regarding health claims for food products, health \ncare economic claims, a notice of discontinuance when a sole \nmanufacturer stops producing a drug, and a range of other items.\n  The original Senate-passed bill contained a provision regarding the \nFDA device approval process that posed a serious threat to public \nhealth. In effect, the Senate-passed bill would have limited the FDS's \ncurrent authority to ask device manufacturers for safety data. It would \nhave prohibited the FDA from considering how a new device could be used \nif the manufacturer has not included that use in the proposed labeling. \nAs a general matter, the FDA does not consider uses that the \nmanufacturer has not included in its proposed labeling. However, there \nare instances when the label does not tell the whole story. It is these \ninstances--when the label is false or misleading--that my and Senator \nKennedy's amendment addressed.\n  I was not alone in my concern about this issue. Indeed, this \nprovision was also identified as worthy of a veto threat by the \nadministration. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices said on numerous occasions that if this provision were not \nchanged, that she and other top Presidential advisers would recommend \nthat President Clinton veto this bill.\n  By accepting the House language on this device labeling issue, the \nconferees have struck a reasonable compromise that will give the FDA \nthe authority it needs to ensure that medical devices are safe and \neffective. In this case, the legislative process has worked, and worked \nwell. I commend the conference committee for the sensible compromise \nthey reached on this important issue.\n  The FDA is responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is \npure and healthy and to provide a guarantee that drugs and devices are \nsafe and effective. The FDA has an immense impact on the lives of all \nAmericans. Indeed, the FDA's mandate requires it to regulate over one-\nthird of our Nation's products. Few Government agencies provide this \nkind of important protection for the American people. On a daily basis, \nthe FDA faces the delicate balance between ensuring that patients have \nswift access to new drugs and devices while guaranteeing that those new \nproducts are safe and effective.\n  The bill we are considering today contains many positive elements. It \nreauthorizes the important Prescription Drug User Fee Act, one of the \nmost effective regulatory reforms ever enacted. The legislation also \nincludes a number of provisions that will improve and streamline the \nregulation of prescription drugs, biologic products, and medical \ndevices. I believe that these important reforms to the operation of the \nFood and Drug Administration will increase its efficiency and speed the \ndelivery of important new medical treatments to patients.\n\n  One of the most important elements of this legislation is the \naforementioned reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, \noften referred to as PDUFA. PDUFA established an important partnership \nbetween the agency and the industry, and has successfully streamlined \nthe drug approval process.\n  I am pleased that this bill will provide expedited access to \ninvestigational therapies. This provision builds on current FDA \nprograms related to AIDS and cancer drugs. Another important element \nwill allow the designation of some drugs as ``fast-track'' medications, \nthus facilitating development and expediting approval of new treatments \nof serious or life-threatening conditions. The bill will also require \nthe Secretary of the Department of\n\n[[Page S12247]]\n\nHealth and Human Services to establish a data base on the status of \nclinical trials relating to the treatment, detection, and prevention of \nserious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. Patients have long \nneeded access to such information, and I am pleased that this bill \nprovides a mechanism to grant it.\n  I am also pleased that this bill contains my amendment requiring that \nwithin 18 months of the date of enactment, the FDA must issue \nregulations for sunburn prevention and treatment products. In August \n1978, the FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to \nestablish a monograph for over-the-counter sunscreen drug products. To \ndate--almost 20 years later--while progress has been made, this rule \nhas not been made final.\n  Sunburn prevention and treatment products can go far to help prevent \nsun exposure related to skin cancer. The facts on skin cancer are \ncompelling: one person an hour dies of malignant melanoma; half of all \nnew cancers are skin cancers; one million Americans will develop skin \ncancer this year, making it nearly as common as all other types of \ncancer combined.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has a key role in our response to \nthis skin cancer epidemic through the regulation of safe and effective \nsunburn prevention products that are vital to avoiding skin damage from \nthe sun's rays.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this compromise is a bill that I can \nsupport. I look forward to working with my colleagues to oversee the \nimplementation of this important legislation and to ensure that its \nprovisions streamline FDA processes while also protecting the public \nhealth of the American people.\n  I compliment Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and many other \ncolleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives who have \nworked hard on this bill together to eliminate many other troublesome \nprovisions in the bill as originally introduced.\n  Mr. President, again, I support the conference report on S. 830, the \nFDA reform bill. The challenge throughout this process has been to \nbalance a more efficient, streamlined, and productive FDA with their \nobligation to protect the public health. It has been a difficult task, \nbut we made remarkable progress over the last several months. At the \ncommittee level, there was a serious discussion and debate. I could not \nsupport that version because at that time there were still outstanding \nissues which I thought could jeopardize the public health and safety.\n  When we reached the floor, there was another serious and productive \ndebate about this legislation. Once again, I felt there were issues \nthat had to be further addressed before I could support the measure. \nToday, happily, through the work of the conferees and colleagues on the \nfloor today, we have reached a point where we have legislation that \nboth provides for a streamlined, productive, and efficient FDA, and \ncontinues to give FDA the authority to protect the public health.\n  With specific regard to the debate on the floor, there was one major \nissue that I felt was very important, and that was to allow the FDA to \nhave the authority to carefully review medical devices that may be used \nby the public. The legislation at that time circumscribed significantly \nthe ability of the FDA to look beyond the label, look beyond the listed \nuse by the manufacturer, to contemplate possible other uses that may \ntake place when the product is in the stream of commerce. Fortunately, \nthrough the work of the conferees, this situation has been resolved.\n  Indeed, on the floor I offered an amendment with Senator Kennedy. It \ndid not pass, but I think that effort helped spur a concentrated effort \nduring the conference to develop a legislative formula to give the FDA \nthe power to regulate these devices appropriately.\n  We have many, many things to be thankful for in this bill. One issue \nI would like to address, also, which does not rise up, in some \nrespects, to the major reforms, PDUFA or these issues, but it is \ncritically important; that is, the issue of protecting the public with \nrespect to sunscreen products and sunburn products. I am pleased to \nnote that the FDA has been directed to promulgate regulations within 18 \nmonths with respect to these products which are sold to the public to \nprotect them from the Sun. This might seem like an innocent product, \nbut, in fact, we are seeing a remarkable growth in incidence of skin \ncancer throughout the United States. One person an hour dies of \nmalignant melanoma, skin cancer. Half of all the new cancers developing \nare skin cancer. One million Americans will develop skin cancer this \nyear alone. So we have to begin to focus our attention on those \nproducts which are advertised to protect the American public.\n  Once again, I think this is totally consistent with the role of the \nFDA. I am pleased that this provision has been included in the \nlegislation.\n  Let me conclude by saying, again, I believe we have struck the vital \nbalance between an efficient, productive FDA and their obligation, \nhistorically and statutorily, to protect the public health. We have \ndone that through the work of Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and many \nothers. I personally thank them and applaud them for their efforts \ntoday.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't also thank my staff member, Bonnie \nHogue, for her help through this entire process. I yield the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will now yield to the Senator from \nUtah, who has been a tremendous help over the years on FDA. In fact, I \nam going to give him all the rest of my time --all 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wanted to take this brief opportunity to \ncommend Chairman Jeffords for a job well done--for producing a bill \nwhich will dramatically improve the way the Food and Drug \nAdministration does business as we move into the 21st century.\n  That has been one of my top priorities during my service in the \nSenate. I am proud that we are having the opportunity today to vote on \nthis historic legislation which will have so many benefits for my State \nof Utah.\n  Utah is the home to over 100 medical device manufacturers, and \nseveral pharmaceutical manufacturers as well. We also are the Nation's \nleading producer of dietary supplements.\n  The Utah Life Sciences Industries Association, the leading trade \nassociation for Utah device and drug manufacturers, has worked closely \nwith the Congress in formulating this legislation, which will have many \npositive effects for Utah.\n  On behalf of our Utah drug and device manufacturers, let me thank you \nChairman Jeffords, and our colleague in the House, Chairman Tom Bliley, \nfor producing a bill which has encouraged the FDA to work in a more \ncollaborative manner and to get the job done, to get it done \nprofessionally and expeditiously, without all the bureaucratic hassles \nwe have experienced in the past.\n  And on behalf of the dietary supplement manufacturers, and most \nimportantly the 100 million or so consumers--most of whom seem to have \ncalled our offices in the last few weeks--let me thank you for making \nsure that the bill does not undo the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act in any way and that dietary supplements will remain what \nthey are, food products, not drugs.\n  Finally, I wish to thank all of the staff who worked literally \nthrough the night to make today's passage of the conference report for \nS. 830 possible. You can be proud of your work.\n\n\n                retirement of kathleen ``kay'' holcombe\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I could not let this opportunity pass \nwithout recognizing the extraordinary contribution that Kay Holcombe \nhas made during almost 25 years of Government service.\n  Kay, who currently serves as the top health staffer on my good friend \nRepresentative John Dingell's Commerce Committee staff, has worked in a \nvariety of positions in Government, including 6 years on Capitol Hill. \nUnfortunately for us, she plans to retire at the end of this session--\nwhile a fantastic opportunity for her, a regrettable loss the Congress \nand the Nation.\n  I grew to know and appreciate Kay in 1984, when I was chairman of the \nLabor Committee and Kay joined our staff as an American Political \nScience Association congressional fellow. What Kay\n\n[[Page S12248]]\n\nbrought to that job was considerable. She is bright, witty, an expert \non any issue she studies, and, above all, a true professional who puts \ngood policy above politics.\n  What I recall most vividly about Kay's period on the Labor Committee \nwas her incredible ability to juggle lots of balls without dropping any \nof them. I could always count on her to get the job done, and, in fact, \nto do her job and the job of three others.\n  I believe that Kay stands out among Government employees for the \ncommon sense she brings to any position and for an ability to bring \nconsensus to the most difficult of issues.\n  We are witnessing that ability today with passage of the conference \nreport on the FDA reform bill, a bill which--quite simply--would not \nhave been possible without Kay Holcombe.\n  Her work on the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act also \nstands out in my mind, where Kay's knowledge and skills as a tactician \nhelped us overcome many an impasse. And, I might add, she was, and I \nsuspect is, the only staffer in the Capitol who understands many of the \nwords we wrote into that act, the most memorable of which was \n``lyophilize''.\n  Her background as a bench scientist at NIH, with subsequent \nexperience in almost every one of the Public Health Service agencies, \nis a record of accomplishment and experience that cannot be matched on \nCapitol Hill.\n  I, for one, will miss Kay's expertise sorely. And while I am thrilled \nfor her as she enters this challenging new period in her life, and I am \nsaddened at our loss here in the Congress.\n  To Kay, her husband Frank, her daughter and son-in-law Anne and Tony, \nand her mother Ginny, I wish the best as the family enters a new period \nof life after Capitol Hill. I hope it will be happy indeed.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes 33 seconds to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues \nwho have spent innumerable hours creating a bill that will bring \nlifesaving drugs and medical devices to the American people more \nquickly and efficiently, without compromising safety or effectiveness.\n  First, Senator Jeffords is to be commended for his leadership. His \nstaff, most notably Jay Hawkins and Sean Donahue, also deserve our \nappreciation for their hard work and dedication to seeing this \nlegislation enacted.\n  Although the process was at times a difficult one, I'm pleased to say \nthat a spirit of bipartisanship and compromise ultimately prevailed, as \nevidenced by the overwhelming Senate vote of 98 to 2 in September on \nthis bill.\n  I'd also like to thank my fellow Senate conferees--Senators Kennedy, \nCoats, Harkin, Gregg, Mikulski, Frist, and DeWine for their successful \nefforts to negotiate a workable compromise with our colleagues in the \nHouse.\n  We should take pride in the legislation that has been created--the \nfirst substantial update of FDA's rules for regulating drugs and \ndevices since the 1970's.\n  We should take pride in the fact that this bill will speed critical \nproducts to patients without compromising the high safety standards \nthat Americans have come to rely on.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to speak for a moment about some of the \npositive reforms contained in this bill.\n  At the heart of the bill is the 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act--a piece of legislation remarkable for \nthe fact that there is unanimous agreement that it really works.\n  In the 5 years since this initiative was created, the fees collected \nunder PDUFA have cut drug approval times in half. With its renewal as \npart of this bill, we can expect drug approval times to drop an \nadditional 10 to 16 months.\n  In addition, by improving the certainty of product review process, \nthis bill encourages U.S. companies to continue to develop and \nmanufacture in the United States. This bill asks the FDA and industry \nto begin collaborating early in the approval process to prevent \nmisunderstandings about agency expectations that ultimately could delay \na needed product from reaching consumers.\n  This bill also establishes or expands upon several mechanisms to \nprovide patients and other consumers with greater access to information \nand to lifesaving products.\n  For example, this bill will give individuals with lifethreatening \nillnesses greater access to information about ongoing clinical trials \nof drugs--information that may offer the only hope for those patients \nwho have not benefited from treatments already on the market.\n  Based on a bill originally championed by Senators Snowe and \nFeinstein, I offered an amendment in committee, which I was pleased to \nsee adopted, to expand an existing AIDS database to include clinical \ntrials for all serious or lifethreatening diseases.\n  Individuals struggling with chronic and debilitating diseases should \nnot be burdened with the daunting task of searching, without \nassistance, to locate studies of promising treatments. This database \nwill provide one-stop-shopping to help those patients quickly and \neasily access vital information.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates \nthe Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, legislation originally \nintroduced by our former colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and \nnow cosponsored by myself and Senator DeWine.\n  This provision addresses the problem of the lack of information about \nhow drugs work on children, a problem that President Clinton recognized \nrecently as a national crisis.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth of \nall drugs on the market have been tested for their safety and \neffectiveness in children. This legislation provides a fair and \nreasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort \nneeded to test their products for use by children.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Jeffords as the first Democratic \ncosponsor of this bill. I would thank him again for the hard work and \nlong hours that he and his staff have contributed.\n  I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me join here, Mr. President, the chorus of praise for those who \nhave been involved in putting this bill together. It has been a long \njourney and not always an easy one, but I think the final product is a \ngood one. I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, \nand his staff, Jay Hawkins, Sean Donohue, Jeanne Ireland of my staff, \nfor their hard work and dedication in seeing this process to its \nconclusion. We swept the Senate with an overwhelming vote of 98 to 2 on \nwhat I thought was a good bill. Our conferees worked very hard. I thank \nSenators Kennedy, Coats, Harkin, Craig, Mikulski, Frist, and DeWine for \ntheir successful efforts in this area as well.\n  This is a critically important piece of legislation that will \nexpedite the process of getting needed medicines and devices to \npatients, without compromising safety or effectiveness. That was a \ndesired goal of everybody here.\n  Let me, if I can, mention two or three provisions in the bill that I \nthink are worthy of special note. One, of course, is a 5-year \nreauthorization of PDUFA, which is very, very important. I think it \ndemonstrates the success of the PDUFA and how well it worked over 5 \nyears.\n  Secondly, I also would like to commend our colleagues for accepting \nthe several mechanisms to provide patients and consumers with greater \naccess to information and to life-saving products. For example, this \nbill gives individuals with life-threatening illnesses greater access \nto information about ongoing clinical trials and drugs that could be \nvery, very important to them and their families. By the way, Senator \nSnowe and Senator Feinstein deserve particular credit. It was \noriginally their idea that we incorporated in the bill, the Better \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act. Former Senator Kassebaum of Kansas \noriginally authored that idea, Mr. President. Senator DeWine and I \nincluded it in this bill. I think it has been improved upon in the \nconference. It is a very important provision that could make a huge \ndifference for young children and their families who want to have \nreliable products that will become available to them.\n\n[[Page S12249]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, let me conclude by again thanking all those who \nhave been involved in this process. Passing this legislation can truly \nbe considered one of the very fine achievements of this first session \nof this Congress. I look forward to its effectiveness with the American \nconsumer.\n\n\n                         APPROPRIATIONS TRIGGER\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, on September 23 of this year, my \ncolleague, Senator Cochran, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies, rose on the \nfloor of the Senate to express objection to a provision of the FDA \nreform bill that would direct the appropriations subcommittee to \nprovide established levels for salaries and expenses of the Food and \nDrug Administration through fiscal year 2002. If the appropriations \nbills did not meet those levels, referred to as trigger, the FDA would \nnot be able to collect or use receipts authorized by the Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act [PDUFA]. The effect of the provision Senator Cochran \nfound so troublesome would have been to place a budgetary gun to the \nhead of the appropriations subcommittee under threat of PDUFA fees not \nbeing collected and the Nation's drug approval process placed at risk. \nAs ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, I shared Senator \nCochran's concerns, but honestly hoped that the problem he highlighted \nwould be corrected before we were faced with final passage of the \nconference report on FDA reform. While the conference report before us \ntoday does provide some relief in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 from the \nearlier Senate language, I am still disappointed that more progress was \nnot achieved to inject a greater dose of realism into the expectations \nof the FDA authorization committees of the House and Senate.\n  I do not mean to detract from the very important work of the FDA nor \nto minimize the need to push ahead aggressively with drug approvals. I \nequally appreciate the concerns of the prescription drug industry, \nwhich will be responsible for paying the PDUFA fees, that their \nconsiderable contributions will be used to supplement, not supplant, \nthe drug approval process. However, an unfortunate charade has been \nemployed to suggest the language now contained in FDA reform is going \nto protect, in fact guarantee, increases in the level of Federal funds \nappropriated for FDA drug approvals. I must point out to my colleagues \nthat the language before us does nothing to assure that very goal and I \nfeel compelled to highlight the provision's failing.\n  FDA reform would require the appropriations bills for fiscal years \n1999 through 2002 to provide levels for the FDA salaries and expenses \naccount at levels no lower than the fiscal year 1997 level adjusted by \nthe lesser of inflation based on the consumer price index or changes in \ngrowth of national domestic discretionary spending. The FDA salaries \nand expenses account contains funding for all activities of FDA, \nincluding drug approvals, subject to an appropriation other than \namounts for buildings and facilities. The FDA reform legislation \ncontains no requirement that FDA allocate any portion of the salaries \nand expenses account for drug approvals. Therefore, while our \nappropriations subcommittee may comply with the full letter of FDA \nreform requirement, that act alone would provide no assurance to the \ndrug industry that the FDA appropriation would be used as they expect. \nFDA certainly has other pressing budgetary demands such as the need to \naccount for the rental space arrearage for which the General Services \nAdministration is threatening action against FDA, and continued work on \ntobacco issues. FDA will also need increased attention in the area of \nfood safety which continuing headlines, such as that appearing in the \nWashington Post this weekend about the more than 700 people made ill by \ncontaminated food in southern Maryland, will no doubt place greater \nworkload on the agency. An arbitrary appropriation trigger will produce \nno magic bullet aimed solely at the problem of drug approval backlogs.\n  Mr. President, I might have a little more understanding for the \nconcerns of the drug industry if there was any merit to their claim \nthat the appropriations subcommittee would not hold faith with their \nrequests. Over the past 10 years, our subcommittee has increased new \nbudget authority for FDA salaries and expenses from $456,004,000 to \n$857,501,000. In fact, I would like the Record  to reflect the amounts \nprovided in that account on a year-to-year basis since fiscal year 1988 \nto the present, and I ask unanimous consent the year and amounts be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Fiscal year 1988--$456,004,000.\n       Fiscal year 1989--$487,344,000.\n       Fiscal year 1990--$574,171,000.\n       Fiscal year 1991--$656,519,000.\n       Fiscal year 1992--$725,962,000.\n       Fiscal year 1993--$746,035,000.\n       Fiscal year 1994--$813,339,000.\n       Fiscal year 1995--$819,971,000.\n       Fiscal year 1996--$819,971,000.\n       Fiscal year 1997--$819,971,000.\n       Fiscal year 1998--$857,501,000.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have included this history of funding to show how the \namount of appropriations for FDA salaries and expenses has increased \nevery single year since fiscal year 1988 except for the period between \nfiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1997 when the level was held at a \nfreeze. I also want to note that the 3-year period connecting fiscal \nyear 1995 and fiscal year 1997 was a period in which the 602(b) \nallocation to our subcommittee fell by 11 percent. I hope my colleagues \nsee in this history a commitment by our subcommittee to recognize the \nimportance of FDA's activities. Further, I hope my colleagues see that \neven during a time when nearly all other programs under our \njurisdiction had to take significant reductions, FDA was held harmless. \nI believe this history reflects well on the commitment and good faith \nof our subcommittee.\n  An obvious result of the provision contained in FDA reform will be \ncontinuing further reductions in other programs under the jurisdiction \nof our subcommittee. Those programs will again have to suffer unless, \nin the unlikely event, we receive substantial increases in our future \n602(b) allocations. There are many, many other programs for which our \nsubcommittee is responsible that are important to people and \ncommunities all across the Nation. Our bill provides funding for all \nactivities at the U.S. Department of Agriculture--except the Forest \nService--and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. At USDA alone, \nthere are hundreds of programs essential to rural and urban America \nthat will be harmed, again, if our subcommittee is expected to provide \nFDA, and FDA only, with inflation increases through fiscal year 2002. \nUSDA programs have already been radically cut by our subcommittee over \nthe past several years while, as noted above, FDA was provided \nsubstantial increases or, at least, held constant.\n  I understand a few other proposals were suggested, and rejected, \nduring consideration of the FDA reform legislation. One proposal was to \nhold FDA to a freeze, something which we have shown we have done \nhistorically. Another proposal would have specifically protected the \nFDA activities for drug approvals. That approach would have better \naddressed the concerns I outlined above. I understand this proposal to \nprotect FDA drug approvals was rejected due to objections from nondrug \nrelated industries concerned that FDA resources might be transferred \nfrom their own specific priority areas to drug approvals. Ironically, \nthat is the same concern I have heard from groups fearful about what \nthe provision in FDA reform will do to USDA and CFTC programs.\n  Mr. President, at times I feel there is an outright assault on the \nappropriations process. Too many times in recent years we have seen \nrequirements imposed on the Appropriations Committee by other \nlegislative and procedural vehicles that continuously impairs our \nability to respond to agency needs and responsibilities to our states \nand the American people. Based on administration projections, the \ntrigger mechanism contained in FDA reform would force the \nappropriations subcommittee to increase the FDA salaries and expense \naccount from the current $857 to $876 million in fiscal year 2002. \nAccording to the President's 1998 budget, the projected request for FDA \nsalaries and expenses for fiscal year 2002 is only $691 million. This \nis a difference of nearly $200 million, an\n\n[[Page S12250]]\n\namount worthy of deliberate consideration by the appropriations \nsubcommittee. Additionally, the FDA reform provision does not account \nfor the possibility of a tobacco settlement that might replace current \nappropriations expenditures, consolidation of food safety functions in \nsome agency other than FDA, or other potential changes that would \naffect, and possibly reduce, the budgetary requirements of FDA. Even \nthough the provision does attach the trigger to the lesser of the \nconsumer price index or changes in the growth of national domestic \ndiscretionary spending, there is no guarantee that any increase in \noverall domestic discretionary totals will be reflected in the 602(b) \nallocation for our subcommittee.\n  For the coming year, I can assure my colleagues that I will work with \nSenator Cochran and others to assess the requests of all agencies and \ndepartments that will come before our subcommittee. I strongly believe \nthat we have been fair in our setting of priorities and that we will \ncontinue to consider the merits of all requests in order to balance the \nfiscal demands and resources in a manner consistent with our abilities, \ngood judgment, and the recommendations of all Senators.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support S. 830, the conference \nreport for the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and \nAccountability Act of 1997, and commend the conferees for quickly \nreaching agreement on compromises that will ultimately improve the FDA \nand improve the public's access to cutting edge medical technology.\n  I am also pleased that we are going to pass this important \nlegislation before adjourning for the year. The American people will be \nmuch better off as a result of our actions here today. S. 830 is a \nperfect example of Congress enacting public policy that Americans both \nwant and need.\n  There is no disagreement as to the caliber of the Food and Drug \nAdministration. FDA is one of the finest regulatory agencies in the \nNation and the world. However, the length of time and amount of \npaperwork required for FDA approval of new products may still be \nexcessive. For many companies, particularly small and startup \nbusinesses, the FDA application process is a formidable time consuming \nobstacle. These barriers exist despite the recent agency improvements \nto their review process. In some cases, the length and complexity of \nthe process can force companies to launch their products abroad rather \nthan here in America. This is a troubling prospect, particularly given \nthe increasingly competitiveness of global markets.\n  The FDA, like all other entities, must evolve and adapt to the \nchanging global landscape. Traditional methods of product review are no \nlonger efficient. Industrialized and emerging nations now participate \nin multilateral trade agreements aimed to reduce trade barriers. While \nthe U.S. continues as the world's premiere economy, our market \ndominance is dwindling. A recent Washington Post article indicated that \nour Nation was far more dominant economically following World War II, \nwhen the U.S. economy accounted for more than 25 percent of the world's \noutput, than it is today. Evolving global markets hold untapped \npotential for product manufacturers. The ability to lucratively launch \nproducts abroad will bring pressure on the FDA to harmonize its \nregulatory policies with other international safety and performance \nstandards. The traditional policies that have made the U.S. the ``gold \nstandard'' in public health protection threaten to undermine our \ncompetitiveness. In order to maintain its status as the gold standard, \nthe FDA must implement polices that encourage the launching of new \nproducts in this country, as opposed to Europe, and ensures that the \nUnited States maintains its technical and scientific leadership in \nhealth disciplines.\n  Mr. President, S. 830 strikes a delicate balance between protecting \nthe public health, fostering global trade under multilateral \nagreements, ensuring swift access to new health technology for \nAmericans, and strengthening the U.S. technical and scientific \nleadership.\n  The conference agreement reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct (PDUFA) for an additional 5 years. PDUFA has been one of the most \nsuccessful pieces of governmental reform legislation. During the 5 \nyears since we first passed PDUFA, the average approval time for \npharmaceutical products has dropped over 40 percent. The pharmaceutical \nand biologics industries overwhelming support reauthorization of PDUFA \nbecause they have seen tangible results from their fee payments. The \nAmerican public also supports reauthorization of PDUFA because they \nhave received access to innovative treatments in a more timely manner.\n  S. 830 also makes considerable progress in expediting patients' \naccess to important new therapies and potentially life saving \nexperimental treatments. I have long held that access to alternative \nmedical treatments is an essential part or health care freedom of \nchoice. Under the conference agreement, patients with fatal illnesses \nwill no longer be denied access to potentially life-saving treatments. \nI am sure that each of my colleagues can recount tales of constituents \nwho have encountered considerable bureaucratic red-tape in their \nefforts to access a non-FDA approved but potentially life-saving \ntreatment. Although I have great respect for the role that the agency \nand its employees play in protecting consumers from unsafe and \nineffective products, there is a problem when informed Americans cannot \nget access to desired therapies. S. 830 makes some much needed reforms \nto enhance that access.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement includes reasonable \ncompromises on provisions concerning medical device labeling, \ndissemination of information concerning drug off-label use, and \nregulation of device manufacturing. Ensuring that unapproved medical \ndevices not get onto the market that clearly have a different use than \nthe labeling indicates is a vitally important task. This issue alone \nwas responsible for delaying approval of the Senate version of the FDA \nModernization Act. I am pleased that the conferees reached an agreement \nto give FDA the necessary regulatory authority but not subject \nmanufacturers to the whims of various application reviewers. FDA will \nbe given the necessary authority to prevent fraudulent labeling as a \nmeans of achieving product approval.\n\n  Similarly, S. 830 strikes an appropriate balance between protecting \nthe public interests and allowing manufacturers to share important off-\nlabel use information with providers. It would have been a grave \nmistake to either prevent the distribution of off-label use information \nor not allow the FDA to play a vital role in ensuring the adequacy of \ninformation being distributed by manufacturers. I know that a lot of \nwork went into the compromise reached regarding off-label usage \ninformation and the agreement greatly benefits the American public.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate patients groups for \ntheir steadfast pursuit of this reform. During this year, I have met \nwith countless numbers of my constituents who will immediately have \nbetter access to medical treatment as a result of this conference \nagreement. Each time we met, their message was loud and clear--pass FDA \nreform now. This is a resounding message that I cannot ignore.\n  S. 830 builds on the reforms that the FDA has already put into place \nover the past 5 years. The agency has taken a number of steps to \nstreamline administrative functions and work better with industry and \nconsumers to facilitate the availability of cutting edge medical \ntechnology. The success that FDA has achieved in reducing the time to \nreview new drugs and get potentially life-saving therapies on the \nmarket is laudable. However, more improvements are needed and S. 830 \nmoves another step in the right direction.\n  My support for S. 830 is not a complete endorsement of the bill. \nThere are a number of important provisions absent from this \nlegislation. I am particularly concerned that the bill does not \nadequately address food safety, which will certainly emerge as a major \npublic health issue. Most of the recent criticism of the FDA has \nfocused on the biologics and medical technology areas. Regulation of \nimported food products will probably be the pressing issue of the next \nmillennium. As more imported agricultural products find there way to \nAmerican tables, there\n\n[[Page S12251]]\n\nwill be more pressure upon FDA to act to prevent tainted products from \ngetting to the market. The recent problems with tainted meat and \npoultry highlight this need for greater focus on food safety. \nHopefully, Congress can revisit the shortcomings in food safety \nstandards next year.\n  Nonetheless, S. 830 is a good start down the road of FDA reform. This \nconference agreement is better than the bill passed by either the House \nor Senate and considerable better than the bill developed last year. I \nam happy to have a conference agreement that I can support and that I \ntruly believe moves the country in the right direction. S. 830 is good \nfor patients, good for the industry, and good for the Nation's global \ncompetitiveness. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I just want to review once again, very briefly, the \nprincipal provisions in the legislation which I think are enormously \nconstructive and positive.\n  First of all, building on the PDUFA record, this provision that we \nhave enacted expands the existing program by setting additional \nperformance targets. It puts special emphasis on expanding early \ncooperation and FDA and the industry, which will reduce the development \ntime, so that the drug development process, not just the regulatory \nreview process, can be expedited. That is very important.\n  There are many other positive achievements in the legislation. I am \nparticularly gratified, as I mentioned earlier, with the broader use of \nthe fast-track approval. The streamlined accessibility procedure now \navailable primarily to patients with cancer or AIDS will also be \navailable for drug treatments for patients with any other life-\nthreatening diseases. This bill also provides for expanded access to \ndrugs still under investigation for patience who have no other \nalternatives. The compromise combines protections for patients with \nexpanded access to new investigational therapies, without exposing \npatients to unreasonable risks.\n  The bill includes a new program to provide access for patients to \ninformation about clinical trials for serious or life-threatening \ndiseases.\n  It provides incentives for research on pediatric applications of \napproved drugs and for development of new antibiotic to deal with \nemerging, drug-resistant strains of diseases.\n  It requires companies to give patients advance notification of \ndiscontinuance of important products. And in that connection, I am \ndisappointed that we were not able to address the issue of assuring \nthat asthma patients and others will not be put at risk by any abrupt \ndiscontinuance of inhalers containing CFC's. I have been informed by \nFDA that no notice of proposed rulemaking will be issued before this \nsummer, which will give Congress plenty of time to return to this \nquestion, if necessary.\n  The bill includes many measures that will reduce unnecessary \nregulatory burdens and appropriately clarify its authority.\n  These provisions, as well as others, are extremely constructive and \nwill be enormously helpful to the American consumer.\n  Mr. President, I would like to mention some of the staff who have \nbeen a crucial part of this whole process. Those members of our staff \non the Labor Committee: Nick Littlefield, David Nexon, Diane Robertson, \nDebbie Kochevar, Pearl O'Rourke, Jim Manley, Leslie Kux, and Carrie \nCoberly.\n  Bonnie Hogue with Senator Reed, Sabrina Corlette and Peter Reinecke \nwith Senator Harkin, Jeanne Ireland with Senator Dodd, Deborah Walker \nwith Senator Bingaman, Anne Grady with Senator Murray, Linda DeGoutis \nwith Senator Wellstone, Lynne Lawrence with Senator Mikulski, and Anne \nMarie Murphy with Senator Durbin.\n  With the Republicans are the following staff:\n  Jay Hawkins, Sean Donohue, and Mark Powden, with Senator Jeffords; \nVince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats; Kimberly Spaulding with Senator \nGregg; Sue Ramthun with Senator Frist; and Saira Sultan with Senator \nDeWine.\n  Also, the House staff were instrumental in the success of this \nconference:\n  Kay Holcombe, as Senator Hatch has indicated, worked with us when she \nworked with Senator Hatch on the committee years ago and was very \nconstructive during this process. Howard Cohen, Rodger Currie and Eric \nBerger also with the Commerce Committee, and Paul Kim on Congressman \nWaxman's staff.\n  And I thank the FDA staff: Bill Schultz, Peggy Dotzel, and Diane \nThompson.\n  I thank them all very much for all of their help and their \ninvolvement.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Perez, a Justice Department \ndetainee on the Judiciary Committee, be given floor privileges for the \nremainder of the session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we again thank our colleagues and friends \nand look forward to the passage of this legislation.\n  If there are no other comments, I would be prepared to yield the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nthe staff who have worked to make this bill possible. In the office of \nSenate Legislative Counsel, Robin Bates, Elizabeth Aldridge, and Bill \nBaird worked tirelessly to produce countless bill drafts and \namendments. I would also like to commend House Legislative Counsels \nDavid Meade and Pete Goodloe for their work on the conference report.\n\n  The staff at CRS, especially Donna Vogt, and at GAO, including \nBernice Steinhardt deserve thanks for their willingness to provide \nessential information and documents on extremely short notice.\n  The staff to the members of the committee contributed greatly to the \nsuccess of this bill. Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats' staff \nworked closely with mine in a true partnership on all aspects of S. \n830.\n  In addition, Kimberly Spaulding with Senator Gregg, Sue Ramthun with \nSenator Frist, Saira Sultan with Senator DeWine, and Kate Lambrew-Hull \nwith Senator Hutchinson all played important roles in fashioning \ncompromises on key provisions of this conference report, as did Dave \nLarson and Barry Daylin.\n  Similarly, three staffers for members of the minority on the \ncommittee played pivotal roles throughout the process--from the \npremarkup stage through the development of this conference report. \nTheir assistance was critical to making this bill a bipartisan success.\n  Lynne Lawrence with Senator Mikulski deserves special mention in \nrecognition of her hard work both in the last Congress and in this one \non FDA reform. Following passage of this conference report, Lynne will \nbe leaving Capitol Hill. I am extremely pleased that she will be \nleaving on a high note, and we all wish her the best with future \npursuits.

I want to speak a little about the fast-track bill that \nis before us and which is scheduled to be voted on in the House \ntonight.\n  I doing so, I reread the President's speech on September 10 that he \ngave on fast track. He gave it at the White House, I believe in the \nEast Room.\n  I found some interesting remarks in the President's speech. He talked \nabout change. He said, ``As we have done throughout our history, we \nhave taken our Nation and led the world to the edge of a new era and a \nnew economy.''\n  He is absolutely right.\n  He talked about the economy, and how we are the largest producer of \nautomobiles, agricultural exports, semiconductors, steel, and other \nitems.\n  Then, closer to the end of the speech, the President said, ``As we \ncontinue to expand our economy here at home by expanding our leadership \nin the global economy, I believe that we have an obligation to support \nand encourage core labor standards and environmental protections \nabroad.''\n  He further said in his speech--this is the President's speech on \nSeptember 10--``Our goal must be to persuade other countries to build \non the prosperity that comes with trade and lift their standards up. As \nwe move forward, we must press countries to provide the labor standards \nto which all workers are entitled,'' et cetera.\n  The President said in his speech that we are part of a new world \neconomy. I would say, yes, Mr. President, we are also part of a new \nworld community--a new world community the likes of which we have never \nseen because of the rapid dissemination of information, the \nglobalization of communication, the instantaneous transmission of \nimages and voice, transmittal of information around the globe. People \nliving in the remotest villages of Africa, China, or Asia now know what \nis happening in other parts of the world. No longer is it kept from \nthem. Increasingly the people on this planet are going to demand their \nhuman rights, their fundamental basic human rights, their individual \nfreedoms. That is what Tiananmen Square was all about.\n\n  Yes, Mr. President, you were right. You were right, Mr. President, to \nsay to President Jiang of China that China was on the wrong side of \nhistory at Tiananmen Square. You were right, Mr. President. But, Mr. \nPresident, to the extent that we have a trade bill before us that \nlimits your authority to negotiate under fast track regarding \nexploitative child labor, that weakens the provisions dealing with \nchild labor, then you, Mr. President, and this country are on the wrong \nside of history.\n  Those may sound like strong words, but as I have read the President's \nspeech, and as I read the fast-track bill before us, one can only come \nto one conclusion. This legislation takes us in the wrong direction. It \nseverely limits the ability of the President and our trade negotiators \nto address the issue of exploitative child labor in trade negotiations. \nThat is right. This bill limits the President's authority. The 1988 \nbill didn't. I will explain this.\n  In this bill, child labor is included in a category of issues under \nthe heading ``Regulatory Negotiations.'' Under this heading in the \nbill, negotiations under fast track on child labor may only cover--I \nwill read it--``the lowering of, or derogation from, existing * * * \nstandards.''\n  That is all. The language does not allow negotiations aimed at \ngetting a country to agree to raise its child labor standards, no \nmatter how weak or nonexistent they may be.\n  Furthermore, the negotiations may only address cases where the other \ncountry's lowering of, or derogation from, its child labor standards \nis--and I will read it directly from the bill--``for the purpose of \nattracting investment or inhibiting United States exports.''\n  I want to make sure my colleagues understand that.\n  First of all, the President may only negotiate regarding the lowering \nof, or derogation from, existing labor standards. He can't negotiate on \nstrengthening them. And he may only negotiate regarding the situation \nwhere the lowering of, or derogation from, standards is done for the \npurpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports.\n  What about the case where a country lowers or fails to enforce its \nchild labor standards for the purpose of producing goods at lower cost \nso it can ship them to the United States? That situation is not \nmentioned in this language, so the President does not have authority to \nnegotiate on that basis according to the terms of the bill. Allowing \nthe use of exploitative child labor to hold the price of goods down is \nunfair competition, plain and simple, but a country could do that.\n  Exploitative child labor in foreign countries unfairly puts competing \nfirms and workers at a disadvantage in the United States and in other \ncountries that do not allow it. Yet, the language in this bill does not \nindicate that President would have the authority to address that kind \nof unfair competition against U.S. companies and workers in \nnegotiations and agreements under fast track. As long as the other \ncountry is not lowering or derogating from its standards for the \npurpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports, our \nnegotiators cannot negotiate to end this unfair competition.\n  The bottom line is that this bill limits the President's authority to \nseek agreements that would curtail exploitative child labor.\n  It is important to clarify this point. I think people will say \n``Harkin, what are you talking about? How could it limit the \nPresident's authority?''\n  Well, let us examine that question.\n  Under this bill, the President actually has less authority to \nnegotiate regarding child labor, and submit an agreement to Congress \nunder fast-track procedures, than he had in the most recent fast-track \nlegislation, which was contained in the Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act of 1988--the last bill laying out fast-track \nprocedures that we voted on and which this Senator voted for.\n\n[[Page S12253]]\n\n  That is right. Let me be very clear. The bill before us provides less \nauthority to negotiate on child labor than the bill that we passed in \n1988. And that bill has done precious little in terms of exploitative \nchild labor.\n\n  Now, let me explain specifically. The 1988 fast-track law was set up \nin the same way as the bill before us. It had a listing of principal \ntrade negotiating objectives. One of those listed objectives pertained \nto worker rights, and I will quote from the 1988 law:\n\n       The principal negotiating objectives of the United States \n     regarding worker rights are (A) to promote respect for worker \n     rights.\n\n  As used in the 1988 fast-track law, the term ``worker rights\" \ncertainly includes the right of children not to be subjected to \nexploitative labor. That is the plain meaning of the language, and I \nhave confirmed that interpretation with the Congressional Research \nService.\n  So the 1988 fast-track bill clearly included a negotiating objective \nencompassing child labor and affirming the President's broad authority \nto negotiate regarding child labor.\n  Well, now someone, I am sure, will point out that the bill before us \nspecifically mentions child labor. Yes, it does. The 1988 bill did not, \nalthough as I noted child labor was encompassed in the 1988 bill under \nthe heading of worker rights. But the 1988 bill and this bill are \nvastly different from one another in the way they are structured and \nhow they deal with child labor. The 1988 bill's negotiating objectives \nwere written in broad terms to urge the President to pursue worker \nrights issues which included child labor. The 1988 language was not \nreally written as a limitation on the President's authority, but rather \nas an affirmation of the President's expansive authority to negotiate \non these issues and an encouragement to seek agreements on these issues \nwith other countries.\n  By contrast, this bill before us is narrowly drawn to circumscribe \nand limit the President's negotiating authority regarding exploitative \nchild labor. Unlike the 1988 bill, this bill before us is not written \nto set objectives and encourage the President to reach them, and to do \neven better if possible, in reaching sound agreements on exploitative \nchild labor.\n  Understand this. This bill before us says he may negotiate under fast \ntrack only agreements designed to prevent other countries from lowering \nor derogating from existing child labor standards--no matter how low \nthey may be. He may not negotiate under fast track an agreement in \nwhich a country would commit to raise its child labor standards if they \nare too low or if they do not exist.\n  And further, a fast-track agreement may prevent a country from \nlowering or derogating from its child labor standards only in cases \nwhere it does so for the limited purposes of attracting investment or \ninhibiting U.S. exports. This bill is very limited on the President's \nauthority to negotiate regarding exploitative child labor. Again, he \ncan only negotiate on agreements designed to prevent other countries \nfrom lowering their standards, and then he can only do that if that \ncountry is lowering its standards for the limited purpose of attracting \nU.S. investment or limiting U.S. exports.\n  Mr. President, you wonder who wrote this. Now, I have in good faith \ntalked a lot to the people around the President about exploitative \nchild labor. I have talked to his Trade Representative in good faith \nabout this issue. And you know, initially they said we are going to put \nchild labor in there. Well, they did, but what they didn't say is they \nput it in in a way that actually limits the President's authority from \nwhat he had in the 1988 bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In my remaining time, Mr. President, I would like to \nexplain why my amendment that I will be offering on fast track deals \nspecifically with exploitative child labor in a way that will enhance \nand strengthen the President's position.\n  Now, there are other labor provisions that ought to be put into this \nbill, and there has been a lot of debate and disagreement on ways to \naddress labor, environmental, and health and safety issues in this \nlegislation. I understand the reasons for these disagreements. But, \nhonestly, I do not see how there can be any disagreement on the need to \naddress exploitative child labor and to ensure that the President and \nour trade negotiators do not have their hands tied when it comes to \nnegotiating and concluding agreements on this issue.\n  This is the benchmark that I believe should be applied to \nexploitative child labor in examining the bill before us. It is simply \nthis. The President's authority and our directions to him to negotiate \non exploitative child labor should be no less than that for the other \nimportant issues contained in this bill.\n  Using that benchmark, I would invite my colleagues to examine the \nfast-track bill that we have before us. This bill has numerous \nprincipal negotiating objectives dealing with a wide range of issues--\ntrade in goods, trade in services, foreign investment, intellectual \nproperty, agriculture, unfair trade practices, a host of them.\n  Again, with respect to all of these other issues, the bill is drafted \nto articulate objectives, to give guidance and direction to the \nPresident, to ensure that the President has sufficiently broad and \nexpansive negotiating authority and to encourages him to use it--a far \ncry from the limiting way child labor is addressed in this bill.\n  Look at the language dealing with intellectual property. The bill \nsets ambitious goals here and confirms the President's broad authority \nto negotiate and submit any resulting agreement under fast track. In \nfact, one of the principal negotiating objectives on intellectual \nproperty is ``the enactment and effective enforcement by foreign \ncountries of laws that recognize and adequately protect intellectual \nproperty.''\n  Now, when it comes to intellectual property, the President is not \nlimited to negotiating under fast track only to prevent other countries \nfrom lowering or derogating from existing standards. Nor is negotiation \nlimited only to those cases where a country is seeking to attract \ninvestment or inhibit U.S. exports.\n  To protect intellectual property, the President is to seek agreements \nin which other countries commit to adopt and enforce higher standards \nif they need to. Not so for child labor. And his negotiating authority \nto protect intellectual property covers the broad range of ways in \nwhich intellectual property rights may be violated. Again, not so for \nchild labor.\n  My amendment regarding exploitative child labor simply tracks the \nlanguage in the bill on intellectual property. It is basically the same \nlanguage, with conforming modifications. My amendment ensures that the \nPresident has the same authority to negotiate on exploitative child \nlabor as he has on protecting intellectual property. It puts into the \nbill that one of our trade negotiating objectives includes the \nenactment and effective enforcement by other countries of laws against \nexploitative child labor. It adds exploitative child labor to the bill \nas a negotiating objective.\n  My amendment does not tie the President's hands. It does not say \nthere has to be a predetermined outcome on child labor in trade \nnegotiations. It just says that in dealing with exploitative child \nlabor, the President has the authority, the same authority, as he has \nto protect against the pirating of a song, a computer chip or a compact \ndisc. We ought to ensure this bill gives the President the same \nauthority to seek protection against exploitative child labor as a \nmeans of unfair competition as he has to seek protection against the \nmisappropriation of intellectual property as a means of unfair \ncompetition.\n  My amendment says that exploitative child labor will be on the table \nduring negotiations. It will be one of our principal trade negotiating \nobjectives. It will have the same status and stature as intellectual \nproperty.\n  Mr. President, again I am not talking about 18-year old kids working, \nor 17-year-old kids, no. This is what I am talking about right here. \nThis picture is of a young girl working in a field in Mexico after \nNAFTA. We have more children working in Mexico today after NAFTA than \nwe did before. And I do not mean just teenagers. I mean kids 8, 9, 10 \nyears of age, too. And yet we had some side agreements covering child \nlabor on NAFTA, but they are not being enforced.\n\n[[Page S12254]]\n\n  We have over 200 million working kids in the world today, more and \nmore being put into factories and plants and, yes, agriculture. My Iowa \nfarmers can compete against anyone in the world, but they cannot \ncompete against that girl because that girl is a slave laborer. That is \nslave labor. This girl has no choice. She has no options. She cannot go \nto school. She cannot go to school because she is out in the fields all \nday, the same as a kid working in a glass factory, a shoe factory, a \ngarment factory, or a rug factory. And these are often kids that are 8, \n9, 10 years old.\n  Now, I believe that our trade negotiators and the people down at the \nWhite House have the best of intentions. I am sure there is no one \nthere who likes exploitative child labor. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand why they sent a bill to us such as they did and why they \nwill go along with such a weak bill relating to exploitative child \nlabor. If they would only compare this bill with the one in 1988, they \nwould understand that the bill before us curtails, circumscribes and \nlimits the President's authority on exploitative child labor relative \nto the 1988 bill.\n  I have been talking to people down at the White House about putting \nexploitative child labor in this bill at the same level as intellectual \nproperty, but for some reason they just cannot quite seem to get on \nboard.\n  There was a time not too long ago when intellectual property rights \nwere regarded as extraneous to trade, just as some argue child labor is \ntoday. I remember when I was in the Navy back in the 1960s. People \nwould go to Taiwan and they would get records for perhaps 10 cents \neach--books and encyclopedias for just pennies--because Taiwan was \npirating the records; they were pirating the books and printing them. I \nremember people I knew in the Navy would go to Taiwan and load up with \nbooks and records, but today there are international rules in trade \nagreements to protect intellectual property. So there was a time when \nintellectual property was considered extraneous to trade agreements. \nNot so today. Exploitative child labor should not be extraneous today.\n  Yes, we are in a new era. We are in a new world economy, but we are \nalso in a new world community. And just as we have taken the lead in \nthe world economy, as we have taken the lead in breaking down trade \nbarriers--and I believe we should--we must take the lead in stopping \nthis, the last vestige of slavery in the world today, exploitative \nchild labor.\n  We can debate and discuss labor issues, environmental issues, and \nthere are all kinds of different perspectives and arguments about them. \nThere should be no argument on exploitative child labor. There should \nbe no disagreement on this. There are distinct lines. Children should \nnot be working like this. Our trade negotiators, when they sit down at \nthat table, ought to be negotiating on exploitative child labor. It \nought to be a trade negotiating objective. It ought to have the same \nstature, the same force, the same effect as intellectual property \nbecause not only is this a moral imperative of ours; it is imperative \nto stop it as unfair competition because that child laborer, that child \nslave, is producing goods that are sent to this country, that compete \nagainst our products. My farmers cannot compete against that. Our \nworkers cannnot compete against that. They should not have to compete \nagainst it. This bill is fatally flawed and the administration needs to \nsend get behind the amendment that I will be offering. We need to adopt \nthat amendment to make sure that stopping exploitative child labor has \nthe same force and effect, and the same level of authority, in trade \nnegotiations as stopping the pirating of intellectual property.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe my order is to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator, under the \nprevious order, has 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12252-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12254-S12256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WE MUST BE FIRM WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak tomorrow on the subject of \nfast track. I wish to talk this evening about another subject that has \nnot received as much conversation on the floor of the Senate as it \nmerits--because, while we have been focused on fast track and on a lot \nof loose ends which must be tied up before this first session of the \n105th Congress can be brought to a close, a very troubling situation \nhas developed in the Middle East that has ominous implications, not \njust for our national security but literally for the security of all \ncivilized and law-abiding areas of the world.\n  Even after the overwhelming defeat that the coalition forces visited \nupon Iraq in and near Kuwait in the Desert Storm conflict, Iraqi \ndictator Saddam Hussein's truculence has continued unabated. In the \nfinal days of that conflict, a fateful decision was made not to utterly \nvanquish the Iraqi Government and armed forces, on the grounds that to \ndo so would leave a risky vacuum, as some then referred to it, in the \nMiddle East which Iran or Syria or other destabilizing elements might \nmove to fill.\n  But instead of reforming his behavior after he was handed an historic \ndefeat, Saddam Hussein has continued to push international patience to \nthe very edge. The United Nations, even with many member nations which \nstrongly favor commerce over conflict, has established and maintained \nsanctions designed to isolate Iraq, keep it too weak to threaten other \nnations, and push Saddam Hussein to abide by accepted norms of national \nbehavior. These sanctions have cost Iraq over $100 billion and have \nsignificantly restrained his economy. They unavoidably also have \nexacted a very high price from the Iraqi people, but this has not \nappeared to bother Saddam Hussein in the least. Nor have the sanctions \nsucceeded in obtaining acceptable behavior from Saddam.\n  Now, during the past 2 weeks, Saddam again has raised his obstinately \nuncooperative profile. We all know of his announcement that he will no \nlonger permit United States citizens to participate in the U.N. \ninspection team searching Iraq for violations of the U.N. requirement \nthat Iraq not build or store weapons of mass destruction. And he has \nmade good on his announcement. The UNSCOM inspection team, that is, the \nUnited Nations Special Commission team, has been refused access to its \ninspection targets throughout the week and once again today because it \nhas Americans as team members. While it is not certain, it is not \nunreasonable to assume that Saddam's action may have been precipitated \nby the fear that the U.N. inspectors were getting uncomfortably close \nto discovering some caches of reprehensible weapons of mass \ndestruction, or facilities to manufacture them, that many have long \nfeared he is doing everything in his power to build, hide, and hoard.\n  Another reason may be that Saddam Hussein, who unquestionably has \ndemonstrated a kind of perverse personal resiliency, may be looking at \nthe international landscape and concluding that, just perhaps, support \nmay be waning for the United States's determination to keep him on a \nshort leash via multilateral sanctions and weapons inspections. This \nlatest action may, indeed, be his warped idea of an acid test of that \nconclusion.\n  We should all be encouraged by the reactions of many of our allies, \nwho are evincing the same objections to Iraq's course that are \nprevalent here in the United States. There is an inescapable reality \nthat, after all of the effort of recent years, Saddam Hussein remains \nthe international outlaw he was when he invaded Kuwait. For most of a \ndecade he has set himself outside international law, and he has sought \nto avoid the efforts of the international community to insist that his \nnation comport itself with reasonable standards of behavior and, \nspecifically, not equip itself with implements of mass destruction \nwhich it has shown the willingness to use in previous conflicts.\n\n  Plainly and simply, Saddam Hussein cannot be permitted to get away \nwith his antics, or with this latest excuse for avoidance of \ninternational responsibility.\n  This is especially true when only days earlier, after months of \nnegotiations, the administration extracted some very serious \ncommitments from China, during President Jiang Zemin's state visit to \nWashington, to halt several types of proliferation activities. It\n\n[[Page S12255]]\n\nis unthinkable that we and our allies would stand by and permit a \nrenegade such as Saddam Hussein, who has demonstrated a willingness to \nengage in warfare and ignore the sovereignty of neighboring nations, to \nengage in activities that we insist be halted by China, Russia, and \nother nations.\n  Let me say that I agree with the determination by the administration, \nat the outset of this development, to take a measured and multilateral \napproach to this latest provocation. It is of vital importance to let \nthe United Nations first respond to Saddam's actions. After all, those \nactions are first and foremost an affront to the United Nations and all \nits membership which has, in a too-rare example of unity in the face of \nbelligerent threats from a rogue State, managed to maintain its \ndetermination to keep Iraq isolated via a regime of sanctions and \ninspections.\n  I think we should commend the resolve of the Chief U.N. Inspector, \nUNSCOM head Richard Butler, who has refused to bend or budge in the \nface of Saddam's intransigence. Again and again he has assembled the \ninspection team, including the U.S. citizens who are part of it, and \npresented it to do its work, despite being refused access by Iraq.\n  He rejected taking the easy way out by asking the U.S. participants \nsimply to step aside until the problem is resolved so that the \ninspections could go forward. He has painstakingly documented what is \noccurring, and has filed regular reports to the Security Council. He \nclearly recognizes this situation to be the matter of vital principle \nthat we believe it to be.\n  The Security Council correctly wants to resolve this matter if it is \npossible to do so without plunging into armed conflict, be it great or \nsmall. So it sent a negotiating team to Baghdad to try to resolve the \ndispute and secure appropriate access for UNSCOM's inspection team. To \nremove a point of possible contention as the negotiators sought to \naccomplish their mission, the United Nations asked that the U.S. \ntemporarily suspend reconnaissance flights over Iraq that are conducted \nwith our U-2 aircraft under U.N. auspices, and we complied. At that \ntime, in my judgment this was the appropriate and responsible course.\n  But now we know that Saddam Hussein has chosen to blow off the \nnegotiating team entirely. It has returned emptyhanded to report to the \nSecurity Council tomorrow. That is why I have come to the floor this \nevening to speak about this matter, to express what I think is the \nfeeling of many Senators and other Americans as the Security Council \nconvenes tomorrow.\n  We must recognize that there is no indication that Saddam Hussein has \nany intention of relenting. So we have an obligation of enormous \nconsequence, an obligation to guarantee that Saddam Hussein cannot \nignore the United Nations. He cannot be permitted to go unobserved and \nunimpeded toward his horrific objective of amassing a stockpile of \nweapons of mass destruction. This is not a matter about which there \nshould be any debate whatsoever in the Security Council, or, certainly, \nin this Nation. If he remains obdurate, I believe that the United \nNations must take, and should authorize immediately, whatever steps are \nnecessary to force him to relent--and that the United States should \nsupport and participate in those steps.\n  The suspended reconnaissance flights should be resumed beginning \ntomorrow, and it is my understanding they will be. Should Saddam be so \nfoolish as to take any action intended to endanger those aircraft or \ninterrupt their mission, then we should, and I am confident we will, be \nprepared to take the necessary actions to either eliminate that threat \nbefore it can be realized, or take actions of retribution.\n\n  When it meets tomorrow to receive the negotiators' report and to \ndetermine its future course of action, it is vital that the Security \nCouncil treat this situation as seriously as it warrants.\n  In my judgment, the Security Council should authorize a strong U.N. \nmilitary response that will materially damage, if not totally destroy, \nas much as possible of the suspected infrastructure for developing and \nmanufacturing weapons of mass destruction, as well as key military \ncommand and control nodes. Saddam Hussein should pay a grave price, in \na currency that he understands and values, for his unacceptable \nbehavior.\n  This should not be a strike consisting only of a handful of cruise \nmissiles hitting isolated targets primarily of presumed symbolic value. \nBut how long this military action might continue and how it may \nescalate should Saddam remain intransigent and how extensive would be \nits reach are for the Security Council and our allies to know and for \nSaddam Hussein ultimately to find out.\n  Of course, Mr. President, the greatest care must be taken to reduce \ncollateral damage to the maximum extent possible, despite the fact that \nSaddam Hussein cynically and cold-heartedly has made that a difficult \nchallenge by ringing most high-value military targets with civilians.\n  As the Security Council confronts this, I believe it is important for \nit to keep prominently in mind the main objective we all should have, \nwhich is maintaining an effective, thorough, competent inspection \nprocess that will locate and unveil any covert prohibited weapons \nactivity underway in Iraq. If an inspection process acceptable to the \nUnited States and the rest of the Security Council can be rapidly \nreinstituted, it might be possible to vitiate military action.\n  Should the resolve of our allies wane to pursue this matter until an \nacceptable inspection process has been reinstituted--which I hope will \nnot occur and which I am pleased to say at this moment does not seem to \nhave even begun--the United States must not lose its resolve to take \naction. But I think there is strong reason to believe that the \nmultilateral resolve will persist.\n  To date, there have been nine material breaches by Iraq of U.N. \nrequirements. The United Nations has directed some form of responsive \naction in five of those nine cases, and I believe it will do so in this \ncase.\n  The job of the administration in the next 24 hours and in the days to \nfollow is to effectively present the case that this is not just an \ninsidious challenge to U.N. authority. It is a threat to peace and to \nlong-term stability in the tinder-dry atmosphere of the Middle East, \nand it is an unaffordable affront to international norms of decent and \nacceptable national behavior.\n  We must not presume that these conclusions automatically will be \naccepted by every one of our allies, some of which have different \ninterests both in the region and elsewhere, or will be of the same \ndegree of concern to them that they are to the U.S. But it is my belief \nthat we have the ability to persuade them of how serious this is and \nthat the U.N. must not be diverted or bullied.\n  The reality, Mr. President, is that Saddam Hussein has intentionally \nor inadvertently set up a test which the entire world will be watching, \nand if he gets away with this arrogant ploy, he will have terminated a \nmost important multilateral effort to defuse a legitimate threat to \nglobal security--to defuse it by tying the hands of a rogue who thinks \nnothing of ordering widespread, indiscriminate death and destruction in \npursuit of power.\n  If he succeeds, he also will have overwhelmed the willingness of the \nworld's leading nations to enforce a principle on which all agree: that \na nation should not be permitted to grossly violate even rudimentary \nstandards of national behavior in ways that threaten the sovereignty \nand well-being of other nations and their people.\n  I believe that we should aspire to higher standards of international \nbehavior than Saddam Hussein has offered us, and the enforcement action \nof the United Nations pursues such a higher standard.\n  We know from our largely unsuccessful attempts to enlist the \ncooperation of other nations, especially industrialized trading \nnations, in efforts to impose and enforce somewhat more \nambitious standards on nations such as Iran, China, Burma, and Syria \nthat the willingness of most other nations--including a number who are \njoined in the sanctions to isolate Iraq--is neither wide nor deep to \njoin in imposing sanctions on a sovereign nation to spur it to ``clean \nup its act'' and comport its actions with accepted international norms. \nIt would be a monumental tragedy to see such willingness evaporate in \none place where so far it has survived and arguably succeeded to date,\n\n[[Page S12256]]\n\nespecially at a time when it is being subjected to such a critical test \nas that which Iraq presents.\n\n  In a more practical vein, Mr. President, I submit that the old adage \n``pay now or pay later'' applies perfectly in this situation. If Saddam \nHussein is permitted to go about his effort to build weapons of mass \ndestruction and to avoid the accountability of the United Nations, we \nwill surely reap a confrontation of greater consequence in the future. \nThe Security Council and the United States obviously have to think \nseriously and soberly about the plausible scenarios that could play out \nif he were permitted to continue his weapons development work after \nshutting out U.N. inspectors.\n  There can be little or no question that Saddam has no compunctions \nabout using the most reprehensible weapons--on civilians as readily as \non military forces. He has used poison gas against Iranian troops and \ncivilians in the Iran-Iraq border conflict. He has launched Scud \nmissiles against Israel and against coalition troops based in Saudi \nArabia during the gulf war.\n  It is not possible to overstate the ominous implications for the \nMiddle East if Saddam were to develop and successfully militarize and \ndeploy potent biological weapons. We can all imagine the consequences. \nExtremely small quantities of several known biological weapons have the \ncapability to exterminate the entire population of cities the size of \nTel Aviv or Jerusalem. These could be delivered by ballistic missile, \nbut they also could be delivered by much more pedestrian means; aerosol \napplicators on commercial trucks easily could suffice. If Saddam were \nto develop and then deploy usable atomic weapons, the same holds true.\n  Were he to do either, much less both, the entire balance of power in \nthe Middle East changes fundamentally, raising geometrically the \nalready sky-high risk of conflagration in the region. His ability to \nbluff and bully would soar. The willingness of those nations which \nparticipated in the gulf war coalition to confront him again if he \ntakes a course of expansionism or adventurism may be greatly diminished \nif they believe that their own citizens would be threatened directly by \nsuch weapons of mass destruction.\n  The posture of Saudi Arabia, in particular, could be dramatically \naltered in such a situation. Saudi Arabia, of course, was absolutely \nindispensable as a staging and basing area for Desert Storm which \ndislodged Saddam's troops from Kuwait, and it remains one of the two or \nthree most important locations of U.S. bases in the Middle East.\n  Were its willingness to serve in these respects to diminish or vanish \nbecause of the ability of Saddam to brandish these weapons, then the \nability of the United Nations or remnants of the gulf war coalition, or \neven the United States acting alone, to confront and halt Iraqi \naggression would be gravely damaged.\n  Were Israel to find itself under constant threat of potent biological \nor nuclear attack, the current low threshold for armed conflict in the \nMiddle East that easily could escalate into a world-threatening inferno \nwould become even more of a hair trigger.\n  Indeed, one can easily anticipate that Israel would find even the \nprospect of such a situation entirely untenable and unacceptable and \nwould take preemptive military action. Such action would, at the very \nleast, totally derail the Middle East peace process which is already at \nrisk. It could draw new geopolitical lines in the sand, with the \npossibility of Arab nations which have been willing to oppose Saddam's \nextreme actions either moving into a pan-Arab column supporting him \nagainst Israel and its allies or, at least, becoming neutral.\n  Either course would significantly alter the region's balance of power \nand make the preservation and advancement of U.S. national security \nobjectives in the region unattainable--and would tremendously increase \nthe risk that our Nation, our young people, ultimately would be sucked \ninto yet another military conflict, this time without the warning time \nand the staging area that enabled Desert Storm to have such little cost \nin U.S. and other allied troop casualties.\n  Finally, we must consider the ultimate nightmare. Surely, if Saddam's \nefforts are permitted to continue unabated, we will eventually face \nmore aggression by Saddam, quite conceivably including an attack on \nIsrael, or on other nations in the region as he seeks predominance \nwithin the Arab community. If he has such weapons, his attack is likely \nto employ weapons of unspeakable and indiscriminate destructiveness and \ntorturous effects on civilians and military alike. What that would \nunleash is simply too horrendous to contemplate, but the United States \ninevitably would be drawn into that conflict.\n  Mr. President, I could explore other possible ominous consequences of \nletting Saddam Hussein proceed unchecked. The possible scenarios I have \nreferenced really are only the most obvious possibilities. What is \nvital is that Americans understand, and that the Security Council \nunderstand, that there is no good outcome possible if he is permitted \nto do anything other than acquiesce to continuation of U.N. \ninspections.\n  As the world's only current superpower, we have the enormous \nresponsibility not to exhibit arrogance, not to take any unwitting or \nunnecessary risks, and not to employ armed force casually. But at the \nsame time it is our responsibility not to shy away from those \nconfrontations that really matter in the long run. And this matters in \nthe long run.\n  While our actions should be thoughtfully and carefully determined and \nstructured, while we should always seek to use peaceful and diplomatic \nmeans to resolve serious problems before resorting to force, and while \nwe should always seek to take significant international actions on a \nmultilateral rather than a unilateral basis whenever that is possible, \nif in the final analysis we face what we truly believe to be a grave \nthreat to the well-being of our Nation or the entire world and it \ncannot be removed peacefully, we must have the courage to do what we \nbelieve is right and wise.\n  I believe this is such a situation, Mr. President. It is a time for \nresolve. Tomorrow we must make that clear to the Security Council and \nto the world.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Congress is engaged in a great \ndebate about giving the President of the United States virtually \nunrestricted authority to engage and negotiate with other nations in \nwhat has been termed fast-track authority.\n  Capital markets and international political leaders are waiting to \nsee whether or not this Congress will grant that authority to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  To some, the debate has already been defined as either one \nof believing in free trade or returning to protectionism. I believe \nthat that is a disservice to this Congress and indeed to the debate \nitself because the issue is extraordinarily more complex.\n\n  The United States needs no lectures about the advantages or the \npursuit of free trade nor, indeed, does this Congress. In Bretton \nWoods, the Kennedy Round, the Uruguay Round, the United States has both \nled and constructed the current system both in monetary and trade \nrelations.\n  This country understands that free, unfettered trade, the opening of \ninternational markets, is the very foundation of both our own and \ninternational prosperity. This generation's standard of living has been \nbased on the lessons of each of these agreements.\n  As a result, the United States has become the largest importing \nnation in the world. Indeed, although the United States has an economy \nthat is smaller than the combined economies of the European community, \nwe import more than twice the industrialized product from the \ndeveloping world.\n  This trade has been not without benefit to even those industries \nwhich seemingly have suffered the most. Although there have been \nserious dislocations in key industrial industries, like autos and steel \nand new products like\n\n[[Page S12257]]\n\nsemiconductors and computers, the current competitiveness and \nefficiency of even these industries have benefited by international \ntrade and competition.\n  Indeed, it is because of this enhanced efficiency in competition that \nI supported fast-track authority in 1988, supported the Canada-U.S. \nFree Trade Agreement and most recently the GATT agreement.\n  I take the Senate floor today because I have reached my own \nconclusion that when asked to vote in this body, I will not support \nfast-track authority as currently requested by the President of the \nUnited States this year. I do so despite a long history of supporting \nsimilar authority and as one who believes strongly in free trade as \nenhancing American competitiveness and it being essential to America's \nquality of life, because I believe the United States has reached an \nimportant crossroads in our trade strategy.\n  Like many Americans, I am simply not convinced that the U.S. \nGovernment has a strategy to maximize benefits in current trade \nagreements. I do not fear the competition of foreign trade. I simply \nfear that our negotiators are not prepared to protect and defend our \nnational interests with a coherent strategy.\n  I base my conclusion on four principal problems.\n  First, over 4 decades, by necessity, through the cold war and in \ntimes of threats to our national security, it became necessary for the \nUnited States on occasion to compromise in our trade strategy in order \nto engage in the protection of other important national interests.\n  By necessity, whether it was to secure Philippine military bases or \nthe cooperation of Korean or Turkish or a host of other allies, the \nUnited States would set apart our trade objectives in order to secure \nnational security concerns.\n  Even now while American intellectual property rights are being \ncompromised in China, we are being told that this is necessary for the \npolitical engagement of the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, my first objection to fast-track authority to the \nPresident is these agreements on trade must stand for economic purposes \nof their own weight. The American people and this Congress must be \nconvinced the country is pursuing a coherent trade strategy without \ncompromise for other purposes.\n  Second, it is critical that this Congress be convinced that our trade \nnegotiators are using the leverage of those seeking access to our \nmarket to its maximum advantage. In negotiating NAFTA, the United \nStates afforded Mexico the most important advantage that any nation \neconomically could ever seek. That is, to gain access to the American \nmarket for their products. But we did so without using all of the \nleverage available to the United States. So Mexico, a country that is a \nprincipal conduit for narcotics into the United States, a source of \nmassive illegal immigration to the United States, a nation which does \nnot allow access to American products or investment without \nreservation, was afforded the opportunities of NAFTA without, by \nnecessity, conceding cooperation on all these fronts. So in my mind, \nMr. President, the second reason for a reservation in proceeding with \nfast-track authority is that the United States is not using its \nprincipal leverage in negotiating with other nations.\n  Third, Mr. President, in my mind, is the legitimate concern about the \npace of international economic integration. Mr. President, during this \ndebate, both in this body and in the other, no one will be quoted more \noften than Adam Smith. Indeed, to my mind, there is no man who has been \nread less and quoted more often than Adam Smith in his ``Wealth of \nNations.'' For my third reason in objecting to fast-track authority, I \nreturn to his treatise of more than two centuries ago when he said, ``. \n. . freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations, and \nwith a good deal of reserve and circumspection. Were those high duties \nand prohibitions taken away all at once . . . the disorder which this \nwould occasion might no doubt be very considerable.''\n  Mr. President, free trade is a national objective, but like other \nhuman virtues, it may never be fully realized. It is forever pursued, \nbut it requires so many changes in culture and values and so many \ncomplications that it must remain a goal, understanding it may never be \nrealized. Every Member of this institution recognizes that fast-track \nauthority and opening the American market involves a host, indeed \nhundreds, of different industries that compromise many communities and \ntheir economic strength. It is understood and recognized that, like \nmanufacturing, certain high-labor-intensive industries have no long-\nterm future in the American economy.\n  As Adam Smith warned two centuries ago, that does not mean that with \nhaste or even immediacy they must be subjected to their demise. There \nare industries in this country that employ thousands, if not millions, \nof people who live on the economic margins of our society who have no \nother economic choice. The 50- or 60-year-old textile worker who may \nhave lived in this country for generations, or be new to our land, who \nmay speak English or may not, who may be educated or may have the bare \nminimum of education, will not in a single generation or with the \nstroke of a pen be transformed from a textile worker to a computer \ntechnician.\n  American trade policy with a goal of free trade must be realistic and \nfair to all elements of this society and must take into account the \nvery disorder of which Adam Smith warned only that we be accommodating.\n  Mr. President, finally, a fourth and final reason that I believe this \nSenate should withhold fast-track authority on this occasion. It is \nbased on a series of judgments that this Congress reached a long time \nago. It has become, I believe, standard in this country, almost without \nreservation, to believe that it is appropriate, from bans on child \nlabor to a reasonable minimum wage, to the human rights organized labor \nunions, to just and fair environmental standards. But our country now, \nin the decision to engage itself in free and open global trade, needs \nto reach a judgment. How is it we keep these basic commitments without \nengaging in an extraordinary and even hypocritical contradiction? At \nthis moment in time, the Nation wants both to maintain these high moral \nstandards, some of which have transcended generations, but at the same \ntime to take advantage of the inexpensive products, the economic \nopportunities of importations where workers have no right to organize, \nnonexistent or unenforced minimum wage and, in many cases, almost no \nprotections against child labor, and a minimum of environmental \nstandards.\n\n  The difference, Mr. President, is whether or not the United States \nwill, in some cases, engage in exploitation, not whether or not the \nUnited States will engage in free trade. I believe, therefore, Mr. \nPresident, that on this occasion, with a commitment to free trade and \nan understanding of the need and necessity for the United States to \nengage in free, fair, and open competition, this Congress should not \ngrant unrestricted authority to the President of the United States to \nengage in trade negotiations, without reserving for ourselves the right \nto ensure that there is a trade strategy that encompasses the goal of \nreaching trade balance, dealing with structural imbalances that, by \nnecessity, are arising from countries that continue to protect their \nown markets. And we deal with these inherent contradictions of how we \nmaintain both a standard of living for those in our country who cannot \nquickly adjust to the competition, the contradictions of maintaining \nenvironmental labor standards, while allowing access to our market to \nthose who do not.\n  This will require a trade strategy by the Executive that, to my \njudgment, has not yet been defined and may not yet exist. I do hope, \nhowever, Mr. President, that this is understood for what it is--not a \nretreat, not protectionism, just forcing this country, at long last, to \nbegin to define a real and lasting trade strategy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12256-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12257-S12258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2607\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress draws to a close, \nwe are finally, at last, about to complete action on the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill. The amendment before the Senate \nincorporates the conference report to the Commerce, Justice, State \nspending bill and the Foreign Operations spending bill, together with \nan amendment in the nature of a substitute to the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill.\n  I would like to speak very briefly to the provisions of the District \nof Columbia portion of this omnibus package. First of all, the ranking \nmember of the District of Columbia subcommittee, Barbara Boxer, and I \nhave ironed out all of our differences and we now have the bill that \nshould have the support of the House and the administration.\n  At the moment, the District of Columbia is being funded on a \ntemporary basis through a continuing resolution. It is critical that we \npass this amendment as soon as possible because the Congress has yet to \npass a District of Columbia rescue package and the management reform \nplan, which we enacted in August. Passage of this bill will ensure that \nthat work goes forward to restructure the city's finances and impose \nsome much-needed management reforms on the city and its various \nagencies.\n  The amendment being offered in the nature of a substitute to the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill will provide funding of $8 \nmillion for management reforms, and these reforms are already under \nway. But without passage of this bill, the reform program will simply \nfall apart.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill that has been pending before the Senate \nfor several weeks. This amendment reflects the work of the Congress, \ncity officials, and the financial control board to bring about a \nbalanced District budget. This budget is balanced 1 year ahead of the \nschedule set by the Congress in 1995 when it created the financial \ncontrol board to rescue the city from insolvency and incompetence.\n  To reach consensus on how to balance the budget, the control board \nand the elected city council first rejected several of the proposed \nbudgets. This budget is a more conservative approach. This amendment \nactually cuts most city agencies, with a few exceptions, such as public \nsafety. The focus of this bill is to balance the budget and reform the \ncity's management problems.\n  It is a good bill and I urge its support by my colleagues. I want to \nespecially thank the ranking member, Senator Barbara Boxer, and Kay \nBailey Hutchison for their hard work on the Appropriations Committee. I \nwant to thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, for their help and guidance in \nthe past several months. I also wish to take a moment to thank Mary \nBeth Nethercutt, Jim Hyland, Dave Landers, of my staff, Jay Kimmit, and \nthe rest of the minority staff for their help on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nstaff members be granted full floor privileges during consideration of \nthe District of Columbia and Omnibus Appropriations bills; James \nMorhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Carl\n\n[[Page S12259]]\n\nTruscott, Dana Quam, Vas Alexopoulos, Luke Nachbar, Scott Gudes, Karen \nSwanson Wolf, Emelie East, and Jay Kimmit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the \nappropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and related agencies for Fiscal Year 1998. The provisions \ncame about through bi-partisan negotiations and provides $31.8 billion, \nan increase of $30.9 million above the House level, $135.3 million \nabove the Senate level, and $297 million less than the President's \nrequest.\n  Before getting to the details, I want to thank Senator Hollings, and \nhis staff, Scott Gudes, Karen Swanson-Wolf, and Emelie East for all \ntheir hard work and dedication to getting this bill written and passed. \nTheir efforts and expertise helped smooth the way for its success \nthrough the 99-0 vote in the Senate in July and its presentation to you \ntoday.\n  The committee amendment includes many of the provisions that the \nSenate gave top priority to in its bill, but the funding levels reflect \nour negotiations with the House. Within the Justice Department, the \ncommittee amendment retains the Senate initiatives to fight crimes \nagainst children, increases assistance to state and local law \nenforcement, strengthens counterterrorism activities, bolsters drug \ncontrol efforts, and provides funding for new juvenile programs.\n  We have funded many programs that will further our efforts in \npreventing and combating crimes against children. The amendment \nprovides $10 million in additional funding for the FBI's efforts to \nstop child exploitation on the Internet. In addition, we're making sure \nthose organizations that work closely with the FBI also receive \nadequate funding to provide much needed support. There is $1.7 million \nfor Missing Children; $6.9 million for the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, of which $1.9 million is provided for Internet \ninvestigations; $1.2 million for the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement \nTraining Center for State and local law enforcement investigations; and \nan additional $2.4 million for State and local law enforcement to form \nspecialized units to investigate and prevent child exploitation on the \nInternet. These agencies have promising ideas of ways to improve \ncurrent law enforcement procedures in this area to stop pedophiles from \ncommitting further atrocities.\n  We believe it is the national interest to improve the skills of law \nenforcement personnel on all levels and supports initiatives to do \nthis. The Community Oriented Policing Services, known as the COPS \nprogram, is funded at $1.4 billion. As part of this provision and with \ndirect funding, we were able to preserve the Senate number of $25 \nmillion for the Regional Information Sharing System so that law \nenforcement officers throughout the country have increased access to \nnational criminal databases.\n  The Committee amendment includes an increase in funding for the \nViolence Against Women Act grants to $270.7 million. We recognize the \nneed to enhance and expand current women's assistance programs as \nviolent crimes against them continue. The Violence Against Women grants \nwill be given to States to be used to develop and implement effective \narrest and prosecution policies to prevent, identify, and respond to \nviolent crimes against women. This funding provides domestically abused \nwomen and children with additional support services. Only 20 states \nreceived Violence Against Women grants in 1996. We believe there should \nbe sufficient funding for more states to participate in these programs. \nConsequently, we have appropriated funds for this effort.\n  In this amendment, we remain committed to ensuring that the U.S. law \nenforcement and intelligence community has a comprehensive strategy to \ncombat domestic and international terrorism. In May Congress received \nfrom the Attorney General a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy \ncompiled with consultation with other key departments and agencies. \nDuring subsequent oversight hearings, it became apparent that \nvulnerabilities to our national security still exist, especially to the \nemerging threats from chemical and biological agents and cyber attacks \non computer systems within the United States. The hearings also \nemphasized the need for our efforts to be constantly coordinated among \nthe many participating departments and agencies to make this very \ncritical mission successful. To do this, the conference agreement \nprovides $32.7 million for the Counterterrorism and Technology Crime \nThreat.\n\n  We remain concerned about the proliferation of illegal drugs coming \nacross our borders and its impact on our children. In an effort to \nsupport law enforcement efforts to combat the rampant spread of illegal \ndrugs, the committee devotes $11 million through the DEA to combat the \ntrade of methamphetamine and $10 million for efforts to reduce heroin \ntrafficking. The COPS Program includes $34 million to stop \nmethamphetamine production. We have created a new Carribean initiative \nthat will disrupt the drug corridors and block the flow of illegal \ndrugs into the United States.\n  Over the last few years, the infrastructure needs of the \norganizations funded in this bill have been neglected. We have made a \npoint of providing funds to repair buildings throughout our agencies. \nOver $300 million will go to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \nDrug Enforcement Agency, and Bureau of Prisons to make much needed \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  Regarding the INS, the agreement provides 1000 Border Patrol agents, \nover $200 million in new initiatives to restore the integrity of the \nnaturalization process, and adds 1000 new beds for detention, and the \nultimate deportation of criminal and illegal aliens.\n  As a last mention within the Justice portion of the bill, we have \nincreased funding to $238.6 million dollars for juvenile justice \nprevention programs with an additional $250 million for a new juvenile \naccountability block grant.\n  In the area of the Commerce Department, we have made some difficult \ndecisions, but, I think they are constructive ones. We have, for \nexample, provided strong support for the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, which does high quality research and \nprovides technical data important to our economy. The Sea Grant \nprogram, which conducts research of regional importance through \ncolleges and universities, is strongly supported in this bill at a \nlevel of $56 million.\n  The committee amendment provides increased funding for the National \nWeather Service. Many of us are concerned that the agency have the \nnecessary resources to ensure timely warnings of severe weather, \nincluding tornados and hurricanes.\n  There is $23.4 million for the U.S. Trade Representative taking into \naccount the amended request made by the President recently.\n  The Bureau of Export Administration has two new requirements which \ndeserve mention. First, the Department of State's encryption export \ncontrol responsibilities have been transferred to the Export \nAdministration. Second, with the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, the Export Administration will have primary responsibility \nfor enforcing the convention and is thus provided with $1.9 million to \ndo this.\n\n  And I've kept the best for last--well, at least the issue that seems \nto have the most interest of late--The Census compromise achieved by \nthe White House and the House leadership--it has two parts. First, it \nestablishes a commission to oversee the Census and report regularly on \nthe conduct of the Census. Second, it establishes fast track procedures \nfor judicial review of sampling.\n  In the Judiciary portion of the bill, we have had to confront some \ndifficult issues, but, I believe we are providing the American people \nwith a better Judiciary through our efforts. The appropriation is \nsufficient to maintain current judicial operation levels and takes into \naccount the increase in bankruptcy caseloads and probation population. \nWe are also providing the Justices and judges with the 2.8 percent cost \nof living adjustment requested in the President's budget.\n  We have established a commission to study the current structure of \nthe circuit courts, especially the controversial Ninth Circuit. During \nthe 1996-1997 session, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 96 percent of \nthe decisions they reviewed from the Ninth Circuit. This\n\n[[Page S12260]]\n\nhigh turnover rate is a beacon that the Ninth Circuit is not meeting \nthe needs of the people it serves. The debate over whether to split it \nhas raged for some years. The commission should end the debate over the \nNinth Circuit once and for all.\n  Moving on to the State Department, we have fully funded, to the best \nof our ability, the operations carried out by this Department. We made \nsure that the day-to-day functions of the State Department are funded \nat acceptable levels, and we are trying to upgrade their outdated \ntechnology systems. Maintaining infrastructure was a top priority for \nthe Senate this year. We are providing $21.4 million above the \nPresident's request for the Capital Investment Fund so that desperately \nneeded upgrades in information and communication systems can be done.\n  And as a final noteworthy item, this bill covers the first down \npayment for U.N. arrears as well as the State Department \nReauthorization bill which includes U.N. reform and State Department \nreorganization, which we have worked so hard to achieve.\n  That is a quick run down of the Commerce, Justice, State, and \nJudiciary provisions before us. I want to thank my staff--Jim Morhard, \nKevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Carl Truscott, Dana Quam, Vas Alexopoulos, \nand Luke Nachbar--for all their hard work. They, and their democratic \ncounterparts, have spent long hours drafting this legislation. I \nbelieve this amendment contains sound provisions that have been agreed \nto by both parties. The departments and agencies funded in this \nlegislation can only benefit from the passage of these new funding \nlevels. I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of this \ncommittee amendment.\n  Just to quickly comment on that section of the bill, the language \nwhich is in this bill dealing with the funding for State, Commerce, \nJustice, is similar to the language which passed this Senate by a 99-0 \nvote. The language which is before the Senate at this time is language \nwhich has been agreed to by the Democratic and Republican members of \nthe Appropriations Committee unanimously. Again, I strongly encourage \nthe Senate to pass it.\n  At this time, I yield back the time allocated to myself and Senator \nHollings under the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time is yielded back.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are awaiting another Member who wishes \nto ask some questions, so I will not yield my time yet.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I fully support the efforts of the chairman, \nand I congratulate him for the proposal that he has just described \nwhich, if adopted, makes it possible to greatly shorten the process of \ncompletion of the remaining appropriation bills.\n  The pending amendment contains the committee's recommendations for \nthe remaining three Fiscal Year 1998 appropriation bills, namely, the \nCommerce/Justice/State, District of Columbia, and Foreign Operations \nAppropriation Bills. As Members are aware, the Commerce/Justice/State \nand Foreign Operations Appropriation Bills were passed by the Senate in \nJuly of this year and have been in conference with the House. For those \ntwo bills, the committee's recommendations include, to a large extent, \nthe agreements reached by the House and Senate conferees. There are, \nhowever, certain issues upon which the conferees were unable to reach \nagreement. For those particular issues, the committee has recommended \nproposals which we hope will be acceptable to the Senate and, if so, \nwhich the House can then accept. The chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce/Justice/State Subcommittee, Senators Gregg and Hollings, and \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, \nSenators McConnell and Leahy, will make statements regarding their \nportions of the pending amendment. These very capable chairmen and \nranking members have worked tirelessly for months on their respective \nbills, and they are to be commended by the Senate for their efforts.\n  For the District of Columbia, as Senators are aware, the Senate has \nnot yet passed the Fiscal Year 1998 appropriation bill. Here again, \nthere are a number of issues which, up to this point, have been \nunresolved. I am certain that the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Faircloth, and the equally able ranking member, \nSenator Boxer, will explain in some detail the D.C. portion of the \npending amendment and will be prepared to answer any inquiries which \nSenators may have.\n  Mr. President, hopefully we are nearing the conclusion of the Fiscal \nYear 1998 appropriations process. As I have stated, the pending \nsubstitute, if enacted, will complete action on the remaining three \nappropriation bills. Like last year, this has been a very difficult \nyear for the Appropriation Committees. These difficulties, however, \nlike in other recent years, are due largely to attempts to attach \ncontroversial legislative riders to appropriation bills. The delays in \nenacting the remaining appropriation bills are in no way attributable \nto the chairman or other members of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n  In his first year as chairman of the committee, Senator Stevens has \ncarried out his responsibilities in an outstanding manner. At every \nstep of the process, from the first meeting of the committee this year \nand throughout all of the hearings and markup sessions that he has \nchaired, he has shown not only great expertise and skill as it relates \nto all appropriation matters, but, just as importantly and, perhaps \nmore so, my distinguished friend and colleague from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, has unerringly displayed great patience and bipartisanship on \nevery occasion throughout this, his first year as chairman of the \ncommittee. I know that he would have preferred, as I would, to have the \nthirteen appropriation bills separately adopted and signed into law. \nBut at this late date, I support the chairman's decision and commend \nhim for bringing this proposal to the Senate that, if agreed to, will \nenable us to complete action on the remaining bills expeditiously.\n  It may well be that the House will be unable to agree with every \nrecommendation made in the pending substitute. If that is the case, the \nHouse may wish to ask for a conference with the Senate on the matter; \nor, the House could simply amend the Senate amendment and send the bill \nback to the Senate without the need for a conference. My point is, that \neven with the adoption of this proposal, we are not out of the woods. \nFurther action may be required by the Senate. But, I am convinced that \nif we proceed in the regular manner and continued separate conferences \non the Commerce/Justice/State and Foreign Operations Appropriations \nBills, and separately complete action in the Senate on the District of \nColumbia Appropriation Bills, and then conference with the House on it, \nwe may be in for several more weeks of controversy on these outstanding \nissues on the remaining appropriation bills. Furthermore, there is no \nassurance that these separate conferences would ever be able to \novercome the impasses which have developed and mired them down.\n  Mr. President, I want the Record to show that if given the \nopportunity to vote on these three appropriation bills separately, I \nwould have voted against passage of the conference report on the Fiscal \nYear 1998 Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill. At a time when we are \nunder continuing severe budgetary constraints on discretionary spending \nfor our nation's infrastructure--its highways and bridges, water and \nsewage treatment projects, education and other national priorities--I \nam opposed to providing appropriations for foreign countries at the \nsame or increasing levels year after year. For example, in my view, the \n$3 billion payment to Israel and $2 billion payment to Egypt should be \nreduced under the circumstances facing the nation. Even though we are \nachieving reductions in the Federal budget deficit, we nevertheless \nstill have a Federal debt exceeding $5.43 trillion and the interest on \nthat debt each year amounting to $251 billion.\n  I strongly urge all members to support the chairman of the committee, \nas well as the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant \nsubcommittees, in the proposal that is before the Senate, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call attention to the fact that we will \nfile a statement within 2 days following passage of the bill after the \nHouse has acted on the bill, or Congress as a\n\n[[Page S12261]]\n\nwhole. That will be printed as a document, to be a report for this bill \nthat combines these three appropriations bills.\n  The Senator from Michigan has 10 minutes. If he wants to use that \nnow, Mr. President, I would be pleased to yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I wish to speak in relationship to this legislation, and in favor in \nparticular of title II of the District of Columbia portion of this \nlegislation.\n  Title II incorporates an agreement reached recently between House and \nSenate negotiators to correct provisions in last year's immigration \nlaw. These provisions, as they were being interpreted by the Board of \nImmigration Appeals and others, would have had the effect of changing \nthe rules in the middle of the game for thousands of Central Americans \nand others who came to the United States because their lives and \nfamilies had been torn apart by war and oppression and are seeking \npermanent residency here. That violates the sense of fairness that is \nso much a part of the American character.\n  Mr. President, during the 1980s civil wars rocked Central America. \nThese civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala were of great \nimportance to the United States. They critically affected our national \nsecurity policy, as well as our conception of America's role in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  In 1979, the Sandinistas seized power from Anastasio Somoza. Upon \ngaining control of the state they carried out a program of land \nseizure, suppression of civil liberties, and other forms of oppression. \nThey also aligned themselves with the communist government of the \nSoviet Union. A number of groups formed, seeking to overthrow the \nSandinista regime, including some who had played an active role in the \noverthrow of Somoza on account of his civil liberties violations. These \ngroups ultimately were supported by the U.S. government and became \nknown as the Contras.\n  The Contras' cause ultimately met with success when, in a stunning \nupset, Violeta Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in national elections. \nBut the war, combined with a United States embargo on trade and a \nseries of natural disasters, ruined the economy and added to the unrest \nthat endangered many lives. Approximately 126,000 Nicaraguans fled \ntheir homeland, came to the United States, and applied for asylum \nbetween 1981 and 1991. That was a quarter of all our asylum \napplications during that time period.\n  During that same time, El Salvador experienced a brutal civil war \nwhich left tens of thousands dead. Over a quarter of the population \nwere driven from their homes. The economy was left in a shambles. Faced \nwith these terrible circumstances, and with continual danger for \nthemselves and their families, hundreds of thousands of Salvadoran made \ntheir way to the United States. They asked for asylum because they \nfeared death at the hands of the leftist guerrillas partially backed by \nthe Sandinistas in Nicaragua, or at the hands of the military and the \nextremist death squads. Between 1981 and 1991 approximately 126,000 of \nthese Salvadorans applied for asylum.\n  During the same era, Mr. President, the people of Guatemala faced \nsimilar tragic and extremely dangerous circumstances. Approximately \n42,000 of them made their way here and applied for asylum in the Untied \nStates.\n  A great many of the Central Americans who came here during this \nperiod received some form of encouragement or support from our \ngovernment for that decision. This started in 1979, when President \nCarter's Attorney General used his discretionary authority to protect \nrecent arrivals from Nicaragua by establishing an extended voluntary \ndeparture program for them. When that program expired, it was extended \nfurther through a variety of other congressional and administrative \nactions.\n  During the early to mid-1980s, Nicaraguans' claims for asylum had a \nhigh success rate, and very few were deported. That success rate began \nto decline toward the end of the decade. Recognizing the dangers \npresented by the civil war, however, the Reagan administration in 1987 \nestablished a special Nicaraguan Review Program. Based in part on a \nrecent Supreme Court decision bearing on the standard of proof for \nasylum, the NRP encouraged Nicaraguans to reapply for asylum under the \nnew standard, thereby providing an extra level of review to Nicaraguans \nwhose applications had been denied.\n  When Violeta Chamorro won the election in 1990, conditions in \nNicaragua began to change for the better and the Nicaraguan Review \nProgram began to dissipate. In the meantime, however, many of the \nNicaraguans had laid down strong roots here.\n  The Nicaraguan Review Program was officially ended in 1995. However, \nthe INS established a special phase out program under which Nicaraguans \ncould remain in the country an additional year and receive work \nauthorization. The work authorizations were again renewed in 1996.\n  There were a number of reasons for this phase out program. But one of \nits purposes, as expressly stated in agency documents, was to allow the \nNicaraguans who had laid down roots here to utilize the additional time \nto accrue the 7 years they would need to be eligible to adjust their \nstatus to legal residents under a procedure called ``suspension of \ndeportation.'' In one form or another, this relief has been in \nexistence for 40 years. In recent times, and until April 1 of this \nyear, it was available to anybody who had been here for 7 years, was of \ngood moral character, and whose deportation would cause extreme \nhardship to the person or his or her citizen or permanent resident \nimmediate family members.\n  The Salvadorans and Guatemalans likewise received special protection \nfrom U.S. government authorities. Their asylum claims received a less \nsympathetic hearing initially. As a result, the Salvadorans filed a \nclass suit, knows as the ``ABC''' class action, subsequently joined by \nthe Guatemalans, in which they challenged the way in which their asylum \napplications were being handled. President Bush's Administration \nsettled this suit by agreeing to readjudicate their claims, and in \norder to facilitate this Congress gave the class members a special \n``temporary protected status'' in the 1990 Immigration Act. That \ntemporary status was administratively extended in one way or another \nwhile the class members awaited their readjudications.\n  My point, Mr. President, is that during the 1980's people fearing \npersecution, fearing death squads, fearing disruptions of their \ncommunities, came to America and we took extraordinary measures to make \nit feasible for them to stay here, even if they had been denied asylum \nthrough the official asylum-seeking procedures.\n  At every step of the way, acts of Congress or acts of the executive \nbranch gave these refugees a very clear signal, that they would be able \nto remain if they played by the rules then in existence. An informal \nunderstanding developed that in the absence of some other mechanism \nbeing devised, suspension of deportation would be the means through \nwhich they would become permanent residents of this country.\n  That understanding was undermined when last year's immigration bill \nchanged the rules for suspension of deportation. There are good \narguments, Mr. President, indeed, I believe, arguments that would \nultimately prevail if tested in court, that those changes were not \nintended to operate retroactively. That, however, was not the view of \nsome of the leading sponsors of these changes, nor was it the initial \nview of the INS or the Board of Immigration Appeals. As a result, these \nCentral American refugees--as well as refugees from other countries in \nlike circumstances--face the realistic prospect that a retroactive \nchange in our laws might uproot them yet again.\n  I am happy to say that, under the negotiated arrangement with the \nHouse, this will not happen. The U.S. government will keep its word to \nCentral Americans.\n  Under the version of the legislation incorporated into this bill, \nNicaraguans who were in the United States prior to January 1, 1995 will \nbe permitted to adjust to permanent residence--and get green cards--if \nthey have maintained a continuous presence here. The same right will be \nextended to their Nicaraguan spouses and children.\n\n[[Page S12262]]\n\n  In addition, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans who either applied for \nasylum before 1990 or were members of the ABC class action suit settled \nwith the U.S. Government, as well as members of their families, will be \nentitled to receive a hearing on their claims for suspension or \nwithholding and adjustment under rules similar to those in effect prior \nto the 1996 immigration law. Nothing in the amendment precludes the \nGovernment from adapting those rules further to the special \ncircumstances of that class.\n  Similar relief will be available to those who fled communist regimes \nin Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by December 31, 1990, and \nfiled an asylum claim by December 31, 1991. They too will be able to \nseek suspension of deportation or withholding of removal under the \nrules similar to those in effect before passage of last year's law.\n  This relief also improves current law as applied to the members of \nthese groups in two other respects. First, members of these groups will \nbe eligible to have their cases adjudicated under the more generous \nrules whether or not they were in deportation proceedings as of the \neffective date of last year's immigration law. That makes good sense. \nThere is no reason to apply the more generous rules to someone who \nfiled an asylum application, lost on it, and was placed in deportation \nproceedings, while subjecting to the new rules someone who filed an \nasylum application at the same time and whose asylum claim has yet to \nbe adjudicated.\n  Second, none of these refugees will be subject to the 4,000 cap last \nyear's law placed on the number of adjustments that may be granted in \nany given fiscal year. Thus they will not have to wait in line for a \nnumber to become available before their application may finally be \nacted on. With Central Americans and Eastern Europeans being placed \noutside the cap, it is expected that the 4,000 ceiling will accommodate \nthe ordinary flow of successful applicants. Should there be more \nfavorable adjudications than 4,000 in any fiscal year, the legislation \nassumes the INS will continue with its present approach of only issuing \nconditional grants until a number becomes available. Thus no one who \nwould be the beneficiary of a favorable adjudication would be forced to \ndepart because of the cap's having been reached.\n  When the outlines of an agreement along these lines first emerged in \nthe House, it included a proposal to eliminate an entire category of \nlegal immigration, albeit a relatively small one, as the price for \nallowing these people to seek to stay under the rules they had been \ntold would apply to them. Under the final version of the agreement \nembodied in this amendment, there will be no elimination of any legal \nimmigration category. There will be a temporary reduction of no more \nthan 5,000 visas per fiscal year in the ``other workers'' employment-\nbased immigration category, but only after those now in the backlog \nreceive their visas. There will also be a temporary reduction of not \nmore than 5,000 visas per fiscal year in the Diversity visa program. \nThese temporary reductions will last until the cumulative total of \nthese reductions equals the number of Salvadorans and Guatemalans who \nultimately adjust to permanent residence. The numbers will be taken \nevenly out of the two categories.\n  The legislative process of necessity involves compromise. The version \nof this legislation before us today contains some provisions that were \nnot in Senator Mack's original proposal. I am quick to say I preferred \nthe original for that reason. First, while I think that temporary \nreductions in legal immigration categories are far superior to \nelimination of any, as the House originally proposed, I am not \npersuaded that we should be doing either. Moreover, since we have \ncurrent categories with unused visas, if we must turn anywhere to \n``borrow'' visas for these refugees, an approach that I feel is at odds \nwith our humanitarian traditions, I would prefer to borrow any unused \nvisas from the previous fiscal year before making any reductions.\n  Second, while the legislation makes clear that no retroactive change \nis to be made in the standards for suspension of deportation as applied \nto Central American, Eastern European, and Soviet asylum applicants, it \nalso makes clear that we are retroactively changing those standards for \neverybody else. I see no reason to do so. I have opposed the \nretroactive application of this provision to all individuals, \nregardless of their nationality. This is not because I take issue with \nthe objective I believe the House is seeking: to make it harder for \nsome people who have been abusing the rules by dragging out their \ndeportation proceedings in order to accrue the 7 years they need for \nsuspension of deportation. The problem is that the legislation does not \nand cannot distinguish between those who have been taking advantage of \nthis loophole and others who have done nothing wrong and who have been \nstuck in administrative backlogs through no fault of their own.\n  Retroactivity is particularly unjustified with respect to refugees \nfrom countries not covered by this compromise who have equities similar \nto those of the Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans. In recent \nyears, many people came to the United States under a legal or quasi-\nlegal status, fleeing tyrannical regimes that were either enemies of \nthe U.S. or allies whose domestic abuses were countenanced because of \nthe country's strategic significance in the struggle for world freedom \ngoing on at the time. The retroactivity may force some of these people \nto leave despite the roots they have laid down and the fact that the \nconditions they are returning to remain dangerous.\n  Despite these reservations, I support this agreement. On the whole it \nwill advance the cause of fairness and the promise that America will \nmake good on its commitments better than if we were to do nothing. It \nwill free a large number of people from the threat of immediate \ndeportation. It will allow some of them to adjust to legal status and \nassure others of a fair hearing on their effort to do so. Accordingly, \nMr. President, I urge adoption of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here, even though \nit is 7 o'clock on Sunday night, to finally finish up the D.C. \nappropriations bill. When Senator Faircloth and I started working \ntogether on this, it was way back in the summertime, and in September \nour bill, this D.C. appropriations bill, was voted out of committee.\n  It was very easy to do that because the mayor, the city council, the \ncontrol board, all agreed on the D.C. budget. We basically put it in \nthis bill and we followed on the authorizing committees which had \npassed the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government \nImprovement Act. So what we did was to carry forward the will of this \nCongress and the will of the people of D.C. as repleted by their \ncontrol board, their city council, and their mayor putting together a \nconsensus balanced budget.\n  That all was fine until we came to the floor and, of course, suddenly \nthis bill became a very attractive sort of Christmas tree, way before \nChristmas, and Senator Faircloth and I found ourselves looking at each \nother as the debate swirled around us on immigration, on school \nvouchers and other things that we really did not anticipate being a \npart of this bill.\n  The two of us had very much wanted to move it forward, and I was very \ncandid at the time that there were a couple of provisions in this bill \nthat I was not happy about because I did not think it showed enough \nrespect for the women of D.C. in terms of their right to choose and to \nthose who are seeking recognition of domestic partners, which I think \nis a local issue.\n  But I stated at that time that majority rules, and I was not going to \nhold up the bill because I did not agree with these things, and so we \nwere ready to move forward.\n  I am very pleased tonight that we have a resolution on the \nimmigration portion. It was a very legitimate issue that was raised by \nSenators Kennedy, Mack, and Graham, and I think Senator Abraham was \nvery eloquent on the point that there were in fact refugees who came \nfrom Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador, and Guatemala who were going to be \nthrown out of the country without any sort of hearing whatsoever. \nSenator Moseley-Braun has raised the issue of Haitians in a similar\n\n[[Page S12263]]\n\nsituation. Although this bill is silent on that, I think we have found \nother ways to handle her concerns. So it appears to me that we are on \nour way to having a bill for the people of Washington, DC, and the \nchildren of Washington, DC, who desperately deserve to have this bill \ncompleted.\n  The issue of vouchers was handled, I thought, in quite a diplomatic \nway, which was to remove it from this bill and send it forward to the \nPresident as a separate vehicle. I think that really is a way to \nresolve the problem which right now is very contentious on both sides.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not have any further comments to make at this \ntime. I stand ready with my colleague from North Carolina to vote on \nthis tonight. I understand we will voice vote it. I understand there \nare some colleagues who have other things they wish to discuss. I know \nSenator Wyden had a provision in the bill, which I strongly supported, \ndealing with the end of anonymous holds that we have had as a Senate \nprerogative around here. That appears to be an issue of contention that \nis no longer in the bill.\n  So at this time I retain the remainder of my time in case colleagues \ncome over and need it, but at this time I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, with the understanding that Senator Stevens is going \nto enter into a colloquy with Senator Wyden, I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nOregon as he wishes. I know he has a matter he wishes to discuss, and \nSenator Byrd and I have time so he can use whatever time of that he \nwishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He has been exceptionally kind to me as a new \nMember of the Senate. I thank him for yielding to me this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that I be \npermitted to offer my amendment to prohibit secret Senate holds which \nwas agreed to previously in the Senate D.C. appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, then in light of the time that the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee has kindly yielded to me, I should like \nto take a few minutes to describe why I think this issue is so \nimportant.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I spoke yesterday afternoon in this \nbody on the need to end Senate secrecy. Within an hour of my talk, \nthree of the most senior Members of the Senate came to me and said they \nhoped this amendment would prevail.\n  These three Members probably have an aggregate total of 60 years \nseniority in this body, and each of them told me that they had been \nfrustrated by instances of this hide-and-seek process that the Senate \nnow has with secret Senate holds.\n  Certainly most of the American people are not aware of what a hold \nis. But the fact of the matter is, it is now possible for any Member of \nthe U.S. Senate to unilaterally block the consideration of a bill or \nnomination from coming to this floor. It is an extraordinary power. It \nkeeps the U.S. Senate from even discussing a nomination or a particular \nbill. It is one thing to object to something, or plan to vote against \nsomething. But in the case of the secret Senate hold, one Member of the \nU.S. Senate, one Member, can block the consideration of a nomination or \nbill. And during these last days of a session, this power is not just \nextraordinary, it is essentially a veto. It is a power that is \nunbeatable.\n  I would just say to my colleagues that, as a new Member of the U.S. \nSenate, every day I am impressed by the greatness of this institution. \nAnd I don't think that the greatness of this institution will in any \nway be diminished if this body is open and accountable. I think that is \nwhy senior Members of the U.S. Senate have come to Senator Grassley and \nmyself and said, ``I hope you prevail on this.''\n  We are not seeking to block the right of a Senator to impose a hold. \nUnder what we have proposed, each Member of the U.S. Senate could still \nuse the hold, block the consideration of a nomination or bill. All we \nare saying is that it cannot be done behind closed doors. This Senate \nsecrecy doesn't smell right. It doesn't pass the smell test to the \nAmerican people. What Senator Grassley and I have proposed is that \nwithin 48 hours after a Member of the Senate informs the leadership \nthat he or she is going to put a hold on a bill, that be so noticed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  Recently there were more than 40 holds. Outside, much of the day, has \nbeen a group of people, outside the Chamber, simply trying to keep \ntrack of all the revolving holds, where a Senator imposes a hold for a \nshort period of time and then, in effect, another Senator comes along \nand imposes a hold again. Outside the Chamber throughout this day there \nhave been individuals trying to keep track of what is going on.\n  I would say to my colleagues, I subscribe to the not exactly radical \nnotion that public business is done in public. The use of this hold in \nthe last few days of a session is not just some small thing. It is an \nextraordinary power. It can affect millions of dollars. It can affect \nthe course of the judiciary and other key executive branch \nappointments. I am very concerned that at a time when the public is so \nskeptical and so cynical about Government, that this use of the secret \nhold simply feeds that cynicism. It contributes to the sense that the \nAmerican people have that so much in Washington, DC, is not on the \nlevel.\n  So, I am very grateful to Chairman Stevens for giving me this time to \nexplain my point of view. Senator Grassley and I have indicated that we \nwill be back. We will be back at the beginning of next session. I have \ntried for almost 15 months to get this issue before the U.S. Senate. \nThe fact is, it is most abused right at this time, which is why we saw \nlast week more than 40 holds. It was the subject of a hilarious press \nconference with the Senate minority leader, who said then that he \ncouldn't figure out where all the holds were coming from.\n  So Senator Grassley and I are not going to prevail tonight. I think \nthat is bad news for democracy. I think the secret hold cheapens the \ncurrency of democracy. But we will be back. We will be back until we \nmake this institution more open and accountable.\n  Senator Stevens has been kind to give me all this time to explain my \nviews. I appreciate that courtesy very much and I thank him for the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret that I have objected to the \namendment. I tell my friend from Oregon that the practice that he seeks \nto change is embedded in our rules; not in any law. During the period \nof time that I served here, 8 years as whip, Republican assistant \nleader, 4 years in the minority and 4 years in the majority, we had a \ndifferent way at that time of handling what is now known as a hold.\n  A hold is nothing more than an agreement of another Senator to object \non behalf of a Senator at the request of the second Senator to prevent \na unanimous consent agreement from coming into play. There is nothing \nin the rules about holds. It is a practice that has built up. To try to \npass a law to deal with a practice of the Senate--I would call to the \nattention of the Senator from Oregon, there is a law that Congress \ncannot sit in Washington after July 31st. It has been the law for many \nyears.\n  We will not change the practices of Senate by law. What we have to do \nis get some rule changes, or a standing order that would apply to \nSenators. But the issue is whether a Senator in each instance, in this \ncase whether the leaders, may object on behalf of a Senator who says, \n``I want to object and I may not be there at the time the subject comes \nup, and I want you to object for me.'' That is known as a hold today.\n  When I first came to the Senate there was an official objectors' \ncommittee. It was unofficial in that sense, but on each side they had \ntwo or three Senators who agreed to be on the floor. At any time, one \nof them was here. And they objected to unanimous consent requests if \nthey had been requested to do so by Members.\n\n[[Page S12264]]\n\n  It later became a prerogative of the leadership to do that. I think I \nwould have to rely on my friend from West Virginia to give the complete \nhistory of it. I do not have the memory that he has. But I can assure \nyou that he will instruct us one of these days about the history of \nthis practice.\n  But I do regret having to object. I understand what the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from Iowa are trying to do. I wish them success, \nbecause I find holds to be very burdensome to deal with, whether it's \nfrom the leadership point of view or the point of view of a chairman of \na committee.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the chairman yield briefly for just a moment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Just for a few minutes, because I agreed to go to dinner \nwith my wife tonight. If the Senator will be short, I will be glad to \nyield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman. Far be it from me to interfere with \nthat.\n  First, I thank the chairman for his courtesy and say I would very \nmuch like to work with him, to get this practice changed. I have, in \nfact, spent a considerable amount of time with Senator Byrd on this. He \nwas very helpful as well.\n  I would finally say to the chairman that with respect to this matter \nof courtesy, I and Senator Grassley have no concern about that. Of \ncourse the hold, if we are talking about a few days or a few hours as a \ncourtesy, is not what is at issue. It is when a Senator digs in to try \nto block a bill that there ought to be some public disclosure.\n  But to me the chairman has been very helpful, not just on matters \nfrom our committee like Internet and the like, but generally. I want to \ntell him I am very interested in working with him on it because I think \nthis is an opportunity to keep the greatness of this institution and \nstill make it more open and democratic. I thank him for all the time.\n\n\n                       central american refugees\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this appropriations bill contains \nimmigration provisions to provide much-needed protection from \ndeportation for Central American refugee families and an opportunity \nfor permanent residence in the United States under our immigration \nlaws.\n  This legislation is an important step, and I commend Senator Mack and \nSenator Graham for their extraordinary work and leadership in helping \nthese refugee families and for bringing this issue before the Senate.\n  I deeply regret, however, that these provisions don't go far enough. \nLast year, Congress changed the rules and broke the faith with \nthousands of refugee families from Central America and Haiti who fled \ncivil war, death squads, and oppression. They found safe haven in \nAmerica, and they have contributed significantly to the United States \nand to communities across the country.\n  They were allowed to remain in the United States under bipartisan \nimmigration rules established by President Reagan, affirmed by \nPresident Bush, and reaffirmed by President Clinton.\n  But last year, the Republican Congress withdrew the welcome mat. Now, \nthese deserving families who have suffered so much are suddenly faced \nwith deportation. They had been promised their day in court, but that \nday has been unfairly denied.\n  This legislation is a frank admission by the Senate that last year's \nimmigration law treated these families unfairly, and that something \nmust be done to correct this grave injustice.\n  But instead of correcting the injustice for all refugees, Republicans \nnow propose to pick and choose among their favorite Latino groups, and \ndeny any relief to Haitian refugees at all.\n  Republicans want a blanket amnesty for Nicaraguans and Cubans, but \nfar less for Salvadorans and Guatemalans who also faced oppression and \ncivil war.\n  They also provide protection from deportation for Eastern European \nrefugees, but nothing for those who fled for their lives from Haiti\n  The Republican proposal is unjust and shamefully discriminatory. \nThese refugee groups faced similar circumstances and have a similar \nhistory. First the Reagan administration, then the Bush administration, \nand then the Clinton administration assured them that they could apply \nto remain permanently in the United States under our immigration laws. \nUnder those laws at that time, if they have lived here for at least 7 \nyears and are of good moral character, and if a return to Central \nAmerica or Haiti will be an unusual hardship, they are allowed to \nremain.\n\n  Last year's immigration law eliminated this opportunity for these \nfamilies by changing the standard for humanitarian relief. It said the \nfamilies had to live here for 10 years, not just 7, to qualify to \nremain. It created a much higher standard for proving that their \nremoval from the United States would pose a great hardship to the \nfamily. It limited the number of persons who could get relief from \ndeportation to only 4,000 per year. All other families would be \ndeported, even if they otherwise qualified for relief under this \nprogram.\n  Americans across the political spectrum have called on Congress to \nensure that the rules are not changed unfairly for these families. \nPresident Clinton has urged Congress to give them the day in court they \nhave been promised for the past decade.\n  They include people such as Zulema, who fled to Miami in 1986 to \nescape civil war. Her husband and four children are all legal permanent \nresidents of the United States. They have their green cards. Two of the \nchildren are now serving in the U.S. Army and have been stationed in \nBosnia. But Zulema still does not have her green card and faces \ndeportation.\n  Her family escaped war and persecution. They rebuilt their lives in \nAmerica. Her children have put their lives on the line in Bosnia in \nservice of their adopted country. It is unfair to suddenly change the \nrules and deport their mother.\n  Roberto, age 6, was abandoned by his parents in El Salvador during \nthat country's tragic civil war. He came to the United States and was \nraised here by his aunt, who is an American citizen. Today, he is 18 \nyears old and a freshman at Middlebury College in Vermont. He is an \nhonors student planning a career in medicine. His only memories of El \nSalvador are of the war. He does not even know if his parents are still \nalive. Roberto, too, faces deportation.\n  These are the kinds of persons we are talking about. They have played \nby the rules laid down by both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. They have obeyed the law. They have made worthwhile \ncontributions to our communities. In fact, the assistant manager of \nDade County in Florida estimates that Dade County would lose $1 billion \nin revenue if these families are forced to leave.\n\n  But while offering assistance to Central American refugee families, \nthe provisions of this amendment contain troublesome inequities that \ncannot be ignored.\n  The Republican bill provides for case-by-case consideration of the \napplications of refugees from El Salvador or Guatemala. Under current \nINS practices, less than half of those eligible to apply are expected \nto get their green cards. But refugees from Nicaragua and Cuba get a \nblanket amnesty.\n  Refugees from all four countries fled violent civil wars, death \nsquads, rogue militias, and violations of their basic rights. Their \nfamilies suffered persecution and death threats. Once here, they \nfollowed the rules laid out by our Government. But now, one group gets \ngreen cards--no questions asked--while the other is considered only on \na case-by-case basis.\n  I am also concerned that this legislation does not also help refugees \nfrom Haiti. In the Bush administration--and again in the Clinton \nadministration--Haitian refugees, like Central Americans, were granted \ntemporary haven in America from the rampant persecution and violence in \nHaiti. Many Haitians risked their lives by opposing the forces of \noppression in their country and standing up for democracy and freedom. \nYet, this amendment does nothing for these deserving families. They \ndeserve their day in court, too.\n  Congress should act on behalf of these Haitian families too, and I \nhope we will do so before the session ends.\n  Once again, I commend Senator Mack and Senator Graham for their \nleadership on this important issue.\n  I regret, however, that the Republican leadership did not see fit to \nallow us to offer amendments to ensure equal treatment for all Central \nAmerican and Haitian refugees.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my thanks to the chairman and ranking member\n\n[[Page S12265]]\n\nfor their hard work on the District of Columbia appropriations bill and \nfor working with me on an amendment of vital importance to the children \nand families of the District. I am very pleased that they have agreed \nto accept my amendment which would allow the District to increase the \nnumber of monitors and inspectors responsible for upholding safety and \nquality standards in day-care centers and home-care operations across \nthe city.\n  Mr. President, in early October we all had the occasion to read an \nextremely troubling article on the front page of the Washington Post. \nAs part of a series on welfare reform implementation, the Post \ndiscussed the deplorable and unsafe conditions at many District day-\ncare facilities. Many of the problems could be traced to the fact that \nthe people and resources dedicated to overseeing child care centers in \nthe District are woefully inadequate.\n  We learned that of the approximately 350 public day-care centers in \nthe District of Columbia, more than half are operating without proper \nlicenses. The primary inspection agency has been without a supervisor \nfor almost a year and a half. There are only five inspectors charged \nwith issuing and enforcing licenses to District child care centers, and \nonly three people in charge of certifying which centers should be \neligible for public funds. Those who are clearly suffering as a result \nare the children, far too many of whom are spending their days in an \nenvironment where they are unstimulated, uncared for, and even in \nmortal danger.\n  The availability and regulation of quality day-care centers and home-\ncare operations in the District and across the country is a crucial \ncomponent of successful welfare reform. Simply put, welfare reforms \nwill not succeed unless moms and dads across the country have a safe \nplace to leave their children while they are out earning paychecks.\n  Not only that, welfare reform has and will continue to increase \ngreatly the demand for day-care slots. In the District alone, it is \npredicted that 4,000 additional slots will be needed to accommodate the \nschedules of working parents. That number mirrors the situation in the \ncity of Milwaukee in my home State of Wisconsin. As more, new child \ncare centers spring up to meet this new demand, tough, consistent \nlicensing standards, applied and enforced by an adequate number of \ninspectors, are essential to avoiding more tragedies like we are \nwitnessing in the District.\n\n  I am a supporter of welfare reform because I believe the family is \nstrengthened by work. But that premise is destroyed--and the success of \ntrue reform, jeopardized--if we force parents to choose between work \nand the basic safety of their children. As a society, we have a \nresponsibility to help American families become independent, unified, \nand strong by moving them off welfare and into the workplace. As a \npeople, we have a moral duty to ensure that children of those families \nare safe and nurtured while their parents work. We will have crippled \nmore than just welfare reform if, because of inadequate attention to \nthe quality of child care in this country, we force parents to turn \ntheir children over to dangerous, deplorable child care situations.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate has agreed to incorporate my \namendment into the spending legislation for the District of Columbia. \nObviously, this is a crisis situation which the additional staff will \nhelp address.\n  That said, much more needs to be done. This problem goes way beyond a \nquestion of mere staffing numbers. As such, in addition to this \namendment, the chairman and I will be writing a letter to the Control \nBoard to ensure that oversight and proper licensing and enforcement of \nsafety and quality regulations by District agencies is an integral part \nof the comprehensive management reform plans scheduled to be unveiled \nin December.\n  Specifically, we will press the Control Board on procedures for day-\ncare center and home day-care licensing, rates of inspection, the \neffectiveness of safety and quality standards at day-care centers and \nhome day-cares, the effectiveness of public subsidy and case referral \nservices in the District day-care system, the effectiveness of the \ncurrent system of public oversight of day-care center and home day-care \noperations as conducted by the Department of Consumer and Regulatory \nAffairs and the Department of Human Services, and appropriate staffing \nlevels at these agencies.\n  Again, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to my amendment. I \nconsider it to be one of many steps we need to take on this very \nimportant issue. I look forward to working with the District on finding \nsolutions to this and other pressing problems relating to the quality \nof life in our Nation's Capital.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12258-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12265-S12271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS FUNDING\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise for two brief colloquies with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I first want to \nbring to the distinguished chairman's attention some confusion \nregarding the committee's intent for approximately $6 million of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers' budget. This money was intended to fund a very \nimportant project in Washington State. Unfortunately, we have been \ninformed by the local Corps of Engineers office that without more \nspecific direction from Congress, the agency cannot spend these funds. \nThe Senate accepted the House position on this project, which was to \nprovide $6 million for the Corps of Engineers to extend the south jetty \nat the Grays Harbor project to provide a permanent solution to the \nongoing erosion problem. Would the chairman agree that my description \nof where these funds will be spent is consistent with the Conference \nCommittee's intention?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. The conference committee intends \nfor the $6 million to be allocated to extend the south jetty at the \nGrays Harbor project to provide a permanent solution to the ongoing \nerosion problem\n  Mr. GORTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My second colloquy pertains to \nan additional $2 million from the Corps budget that should be allocated \nto dredge, monitor, and maintain the channel to determine the potential \nfor cost effective maintenance near the Willapa River. Regrettably, the \ndirection that our committee gave the Corps did not adequately \ndistinguish between two phases of the Willapa Project. The first phase, \nwhich called for beach nourishment to protect the highway from wave \nerosion has been completed. The second phase, calling for channel \ndredging, monitoring and maintenance, has yet to be started. It was the \noriginal intention of the project proponents that the $2 million \nallocated for this project be directed to its second phase. The local \noffice of the Corps of Engineers has indicated that it can spend the \nfunds appropriately, provided it be given the necessary direction by \nCongress. Mr. chairman, given this misunderstanding, do you have any \nobjection to the Corps using these funds for this purpose?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection to the Corps using the funds for \nthat purpose. We have allocated significant funding for these projects \nand it is very important to ensure the funds are not wasted on needs \nwhich have already been addressed.\n  Mr. GORTON. Thank you very much for the clarification, Mr. chairman. \nI greatly appreciate the Chairman's efforts on these two projects which \naddress important economic, environmental, and public safety needs in \nsouthwest Washington. I also want to commend the chairman of the Energy \nand Water subcommittee, Senator Domenici, whose efforts were crucial to \nsecuring the necessary funds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Would the Chairman yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Of course.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman for his \nhard work on this bill and for his clarification here today. These \nprojects will accomplish a great deal for two communities in southwest \nWashington state and I appreciate his hard work, as well as that of the \nsubcommittee chairman's.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section by \nsection analysis of Title II of the D.C. appropriations portion of the \nomnibus appropriations bill be printed at this point in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12266]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Explanatory Memorandum Regarding Title II of The D.C. Appropriations \n Potion of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill Submitted by Messrs. Mack, \n                  Graham, Abraham, Kennedy, and Durbin\n\n\n                          purposes of the bill\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that nationals of \n     certain specified countries who fled civil wars and other \n     upheavals in their home countries and sought refuge in the \n     United States, as well as designated family members, are \n     accorded a fair and equitable opportunity to demonstrate \n     that, under the legal standards established by this Act, they \n     should be permitted to remain, and pursue permanent resident \n     status, in the United States.\n       In recognition of the hardship that those eligible for \n     relief suffered in fleeing their homelands and the delays and \n     uncertainty that they have experienced in pursuing legal \n     status in the United States, the Congress directs the \n     Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service to adjudicate applications for relief under this Act \n     expeditiously and humanely.\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section analysis\n\n     Section 201--Short title\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nicaraguan Adjustment and \n     Central American Relief Act.''\n     Section 202--Adjustment of status of certain Nicaraguans and \n         Cubans\n       This section provides for Nicaraguans and Cubans who came \n     to the United States before December 1, 1995 and have been \n     continuously present since that time to adjust to the status \n     of permanent residents provided they make application to do \n     so before April 1, 2000. The Act also extends this benefit to \n     the spouses, children, or unmarried sons or daughters of \n     those individuals. This portion of the Act is modeled on the \n     Cuban Adjustment Act.\n     Section 203--Modification of certain transition rules\n       Section 203 of the bill modifies the transition rules \n     established in Section 309 of the Illegal Immigration and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (``IIRIRA''), Public Law \n     No. 104-208; division C; 110 Stat. 3009-627.\n       Section 203(a) amends the transition rule governing \n     eligibility for suspension of deportation for those who were \n     in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of April 1, 1997, \n     the effective date of IIRIRA. Under the rules in effect \n     before then, on otherwise eligible person could qualify for \n     suspension of deportation if he or she had been continuously \n     physically present in the United States for seven years, \n     regardless of whether or when the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service had initiated deportation proceedings \n     against the person through the issuance of an order to show \n     cause (``OSC'') to that person. As a result, people were able \n     to accrue time toward the seven-year continuous physical \n     presence requirement after they already had been placed in \n     deportation proceedings.\n       IIRIRA changed that rule to bar additional time for \n     accruing after receipt of a ``notice to appear,'' the new \n     document the Act created to begin ``removal'' proceedings, \n     the repatriation mechanism IIRIRA substituted for deportation \n     and exclusion proceedings. Over a strong dissent, a majority \n     of the Board of Immigration Appeals in Mater of N-J-B- \n     interpreted IIRIRA Section 309(c)(5) to apply not only \n     prospectively in removal cases initiated by means of this new \n     document but also retroactively to those who were in \n     exclusion or deportation proceedings initiated by an order to \n     show cause. On July 10, 1997 Attorney General Reno vacated \n     and took under review the BIA's decision in Matter of N-J-B-.\n       Section 203(a) generally codifies the majority decision in \n     Matter of N-J-B- by stating explicitly that orders to show \n     cause have the same ``stop time'' effect as notices to \n     appear. Excepted from retroactive application of the ``stop \n     time'' rule are (1) those whose cases are terminated and \n     reinitiated pursuant to IIRIRA Section 309(c)(3); and (2) \n     those who, based on their special circumstances, are eligible \n     for relief from repatriation under this Act, as described \n     below.\n       As defined in Section 203(a) of the Act (amending IIRIRA \n     Section 309(c)(5)), those who are eligible for relief under \n     the Act (referred to hereinafter as ``Eligible Class \n     Members'') include:\n       Salvadorans who entered the United States on or before \n     September 19, 1990 and who, on or before October 31, 1991, \n     either registered for benefits under the settlement agreement \n     in American Baptist Churches, et al. v. Thornburgh, 760 F. \n     Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (the ``ABC Settlement'') or \n     applied for temporary protected status.\n       Guatemalans who entered the United States on or before \n     October 1, 1990 and registered for benefits under the ABC \n     Settlement.\n       Salvadorns and Guatemalans not included in the foregoing \n     groups but who applied for asylum on or before April 1, 1990.\n       Nationals of the Soviet Union (or any of its successor \n     republics), Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, \n     Czechoslovakia (or its successor republics), Romania, \n     Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, East Germany and Yugoslavia (or \n     its successor republics) who entered the United States on or \n     before December 31, 1990 and applied for asylum on or before \n     December 1991.\n       Under Section 203(a) of the bill, the foregoing Eligible \n     Class Members may pursue and be granted suspension of \n     deportation or cancellation of removal without having their \n     continuous physical presence in the United States terminated \n     as of the date of service of an order to show cause or notice \n     to appear. As Section 203(a)'s amendment to section \n     309(c)(5)(C)(i) of IIRIRA makes clear, these class members \n     are eligible for this treatment even if they were not in \n     proceedings on or before April 1, 1997.\n       Also eligible for relief from repatriation under this Act \n     are those who, at the time an Eligible Class Member is \n     granted relief from repatriation under this Act, are either \n     (1) the spouse or child (as defined in Section 101(b)(1) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act) of such person; or (2) \n     the unmarried son or daughter of such person, provided that, \n     if the unmarried son or daughter is 21 years of age or older \n     when the parent is granted relief under this Act, the son or \n     daughter must establish that he or she entered the United \n     States on or before October 1, 1990.\n       Those who otherwise would be eligible for relief but have \n     been convicted of an aggravated felony (as defined in Section \n     101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) are not \n     eligible for relief. Moreover, those deemed ineligible for \n     relief under this Act may not seek judicial review of this \n     decision.\n       Section 203(b) of the bill adds a new subsection (f) to the \n     IIRIRA Section 309 transition rules. Under this new \n     provision, Eligible Class Members who were not in exclusion \n     or deportation proceedings as of April 1, 1997 may apply for \n     cancellation of removal--the relief from repatriation \n     replacing ``suspension of deportation,'' which was available \n     under the pre-IIRIRA rules--and adjustment to permanent \n     resident status under a special set of standards, subject to \n     the following limitations:\n       Generally speaking, Eligible Class Members will be eligible \n     for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status if they \n     can establish that: (1) they have been physically present in \n     the United States for a continuous period of seven years \n     immediately preceding the date of application for relief; (2) \n     they have been of good moral character during that period; \n     and (3) removal would result in ``extreme hardship'' to the \n     person or to a spouse, parent or child who is either a \n     U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\n       Those who are inadmissible or deportable because of certain \n     offenses--including engaging in certain activities \n     threatening U.S. national security (8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 212(a)(3), 237(a)(4)); conviction of an aggravated \n     felony at any time after admission (8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii); or participating in the persecution \n     of others (8 U.S.C. Sec. 241(b)(3)(B)(ii))--are ineligible \n     for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status.\n       Those who are inadmissible or deportable because of certain \n     other offenses--including engaging in specified criminal \n     activity (8 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 212(a)(2), 237(a)(2)); or \n     failure to comply with certain INS rules, including engaging \n     in document fraud (8 U.S.C. Sec. 237(a)(3))--are eligible for \n     cancellation of removal and adjustment of status if they can \n     establish that (1) they have been physically present in the \n     United States for a continuous period of ten years \n     immediately following the event that otherwise would \n     constitute a ground for removal; (2) they have been a person \n     of good moral character during that period; and (3) removal \n     would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to \n     the person or to a spouse, parent or child who is either a \n     U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\n       These standards generally echo the standards for suspension \n     of deportation that had been in effect until IIRIRA. Nothing \n     in these standards is intended to preclude the Attorney \n     General from adapting the procedures under which Eligible \n     Class Members' applications for cancellation or suspension \n     are to be adjudicated in a manner appropriate to the \n     circumstances of the individuals whose cases are before her. \n     These cases have already been drawn out enough as a result of \n     the uncertainties about the applicable standard brought about \n     by the changes to the law made by IIRIRA and uncertainties \n     about the meaning of those changes.\n       In particular, given the special solicitude Congress is \n     showing toward the Eligible Class Members by enacting this \n     legislation in large measure to see to it that their claims \n     are fairly adjudicated, it would, for example, be entirely \n     consistent with that intent for the Attorney General to \n     direct INS attorneys to consider the special hardships \n     undergone by them and the fragile economic and political \n     conditions in their home countries as relevant to the extreme \n     hardship determination. For this reason, it would also be \n     appropriate for the Attorney General not to challenge \n     applications for relief by Eligible Class Members on hardship \n     grounds if the applicant satisfies the seven-year presence \n     and good moral character requirements. This would be similar \n     to the approach taken by President Bush in the context of the \n     review of asylum applications by Chinese nationals based on \n     China's policy of forced abortion and coerced sterilization. \n     See November 30, 1989 Memorandum of Disapproval signed by \n     President Bush; December 1, 1989 and January 4, 1990 \n     cables from INS Commissioner Gene McNary to all field \n     offices (File CO 243.69-P); Executive Order 12711 (April \n     11, 1990); 55 Fed. Reg. 13897 (April 13, 1990). More \n     generally, it would be entirely consistent with \n     Congressional intent for the Attorney General to establish \n     procedures that keep to a minimum the burdens an applicant \n     of good\n\n[[Page S12267]]\n\n     character has to shoulder in order to qualify for relief, \n     both in terms of the paperwork the applicant has to \n     complete and the showings the applicant has to make.\n       In addition to recognizing the special circumstances to \n     which the ABC class members have been subjected, application \n     of the foregoing approach would greatly reduce the need for \n     protracted analysis of the more subjective aspects of the \n     suspension standard, thereby reducing the administrative \n     burden on the Immigration and Naturalization Service and \n     minimizing further delays in according relief to these \n     individuals. Adoption of such an approach would be entirely \n     consistent with Congress' intentions in adopting this \n     legislation, and with its interest in seeing to it that any \n     future difficulties these people may experience in getting a \n     final resolution of their status here to be kept to a \n     minimum.\n       Section 203(c) of the bill permits Eligible Class Members \n     previously placed in deportation or removal proceedings who \n     claim eligibility for relief from repatriation under the Act \n     to file a single motion to reopen such proceedings to pursue \n     relief from repatriation; such relief might otherwise have \n     been barred on procedural grounds. The Attorney General must \n     designate a time period not greater than 240 days within \n     which motions to reopen must be filed; the time period must \n     begin within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act. \n     We note that because a number of the Eligible Class Members \n     arrived in this country with no understanding of the court \n     system and no English, some may have had court proceedings \n     initiated against them and been tried in absentia. Others \n     were minors too young to remember that they had been in \n     immigration court. As a result they may not know that they \n     have final orders of deportation entered against them. We \n     encourage all elements of the Department of Justice and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to work to facilitate \n     making that information available to these individuals, \n     including by affirmatively serving notice on Eligible Class \n     Members subject to such orders. We also note that nothing \n     herein prevents the Attorney General from adopting an \n     approach to the deadlines set out here consistent with \n     application of ordinary tolling principles. Finally, we note \n     that if an Eligible Class Member files a motion to reopen and \n     it is determined that the applicant would qualify for some \n     other form of relief, such as adjustment on the basis of an \n     approved visa with a current priority date, that could be \n     adjudicated far more easily than a suspension application, \n     that relief may be granted instead.\n       Section 203(d) establishes certain temporary reductions in \n     the number of visas made available in the ``other workers'' \n     and ``diversity'' immigration categories. Beginning in FY \n     1999, up to 5,000 fewer visas shall be made available on an \n     annual basis in the diversity category. A similar annual \n     reduction shall be made in the ``other workers'' category, \n     but that reduction shall not begin to be made until everyone \n     with an approved petition for a visa in this category as of \n     the date of enactment of the Act has had a visa made \n     available to him or her. The total reduction in the visas \n     issued under these two categories shall equal the total \n     number of individuals described in subclauses I, II, III, and \n     IV of section 309(c)(5)(C) of IIRIRA, as amended by this Act, \n     who are granted cancellation of removal or suspension of \n     deportation under the Act. Each category shall absorb half of \n     the reductions.\n     Section 204--Limitation on cancellations of removal and \n         suspensions of deportation\n       IIRIRA established a 4,000-person annual limit on the \n     Attorney General's ability to grant relief from repatriation. \n     Eligible Class Members and designated family members, as well \n     as those who were in deportation proceedings as of April 1, \n     1997 and who applied for suspension of deportation under INA \n     Section 244(a)(3) (as in effect before IIRIRA), are excepted \n     from this annual limit.\n       These exceptions to the 4,000-person limit having been \n     made, it is expected that that limit should accommodate the \n     remaining annual flow of successful suspension and \n     cancellation applications. Should that projection prove \n     erroneous, however, nothing in this Act is intended to \n     prevent the Attorney General and those adjudicating \n     suspension or cancellation applications on her behalf from \n     pursuing the course that she has been following to this time \n     of entering provisional grants of suspension or cancellation \n     of deportation but postponing a final decision on the \n     application until a slot becomes available. In no case is it \n     Congress's intent that an otherwise meritorious application \n     should be finally denied, and the applicant deported or \n     removed, because the 4,000-person limit has been reached.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this legislation. \nIncluded within this appropriations bill is historic legislation, \nproduced on a bipartisan basis in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nregarding the institutional structure of, and funding for, American \nforeign policy. This important legislation to reorganize the foreign \npolicy agencies of the U.S. Government and authorize the payment of \nU.S. arrearages to the United Nations is similar to a bill approved by \nthe Senate last June by a vote of 90-5. Unfortunately, the bill which \nthe Senate overwhelmingly approved has been bogged down in conference \nwith the other body over an issue which has no relevance to this bill.\n  I am therefore grateful to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, for \nagreeing to include provisions of our legislation in this bill.\n  I can assure my colleagues that the decision to include the \nauthorization bill in an appropriations bill was not taken lightly. The \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and I \nsought to do so after careful consultation with the Senate leadership. \nBut because two major elements of this bill are so critical to American \nforeign policy, the Chairman and I believed that we could not afford to \ndelay this bill until next year. I hope my colleagues will agree.\n  Specifically, the bill addresses two important issues which were the \nfocus of much heated debate in the last Congress. First, the bill \nprovides for the payment of U.S. back dues to the United Nations, \ncontingent on specific reforms by that body. Second, the bill \nestablishes a framework for the reorganization of the U.S. foreign \npolicy agencies which is consistent with the plan announced by the \nPresident last April.\n  Importantly, the bill also contains sufficient funds to restore our \ndiplomatic readiness, which has been severely hampered in recent years \nby deep reductions in the foreign affairs budget. The funding levels in \nthe bill largely mirror the Fiscal 1998 budget request submitted by the \nClinton administration. The wide support in this Congress for providing \nincreased funding for foreign affairs is an important achievement, and \nreverses a troubling trend of the past few years.\n  Although the cold war has ended, the need for American leadership in \nworld affairs has not. Our diplomats often represent the front line of \nour national defense; with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence \noverseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic \ncapability has become all the more important. Despite the reduction in \nour military presence abroad, the increased importance of ``diplomatic \nreadiness'' to our Nation's security has not been reflected in the \nFederal budget.\n  The increase in foreign affairs funding contained in this bill could \nnot have come too soon. According to a report prepared at my request by \nthe Congressional Research Service earlier this year, foreign policy \nspending is now at its lowest level in 20 years. Stated in fiscal 1998 \ndollars, the budget in fiscal 1997 was $18.77 billion, which is 25 \npercent below the annual average of $25 billion over the past two \ndecades, and 30 percent below the level of 10 years ago, near the end \nof the Reagan administration. In fiscal 1997, such funding was just 1.1 \npercent of the Federal budget--the lowest level in the past 20 years \nand about one-third below the historical average.\n  I should remind my colleagues that the bill is truly a bipartisan \nproduct. It began with negotiations involving the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Clinton administration early in the year. The Senate \nsubsequently passed that bill overwhelmingly in June, by a vote of 90-\n5. Since that time, several changes have been made as a result of the \nconference deliberations with our House counterparts and negotiations \nwith the Clinton administration. These were also undertaken in a spirit \nof bipartisanship. Because of these changes, I am confident that the \nbill will be acceptable to the President.\n  Enactment of this bill will mark another important milestone in \nreestablishing a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy. Like our \npredecessors five decades ago, we stand at an important moment in \nhistory.\n  After the Second World War, a bipartisan and farsighted group of \nsenators, led by Chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committee such as \nThomas Connally and Arthur Vandenberg, worked with the Truman \nadministration to construct a post-war order. The institutions created \nat that time--the United Nations, the World Bank, the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--are still \nwith us today, but the task of modernizing these institutions to make \nthem relevant to our times is just beginning.\n  For example, the Clinton administration and the Senate are \ncooperating on\n\n[[Page S12268]]\n\nthe first significant expansion of NATO--an expansion to the east which \nwill encompass three former adversaries in Central Europe. The Foreign \nRelations Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Helms, has \ninitiated a series of hearings on the proposed enlargement of NATO, \nsetting the stage for what I hope will be successful amendment to the \nWashington Treaty next spring. Similarly, this legislation now before \nus calls for significant reforms of the United Nations, an important \ninstrument in American foreign policy which has become crippled both by \ngrowing U.S. arrearages and an unwillingness within that body to \nreform. Enactment of this legislation will be an important step forward \nin resolving both those problems.\n  Just as we are trying to revise and reenergize international \ninstitutions, we must reorganize our own foreign policy institutions. \nTwo years ago, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee put \nforward a far-reaching plan to consolidate our major foreign affairs \nagencies--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the United \nStates Information Agency (USIA), and the Agency for International \nDevelopment--within the Department of State. In the context of an \nelection cycle, it was perhaps inevitable that the Congress and the \nPresident would not come to agreement on it.\n  But continued stalemate was not inevitable. With the onset of a new \npresidential term and the appointment of a new Secretary of State, a \nwindow of opportunity to revisit the issue was opened. The Chairman, to \nhis credit, took advantage of this window by urging the new Secretary \nof State, Madeleine Albright, to take a second look at the \nreorganization issue. And, to her credit, the Secretary did so; the \nresult was the reorganization plan announced by the President in April. \nUnder the proposal, two agencies--ACDA and USIA--will be merged into \nthe State Department. The Agency for International Development will \nremain an independent agency, but it will be placed under the direct \nauthority of the Secretary of State.\n  The legislation now before the Senate closely reflects the \nPresident's proposal. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will be \nmerged into the State Department no later than October 1, 1998, and the \nU.S. Information Agency will be merged no later than October 1, 1999. \nAs with the President's plan, the Agency for International Development \nwill remain a separate agency, but it will be placed under the direct \nauthority of the Secretary of State. And, consistent with the \nPresident's proposal to seek improved coordination between the regional \nbureaus in State and AID, the Secretary of State will have the \nauthority to provide overall coordination of assistance policy.\n  The bill puts flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard \nto international broadcasting. The President's plan was virtually \nsilent on this question, stating only that the ``distinctiveness and \neditorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting \nagencies would be preserved.'' This bill upholds and protects that \nprinciple by maintaining the existing government structure established \nby Congress in 1994 in consolidating all U.S. government-sponsored \nbroadcasting--the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV--under the \nsupervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors. Importantly, however, the Board and the broadcasters below \nthem will not be merged into the State Department, where their \njournalistic integrity would be greatly at risk.\n  With regard to the United Nations provision, the bill provides $926 \nmillion in arrearage payments to the Union Nations over a period of 3 \nyears contingent upon the U.N. achieving specific reforms. This will \nallow us to pay all U.S. arrears to the U.N. regular budget, all \narrears to the peacekeeping budget, nearly all arrears to the U.N. \nspecialized agencies, and all arrears to other international \norganizations.\n  It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of this achievement. \nWe are finally in a position to lay to rest the perennial dispute over \nour unpaid dues that has severely complicated relations between the \nUnited Nations and the United States. This bill would give our \ndiplomats the leverage they need to push through meaningful reforms \nthat promise to make the U.N. a more capable institution.\n  Two important changes were made to the legislation that cleared the \nSenate last June. First, the bill now allows the crediting of $107 \nmillion owed to the U.S. by the U.N. against our arrears. Second, it \ngives the administration added flexibility by allowing the Secretary of \nState to waive two conditions. The waiver will not apply to the \nreduction of assessment rates or the establishment of inspectors-\ngeneral in the specialized agencies. But report language will make a \nclear commitment that Congress would, if necessary, consider on an \nexpedited basis a waiver on the condition for a 20 percent assessment \nrate for the U.N. regular budget.\n  Of course, not everyone is happy with the agreements the Chairman, \nSenator Helms, and I worked out. Some would have preferred to see no \nconditions at all attached to the payment of our debts. Others are \nunhappy that the United States is paying any arrears whatsoever.\n  I think it is fair to say that the Chairman and I approached this \nissue from two very different points of view. I make no excuses for my \nsupport of the United Nations. I believe that the U.N. is an \nindispensable arrow in our foreign policy quiver. The Chairman, I think \nit is fair to say, has been skeptical of the role of the United \nNations.\n  But despite our differing outlooks, over the course of nearly 8 \nmonths of negotiation, dialogue, and old-fashioned bargaining, we each \ngave something and got something to return. The Chairman got several \nimportant conditions attached to the payment of arrears. Among other \nitems, these include important managerial reforms, assurances that U.S. \nsovereignty will be protected, and a lowering of our assessment rate \nfrom 25 percent to 20 percent of the U.N. regular budget.\n  For me, it is important that this bill sends a strong signal of \nbipartisan support for putting our relationship with the United Nations \nback on track. Restoring our relationship with the United Nations is \nnot a favor to anyone else--it is in our interest.\n  The United Nations allows us to leverage our resources with other \ncountries in the pursuit of common interests, be it eradicating \ndisease, mitigating hunger, caring for refugees, or addressing common \nenvironmental problems. And as the unfolding crisis with Iraq \ndemonstrates, the United Nations can be a useful instrument in our \ndiplomacy. The United States has played a leading role in the United \nNations since its founding, and I believe that this legislation will \nsecure that leadership.\n  While the purists on either side may not be happy with the agreement \nbefore us, I believe that we have produced a responsible piece of \nlegislation that warrants the support of our colleagues.\n  In sum, the bill before the Senate, the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act, is a significant achievement. I want to pay tribute \nto the Chairman for his continued good faith and cooperation throughout \nthis process. I want to thank the President, the National Security \nAdviser, and the Secretary of State, for their support and assistance \nduring the negotiations. I also want to thank our colleagues in the \nother body, particularly the ranking member of the International \nRelations Committee, Lee Hamilton, who played an important role in \npushing for changes to make this proposal more acceptable to the \nadministration.\n  I believe we have produced a good compromise that a large majority \nwill be able to support. I urge its adoption.\n\n\n             Amendments to the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Commerce-State-Justice portion of \nthis bill contains a few technical and clarifying changes to the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act enacted last year. The Majority Whip of the House \nof Representatives and I have been working together on this language, \nand I believe this statement reflects both of our views.\n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act was specifically designed to protect \nthe Tenth Amendment powers of the sovereign states, to enforce the \nGuarantee Clause, and to preserve and strengthen key structural \nelements of the United States Constitution such as separation of \npowers, judicial review, and federalism. In passing the Act Congress \nmade clear that it intended that the courts enforcing the Act \nscrupulously ensure\n\n[[Page S12269]]\n\nthat these goals be accomplished. In order to avoid any possibility of \nmisinterpretation, we are seeking through the language contained in \nthese amendments to clarify that stated intent.\n  Subsection (a)(3)(F) establishes that a state or local official, \nincluding individual state legislators, or a unit of government, is \nentitled to intervene as of right in a district or appellate court to \nchallenge prisoner release orders or seek their termination. No \nseparate time limits are included because the sponsors think it clear \nthat a court should implement the intervention provisions in a manner \nthat gives them their full effect by ruling in timely fashion on such \nmotions.\n  Subsection (b)(3) corrects the confusing use of the word ``or'' to \ndescribe the limited circumstances when a court may continue \nprospective relief in prison conditions litigation. The amendment makes \nclear that a constitutional violation must be ``current and ongoing''. \nBoth requirements are necessary to ensure that court orders continue \nonly when necessary to remedy a presently occurring constitutional \nviolation. These dual requirements thus ensure that court orders do not \nremain in place on the basis of a claim that a current prison condition \nthat does not violate prisoners' Federal rights nevertheless requires a \ncourt decree to address it because the condition is somehow traceable \nto a prior policy that did violate Federal rights. Likewise, the \nclarification insures that prisoners cannot keep intrusive court orders \nin place based upon the theory that the government officials are \n``poised'' to resume allegedly unlawful conduct. Congress does not \npresume that government officials who have been advised that a \nparticular practice is unlawful will automatically return to an \nunlawful practice unless a court order remains in effect. If an \nunlawful practice resumes or if a prisoner is in imminent danger of a \nconstitutional violation, the prisoner has prompt and complete remedies \nthrough a new action filed in a state or federal court and preliminary \ninjunctive relief.\n  Finally, these amendments make some changes to the automatic stay \nprovisions in the Act. Under the Act, courts are supposed to rule \npromptly on motions to terminate these longstanding decrees. In order \nto discourage delay on such motions, the Act provided that, if a court \ndid not render a decision on the motion within 30 days, the decree was \nautomatically stayed until the court had rendered a final decision. \nUnfortunately, many district courts are not ruling promptly, are \nkeeping the decrees in effect, and are then seeking violations that \njustify doing so.\n  Courts have also been avoiding the automatic stay by saying that it \nis impossible to comply with because it sets up an impossible timetable \nand that it is therefore unconstitutional. The Department of Justice \nmeanwhile has contended that the stay is not really automatic at all, \nalthough no court has accepted that view.\n  The argument that the court is being forced to rule on anything on an \nunrealistic timetable is incorrect because the automatic stay imposes \nno requirement that they rule. It only provides that if they do not \nrule there is no order in effect until they do so. Nevertheless, giving \nthe court the authority to extend the time an additional 60 days should \neliminate that basis for challenge. The amendments also clarify that \nthe stay is in fact is automatic by expressly modeling it on the \nbankruptcy automatic stay, and they state explicitly that any order \nblocking the automatic stay is appealable, thereby ensuring review of \nthe district court's action. Finally, they make clear that mandamus is \navailable to compel a ruling if a court is simply failing to act on one \nof these motions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee for bringing this bill to the \nSenate. Their leadership will help break the logjam on the remaining \n1998 appropriations bills, and I commend them for pushing forward.\n  While I support most provisions in this multi-title legislation, I \nmust take this opportunity to register my strong disapproval of the \nprovisions in the Foreign Operations title relating to International \nFamily Planning.\n  The bill provides that for the next two years, it will include the \nrestrictive Mexico City policy, which will prohibit U.S. international \nfamily planning assistance from going to any foreign private \norganization involved in certain abortion-related activities--even \nthough these activities are carried out with non-U.S. funds. This \nlanguage will cripple the work of many of the private organizations \ndoing the most effective work in family planning and maternal and child \nhealth. For example, organizations that seek to advise their \ngovernments on how to make abortions safer for women, in countries \nwhere abortion is legal, would be restricted from doing so if they \nreceive U.S. money for family planning services. This restriction will \nonly result in more dangerous health conditions for women.\n  The Mexico City provision does at least include a waiver provision, \nallowing the President to disregard the policy. However, if he chooses \nto exercise the waiver, the family planning account will be penalized \nby being reduced.\n  Unfortunately, this language is a compromise with those who would \nterminate international family planning altogether, and thus it is \nprobably the best we can do. I commend the Senator from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, for working so hard to get the best language possible at \nthis time. However, Mr. President, this compromise must go no further. \nAny movement beyond the language we have included in the Senate bill \nwill, in my view, seriously jeopardizes passsage of the legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are waiting for the Senator from \nVermont. While I am waiting let me state for the record that the \nomnibus bill that is here has some additions that were not in the \nconference reports of the various bills.\n  We have included the Small Business Administration reauthorization \nbill, a portion of the State Department authorization bill which deals \nwith reorganization, and with authorization for the United Nations \narrearages. We have included the Highway Safety and Transit Contract \nAuthority Extensions, due to the expiration of ISTEA. We have technical \ncorrections to the Department of Defense Authorization Act with regard \nto land transfer in New Mexico. And we have the agreement that deals \nwith the census provision that was in the State-Justice-Commerce bills \nthat passed the Senate, but it has been altered substantially. I should \ncall attention to that.\n  Let me ask the Chair, what time now remains on this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes for the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd]; there is 15 minutes for the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. McConnell].\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am authorized to yield back the time of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and the Senator from West Virginia. I do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 15 minutes for the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy].\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I advise my good friend, the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, that Senator Leahy has been on the floor. \nHe has been detained just for a few minutes. He is on his way. I don't \nthink he will take his entire 15 minutes, but I would have to hold \nthose minutes for him, if I could.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Florida seek to speak?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the procedure, which I discussed with the \nmajority leader, was that as soon as we completed action on the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill, I would be recognized for \npurposes of offering legislation relative to Haitian immigration. I \nwonder if it would be an appropriate use of this time, and I so ask \nunanimous consent, while awaiting Senator Leahy's arrival, to offer \nthat legislation at this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with the understanding that the Senator \nfrom Florida will yield to the Senator from Vermont, in order to finish \nthis bill, when the Senator from Vermont arrives, I suggest the Chair \nrecognize the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the business currently \npending before the Senate be set aside temporarily for purposes of \nintroducing\n\n[[Page S12270]]\n\nlegislation with the understanding that at such time as the Senator \nfrom Vermont arrives, the Senator from Vermont will have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham pertaining to the introduction of S. 1504 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens; the distinguished ranking \nmember, Mr. Byrd; and the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on \nForeign Operations, Mr. McConnell; and all those who worked on it. This \nhas not been an easy time getting this bill through, partly because of \nholdups in the other body, holdups that tended to disregard, frankly, \nthe democratic process and how we voted here and voted over there. Be \nthat as it may, we have done the best with a difficult situation. I \nbelieve this bill should be passed.\n\n\n                 INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING FUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak on the issue of funding for \ninternational family planning, which is contained in this omnibus bill.\n  The agreement on the Mexico City policy that was approved by the \nAppropriations Committee yesterday, is the result of weeks of tortuous \nnegotiations. It would establish the Mexico City policy in statute for \n2 years. That is a major concession to the House that is opposed by the \nadministration. It would permit him to waive the Mexico City \nrestrictions.\n  But there is a penalty if he does. Funding for family planning would \nbe frozen at last year's level, which is the House level and $50 \nmillion below the Senate level.\n  Even with the waiver for the President, I believe that if the Mexico \nCity issue were voted on separately in the Senate it would be defeated. \nWe are including it as part of this larger package in an effort to pass \nthe Foreign Operations conference report.\n  It is interesting to me that despite the fact that 5 months ago the \nAppropriations Committee reported and the Senate voted for $435 million \nfor international family planning programs with no Mexico City \nrestrictions, despite the fact that the Senate voted the same way in \nFebruary, and the same way last year, despite the fact that the House \nand Senate Foreign Operations conferees would have overwhelmingly \nsupported the Senate position if the House leadership had allowed them \nto vote on it, Members of the House are already saying that they will \nnot accept it because it permits the President to waive the Mexico City \nrestrictions.\n  Under their approach, the United States could not fund organizations \nthat support laws to make abortion safer in countries where abortion is \nlegal. And they expect the President, and the Secretary of State who is \nseen around the world as a champion for women's rights, to accept the \nMexico City policy. It completely ignores reality. If they are \nunwilling to budge we are doomed to failure, because their approach \nwould be vetoed. In fact, I cannot even say that the Mexico City policy \nwith a waiver for the President, as we have done, would not be vetoed.\n  Mr. President, I was perfectly willing to have a vote in the \nconference committee, and I am more than willing to vote on this today \nor next year.\n  But the House has been unwilling to do that. They prefer to try to \nthwart the process in other ways.\n  They are all for democracy in Russia. They are outraged when the \nHaitian Parliament does not follow the rules. But if they do not have \nthe votes here, they break their commitments, manipulate the \nparliamentary rules to their advantage, and obstruct the democratic \nprocess.\n\n  Six years ago we had the votes to defeat the Mexico City policy, \nwhich was the policy in effect during the previous administration, just \nas we have the votes in the Senate today. But we knew our position \nwould be vetoed, and that we could not override a veto.\n  So rather than bring the Congress to a standstill, we accepted that \nwe could not change the President's policy and we got the Foreign \nOperations Conference Report passed and signed into law.\n  Today the tables are turned. The supporters of Mexico City do not \nhave the votes to get it through the Congress, and even if they did \nthey could not override a veto.\n  But rather than accept that, rather than concede that they cannot win \na fair fight, they prevented the conference committee from doing its \njob, they refused an offer to vote when they knew they would lose, and \nthey tried to force their position through so that we would either have \nto shut down the government again or swallow their position without an \nopportunity to amend it.\n  That is exactly what they did two years ago. The result was that \nfunds for family planning were cut sharply. They tried it again last \nweek, when they sent over the Mexico City policy and tried to jam it \nthrough with only Republican names on the Conference Report. They were \nblocked at the last minute by members of their own party.\n  Mr. President, the irony of this is that not one dime of our money \ncan be spent on abortion or to lobby for abortion. That has been the \nlaw for years.\n  This issue is about what private organizations, like Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, like Georgetown University, like the University of North \nCarolina , like the International Planned Parenthood Federation, do \nwith their own money.\n  It is about whether we have a policy that says it is okay to give \nmoney to foreign governments in countries where abortion is legal, but \nit is not okay to give money to private organizations that work in \nthose same countries. It is totally illogical and discriminatory.\n  The compromise agreement contained in this omnibus bill will make no \none happy. I do not like it because it puts into law the Mexico City \npolicy, which I strongly oppose even for two years. Others on this side \nfeel the same way. They see that this is a major concession to the pro-\nMexico City faction in the House, and they are right. The \nadministration does not like it either.\n  It also means that funding for family planning remains frozen at last \nyear's level of $385 million. That is a $180 million cut from the 1995 \nlevel. I think that is a travesty, when so many people around the world \nwant family planning services and cannot get them. Not abortion. Family \nplanning, so they don't have to resort to abortion.\n  That is the choice. In Russia, where women had on average 7 abortions \nin their lifetimes because they had no access to family planning, that \nnumber has fallen sharply since we started a family planning program \nthere. It is common sense.\n  I would like to see twice this amount of money going for family \nplanning, but we have agreed to this level, which is a $50 million cut \nfrom the amount that passed the Senate in July, as part of this \nagreement to try to finish these appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, the House can reject this approach. Perhaps they do \nnot believe the President when he says he will veto the Mexico City \npolicy. I do not know how many times he has to say it.\n  It was not easy to get here. When there is a Republican in the White \nHouse, or the votes change in the Senate, I am sure the other side will \nwant to vote because they will be confident of victory. But that is not \nwhere we are today.\n  I hope the House can improve on this approach. I would be overjoyed \nif they can find a way to keep the Mexico City policy out of the law \nentirely, without including the kind of harmful restrictions on the \ndisbursement of family planning funds that were adopted last year. If \nthe supporters of the Mexico City policy want it so badly, why not vote \non it?\n  As I have said time and again, I would prefer to handle this by \nvoting on Mexico City next year. We could agree that if it is defeated \nin the Senate, the funds would be disbursed on a quarterly basis \nthrough the 1998 fiscal year. I know that approach has bipartisan \nsupport in the House. In fact, the Chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee has suggested that approach. Whether it could win a majority \nI do not know, but I encourage the House to pursue it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for purposes of a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I yield to my friend from California.\n\n[[Page S12271]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to Chairman Stevens and I know the ranking member, \nSenator Byrd, and to the Senator from Vermont, thank you for working so \nhard on this international family planning issue. The Senator is so \ncorrect when he says that the Senate has spoken, the House has spoken, \nand suddenly we find ourselves faced with a situation where the funds \nfor family planning on an international scale will be withheld.\n  I say to my friend, for the Record, because I think it is very \nimportant and a lot of people are counting on us, can our friend from \nVermont assure us that this agreement that he has garnered working with \nSenator McConnell is, in fact, the best he thinks he can get at this \ntime?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is, but it is not what I would want. I would prefer to \nbe far closer to what the Senate has voted on time and time and time \nagain.\n  I understand the realities of the situation, though, and this is \nwhere we are. The irony is that those who are holding up family \nplanning money, claiming they are doing it because of their opposition \nto abortion, are assuring that there will be more abortions in the \ncountries we send the family planning money to.\n  The family planning money, in so many of these countries, has \nprovided a strong alternative to abortion, because many countries use \nabortion as a method of birth control. Our family planning money would \ncut down abortions. It has been proven.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand this topsy-turvy, ``Alice in \nWonderland,'' view of cutting family planning money and saying we are \ntrying to stop abortions, because its does nothing of the kind. In \nfact, when people have access to family planning, the abortions go \ndown.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman on the \nfloor. If he does not need further time on this, I understand the \nSenator from Kentucky has yielded back his time. I, therefore, yield \nback time on this side.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As I understand it then, the balance of the time is the \ntime that remains to me, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to thank the Senate for its consideration of the \ndesire of the Appropriations Committee to finish this work for this \nCongress. We had hoped that we would pass 13 separate appropriations \nbills. That has not been possible. But we have taken the opportunity to \nput two of the bills that have not been finished on this bill--that \nmanaged by Senator Faircloth and Senator Boxer, with the hope that we \ncould resolve the differences with the House. It will go to the House \nnow as an amendment to the House bill. It is an omnibus appropriations \nbill now. And the House will work its will on it. I am hopeful that it \nwill decide to send the bill to the President.\n  In any event, it is my understanding we will soon be presented with a \ncontinuing resolution. The continuing resolution in effect now would \nexpire at midnight tonight. The one I expect to be received by the \nSenate will expire tomorrow night. So we are hopeful that we will be \nable to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate by \ntomorrow night with regard to the matters under this bill.\n  Again, I thank everyone for their consideration of our position. And \nif there is nothing further to come before the Senate on this bill, I \nyield back the balance of the time. It is my understanding that would \nyield back all time on this bill. Is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It would yield back \nall time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there anything further we need to do to see it to \nthat the time agreement is carried out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1621) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2607), as amended, was passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the title is \namended.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       An Act making omnibus consolidated appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House, and the Chair \nappoints the following conferees.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Enzi) appointed Mr. Stevens, Mr. Specter, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nCampbell, Mr. Faircloth, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nHarkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Boxer conferees on the part \nof the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12265-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12271-S12272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 1502.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1502) entitled ``District of Columbia Student \n     Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the D.C. voucher bill \nbecause it is unacceptable and unconstitutional.\n  We all want to help the children of the District of Columbia get a \ngood education. But this voucher provision is not the way to do it. \nPublic funds should be used for public schools, not to pay for a small \nnumber of students to attend private and religious schools.\n  Earlier this week, the House of Representatives soundly defeated a \nsimilar bill. It was Congress' first vote on a free-standing private \nschool voucher bill. It's clear that private school vouchers are not \nthe panacea that voucher proponents would like them to be. Americans do \nnot want vouchers--they want to improve public education, not undermine \nit.\n  President Clinton is a strong leader on education. In fact, President \nClinton is the education President. He is leading the battle for \neducation reform. The country is proud of his leadership, and our \nRepublican colleagues don't know what to do.\n  They keep shooting themselves in the foot in their repeated attempts \nto devise a Republican alternative that will satisfy their right wing \nhostility to public education and still have the support of the \nAmerican people. It can't be done. First they tried to abolish the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. Then they tried to make deep cuts in funds for \npublic schools. They even shut down the Government when they couldn't \nget their way. Now they are trying the same trick through the back \ndoor, using public funds to subsidize private schools. It won't work, \nand they shouldn't try.\n  It is clear that President Clinton will veto the D.C. voucher bill, \nand he is right to veto it.\n  The current debate involves schools in the District of Columbia. But \nthe use of Federal funds for private schools is a national issue that \nCongress has addressed and rejected many times before. And so have many \nStates.\n  Now, voucher proponents are attempting to make the D.C. public \nschools a guinea pig for a scheme that voters in D.C. have soundly \nrejected, and so have voters across the country.\n  Recent voucher proposals in Washington, Colorado, and California lost \nby over 2-to-1 margins. In 1981, D.C. voters defeated a voucher \ninitiative by a ratio of 8 to 1, and the concept has never been brought \nup on the ballot again because it has so little support. Clearly, \nCongress should not impose on the District of Columbia what the people \nof D.C. and voters across the country reject.\n\n[[Page S12272]]\n\n  Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, and D.C. parents, ministers, \nand other local leaders have made it clear that they do not want \nvouchers in the District of Columbia. Members of Congress who can't get \nto first base with this issue in their own States should not turn \naround and impose it on the people of the District.\n  Vouchers would undermine D.C. school reforms already underway. Last \nyear, Congress created a Control Board and all but eliminated the \nlocally elected school board. This bill would create yet another \nbureaucracy in the form of a federally appointed corporation to run the \nvoucher program. Six of the seven corporation members would be \nnominated by the Federal Government, and those nominations are \ncontrolled by the Republican Congress. Only one representative of D.C. \nwould serve on the corporation. This is precisely the kind of Federal \ntakeover of a local school system that Republican Senators oppose for \nany other community in America.\n  Public funds should not go to private schools when District of \nColumbia public schools have urgent needs of their own. Roof repairs \nstill need to be made; 65 percent of the schools have faulty plumbing; \n41 percent of the schools don't have enough power outlets and \nelectrical wiring to accommodate computers and other needed technology; \n66 percent of the schools have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air \nconditioning. Funding these repairs should be our top priority, not \nconducting a foolish ideological experiment on school vouchers.\n  Another serious problem with private school vouchers is the \nexclusionary policies of private schools. Scarce Federal dollars should \nnot go to schools that can exclude children. There is no requirement in \nthe bill that schools receiving vouchers must accept minority students, \nor students with limited English proficiency, or students with \ndisabilities, or homeless students, or students with discipline \nproblems.\n  Public schools are open to all children. Public schools don't have \nthe luxury of closing their doors to students who pose difficult \nchallenges.\n  Voucher proponents argue that vouchers increase choice for parents. \nBut choice for parents is a mirage. Private schools apply different \nrules than public schools. Unlike public schools, which must accept all \nchildren, private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. \nThe real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the \nprivate school, the more selective it is, and the more students are \nturned away. In Cleveland, nearly half of the public school students \nwho received vouchers could not find a private school that would accept \nthem.\n  Vouchers will not help the overwhelming majority of children who need \nhelp. The current voucher scheme will, at most, enable 2,000 D.C. \nchildren to attend private schools, out of the 78,000 children who \nattend D.C. public schools. This proposal would provide vouchers for 3 \npercent of D.C. children--and do nothing for the other 97 percent. This \nis no way to spend federal dollars. We should invest in strategies that \nhelp all children, not just a few.\n\n  As I have said before, instead of supporting local efforts to \nrevitalize the schools, voucher proponents are attempting to make the \nD.C. public schools a guinea pig for an ideological experiment in \neducation that voters in D.C. have soundly rejected, and that voters \nacross the country have soundly rejected too. Our Republican colleagues \nhave clearly been unable to generate any significant support for \nvouchers in their own States. It is a travesty of responsible action \nfor them to attempt to foist their discredited idea on the long-\nsuffering people and long-suffering public schools of the District of \nColumbia. If vouchers are a bad idea for the public schools in all 50 \nStates, they are a bad idea for the public schools of the District of \nColumbia too.\n  Many of us in Congress favor D.C. home rule. Many of us in Congress \nbelieve that the people of the District of Columbia should be entitled \nto have voting representation in the Senate and the House, like the \npeople in every State. It is an embarrassment to our democracy that the \nmost powerful democracy on Earth denies the most basic right of any \ndemocracy--the right to vote--to the citizens of the Nation's Capital.\n  D.C. is not a test tube for misguided Republican ideological \nexperiments on education. Above all, D.C. is not a slave plantation. \nRepublicans in Congress should stop acting like plantation masters, and \nstart treating the people of D.C. with the respect they deserve.\n  General Becton, local leaders, and D.C. parents are working hard to \nimprove all D.C. public schools for all children. Congress should give \nthem its support, not undermine them.\n  Another serious objection to this voucher scheme is its \nunconstitutionality. The vast majority of private schools that charge \ntuition less than the $3,200 available for a voucher are religious \nschools. Providing vouchers to religious schools violates the \nestablishment clause of the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nIt's a Federal subsidy for sectarian schools. In many States, voucher \nschemes would violate the State constitution, too.\n  Last January, a Wisconsin lower court held that the expansion of the \nMilwaukee voucher program to include religious schools was \nunconstitutional and violated the Wisconsin Constitution. The court \nstated that ``We do not object to the existence of parochial schools or \nthat they attempt to spread their beliefs through their schools. They \njust cannot do it with State tax dollars.''\n\n  Last August, the Wisconsin State Court of Appeals affirmed that \ndecision, holding that the expansion of the State voucher program to \ninclude religious schools was unconstitutional under the Wisconsin \nConstitution.\n  Last May, an Ohio appellate court reversed a trial court's decision \nto allow public money to be paid to religious schools. The appeals \ncourt held that the voucher program violated the principle of \nseparation of church and state under both the United States \nConstitution and the Ohio Constitution. The court ruled that the \nvoucher program ``steers aid to sectarian schools, resulting in what \namounts to a direct government subsidy.''\n  Last June, a Vermont State Superior Court held that the use of \nvouchers to pay tuition at private religious schools violates both the \nU.S. Constitution and the Vermont Constitution.\n  As these cases demonstrate, the courts are clear that vouchers for \nreligious schools are unconstitutional, and Congress should abide by \ntheir rulings.\n  Last month, in a keynote address to the Conference of the Council of \nGreat City Schools, Coretta Scott King said,\n\n       I don't have a lot of sympathy with those who would further \n     diminish the resources available to urban public schools with \n     a voucher system . . . The debate over vouchers takes the \n     focus away from where it really needs to be--on how we can \n     increase funding and resources, so that every public school \n     can provide the best possible education for all students.\n\n  Coretta King is right. Instead of subsidizing private schools, we \nneed to support ways to improve and reform the public schools--not in a \nfew schools, but in all schools; not for a few students, but for all \nstudents.\n  Subsidies for a few children at the expense of the many divides \ncommunities. The federal government should help bring communities \ntogether, not divide them. We should make investments that help all \nchildren in all neighborhood schools to get a good, safe education. I \noppose the D.C. voucher bill as unwise, unacceptable, and \nunconstitutional.\n  Private school vouchers are not the answer to the problems facing the \nnation's schools. It is a mistake and a misuse of tax dollars to send \nchildren to private schools at public expense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12271-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12272-S12277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DC SCHOOL VOUCHER BILL\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I strongly appose S. 1502, a bill \nto take funds away from public school children in order to subsidize \nprivate schools.\n  Supporters of this legislation claim that the $7 million they propose \nto spend on private schools does not divert funds from public school \nchildren. The truth, however, is that in the zero-sum budget, any funds \nspent on vouchers must be drawn from other education funds. That means \nless resources for public school children.\n  Seven million dollars could make a real difference in the DC public \nschools. We could fully fund after-school programs at every DC school.\n\n[[Page S12273]]\n\n We could buy 368 new boilers for the DC schools. We could rewire the \n65 schools that don't have electrical wiring to accommodate computers \nand multi-media equipment. We could upgrade the plumbing in the 102 \nschools with substandard facilities. With just $1 million, we could buy \n66,000 new hard-cover books for DC's school libraries. There are real \nimprovements we could make to the DC public school system with $7 \nmillion. Instead, this bill proposes to siphon those funds away from \nthe public school children.\n  Some of my colleagues suggest that, were it not for management \nproblems, the DC schools would not be in the condition they are now in. \nHow a diversion of $7 million from the public schools to private \nschools will solve that problem is beyond me. I have a better solution: \ngood management. Paul Vallas has turned around the Chicago schools. It \nwould not surprise me if some day the Chicago Public Schools were \ncompeting on the same level as the public schools that comprise the \nFirst in the World Consortium in north suburban Chicago. Students in \nthose schools compete with students at the finest schools in the world. \nThe DC schools have new management, and I have every confidence that \nGeneral Becton will be able to do for the DC schools what Paul Vallas \nis doing for the Chicago schools.\n  Some of my colleagues suggest that school vouchers will help improve \nthe public schools by increasing competition--by creating, in effect, a \nmarketplace for education. There is a problem with that proposal. By \ndefinition, markets have winners and losers, and our country cannot \nafford any losers in a game of educational roulette.\n  Supporters of school vouchers state that this is not like a game of \nroulette, that research proves that voucher programs have positive \neffects on student achievement. The facts, however, do not speak so \nclearly to this issue. The data is mixed. Some studies show \nimprovement. Some studies show declining achievement. Some studies show \nno difference at all between the students in public schools and those \nplaced in private schools. We do know that programs in other countries \nhave not succeeded. In France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Chile, \nvoucher programs actually widened the achievement gap, instead of \nnarrowing it.\n  That is the real problem. Vouchers do not fix public schools. \nVouchers do not solve problems. Vouchers raise false hopes in parents \nwho desire better schools for their children. Vouchers are not answers \nto the real problems that we must address in our public schools.\n  Mr. President, for the last three years, proponents of this bill in \nthe Senate have failed to pass this bad idea. Today, however, in order \nto expedite the business of the Senate, I, and my colleagues who oppose \nthis bill, are willing to the let the Senate pass this measure, because \nPresident Clinton has wisely pledged to veto it. Our willingness to let \nthis legislation pass the Senate does not represent any weakening of \nour belief that it is fundamentally flawed, that it represents an \nabandonment of public education, and a pessimistic capitulation to a \nwinnable challenge--the improvement of our public schools so they may \nserve all our children into the 21st century.\n  We have agreed to let this legislation clear the Senate, in these \nlast hours of the first session of the 105th Congress, as part of a \nmuch larger arrangement to consider a number of important issues, \nincluding: measures to fund the activities of the State Department, the \nCommerce Department, and the Justice Department; measures to fund the \nDistrict of Columbia and our foreign aid operations; a stop-gap measure \nto fund our highway and mass transit programs; and legislation granting \nthe President the so-called ``fast track'' authority to negotiate trade \nagreements. It is in this context, and with the advance knowledge that \nthe President will veto this DC voucher bill, that we have agreed to \nlet the Senate proceed with this bill.\n  Mr. President, I hope that next year we will focus on real solutions \nto the problems facing our public schools. According to the U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office, 14 million children attend schools that are \nliterally crumbling down around them, and we have let our public \nschools fall $112 billion into physical disrepair. Our children cannot \nlearn the skills they need to keep us competitive in this kind of \nenvironment. I know that we can do better for our children. We can fix \nour schools, and I look forward to working with my colleagues next year \non legislation to form a partnership with state and local governments \nto rebuild and modernize our crumbling schools. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues next year to address the real needs of our \nnation's 52 million public school children.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today we are passing important \nlegislation which I strongly oppose by voice vote. The normal Senate \nprocedure would be to vote on such an important bill, and I do not like \nto see Senators avoid a recorded vote on a bill with such dire \nimplications for public education. However, the President has committed \nto veto the full bill, and I am confident from repeated past votes that \nif we did not have this commitment, the Senate would block the bill. \nAlso, without this commitment, I would be glad not only to force a \nvote, but also to discuss the bill at length.\n  In fact, there is a healthy sign that even supporters of the ill-\nadvised idea of starting a taxpayer-funded private school voucher \nprogram are re-thinking their support. Five days ago, the House \ndefeated a private school voucher plan. Thirty-five House Republicans \nvoted against creation of a voucher program on the basis that the \nlegislation did not include basic civil rights protections that also \nare absent in the bill before us.\n  The United States Catholic Conference opposed that bill. I quote here \nfrom their letter:\n\n       An additional reason why the USCC is unable to support H.R. \n     2746 is the ``Not School Aid'' provision in the new section \n     6405(a). . . . Section 6405(a) can readily be construed to \n     negate the application of longstanding civil rights statutes, \n     in particular, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n     Title X of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 \n     of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that would normally apply \n     to a scholarship program.\n\n  In other words, by saying that the federal aid going to private \nschools under a voucher program is ``not school aid'' the bill \nproponents excuse them from full compliance with federal protections \nthat currently apply to public schools.\n  Mr. President, that is not just my interpretation or that of the \nCatholic Conference. That is the reading of proponents of the bill.\n  Specifically, Mr. Clint Bolick, who has a group named ``Institute for \nJustice,'' has been agitating to start taxpayer funding for private \nschool tuitions. Here is what Mr. Bolick said about the Catholic \nConference and civil rights in a memo that leaked out last month:\n\n       Dick Komer and I met with representatives of the Catholic \n     Conference, who urged that the bill contain the full panoply \n     of federal civil rights regulations, including Title IX \n     (gender) and disability provisions. We argued strongly \n     against those regulations. We are pleased to report that the \n     final bill contains only a general anti-discrimination \n     requirement and expressly provides that schools are not \n     ``recipients of federal funds.''\n\n  So Mr. Bolick ``argued strongly'' against civil rights for girls and \ndisabled children, but he is pleased to report that schools receiving \nvouchers would not be ``recipients of federal funds.''\n  This is absurd. The federal government today spends about $12 billion \non elementary and secondary education. That is about $250 per child in \na public school. But the proponents of this bill want from the outset \nto give private schools $3,200 per child in federal funds. If we do \nthat, just three voucher children would provide a private school with \nmore federal assistance than we provide to a whole public school \nclassroom. If that is ``Not School Aid,'' I don't know what is. There \nare a lot of public school classrooms that would like to have $3,200 \nper child in federal assistance, and they would not be crowing about \nhow basic civil rights protections were rolled back.\n  I say this to criticize this proposed legislation, not the private \nschools. I believe that we have a duty as public servants to fund the \npublic schools, and we have a duty to the private schools to leave them \nalone. I support private schools. About nine out of ten are religious, \nand I particularly support their freedom to stay that way without \nfederal intervention. Make no mistake. If we go down this road of \nputting $3,200 per child of federal taxpayers' money\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\ninto private school classrooms, federal regulation will follow and that \nwill be a tragedy.\n  This is not conjecture, the Bush Administration studied it. In a \nreport titled ``Choice of Schools in Six Nations,'' here is what they \nfound:\n\n       For those who believe strongly in religious schooling and \n     fear that government influence will come with public funding, \n     reason exists for their concern. Catholic or Protestant \n     schools in each of the nations studied have increasingly been \n     assimilated to the assumptions and guiding values of public \n     schooling. This process does not even seem to be the result \n     of deliberate efforts . . . but rather of the difficulty for \n     a private school playing by public rules, to maintain its \n     distance from the common assumptions and habits of the \n     predominant system.\n\n  World Bank economist Estelle James did a similar survey and found \nthat ``. . . heavy controls invariably accompany subsidies, \nparticularly over teacher salaries and qualifications, price, and other \nentrance criteria.'' She looked particularly closely at Australia, and \nfound ``. . . increasing regulation and centralization of decisions and \nthe loss of private school autonomy . . . ''\n  I raise all of these points to appeal to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I do not talk to hear myself talk, but to urge \nserious consideration. We have House colleagues reconsidering. We have \nthe Catholic Conference urging civil rights protections. We have Bush \nAdministration and World Bank studies indicating heavy regulation. We \nhave a proposal that clearly disadvantages public schools on the matter \nof federal funding. Who will really be happy if we pass this?\n  Mr. President, we must finally remember our duty to public education. \nI go back to Horace Mann, the great champion of public schools. He said \nthat\n\n       The idea of an educational system that was at once both \n     universal, free and available to all the people, rich and \n     poor alike, was revolutionary. This is the great thing about \n     America. No other nation ever had such an institution. . . . \n     The free public school system . . . has been in large measure \n     the secret of America's success.\n\n  The proposal before us erodes public education. It disadvantages \npublic schools in federal funding and under federal regulation. \nInstead, it offers more funds to private schools which should exist as \nan independent alternative, but which are not ``universal, free'' or \n``available to all the people.'' I urge my colleagues who have \nsupported this private voucher idea to reconsider over the holidays, \nand I thank the President in advance for his veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PRECEDENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``District \n     of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public education in the District of Columbia is in a \n     crisis, as evidenced by the following:\n       (A) The District of Columbia schools have the lowest \n     average of any school system in the Nation on the National \n     Assessment of Education Progress.\n       (B) 72 percent of fourth graders in the District of \n     Columbia tested below basic proficiency on the National \n     Assessment of Education Progress in 1994.\n       (C) Since 1991, there has been a net decline in the reading \n     skills of District of Columbia students as measured in scores \n     on the standardized Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills.\n       (D) At least 40 percent of District of Columbia students \n     drop out of or leave the school system before graduation.\n       (E) The National Education Goals Panel reported in 1996 \n     that both students and teachers in District of Columbia \n     schools are subjected to levels of violence that are twice \n     the national average.\n       (F) Nearly two-thirds of District of Columbia teachers \n     reported that violent student behavior is a serious \n     impediment to teaching.\n       (G) Many of the District of Columbia's 152 schools are in a \n     state of terrible disrepair, including leaking roofs, \n     bitterly cold classrooms, and numerous fire code violations.\n       (2) Significant improvements in the education of \n     educationally deprived children in the District of Columbia \n     can be accomplished by--\n       (A) increasing educational opportunities for the children \n     by expanding the range of educational choices that best meet \n     the needs of the children;\n       (B) fostering diversity and competition among school \n     programs for the children;\n       (C) providing the families of the children more of the \n     educational choices already available to affluent families; \n     and\n       (D) enhancing the overall quality of education in the \n     District of Columbia by increasing parental involvement in \n     the direction of the education of the children.\n       (3) The 350 private schools in the District of Columbia and \n     the surrounding area offer a more safe and stable learning \n     environment than many of the public schools.\n       (4) Costs are often much lower in private schools than \n     corresponding costs in public schools.\n       (5) Not all children are alike and therefore there is no \n     one school or program that fits the needs of all children.\n       (6) The formation of sound values and moral character is \n     crucial to helping young people escape from lives of poverty, \n     family break-up, drug abuse, crime, and school failure.\n       (7) In addition to offering knowledge and skills, education \n     should contribute positively to the formation of the internal \n     norms and values which are vital to a child's success in life \n     and to the well-being of society.\n       (8) Schools should help to provide young people with a \n     sound moral foundation which is consistent with the values of \n     their parents. To find such a school, parents need a full \n     range of choice to determine where their children can best be \n     educated.\n       (c) Precedents.--The United States Supreme Court has \n     determined that programs giving parents choice and increased \n     input in their children's education, including the choice of \n     a religious education, do not violate the Constitution. The \n     Supreme Court has held that as long as the beneficiary \n     decides where education funds will be spent on such \n     individual's behalf, public funds can be used for education \n     in a religious institution because the public entity has \n     neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion and \n     therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the \n     first amendment to the Constitution. Supreme Court precedents \n     include--\n       (1) Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v. \n     Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); and Meyer v. \n     Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) which held that parents have \n     the primary role in and are the primary decision makers in \n     all areas regarding the education and upbringing of their \n     children;\n       (2) Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983) which declared a \n     Minnesota tax deduction program that provided State income \n     tax benefits for educational expenditures by parents, \n     including tuition in religiously affiliated schools, does not \n     violate the Constitution;\n       (3) Witters v. Department of Services for the Blind, 474 \n     U.S. 481 (1986) in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously \n     that public funds for the vocational training of the blind \n     could be used at a Bible college for ministry training; and\n       (4) Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, 509 U.S. \n     1 (1993) which held that a deaf child could receive an \n     interpreter, paid for by the public, in a private religiously \n     affiliated school under the Individual with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.). The case held that \n     providing an interpreter in a religiously affiliated school \n     did not violate the establishment clause of the first \n     amendment of the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Bill Lann Lee \nnomination as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. He is a good \nman, a lawyer of skill and experience. He is the son of an immigrant \nwho has worked hard and done very well professionally and financially.\n  However, his nomination is in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of \nhis positions are outside the mainstream of current legal thought, and \nI believe we need to reject that nomination. Regretfully, I intend to \nvote no when it comes up before the Judiciary Committee.\n  There has been some discussion and comments made that there have been \nscurrilous attacks against him. I just want to say that is not so. \nCertainly it is not so from the Senators who are members of the \nJudiciary Committee who have considered this nomination. Senator Hatch, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, came to this body earlier this \nweek. He made a very long, professional address, delineating his \nconcerns about this nomination and why he had decided to vote no. He \ntalked about legal issues, professional issues, positions of \nimportance, and that is the basis of our concern--not personal attacks.\n  This position is a serious position. Mr. Lee has been treated \nrespectfully. I have been at every hearing he has attended, and I have \nbeen at every hearing in which his nomination has been discussed. It \nhas been discussed on a high level, according to the highest \nprofessional standards of this Senate. That is the way it should be. \nBut his\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\nposition is an important position, so it is necessary that we ask \nimportant fundamental questions and that we get answers from him, and \nthen once we get those answers, it is our responsibility, under the \nadvice and consent responsibility of the Senate, to make a judgment as \nto how we should vote.\n  I want to say we must protect the civil rights of all Americans. We \ncannot, however, utilize civil rights laws as a tool to favor one group \nover another. We need to know what Mr. Lee thinks on what the issues \nare facing America. He is an advocate. We know that. I respect that. \nBut we need to go beyond that. How deep is his advocacy? Can he take it \naway and can he be an objective and effective administrator of the \ncivil rights policies of the U.S. Government, or does he maintain some \nof his advocacy views that are outside the mainstream of American legal \nthought?\n  That is why, I submit, he has been asked a number of questions and \nwhy we have taken this seriously.\n  This position has been vacant for 18 months. The President just \nrecently submitted his nomination. Our committee has moved promptly to \nconsider that nomination, and we brought it up last week for a vote. \nHis supporters, perhaps fearing they did not have the votes, asked it \nbe put over again for another week. I expect we will take that up \nThursday of next week. Some have suggested that if there are not enough \nvotes in the committee to confirm this nomination, that we ought to, \nregardless of that, send the nomination to the floor.\n  As a new member of the committee, I thought we had an interesting \ndiscussion about that. The Members who felt they were on the losing \nside raised quite a number of questions and earnestly argued for their \nposition. Of course, this is a decision that we can make, and we can \nmake any decision we choose, and they cited a number of historical \nexamples why we should do that. Senator Hatch has been a member of the \ncommittee for a number of years and delineated the history. There has \nbeen no Executive nominee--and this nominee would be part of President \nClinton's administration--reported out of that committee other than \nwith a favorable recommendation since 1953.\n  In fact, a number of Democratic Senators on the committee were the \nvery ones who just a few years ago voted not to send the nomination of \nBill Lucas, an African-American who had been nominated by President \nReagan to be civil rights chief--they voted not to send his nomination \nout. And they did the same with William Bradford Reynolds, another \nnominee of President Reagan, who was not sent forward, on their \nobjection.\n  Therefore, they took the position--and I think one that is quite \nproper--if they so choose and if our committee so chooses, that the \ncommittee makes a recommendation as to whether or not a nomination \nshould go forward.\n  Let me say there have been suggestions that scurrilous complaints and \nattacks have been made. I hate to hear that, but I say they have not \ncome from our side. I say there have been some unwise and intemperate \nremarks by those who are supporting the Lee nomination in this U.S. \nSenate. They have, in effect, said, ``Agree with us and you report out \nthis nomination, or we will say you are against civil rights, we will \naccuse you of being against African-Americans, we will say you are \nagainst women, we will say you are against Chinese-Americans.'' They \nwould, in fact, play the race card.\n  Sad to say, they have done just that.\n  Mr. President, let me share with Members of this body and the \nAmerican people some of the things that were said by Senators in this \nbody about those of us who have concerns about this nomination. The \nDemocratic leader had a press conference earlier this week, and he \nsaid, ``The far right doesn't want the Civil Rights Division filled \nbecause they don't want civil rights laws enforced.''\n  Now, I submit that is a sad thing to say. That is an extreme thing to \nsay, that the chairman of our committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, who has \nworked hand in glove with this administration to confirm every nominee \nthey sent forward for the Department of Justice, except this one. This \nis the only one he has objected to. It is extremely unfair to say that \nwe don't want civil rights laws enforced because we want to question \nthis nominee and we believe he is outside the mainstream of current \nlegal thought.\n  Senator Kennedy said, ``It's wrong for Republicans to hold him \nhostage to their anti-civil-rights agenda.'' I'm for civil rights. I \nbelieve in that. The other Members do. We just need to talk about what \nwe really mean by the words ``civil rights.'' Do civil rights mean \nequality for all as we traditionally thought? Or do we go to a new \ndefinition of civil rights that means preferences and advantages to one \ngroup or another group because of the color of their skin? We are not \nagainst civil rights. Senator Kennedy went on to say, ``It would be an \noutrage for a small band of anti-civil-rights Republican Senators to \nbottle up this nominee. A vote against Bill Lee is a vote against civil \nrights,'' he said.\n  Another Senator, Senator Boxer said, ``By opposing Bill Lee, I think \nthe Republicans are sending a signal to every minority in this country, \nto every woman in this country, that, frankly, they don't believe in \nequal opportunity for everyone.''\n  That hurts me, Mr. President, to hear a Member of this body make such \nan extreme statement as that. I really think it was unnecessary and \ngoes beyond what ought to have been said. We can disagree whether or \nnot this nominee ought to be confirmed. But I think we ought to all \nrespect each other's views and opinions more than that. So I am \nconcerned about that.\n\n  Another Senator, Senator Mikulski, was also aggressive in her \nremarks. This is how it was reported in the Washington Times the other \nmorning on the front page:\n\n       Congressional Democrats, in a bid to save the nomination of \n     a Chinese American as assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights, yesterday accused Republicans of racism.\n       ``I don't think the United States Senate should be a forum \n     for attacking Chinese Americans,'' said Senator Mikulski. \n     ``We don't want Bill Lann Lee to be the Anita Hill of 1997,'' \n     she said.\n\n  This is what the paper reported:\n\n       Just after finishing leveling fire, the Maryland Democrat \n     walked over to Senator Edward M. Kennedy and said under her \n     breath, ``I hated to do that, but we had no choice.''\n\n  I am glad at least to know that she was reluctant to make those \ncomments. I think she well should have been because I intend to take, \nand every member of this committee intends to take, this nominee \nseriously. We need to give him a fair hearing. He needs to be treated \nrespectfully. But if his ideas are outside the mainstream of current \nAmerican law, outside the direction we believe this Nation ought to go \nin civil rights, we have a responsibility to reject the nomination, and \nthat is what I intend to do. I intend to fulfill my responsibility.\n  I want to say right now that I don't intend to be intimidated by \nattacks of that kind. I am going to do what I believe is right for this \ncountry.\n  Let me read you what some of the testimony was at hearings about this \nnominee.\n  Mr. Gerald A. Reynolds, an African-American, president of the Center \nfor New Black Leadership, testified that he strongly opposed the \nnomination of Mr. Lee. He said:\n\n       If confirmed as Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Lee's \n     background suggests that no democratic principle, controlling \n     legal authority, nor legal standard will prevent him from \n     furthering his particular ideological agenda.\n\n  Further he said:\n\n       For the last 30 years, traditional civil rights \n     organizations have used civil rights laws as a weapon to \n     extract benefits for racial minorities, no matter what the \n     cost. Mr. Lee has spent most of his professional life doing \n     that same thing.\n       Mr. Lee's legal defense fund sought to overcome the will of \n     the citizens of California by persuading the ninth circuit to \n     affirm Judge Henderson's ruling against Proposition 209.\n       I would argue that the legal defense fund's attempts to \n     nullify Proposition 209 constitutes a direct assault upon our \n     democratic principles. The legal defense fund's case against \n     Proposition 209 rested on a thin reed. Basically, it rested \n     upon two cases that are easily distinguishable from the facts \n     surrounding Proposition 209.\n\n  I think we will talk about Proposition 209 in a minute. But just to \npoint out, that is a civil rights initiative in California that said \npeople should be treated alike regardless of the color of their skin, \nand it mirrored almost exactly the 14th amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\n  Mr. Reynolds goes further:\n\n       There are other examples. We can look to the lawsuit in Los \n     Angeles. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation \n     Authority decided to increase its bus fares and eliminate \n     monthly bus passes. Mr. Lee's legal defense fund lawsuit \n     alleged that the MTA action violated the civil rights laws \n     and the Constitution because they had an adverse impact on \n     minorities and poor people.\n\n  Mr. Reynolds continues:\n\n       We can debate whether it was a good idea to eliminate some \n     of the benefits that the citizens of Los Angeles enjoyed, \n     but I think it is a stretch to conclude that a policy \n     decision such as raising a bus fare and eliminating bus \n     routes and eliminating bus passes constitutes a \n     constitutional violation.\n\n  He went on to note that:\n\n       The lesson that we should have walked away with is that \n     race is a toxic circumstance, and that it is wrong to \n     distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of race.\n\n  I questioned Mr. Reynolds and I asked him about busing and how people \nin the minority community feel about busing.\n  Mr. Reynolds replied:\n\n       I think it is clear that most parents are concerned with \n     the quality of education that their children receive, and \n     most parents, black and white, do not care. Well, actually \n     they prefer that it be a neighborhood school. More \n     importantly, I think time has shown that forced busing has \n     been an unmitigated disaster.\n\n  Those were the words of Mr. Reynolds. I further asked him, had he \nseen cases like the Houston busing case, on which Mr. Bill Lann Lee was \nthe attorney, and where lawyers, professional litigators, who were \ninvolved in these issues as a business, their livelihood, continued to \npursue remedies that the children and the parents of the children do \nnot want. Mr. Reynolds answered: ``Yes.''\n  Well, that was from Mr. Gerald Reynolds, an African-American citizen \nof this country, opposing Bill Lann Lee. Is he against African-\nAmericans? I submit not. Is he against women? I submit not. Is he \nagainst Chinese-Americans? I submit not. Is he against civil rights? I \nsay no. He's for civil rights. There is no doubt about that.\n  Let me read you this excerpt from the testimony, in June, of Charlene \nF. Loen. Like Mr. Lee, she is a Chinese-American, and she gave some of \nthe most poignant testimony I have heard before our committee. She \nactually came to tears. She talked about her son, Patrick, who wanted \nto attend Lowell High School in San Francisco, but he was prevented \nfrom attending that public high school because of a racial quota set up \nunder a Federal court consent decree in 1983. Under the consent decree, \nshe said:\n\n       Hard work and good grades are not always enough. My son \n     Patrick found out the hard way.\n\n  I am quoting again:\n\n       In 1994, Patrick applied to Lowell, with a test score of 58 \n     out of a 69. That year, Lowell set the minimum score for \n     Chinese students at 62. But then Lowell set the minimum \n     scores for white students and other Asians at 58. Lowell set \n     the minimum scores for blacks and Hispanics lower than that. \n     So Patrick could have gotten into Lowell if he were white, \n     Japanese or black. He was rejected because he was Chinese \n     American.\n\n  She went on:\n\n       Discipline, hard work, and academic achievement should be \n     rewarded. Patrick studied hard, he got the grades, and he was \n     rejected because he is of Chinese descent.\n\n  She went on:\n\n       The year Patrick was rejected, the San Francisco school \n     district announced the opening of a new academic high school, \n     Thurgood Marshall. I went to the school district to apply for \n     Patrick. Right away, the person at the office asked me, ``Is \n     Patrick Chinese?'' I said, ``yes,'' and she said that the \n     slots for the Chinese were already taken at Thurgood \n     Marshall. I asked how could that be because the application \n     period was not even over yet. She shrugged and said that that \n     is just what the consent decree requires. Patrick also \n     applied at three other high schools--Wallenberg, Washington, \n     and Lincoln--and all three rejected him because they already \n     had too many Chinese under the consent decree.\n\n  Those were her words. That is not the way, I submit, we ought to \noperate our Government today. She felt very strongly about that. And \nthis is a Chinese-American testifying before our committee. In \nNovember, she said the Federal judge who approved the consent decree \napproved a payment by the State of California of over $400,000 in legal \nfees to the NAACP, the legal defense fund, Bill Lee's unit, for \nopposing the lawsuit; in other words, the lawsuit that she had filed to \ntry to get her son to be able to go to the school of her choice that he \nqualified to by objective standards.\n  A judge denied a motion to end the consent decree.\n  This is how she concluded her remarks.\n\n       Under the consent decree can you be denied admission to \n     public school because of your race by treating people as \n     members of racial groups rather than as individuals with the \n     same rights before the law. The consent decree has dashed the \n     hopes of children, denied my son and many others the right to \n     opportunities they earned through hard work and diligence, \n     condemned children to needless busing, prevented parents from \n     being involved in their school and thereby holding school \n     administrators accountable, and divided the people of San \n     Francisco.\n\n  Divided the people of San Francisco.\n\n       This is the way things have been in San Francisco for the \n     past 14 years.\n\n  Is Mrs. Loen against civil rights? I submit not. Is she against \nChinese-Americans? No, she is not. She is a Chinese-American. Is she \nagainst women? No. Is she against minorities and civil rights? No.\n  Let me read this testimony before the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on the Constitution Federalism, and Property Rights \nchaired by Senator John Ashcroft. This is the statement of Senator \nMitch McConnell of Kentucky. He was talking about the ``legally \nordained'' set-aside in Federal highway funding that mandated a certain \npercentage of the money be spent toward minority contractors.\n  This is what Senator McConnell recounted:\n\n       Michael Cornelius recently spoke poignantly to this point \n     before the Constitution Subcommittee in the House of \n     Representatives. He explained that his firm [his business] \n     was denied a Government contract under ISTEA [a Federal \n     program] even though his bid was $3 million lower than his \n     competitor's. Mr. Cornelius' bid was rejected because the \n     Government felt that the bid ``did not use enough minority- \n     or women-owned subcontractors.''\n       To comprehend the full extent of the Government's \n     unconstitutional policy, you must understand that the \n     Cornelius bid proposed to subcontract 26.5 percent of the \n     work to firms owned by minorities and women, and, of course, \n     the Government concluded that even that was inadequate.\n\n  This is the kind of matter that the Adarand decision dealt with, and \nthe Adarand decision is a decision Mr. Lee says he believes is bad \nconstitutional law. But that is the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwhich in the Adarand decision set forth standards that basically \ndemonstrate that these kind of set-asides are not fair. They are in \nviolation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to quote one more witness who \ntestified. This is Mrs. Sue Au Allen, a Chinese-American, the President \nof the United States-Pan American Chamber of Commerce, a national \nnonprofit organization representing Asian-American business men and \nwomen, and other professionals.\n  She is a very impressive lady, and was very direct in what she had to \nsay about the Lee nomination. She said:\n\n       Mr. Lee's record gives me grave concern, Mr. Chairman. As a \n     nation's top civil rights law enforcement official, he will \n     advocate certain policies on race and gender issues that are \n     contrary to constitutional guarantee of equal right and \n     opportunity for all Americans and that will have a \n     deleterious effect on racial and gender harmony in general \n     and on the rights of many individuals in particular.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       When I look at the arguments he has made in the last 20 \n     years to determine his understanding of what equal protection \n     requires, I learned that he does not believe in civil rights \n     for all. He believes in quotas, set-asides, and preferences \n     based on race and gender. This is not my belief. The person \n     who believes in civil rights for some based on race and \n     gender is a wrong person for this job.\n  She continues:\n\n       And his organization's defense of continuing judicial \n     control of the desegregation of Lowell High School in San \n     Francisco for high admission standards required of students \n     whose admissions are kept at 40 percent . . .\n\n  She particularly mentioned that. This was just a few weeks ago. It is \nthe same comment made by Mrs. Loen that I read earlier about Lowell \nHigh School in San Francisco.\n  Mrs. Allen continues, describing the assault on Proposition 209, the \nCalifornia civil rights initiative. This is what she said:\n\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\n\n       To bolster the assault on 209, Mr. Lee's Legal Defense Fund \n     recruited the Federal Government as his ally. First, he filed \n     a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of \n     Federal Contract Compliance Program and said that the decline \n     in minority admissions at the University of California \n     violates affirmative action rules imposed on Federal \n     contractors.\n\n  This is the university:\n\n       It argued that the lowered admissions reduced the number of \n     minority graduate students that the university might hire in \n     complying with Federal racial preference programs.\n\n  This pushes legal theory, I submit, beyond any reasonable standard. \nThis was for Mr. Lee's use. He is a private attorney now. He gained the \nsupport of his allies in the Department of Labor.\n  Quoting Mrs. Allen:\n\n       Second, although no student had ever complained about \n     discrimination because of Proposition 209 or the University \n     of California regents' vote to end racial preferences in \n     admissions, Mr. Lee's Legal Defense Fund filed a complaint \n     with the United States Department of Education attributing to \n     discrimination the decline in minority admissions and \n     enrollment at select University of California campuses.\n\n  So, Mrs. Allen is making a significant point. What she was saying was \nthat even though a private attorney, Mr. Lee has been adept at inducing \nthe Federal Government to join with him in his legal theory.\n  If confirmed in this position, he will, in fact, be the Federal \nGovernment, and he will have 250 attorneys at his disposal to send out \non whatever cause he might deem appropriate.\n  She goes on to say this:\n\n       A San Francisco school district has been under a consent \n     decree since 1983 because the Legal Defense Fund brought a \n     suit to desegregate the school.\n\n  That is, since 1983, they have had a Federal judge monitoring that \nschool system, I submit Mr. President.\n  She continues:\n\n       Under that decree, Lowell High School, a magnet school, \n     where competition for admission is fierce, operates with a \n     40-percent cap on Chinese students. In addition, the school \n     sets higher admission standards for Chinese students than for \n     any other race or ethnic group. Recently, several Chinese \n     students and their parents challenged that consent decree. \n     But the Legal Defense Fund . . .\n\n  Which I submit is Mr. Lee's organization which he headed in the west:\n\n       . . . the Legal Defense Fund has actively defended the \n     continuing judicial control over the district in the name of \n     desegregation, this despite the adverse impact on Chinese \n     students who would otherwise be admitted to Lowell and \n     against the strong opposition of their parents.\n\n  Chinese-American parents.\n  Mrs. Allen said:\n\n       When the Legal Defense attorney called the consent decree \n     segregation by inclusion, to me it is desegregation by \n     discrimination and exclusion. These examples raise a very \n     important question. As head of civil rights enforcement, will \n     Mr. Lee argue for continued forced busing?\n\n  This lady Sue Au Allen, president of the Pan American-Asian Chamber \nof Commerce--is she anti-Chinese? She is of a Chinese descent. Is she \nantiwomen? Is she anticivil rights? Is she antiminority? I submit no.\n  Serious questions have been raised about this nominee. This use of \nscurrilous attacks has not been coming by those of us who are concerned \nabout nominations. We are talking about real issues. We are talking \nabout real cases. We are talking about the position of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice and what kind of position it will be taking in \nthese cases as the years go by.\n  Those who oppose him, however, have been intemperate at best in those \nremarks, and I hope and pray that they will evaluate that and be more \nresponsive, be more respectful of their colleagues in the future.\n  Let me say this. Incivility is not acceptable. In my opinion, the \nJudiciary Committee over the past decade, over 20 years, 15 or 20 \nyears, has gone through a series of confirmation battles that have not \nbeen healthy. They have not reflected well on the Senate, and they have \nnot done well in analyzing whether or not people should be confirmed. I \nfor one believe we ought to do better. I believe we ought to have a \nhigher standard. I believe we ought to dig in seriously to the nominees \nand what they believe, their integrity, their ability and their legal \nphilosophy. And I think we can do that and sometimes we are going to \nsay no. We hate to. It is no fun to say no to a person who would like \nto have a position of prominence. But that is our position of \nresponsibility and we must face up to it.\n  Let me just say this. Why is it that I am concerned with this \nnomination? There has been a lot of talk about the California civil \nrights initiative, Proposition 209, a very, very important event in \nAmerican history.\n  Basically, what the people of California said is we do not believe in \npreferences. We, in effect, believe that in our State we want the law \nto be very similar and basically the same as what the 14th amendment to \nthe Constitution of United States says. So they really encapsulated the \n1964 Civil Rights Act, and the people of California passed that by a \nsignificant margin.\n  Mr. Lee's organization immediately joined in a challenge to that \nproposition and in fact filed a brief. It is one thing for him to \noppose the proposition when the people are voting on it, to campaign \nabout it, but he went further than that. His organization joined in the \nlitigation to have Proposition 209, which says almost the same thing as \nthe Constitution of the United States, declared unconstitutional, a \nperfectly legitimate referendum declared unconstitutional. And this is \nwhat the court of appeals, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held when \nthey considered Mr. Lee's opinion on Proposition 209.\n  They said this. This is a Federal court:\n\n       As a matter of conventional equal protection analysis --\n\n  Equal protection clause of the 14th amendment--\n\n     there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is \n     constitutional.\n\n  Those are the words of the ninth circuit, the most liberal of the \neleven circuits in this country. Everyone suggests that. That circuit \nflatly rejected Mr. Lee's position, saying there is no doubt about it. \nAnd what is troubling is here you have an attorney seeking to attack \nthe will of the people by bringing in a challenge to the \nconstitutionality of an act that had no basis.\n  The court continued to say:\n\n       After all, the goal of the 14th amendment, to which the \n     Nation continues to aspire, is a political system in which \n     race no longer matters. The 14th amendment, lest we lose \n     sight of the forest for the trees, does not require what it \n     barely permits.\n\n  In other words, it does not require, the 14th amendment does not \nrequire preferences based on a person's race. It barely permits it. \nOnly in the most extreme circumstances, only under the most strict \nscrutiny will a court ever approve an event in America in which we give \na benefit to one person, thereby denying it to another simply because \nof their race.\n  So we have to be honest about this. It is time for us to talk about \nit seriously. We believe--I certainly do--in affirmative action, to go \nout and affirmatively solicit every person to apply, to seek out the \nbest talent, to give people every chance to succeed, but we cannot \ntolerate quotas and set-asides and things of that nature.\n  Well, that is the important issue, Proposition 209, and Mr. Lee, when \nquestioned about it, says it continues to be his position. And at the \nCivil Rights Division of the Department of Justice he would be prepared \nto file a brief on behalf of the United States of America in the \nSupreme Court to declare it unconstitutional. But he would not get that \nopportunity because the Supreme Court refused to even review the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals ruling. The Supreme Court of the United States \nlet it stand, denying certoriori, in effect saying this is a matter not \neven worth our time to consider because the law is so clear, agreeing \ntotally with the ninth circuit's opinion.\n\n  Well, there is another matter of importance, and that is the Supreme \nCourt decision, recent decision in the Adarand case. Adarand dealt with \nthe set-asides in Federal law, that in effect tell Federal Government \nhighway administrators that they must set aside a certain percentage of \nFederal contracts for minority contractors. I earlier read the comments \nof Mr. Cornelius who was the low bidder by $3 million on one of those \ncontracts and had an agreement to hire 25 percent of his subcontractors \nwho would be minorities, and that was rejected because it was not \ngenerous enough. This is the kind of issue with which we are dealing.\n  Adarand said basically that that cannot continue. I would suggest \nthat the Supreme Court is very seriously thinking about this issue, and \nI believe the\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\nSupreme Court has looked down history in America and they have thought \nabout it and they are saying we have got to stop, we have got to get \nout of this business of disbursing the goods and services of America \nbased on what group you belong to. This is not the kind of principle \nupon which our country was founded, and that is what they meant by the \nAdarand decision, and that's why legal scholars consider it of \nthunderous importance, an extremely important decision.\n  OK. How does Mr. Lee feel about that? He opposed the Adarand \ndecision. I asked him, does he still believe it is bad law? He says he \nbelieves it is bad law. He testified he does not agree with it. And he \nsaid something that is particularly troubling about it.\n  In his testimony, Mr. Lee stated that Adarand allowed affirmative \naction programs, which in this case means a kind of set-aside, in \neffect quotas. Sometimes affirmative action means affirmative outreach. \nSometimes it means racial preferences and quotas. It just depends how \nit is used. But in this case we are talking about Adarand which had a \nset-aside in the law to favor some people. He said he thought they were \nlegal under the Adarand decision if conducted in a limited and measured \nway.\n  That is not, Mr. President, what the Court in Adarand said. The Court \nin Adarand said that set-asides like this highway program are \npresumptively unconstitutional and can never be allowed except under \nthe strictest of scrutiny. It is for the most significant of reasons \nthat would justify these kinds of actions.\n  So what troubles me about that, and I know Senator Hatch raised it, \nis it suggests that as the top civil rights lawyer in this country he \nwould not interpret Adarand the way the legal scholars do but would \ninterpret Adarand in a way that would justify him applying the \nresources of the 250 attorneys in the Department of Justice to \nundermine the Adarand decision the Supreme Court has rendered.\n  So let me ask, am I against civil rights to say that? Do I not \nbelieve in civil rights to say that I agree with the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, I agree with the ninth circuit of the United States \nwith regard to Proposition 209? I submit not. I believe in civil rights \nfor everyone and I think most Americans do.\n  I wanted to quote from the words of Congressman Charles Canady who \ntestified before the Subcommittee on Constitution, Federalism and \nProperty Rights of the Judiciary Committee just a few days ago \nactually. And this is what he says, Congressman Canady from Florida:\n\n       If we go back to 1961, when President Kennedy promulgated \n     the original Executive order on affirmative action, it was \n     clear in that Executive order that steps were to be taken to \n     reach out to all parts of the community to bring people into \n     the pool of applicants for opportunities, but that people \n     were to be treated without regard to their race. That \n     specific language was used in the Executive order.\n       So I believe that Senator McConnell's proposal encompassing \n     a number of outreach elements is [what we should do].\n\n  Congressman Canady continued:\n\n       Now, this system of set-asides [which was legally \n     challenged in the Adarand decision] that is in place has been \n     described as a remedial system. The problem with this system, \n     however, is that it provides benefits to people who have not \n     demonstrated that they are victims of any specific wrongdoing \n     and it imposes cost on individuals who have been demonstrated \n     to be guilty of no wrongdoing themselves.\n       Do we get that? It provides benefits to people who do not \n     demonstrate that they have been harmed and it provides costs \n     on those who have not been demonstrated to have done anything \n     wrong. Is it against civil rights to think such a policy is \n     not good?\n\n  Congressman Canady continued, I think saying it well:\n\n       I believe if we step back from this system [step back, like \n     the Supreme Court is doing] which was put in place with the \n     best of intentions [these set-asides and preferences and \n     quotas] we have to conclude on the basis of our history as \n     Americans that racial distinctions are inherently pernicious. \n     It is fundamentally wrong [Congressman Canady continued] for \n     our country to divide this country into groups based on race \n     and gender and then award benefits to some people because \n     they belong to the right group and deny benefits to other \n     people because they belong to the wrong group. That is \n     inconsistent with our fundamental American values. It is \n     inconsistent with the way our Government should treat its \n     citizens.\n\n  He concluded:\n\n       I believe that the American people are becoming more and \n     more weary of this failed system of race and gender \n     preferences. They want to reaffirm the promise of America, \n     that all Americans will be treated as individuals who are \n     equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n  Well, I thought a good while about this. I think it was important to \ndo so. I will just say this. We cannot end discrimination by practicing \ndiscrimination. That is fundamental. Make no mistake, when you benefit \none person because of the color of his or her skin you are depriving \nanother person because of the color of his or her skin. It is just that \nsimple. It can be no other way. And the courts are agreeing with this. \nAnd Mr. Lee is outside the mainstream of judicial thought in America \ntoday. His opinion, opposing the most important Adarand decision, \nrepresents that he opposes the position of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. For that reason I feel compelled to vote ``no'' on his \nnomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n                              N O T I C E\n\nIncomplete record of Senate proceedings.

Mr. President, in the dozen or so weeks between the end of \nthis congressional session and the start of the next, members might \nprofitably encourage their staffs to pursue a matter of great \nimportance to the preservation of the Senate's institutional memory. I \nrefer to the archiving of senators' noncurrent office files and \npersonal papers.\n  I recognize that most of us have enough to engage our attention \nthinking about the demands of today and tomorrow, without worrying a \ngreat deal about the records of yesterday. That's why the intersession \nrecess offers a useful opportunity to address this important \nhousekeeping matter. Our records deserve professional attention--not \njust in the final days of our Senate careers--but throughout our entire \nservice here. The current proliferation of records in electronic \nformats makes this updating particularly urgent. Whether on disks, \ntapes, or paper, these records, if properly managed, will take their \nplace as vital historical resources in the decades ahead. By planning \nnow, senators can minimize preservation costs while maximizing research \nvalue at the time these records are opened for research and other \neducational purposes.\n  Many senators have already made commitments to home-state educational \ninstitutions for staged transfer of their non-current records. For \nthose who have not, I urge you to seek the assistance of the Senate \nArchivist within the Office of the Secretary of the Senate. What better \nway could there be to join those who have come before us in preserving \nand enriching the documentary resource of this great institution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12283-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12283-S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THANKS TO MAJOR GENERAL LANSFORD E.

He is an extraordinary officer who, \nthrough dedication and expertise, has built an impressive record of \nachievement throughout his 28 years of service to our nation.\n  One of the most exceptional aspects of his background is that General \nTrapp is from my home state of South Dakota. In fact, Lanny and I were \nclassmates at South Dakota State University, where we both participated \nin the Reserve Officer Training Corps program. We also entered the Air \nForce the same year, in 1969, amidst the turmoil of the Vietnam war.\n  I am proud of the fact that General Trapp has progressed to a \nleadership position of such significance because I believe it is a \ntribute not only to him and his family, but to the entire state of \nSouth Dakota. While Lanny is currently a long way from his hometown of \nBrookings, South Dakota, he has served our state and our country well \nthroughout his career and particularly during his time in Washington.\n  His judgment and unquestionable integrity have formed the bedrock of \nthe maturing relationship between the Air Force and the Senate, \nfacilitating the modernization the Air Force has pursued in the post-\ncold war era. General Trapp has worked tirelessly to make the senior \nleadership of the Air Force easily accessible to Members and staff, \nknowing well the importance of constant dialogue. He has always been \nvery responsive to inquiries and is a frequent and welcome visitor to \nthe Hill. Under his leadership, General Trapp's Legislative Liaison \norganization enhanced its already strong reputation for responsiveness, \nthoroughness and accuracy when providing information on Air Force \npolicies and programs to various committees, Senators and their staffs. \nHe and his staff in the Russell Senate Office Building and in the \nPentagon deserve to be commended for their hard work and dedication.\n  General Trapp has been particularly responsive and helpful to me \nduring the past two years. As many of my colleagues know, South Dakota \nis the proud home of Ellsworth Air Force Base and the B-1 bomber. \nGeneral Trapp has been very responsive to questions and concerns I have \nraised from time to time, and the Air Force simply could not find a \nmore fair and understanding representative. He willingly traveled with \nme to Ellsworth on more than one occasion.\n  It has been both an honor and a pleasure for me to work with General \nTrapp during his tenure as Deputy Director and then Director of Air \nForce Legislative Liaison. He has set new standards of excellence in \nthese critically important positions, and all of us in the Senate are \nindebted to him for his efforts. More importantly to me, Lanny has \nbecome a good friend. My wife, Linda, and I congratulate General Trapp \non his nomination to be a Lieutenant General in the Air Force and wish \nhim and his wife, Nancy, great health and happiness as they embark on \ntheir new assignment. We will miss them both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12283-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FISCAL YEAR 1998 LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION \n                    APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an amendment that \nthis body passed as part of the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations bill. That amendment, S.1101, would have put \ninto motion a strategy aimed at confronting fetal alcohol syndrome \n(FAS), the number one cause of mental retardation in this country. Even \nthough S.1101 was a modest, non-controversial and wholly beneficial \naddition to the Labor/HHS bill, the House refused to accept it. There \nwere no funding trade-offs involved, no unresolved policy concerns. \nInstead, the measure was killed because of ``jurisdictional issues.'' \nTo quote the conference report: ``This matter is one that is more \nappropriately considered by the authorizing committees; those \ncommittees have objected to the inclusion of the provision in the \nconference agreement.''\n  Mr. President, those committees have had five years to consider this \nmatter. That's how long there have been bills in both the House and \nSenate that would do exactly what the amendment aimed to do. While \nCongress considers this matter, tens of thousands of children are being \ndenied the capacity to live a normal life. Tens of thousands of \nfamilies are confronting overwhelming obstacles as their children drift \nin and out of hospitals, mental health institutions, detention centers, \nand substance abuse treatment.\n  We can label it inertia, a lack of understanding, or bad timing, but \nthere is no sufficient explanation for the lack of attention that has \nbeen paid to this issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol \neffects (FAE) are 100 percent preventable, yet new cases are identified \nevery single day. Up to 12,000 children are born with FAS in the United \nStates each year. Thousands more are born with FAE. The incidence of \nFAS may be as high as one per 100 in some Native American communities.\n  FAS and FAE are characterized by multiple physical, mental and \nbehavioral problems, handicaps that interfere in tragic ways with a \nchild's ability to live a normal, productive life.\n  The costs associated with caring for individuals with FAS and FAE are \nstaggering. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates \nthat the lifetime cost of treating an individual with FAS is almost \n$1.4 million. The total cost in terms of health care and social \nservices to treat all Americans with FAS was estimated at $2.7 billion \nin 1995. This is an extraordinary and unnecessary expense.\n  Aggressive action to fight back against FAS--to detect it and prevent \nit and help FAS children and their families cope with it--is long \noverdue. I am asking this body to work with me to ensure that we pass \nmeaningful, targeted FAS legislation next year. Frankly, I am not \nparticularly concerned about which protocols we follow to get us from \nhere to there. Those details pale in comparison to the magnitude of the \nproblem confronting us and the opportunities we have missed to address \nit. What I am concerned about is that we finally, finally, get the job \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12284-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12284-S12285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RETIREMENT OF HUMANA CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER DAVID E. JONES\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I'm honored today to salute one of \nKentucky's and this nation's finest business leaders and statesmen, \nDavid A. Jones. David will soon be retiring as Chief Executive Officer \nof Humana Inc., the company he co-founded over 36 years ago.\n  David is one of this country's all-time great business leaders. His \ncareer has been marked by a deep commitment to high principles and \ncommunity service and he will leave behind a very distinguished history \nof service to Kentucky and the nation. Fortunately, Kentucky and the \nhealth care industry won't be losing his guidance entirely as David \ncontinues as chairman of the board of directors of Humana.\n  A native of Louisville, David earned a bachelor's degree from the \nUniversity of Louisville in 1954, where he won the outstanding senior \naward. He also became a Certified Public Accountant that same year. \nAfter three years of service in the U.S. Navy, he entered Yale \nUniversity, earning a law degree (JD) in 1960, while also serving on \nthe economics faculty from 1958 to 1960. David also holds honorary \ndoctorates from the Chicago Medical School, the University of \nLouisville, Transylvania University and the Claremont Graduate School.\n  In 1961, David and another young lawyer, Wendell Cherry, discussed \nways to build and operate a new kind of nursing home--one that would \ntreat its elderly patients not only with dignity and respect, but with \na kind of personal attention rarely seen in nursing homes of that time. \nThe nursing home was called Heritage House and was located in \nLouisville. The company began to grow and add additional facilities. \nEventually, the company, then known as Extendicare, became the largest \nnursing home company in America with more than 40 facilities. As the \ncompany continued to grow, it eventually divested itself of all nursing \nhomes to concentrate on the hospital business.\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\n  To reflect the company's new direction, the corporate name was \nchanged to Humana Inc. in January of 1974. During David's tenure as \nchief executive, Humana Inc. became one of the nation's leading health \ncare companies. The company pioneered the measurement of hospital \nquality and productivity to achieve consistent care for every patient.\n  In 1982, Humana established its Centers of Excellence program, \ndesignating hospitals that offered unsurpassed specialty care by \ncombining research and education with state-of-the-art treatment. While \nthe Humana Heart Institute International at Humana Hospital-Audubon \nbecame renowned for its pioneering research into the artificial heart, \nother Centers of Excellence were developed in the specialties of \ndiabetes, neuroscience, orthopedics, and spinal injury care.\n  David continued to lead Humana as dramatic changes occurred in the \nhospital industry in the 1980s. In 1984, Humana created a family of \nflexible health care plans. The health insurance side of the company \ngrew and matured, and in 1993, Humana separated its hospital and health \ninsurance divisions. Although no longer in the hospital business, \nHumana Inc. continues to be one of the leading health care companies in \nthe nation.\n  In addition to his outstanding business acumen, David is also a \ndeeply committed humanitarian who created the Humana Foundation, a \ncharitable organization committed to the arts, education and other \ncauses around the world. In part because of that support, the Humana \nFoundation won the 1996 Business in the Arts Award given by the \nBusiness Committee for the Arts and Forbes Magazine.\n  David has helped build affordable housing in marginal neighborhoods, \nput computers in schools, supported an international theater festival \nin Louisville, helped launch an African-American business venture fund, \nhelped attract the Presbyterian Church USA headquarters to the river \nfront, and for a brief time in the 1970s, brought professional \nbasketball to Louisville. More recently, he helped raise nearly \n$750,000 in flood aid for Louisville residents and businesses by \npledging to match contributions from local companies or business \nleaders.\n  During his tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Humana, David worked \nhard for his employees, fought for his beliefs, and strived to make our \nnation an even better place. He has been a tireless promoter of \nbusiness in Kentucky, and his efforts undoubtedly helped to make the \nstate an important part of the burgeoning national economy.\n  Nationally, his opinions and actions help set the direct for health \ncare policy, not just in this country, but all over the world. He has \nbeen the architect of many initiatives in this country, but has also \nbeen a leader in improving and expanding health care delivery in \nRomania. In a joint venture with Baylor Medical Center in Texas, Humana \nis helping rebuild the health care system in Romania, which is \nstruggling to survive as a new democracy.\n  A compassionate heart has kept him humble and grounded, his path \nstraight, his words true, and his conviction undiminished. The career \nof David Jones should be an model to all those who aspire to succeed in \nbusiness. Indeed, David is a man of integrity, ability, and dedication, \nand we commend him for the great service he has rendered this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I know that all the Members of the Kentucky \ndelegation, and my colleagues in the Senate, wish David good health and \ngreat happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12284-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING DAVID E. LARKIN FOR EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I wanted to take just a moment to commend \nDavid E. Larkin for his extraordinary leadership, motivation and \ndirection in the development of the Dan Beard Council, Boy Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  Larkin has recruited, developed and motivated the Executive Board of \nthe Dan Beard Council, BSA, representing one of the most prestigious \nphilanthropic Youth Service Organizations in Greater Cincinnati and \nNorthern Kentucky.\n  During his tenure on the council, he succeeded in improving the \nquality of life among the youth of that area by creating Challenge \nCamp, where more than 1,000 ``at risk'' youth were able to experience \nthe cherished values of Scouting.\n  His imagination and creativity brought into being ``The Scout Family \nJamboree,'' an event attracting some 45,000 attendees, showcasing not \nonly Scouting, but numerous community activities and events.\n  Over the years, Larkin has served the greater community by enriching \nthe relationships between the Scouts, the United Way and Community \nChest, increasing both awareness and funding. He also created alliances \nbetween the Boy Scouts and the Greater Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky \nSchools and Educational Institutions, resulting in ``Learning for \nLife'' and Career Explorer programs.\n  His exceptional leadership and vision provided to be the catalyst for \napproval of a comprehensive $14.5 million Camp Re-Development Capital \nCampaign to construct a 25 acre lake, Cub World and Boy Scout Camp.\n  Larkin has provided the leadership, high standards, the means and the \nmethods necessary to expand the Scouting program to where it now \ninvolves a record 65,000 youths and adults annually throughout \nSouthwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky. He has dedicated his life to the \nconcepts of duty, honor and country central to the mission of the Boy \nScouts and I know that the entire community will miss his guiding \nforce.\n  Mr. President, let me close by thanking David Larkin for his \ncommitment over the years to instilling the values of this country \nthrough the Boy Scout program. I know I speak for all Kentuckians when \nI say that his work will be felt by generations of Boy Scouts to come. \nWe wish your much luck in all your future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12285-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12285-S12286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A VERMONTER MOVES ON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the lifetime of service that Mary Miller has given to the \nstate of Vermont. I have been fortunate to have had Mary in my \nMontpelier office, working for the people of Vermont for 17 years. \nAnyone involved in rural development, small business, or affordable \nhousing has undoubtedly seen for themselves her whole-hearted \ncommitment to these issues which are so important for our small state. \nEven before joining my staff Mary was working to improve the lives of \nher fellow Vermonters through her service to Common Cause, and as a \nstate legislator for her home base in Rutland County.\n  It is difficult to put into words Mary's boundless energy, her \nenthusiasm--and her ability to simultaneously make Vermonters feel good \nabout what they are doing while helping them achieve their goals. At \ntimes I have felt that members of Congress are only Constitutional \nimpediments to our staff. Mary is a humbling case in point. I have met \nhundreds of thousands of Vermonters over the past 25 years. I have been \nto every corner of the state many times over--and it's fair to say that \noften more people recognize Mary than recognize me. Sometimes it is not \neven close.\n  There is no mud season too miserable, no pothole too large, and no \nsnowfall too deep to keep Mary from meeting with Vermonters. I remember \none spring in particular when she traveled for miles over muddy, rutted \ndirt roads to meet a small business owner who had benefitted from one \nof the revolving loan funds I have worked to set up around the state. \nAs I recall, in this particular case the owner was not home, but his \ndog was and gave her quite a reception. He may be the only revolving \nloan fund recipient in the state that Mary has not met, and even his \ndog would recognize her.\n  Despite this outreach schedule, that would put many of her \nchronologically challenged co-workers to shame, Mary has always found \ntime for fun. Even as she approaches the age when more conventional \npeople are thinking about retirement, Mary is planning her next white \nwater rafting trip.\n  I know I am not alone in saying that I will miss her lively presence \nin the office. I will miss her colorful reports on the weather which \nclose out the daily press brief and her unflagging\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\nsupport for the Red Sox. But I don't plan on letting her get away too \neasily--I have Mary's e-mail address and it will be well used.\n  Mary is not retiring, just shifting her focus to new challenges, such \nas the mountains yet to be climbed, rivers yet to be rafted, \ngrandchildren yet to be born. I know that her husband Sam is looking \nforward to seeing more of Mary as much as I regret seeing her leave. \nVermont is lucky to have had Mary to itself for all these years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12285-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12286-S12288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNITED STATES-SPAIN COUNCIL\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the relationship between the United States \nand Spain is the oldest one in North America. Almost 500 years ago--in \n1513--Spanish Explorer Ponce de Leon and his crew in search of a \nFountain of Youth discovered North America. What they found was a \ntreasure of a different kind--a land that Ponce de Leon named ``La \nFlorida.''\n  In the four centuries since then, the histories of the United States \nand Spain have been inextricably linked. While there have been periods \nof estrangement and even hostility, the United States and Spain are \n``natural allies.'' As we approach the end of this century, the \ncultural, political, and economic ties between the United States and \nSpain have never been stronger, nor more mutually beneficial.\n  This reinvigorated relationship is especially visible in the active \nrelations, frequently in close collaboration, of Spain and the United \nStates in Latin America.\n  To build on this exceptional period of positive relationship, the \nUnited States--Spain Council was formed in May 1996 by Vice President \nAl Gore and the President of Spain, Jose Maria Aznar. The Council was \nformerly established at an organizational meeting held in Toledo, Spain \nin November 1996. The Council established itself as a forum in which \nSpanish and American citizens, including leaders in government \nbusiness, education, and culture could discuss the state of the United \nStates--Spain relationship.\n  In April of 1997 the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the \nFundacion Consejo Espana-Estados Unidos, Mr. Jaime Carvajal and the \nthen Chairman of the United States--Spain Council, Bill Richardson, \nsigned an agreement of the common goals regarding their intent to: \npromote cooperation between Spain and the United States in the \neconomic, trade, business, scientific and cultural fields; improve \nknowledge about each other's country and the image of the United States \nin Spain and of Spain in the United States; propose to their respective \ngovernments actions aimed at developing relations between the two \ncountries and adopt other initiatives which would contribute to the \nprogress and growth of relations between the United States and Spanish \nsocieties.\n  This past October 31 through November 2, 1997 the Council met here in \nWashington for two and one half days and in New York for an additional \nday on November 3, 1997. The meeting was attended by many prominent \nmembers of the Council from both nations, which led to a candid and \nthought provoking discussion of the topics on our agenda.\n  These topics included United States--Spain Trade and Investment \nAnalysis of Direct Investment Practices, Spanish and United States \nimages: Origins and Reasons, Strengthening United States--Spanish Ties, \nthe Role of Civil Society (Educational and Cultural exchanges), \nIntellectual Property and Internet in Spanish.\n  The members of the Council agreed to undertake a challenging agenda \nshort and long objectives, all intended to advance United States and \nSpanish relations.\n  I would like to thank Vice President Al Gore, Spanish Deputy Prime \nMinister of the Economy and Finance, Mr. Rodrigo Rato, Spanish Minister \nof Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abel Matutes, and Stuart E. Eizenstat, US Under \nSecretary for Economic Business and Agricultural Affairs, and other \ndistinguished presenters, for their meaningful participation in our \nmeeting.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank the two Executive Directors of \nour Council, Ambassador Diego Asencio and his Spanish counter part, \nEmilio Cassinello Auban. Ambassador Asencio and his Assistant, Elia \nGarcia-McComie did an outstanding job of bringing together all the \ningredients essential to a productive meeting.\n  It is important that my colleagues in the Senate and the people of \nthe United States understand this special relationship, which is old in \nhistorical terms and yet new because it is being reinvigorated by this \nrenewed attention to its importance. We must recognize that the United \nStates with its growing Spanish speaking population, is a logical \nbridge between Latin America and Spain. We must take advantage of this \nmoment in history to strengthen cultural and educational ties as well \nas promoting investment opportunities for both countries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of speeches at the meeting by \nVice President Gore, Mr. Rato, Mr. Eizenstat, and the entire text of \nMr. Matutes' address be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Excerpts of Remarks of Vice President Al Gore\n\n       Thank you so much.\n       You know, Bob Graham is truly a national treasure. He has \n     done so much to nurture the friendship between Spain and the \n     United States, and has been such a leader in building a \n     thriving new era in the affairs of our hemisphere. I am \n     honored to be here with him today.\n       When President Aznar and I met last year, we looked forward \n     to the day when a vanguard of key leaders from business and \n     academics, politics and culture would meet to discuss issues \n     of common concern.\n       What we do here today is an important new step in the \n     evolving relationship between our peoples and our nations--a \n     relationship that dates back hundreds of years of rich \n     history.\n       Our historic ties, strong alliance and shared ideals \n     underpin an ambitious cooperative effort in support of peace, \n     democracy and prosperity in important areas such as the \n     former Yugoslavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern \n     Europe and Latin America.\n       Each of you here this morning represents a specific aspect \n     of the American-Spanish relationship--whether in diplomacy \n     and government, business, culture, education, the media or in \n     any of a host of other endeavors.\n       The variety of this group mirrors the complexity of our \n     exchanges and drives home the point that it is in our daily \n     business, public or private lives, that our nations' bonds \n     are created and affirmed. Some many of the important national \n     issues we address have international ramifications. Doing our \n     jobs well means doing them well together.\n       All this, ladies and gentlemen, can be summed up in one \n     sentence: U.S.-Spanish relations are excellent now, and \n     poised to become even more productive in the coming years.\n       I applaud your work; and I salute your commitment to a new \n     era, and a new century of friendship between Spain and the \n     United States.\n       Buena Suerte, and Good Luck!\n\nExcerpts of a Speech by the Spanish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister \n                of the Economy and Finance, Rodrigo Rato\n\n\n          ``The spanish economy on the threshold of the euro''\n\n       It is a great honor for me to have the chance to close this \n     Third Spain-United States forum. Previous sessions have \n     demonstrated the great utility of these platforms, involving \n     a wide range of personalities from all fields, in enhancing \n     dialog between the two countries and promoting greater \n     tapproachment and mutual understanding.\n       In a globalized work such as today's, marked by freedom of \n     exchange and the mobility of factors, ti is clear that there \n     can be no isolated response to the problems affecting our \n     economies. The global interrelation which surrounds us \n     assesses the need for coordinating mechanisms which are \n     sufficient to meet the demands of the international economy \n     effectively and with assured success.\n       EMU implies for Spain an economic policy which would have \n     to be pursued in any case (even if there were no EMU), given \n     the challenge of globalization and competition with North \n     America and in the Asian Pacific region. EMU represents \n     macro-economic stability, a necessary pre-requisite in the \n     creation of jobs.\n       EMU is a strategic challenge. The point of no return for \n     the creation of EMU and for Spain's participation has been \n     reached. For Spain, there is no strategic alternative to our \n     full participation from the outset. EMU will not however be a \n     panacea that will resolve all our problems with no effort on \n     our part. Moderation of production costs, restraints of \n     public spending and tax policies to format saving and \n     investment are key elements to the creation of jobs.\n       Trade unions and employers have recently given ample \n     evidence of their sense of responsibility in dealing with the \n     historical challenge posed for Spain by EMU. Spanish society \n     and the Government are certain that they will be up to the \n     task and that social consensus will be maintained. The \n     Government considers this social consensus to be fundamental \n     to its economic policy strategy for stability and job \n     creation.\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\n       As revealed by the figures and the results of the last \n     year, the Spanish economy has shown considerable maturity, \n     adapting and reacting positively to the changes made to its \n     system. Spain is, at this time, an adaptable economy, \n     increasingly flexible, and with a dynamism which I do not \n     doubt will increase as we pursue the structural reforms under \n     way.\n\nExcerpts of Remarks for Under Secretary Eizenstat at U.S.-Spain Council \n                                 Lunch\n\n\n                      u.s.-spanish trade relations\n\n       It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the State \n     Department today. I am honored to host this event which marks \n     the first meeting in the United States of the U.S.-Spain \n     Council. I want especially to congratulate all those who have \n     helped make this meeting possible. I believe this group has a \n     vital role to play in the New Transatlantic Agenda and in \n     building and strengthening essential contacts between our two \n     countries.\n       The overall relationship between Spain and the United \n     States can best be characterized as one of increased mutual \n     trust and cooperation, especially during the past decade. We \n     value Spain's commitment to strengthened transatlantic ties \n     and desire to strengthen points of contact in many areas--\n     political, military and economic. Spain has courageously \n     taken a leadership role on many of the most challenging and \n     demanding issues before Europe today--peacekeeping in Bosnia \n     and the Middle East, development of a Mediterranean \n     initiative, the expansion of NATO, and improved transatlantic \n     trade. It was Spain that was most outspoken in its opposition \n     to the undemocratic Castro regime in Cuba. Spain's leadership \n     and initiative made it possible to create consensus among \n     governments, the private sector and nongovernmental \n     organizations on ways to promote democracy and freedom in \n     Cuba.\n       The relationship between Spain and the United States \n     remains a partnership between equals who agree on the basic \n     principles that will help achieve the goal of a New \n     Transatlantic Marketplace. This is demonstrated here today by \n     the number of important U.S. and Spanish business and \n     government representatives committed to continuing an honest \n     and open dialogue on these issues.\n       Once again, let me welcome you to the State Department and \n     encourage your successful collaboration.\n\n\n      address by the minister of foreign affairs mr. abel matutes\n\n       Mr. Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Under Secretary of \n     State for Economic Business and Agricultural Affairs, Mr. \n     Ambassador, Chairmen of the United States-Spain Council, \n     Ladies and Gentlemen: Today I visit Washington once again, on \n     the occasion of the III Forum, organized by the U.S.-Spain \n     Council, an initiative that rests on society, sponsored from \n     the outset by the President of the Spanish Government and \n     Vicepresident Gore, as a dynamic contribution to the \n     cooperation between our countries. We must congratulate \n     ourselves for the continuity this open and informal dialogue \n     has attained, a dialogue which brings together businessmen, \n     legislators, scholars, professionals and politicians from \n     Spain and the U.S.\n       The III meeting of the Forum--the first to be held in the \n     United States--has been preceded by two previous ones: \n     Seville in 1995 and last year in Toledo. It is with utmost \n     satisfaction that we Spaniards now review certain predictions \n     made in Seville and Toledo. At the close of 1995, cautious \n     predictions envisaged the possibility of Spain being in the \n     first group of countries to enter the E.M.U. and inaugurate \n     the movement towards the euro. As a conclusion to the debate \n     on the Spanish economy, Seville's records state that: ``the \n     Spanish economy will continue to grow relatively strongly for \n     the next couple of years, the underlying concern being \n     whether or not Spain will meet the Maastricht convergence \n     criteria''. One year later, in November 1996, the Toledo \n     report literally stated that ``the markets judge that Spain \n     has a 70% chance of joining the E.M.U. on schedule''. Today, \n     scarcely twelve months after these predictions, neither the \n     economists, nor the politicians nor the markets leave any \n     room for doubt. Spain will be on time for this crucial \n     economic and political rendezvous, and will belong to the \n     group of countries that will lead the E.U. into the coming \n     millennium.\n       It is obvious that, as members of the E.U., political and \n     economic convergence within the process of construction of \n     Europe is for us of paramount importance. This does not \n     exhaust, however, our foreign policy options. Spain can today \n     envisage being present simultaneously in all those \n     international scenarios, where necessary to defend its \n     national interests. This allows me to affirm, without \n     reservations, that the Spanish foreign policy has multiple \n     essential goals that are perfectly compatible. In this sense, \n     Europe does not preempt Latinamerica and even less so our \n     concerns for the Mediterranean; convergence with the E.U. is \n     not unreconcilable with the transatlantic common goals, \n     bilaterally with the United States and multilaterally, within \n     the E.U. and N.A.T.O.\n       In the economic field, the fact is that the intensification \n     of our relationship with member countries of the European \n     Union has reduced the relative weight of trade and investment \n     between the United States and Spain. Notwithstanding, the \n     global value of our exchanges reflects a first-class \n     relationship with the United States. Our trade flows top the \n     10 billion dollar mark. The United States is our most \n     important trade partner outside the E.U. It is clear that the \n     balance is tilted in favor of the United States--6.5 billion \n     dollars against 3.6 billion dollars in 1996--, compelling us \n     to redouble the efforts to reach a more balanced export-\n     import ratio, surmounting tariff barriers and the socalled \n     ``equivalent effect measures''. The image factor, --or the \n     lack thereof, rather than its shortcomings--, plays a \n     relevant role in the Spanish exports to the United States, a \n     fact which has drawn the Council's justified attention. The \n     analysis of the origins and solutions to the absence of a \n     Spanish image in the United States may well be a substantial \n     contribution of this Washington Forum.\n       In turn, Spanish investment in the U.S. market is growing. \n     With an annual volume ranging between 300 and 400 million \n     dollars, it accounts for 5% of Spanish investments abroad. We \n     must not forget either the decisive role played by U.S. \n     investments in the Spanish development in terims of \n     contributing technology innovation, occupational training and \n     job creation in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Currently U.S. \n     financial investments in the Spanish stock exchange are of \n     considerable importance. Statistics show that more than 500 \n     U.S. corporations are present today in the Spanish economy, \n     the eighth in the world in terms of industrial output, with a \n     G.D.P. that exceeds five hundred billion dollars, which makes \n     Spain the top medium in-come country.\n       Many of these, import, export and investment companies are \n     represented in the U.S.-Spain Council, and their Chairmans \n     and CEOs are here today to participate in this III Forum. The \n     Program for discussion of this Forum has scheduled an \n     interesting session on ``joint ventures''. Their primary \n     field of action is obviously in this hemisphere. The \n     possibilities of success of these Spanish-American joint \n     ventures, particularly in basic areas such as infrastructure, \n     services and finance are increased by the affinity of the \n     Spanish culture, by the fact that Spain is the first European \n     investor in Latin America, and by the existence of a \n     sophisticated and complex network of cooperation agreements \n     between Spain and Latin American countries. The Latin \n     American experience can be obviously useful in other regions \n     and markets, be they European, mediterranean or Asian.\n       In short, the potential of economic interests requires both \n     Governments to promote and encourage the transatlantic \n     business dialogue and to increase our exchanges. The creation \n     of the United States-Spain Council is a step in this \n     direction. Our dual convergence with the United States, both \n     bilaterally and as a member of the E.U., must be regarded in \n     the framework of the New Transatlantic Agenda that President \n     Clinton signed in Madrid and that Undersecretary of State \n     Eizenstat referred to as ``the roadmap of our relationship \n     into the XXI Century'', not only in the economic field, but \n     also in the field of foreign policy and security understood \n     in its widest sense. In this context, the Spanish Government \n     has given proof of its willingness--which I reiterate today--\n     of pioneering in Europe the ``habit of consultation'' in \n     Europe, in my view the cornerstone of this New Transatlantic \n     Agenda.\n       In the cultural field, our relations continue to advance, \n     but the volume of the Spanish presence in the United States \n     is still insufficient. Notwithstanding, our cultural heritage \n     is among the most important in the world; the artistic \n     creativity of the Spanish people has produced and continues \n     to produce exceptional works; and our language is a work of \n     art of the ancestral living and daily communication we share \n     with 400 million people. Of these, nearly 30 million live \n     within the borders of the United States, making this country \n     the fifth-ranking Spanish-speaking country in the world.\n       Where do we then stand with regard to our cultural \n     relations?\n       The answer is not as satisfactory as it could and should \n     be, even though new means and mechanisms have been created to \n     open significant perspectives for the increase of our \n     cultural exchanges. We witness growing levels of cooperation \n     in the field of education: within twelve to eighteen months \n     there will be 2000 Spanish teachers in American high schools, \n     two Cervantes Institutes, in addition to New York and \n     Chicago, a greater number of privately funded scholarship \n     programs, including post-graduate students such as Spain-\n     U.S.A. 2000. The expectations are ambitious and we should \n     continuously stimulate them, especially in a country where \n     65% of all students choose Spanish as a second language, \n     including the daughters of both President Clinton and Vice-\n     President Gore. New technologies and media, the promotion by \n     audio-visual means of Spanish cultural expressions, the \n     introduction of the Spanish language in the Internet--another \n     subject included in the program of discussion of the III \n     Forum--, in sum, the whole arsenal of modern communication \n     should be used in a tightly coordinated strategy, to achieve \n     a widespread presence of Spain in the United States, \n     including, naturally, tourism and the healthy Mediterranean \n     diet.\n       Taking all this into account, I believe that the engagement \n     of society in this task is absolutely essential. This is why \n     I am so pleased by the fact that the United States-Spain \n     Council has, among its specific goals,\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\n     that of promoting our relations with the Hispanic community \n     in the U.S. I am particularly encouraged by the fact that \n     this will be one of the issues to be discussed in this III \n     Forum, both in the context of education and promotion of \n     people to people links as well as from the perspective of \n     image and mutual understanding. In fact, the U.S.-Spain \n     Council which owes much of its existence to the talent and \n     the perseverance of Ambassador Bill Richardson is, in itself, \n     a good example of the special predisposition that Spaniards \n     and Hispanics share to understand each other.\n       Finally, I would like to make reference to the third \n     convergence that makes our relationship unique: the security \n     and defense issues, the military component of the Spanish-\n     American ties. Historically, Spain has evolved from \n     contributing to the struggle for American independence 200 \n     years ago, to its accession to the Washington Treaty in 1982 \n     and common membership in N.A.T.O. It can even be said that, \n     since 1975, the major change in our growing exchanges with \n     the American Government and society has been a progressive \n     reduction of the military issue in the relationship as a \n     whole. We are no longer primarily a military ally, as we have \n     become above all a partner in the International Community, \n     engaging in excellent and extensive political, economic and \n     cultural relations, that do not, however, exclude the \n     security and defense link.\n       The N.A.T.O. Summit held in Madrid last July, was a crucial \n     moment in the design of a new post-Cold War N.A.T.O., both in \n     its internal renovation and its external adaptation. Spain \n     and the United States share a common view in practically all \n     issues: the new design of the command structure; the \n     development of the European Identity in Security and Defense, \n     involving the effective participation of the W.E.U.; the full \n     support to the new Council of Euro-Atlantic Association; the \n     enlargement understood as a historical challenge that demands \n     an undeferable response and as a evolving process that \n     began with three countries but has been left open to the \n     future; the full support to the new Council of the Euro-\n     Atlantic Association; the N.A.T.O. Russia cooperation, and \n     the special relationship with the Ukraine; the \n     strengthening of the Mediterranean dialogue, and the \n     creation of a Group for Cooperation in the Mediterranean.\n       Consequently, we have arrived at a juncture in which we \n     feel that the transformation of the current model of our \n     presence in the renewed Alliance, and our entrance in the new \n     command structure is deemed advisable. We believe that the \n     necessary adjustments are practically concluded, in a \n     conceptual design that is acceptable both to Spain and to the \n     Other N.A.T.O. partners. We trust that this decision will be \n     formalised next December, without undue interference from any \n     extraneous bilateral dissension, foreign to the Alliance, \n     which ought to be solved in other fora.\n       Ladies and Gentleman;\n       Our world is irrevocably and unquestionably different. \n     Globalization--of markets, of finance, of technology, of \n     challenges--is not an option but a reality. International \n     relations are predominantly multilateral; the expansion of \n     democracy can be demonstrated; the proliferation of new \n     conflicts within states, rather than between states, is a \n     proven fact and an unfortunate truth,; and the revolution in \n     communications and information technology is the result of \n     the most significant and drastic technological changes since \n     the Industrial Revolution.\n       And within such complex and changing framework, that is so \n     contradictory in its inequalities and its fortunes, it seems \n     appropriate that as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain I \n     encourage the United States to continue to be the most \n     visible international spokesman in favour of stability, \n     sustainable development, peace and security. This is not a \n     responsibility that must be carried out alone. Europe must \n     participate since we share a common world, since the United \n     States is a European country and Europe is an Atlantic \n     Continent. This is Spain's understanding which has been \n     postulated numerous times over the last years. The United \n     States can rest assured that in the conflict-stricken \n     scenarios of the world and in the daily life of the \n     international community, it will always find a Spaniard \n     striving towards peaceful co-existence, democracy and the \n     rule of law.\n       This does not imply that no differences exist between the \n     policies of both and countries, or that we will not encounter \n     situations in which, while agreeing on the goals, we dissent \n     on the means. In such a complex and vital relationship, \n     perpetual consensus or systematic unanimity are unattainable. \n     It is in exploring doubts and in the search for alternatives, \n     that the intelligence of thought is expressed. On occasion's, \n     this is the only manner in which partner of good faith can \n     effectively help one another, in a relationship as plural and \n     conditioned by the World's diversity as ours.\n       I would like to end by congratulating, once again, the \n     U.S.-Spain Council for having maintained this initiative and \n     the continuity of its meeting. The ambitious originality and \n     imagination of its members allows us to harbour great \n     expectations about their practical proposals which we shall \n     listen to with great attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12286-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO REV.

I commend LFCS staff for their foresight in choosing \nReverend Keisker to lead their mission. As our Nation looks \nincreasingly for moral guidance in an era of moral decay, Reverend \nKeisker's example provides inspiration for others to follow in building \nfamily life.\n  Anyone ever associated with Reverend Keisker knows of his unique \nspirit and tenacity which has brought about a rich lifetime of \naccomplishments. This special servant of God and man was bestowed a \nhonorary degree of doctor of divinity in 1993 by Concordia Seminary in \nSt. Louis. Reverend Keisker generously gives his time to the Boy \nScouts, Ministerial Alliance, Chamber of Commerce, and Historical \nSociety. His dedication is an enduring example of service, integrity, \nfaithfulness, and love in the highest and best spirit of American \ncitizenship.\n  From Matthew, Chapter 25, Verse 21, ``Well done, my good and faithful \nservant!'' With God's blessing, and the benevolent commitment of Rev. \nWalter J. Keisker as a guiding light, the lutheran family and \nchildren's services will continue to be successful in building a \nstronger family life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12288-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATIONS TO EDITH BARCOMB CELEBRATING HER 88TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto join me in congratulating Edith Barcomb of Springfield, MO, who will \ncelebrate her 88th birthday on November 26. Edith is a truly remarkable \nindividual. She has witnessed many of the events that have shaped our \nNation into the greatest the world has ever known. The longevity of \nEdith's life has meant much more, however, to the many relatives and \nfriends whose lives she has touched over the last 88 years.\n  Edith's celebration of 88 years of life is a testament to me and all \nMissourians. Her achievements are significant and deserve to be \nrecognized. I would like to join Edith's many friends and relatives in \nwishing her health and happiness in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12288-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12288-S12289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   1997: A BANNER YEAR OF WORK FOR SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this past week, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee held its final business meeting of the 1st session \nof the 105th Congress. At that meeting, the committee approved 50 \nnominations as well as three pieces of legislation. This was the \nculmination of an ambitious 1997 agenda which included 97 committee \nmeetings--the first on January 8 when the committee convened to \nconsider the nomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State.\n  With this past week's business meeting, the committee had approved \nand sent to the Senate, in 1997, 119 nominations, approved 1,004 \nForeign Service promotions and reported out 37 pieces of legislation, \nwhile approving 15 treaties. Among the nominations were the Secretary \nof State, numerous Assistant Secretaries of State, and Ambassadors to \nthe United Nations, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Greece, Korea, \nIsrael, and Egypt.\n  But this, Mr. President, does not begin to tell the full story. \nThanks to the able members of the committee staff, hard work of the \ncommittee members--the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members--and \nthanks to the bipartisan spirit which we, all of us, have worked to \nestablish, we have--all of us together--succeeded, in the opinion of, \nat least, two former Secretaries of State, in returning the Foreign \nRelations Committee to top-drawer relevancy for the first time in \ndecades. I believe it is fair to say that, thanks to the joint efforts \nof so many, the committee is today a force to be reckoned with in terms \nof U.S. foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, the most concrete evidence of this rejuvenation came \nin May and June, when the committee wrote and approved sweeping \nbipartisan legislation to reorganize and revitalize the\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\nU.S. foreign policy apparatus, and reform the United Nations. This bill \npassed the Senate by an overwhelming 90 to 5 vote stipulating the \nabolishment of two antiquated temporary Federal agencies--the U.S. \nInformation Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--and \nbrings another--the Agency for International Development--under the \nauthority of the Secretary of State.\n  And, just as importantly, it strikes a grand bargain regarding the \nUnited Nations, paying $819 million in so-called U.S. arrears in \nexchange for deep-seated and meaningful U.N. reforms.\n  In addition, since the August recess, the full committee, and its \nvarious subcommittees, have convened literally dozens of hearings on a \nwide range of foreign policy matters. During the fall months, the \ncommittee began hearings on what will surely be next year's most \nimportant foreign policy debate: The expansion of the NATO alliance.\n  The committee has already held six hearings--beginning with testimony \nfrom Secretary of State Albright--hearings which I believe will have a \nreal impact in ensuring not only that NATO expansion is approved by the \nSenate next spring, but that the plan presented to the Senate for its \nadvice and consent is done the right way, taking into account the \nlegitimate concerns various Senators have presented.\n  It is difficult for me to express in any adequate way my gratitude to \nthe members of this committee for all their efforts this past year. The \nchairmen and ranking members of the various subcommittees have done \nsplendid work in the consideration of all the nominations, the \nbilateral tax treaties that are so important to American industry, and \nto hold oversight hearings on so many important matters.\n  It is because of their work--not Senator Biden's nor mine--that this \ncommittee has been restored to the world stage as an important player \nin American foreign policy. I am proud of them and, it has been a \nprivilege to serve with them on the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12288-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            JUDGE IN MINNESOTA BLOCKS CLASS I DIFFERENTIALS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week Senator Leahy and I addressed \nthe Senate about our concerns and disappointment with the recent order \nby the U.S. District Court of Minnesota which enjoined the Secretary of \nAgriculture from enforcing class I differentials in 28 of the current \n33 Federal milk marketing orders. If the November 3, 1997, ruling \nstands, it will throw the entire milk pricing system into chaos \nthreatening the continued existence of thousands of dairy farms \nnationwide.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that Secretary Glickman move \nimmediately to seek a stay and file an appeal to the court's decision. \nI am joining several of my colleagues in a letter to Secretary Glickman \nto formally request that the U.S. Department of Agriculture appeal the \ndecision. I urge others to contact Secretary Glickman to recommend that \nhe act swiftly in this request as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter \nbeing sent to Secretary Glickman appear in the Record.\n  This ruling should not impact the current reforms of the Federal milk \nmarketing orders with respect to the basic formula price and class I \ndifferentials. It is important that the Department of Agriculture \ncontinue to use sound public policy in determining a pricing structure \nthat is in the best interest of dairy farmers and consumers alike. Both \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives have expressed in \noverwhelming fashion to the Secretary of Agriculture the support and \nimportance of maintaining our class I differentials. Recently, 48 \nSenators wrote to Secretary Glickman supporting class I differentials \nand endorsing the Department's option 1-A proposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter of October 10, \n1997, regarding overwhelming support for option 1-A appear in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, those of us who value dairying in our States should \nrecognize the dangerous precedent of this ruling. The success of an \nappeal to overturn in this case is of vital importance to the survival \nof dairy farmers across this Nation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Glickman: Considering the recent district \n     court decision out of Minnesota, we want to reconfirm our \n     views on milk marketing orders and strongly recommend that \n     the USDA seek a stay and appeal the decision.\n       In reviewing the various options for the pricing of Class 1 \n     fluid milk, it is still our view that Option 1-A is the most \n     viable and economically sound approach to the future pricing \n     of fluid milk.\n       Last month forty-eight Senators and one hundred and \n     thirteen Members of the House of Representatives indicated to \n     you that Option 1-A reflects good public policy necessary for \n     effective milk marketing order reform. Our support for Option \n     1-A is based upon a number of important factors:\n       It recognizes the transportation costs involved in moving \n     fluid milk from the farm to the consumer.\n       It takes into account the importance of balancing the \n     supply and demand for milk, ensuring adequate production to \n     meet all fluid milk needs.\n       It recognizes the costs of producing and marketing milk \n     and, therefore, does not inflict economic hardship on dairy \n     producers in any one region to benefit others.\n       It is sensitive to the need for attracting supplemental \n     milk supplies to regions of the country that occasionally \n     face production deficits.\n       These are some of the reasons that most of the dairy \n     producing regions of the country support Option 1-A for the \n     regional pricing differentials for fluid milk.\n       Under the November 3, 1997, court decision in Minnesota \n     Milk Producers, et al. v. Dan Glickman, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture would be required to end the Class I \n     differentials in the milk marketing order system. If this \n     decision stands, it will throw the entire milk system into \n     chaos threatening the continued existence of thousands of \n     dairy farms nationwide.\n       Appealing the court's ruling is in the best interest of \n     milk producers and consumers across the country.\n       We look forward to your comments and to working closely \n     with you on the federal order reform process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim M. Jeffords.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Glickman: In reviewing the various options \n     for the pricing of Class 1 fluid milk, it is clear that \n     Option 1-A is the most viable and economically sound approach \n     to the future pricing of fluid milk.\n       Option 1-A reflects good public policy necessary for \n     effective milk marketing order reform. Our support for Option \n     1-A is based upon a number of important factors: It \n     recognizes the transportation costs involved in moving fluid \n     milk from the farm to the consumer; it takes into account the \n     importance of balancing the supply and demand for milk, \n     ensuring adequate production to meet all fluid milk needs; it \n     recognizes the costs of producing and marketing milk and, \n     therefore, does not inflict economic hardship on dairy \n     producers in any one region to benefit others; and it is \n     sensitive to the need for attracting supplemental milk \n     supplies to regions of the country that occasionally face \n     production deficits.\n       These are some of the reasons that most of the dairy \n     producing regions of the country support Option I-A for the \n     regional pricing differentials for fluid milk.\n       As part of the reforms to the Basic Formula Price (BFP), we \n     urge the Department to seriously consider partially \n     ``decoupling'' fluid milk prices from the volatile cheese-\n     based pricing system that has resulted in wide fluctuations \n     in milk prices.\n       This pricing system has dramatically reduced farm milk \n     prices and has left permanently high consumer prices. In our \n     view, maintaining price stability is an extremely important \n     order reform goal for both dairy farmers and consumers.\n       We look forward to your comments and in working closely \n     with you on the federal order reform process.\n           Sincerely,\n         James M.

A bill to amend section 485(f)(1)(F) of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 to provide for the disclosure of all criminal incidents \nthat manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender, religion, \nsexual orientation, ethnicity, or disability; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                THE CAMPUS HATE CRIMES RIGHT TO KNOW ACT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, every year, over 14 million students \nand their parents agonize over where to attend college. They spend \nmonths researching schools and visiting campuses in an effort to find \nthe perfect fit. At the top of the list of characteristics students and \ntheir parents look for in a school is a safe learning environment. \nInformation is the key to choosing such an environment. Under current \nlaw, students and their parents do not have access to all the \ninformation necessary to make an informed choice.\n  Current law requires colleges and universities to report statistics \non crimes that occur on their campuses. However, colleges are only \nrequired to report those hate crimes that result in murder, rape, or \naggravated assault. These three categories of crimes only represent 16 \npercent of the total number of hate crimes that occur on college \ncampuses every year. Vandalism, harassment, and simple assault comprise \nthe vast majority of hate crimes. Under current law, however, colleges \nare not required to report these crimes.\n  Current law also does not require colleges and universities to report \nhate crimes against women and the disabled. Thus, parents of daughters \nor disabled students have no idea whether the college to which they \nwill send their children is safe.\n  Students and parents have the right to information about all hate \ncrimes committed on their prospective college campuses. My bill, the \nCampus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, will ensure that they \nhave access to that information.\n  The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act does two very important \nthings: it expands college reporting requirements to include all hate \ncrimes, not just those that result in murder, rape and aggravated \nassault; and, it includes gender and disability in the class protected \nby the reporting requirement. Under current law, colleges need only \nreport hate crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation, and \nethnicity. My bill will cover these four categories plus gender and \ndisability.\n  Our Nation's college campuses should be a refuge from crime, \nparticularly heinous attacks motivated by hatred and bigotry. The \ndisturbing truth, however, is that college campuses are often fertile \nground for bigotry. A recent study done by the Maryland Prejudice \nInstitute reported that 25 percent of minority college students \nattending predominantly white colleges have been victimized by hate. In \n1996, 90 incidents of anti-Semitic activity on college campuses were \nreported to the Anti-Defamation League.\n  In September 1996, 60 Asian-American college students at a California \nuniversity received threats from another student via e-mail messages \nthreatening that all Asian-Americans would be hunted and killed. Under \ncurrent law, this offense would not appear on a campus crime report.\n  The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act will provide students and \ntheir parents with vital information so that they may better protect \nthemselves against such crimes. It will also encourage college \nofficials to raise awareness about these crimes and develop programs \nand strategies to combat them.\n  The damage done by hate crimes goes beyond physical injury. Hate \ncrimes, whether they take the form of painting a swastika on someone's \ndorm room door or gang beating a student believed to be gay, leave the \nvictim feeling fearful, vulnerable, and isolated.\n  Our children are our future. Their college years are among the most \nexciting and formative of their lives. By introducing the Campus Hate \nCrimes Right to Know Act of 1997, I hope to empower students and \nparents with all of the information necessary to ensure that those \nyears are as safe as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that the text of \nthe Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, in its entirety, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISCLOSURE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Campus \n     Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incidence of violence on college campuses based on \n     race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or \n     disability poses a serious national problem;\n       (2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     campuses and is deeply divisive;\n       (3) hate crimes include crimes in which the perpetrator \n     intentionally selects a victim because of the actual or \n     perceived race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, \n     ethnicity, or disability of the victim;\n       (4) existing Federal reporting requirements only require \n     colleges and universities to report hate crimes that result \n     in murder, rape, or aggravated assault;\n       (5) existing reporting requirements are inadequate to deal \n     with the problem of hate\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\n     crimes since the vast majority of hate crimes that occur on \n     college campuses do not result in murder, rape, or aggravated \n     assault;\n       (6) existing reporting requirements are inadequate because \n     the requirements do not require colleges and universities to \n     report hate crimes that target victims because of the \n     victims' gender or disability;\n       (7) omitting certain hate crimes from official campus crime \n     reports may result in a false sense of security among \n     students and apathy from campus officials;\n       (8) omitting certain hate crimes from official campus crime \n     reports deprives students and parents of the students of \n     vital information necessary to protect the students against \n     such crimes and to make informed decisions in choosing a \n     college or university;\n       (9) requiring postsecondary institutions to report all hate \n     crimes that occur on their campuses will provide students and \n     parents of the students with vital information so that the \n     students may better protect themselves against such crimes; \n     and\n       (10) requiring postsecondary institutions to report all \n     hate crimes that occur on their campuses will encourage \n     college officials to raise awareness about such crimes and \n     develop programs and strategies to combat such crimes.\n       (c) Amendment.--Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(1)(F) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignation clauses (i) through (vi) as subclauses \n     (I) through (VI), respectively;\n       (2) by striking ``Statistics'' and inserting ``(i) \n     Statistics''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) Statistics concerning the occurrence on campus, \n     during the most recent calendar year, and during the 2 \n     preceding calendar years for which data are available, of all \n     criminal incidents that manifest evidence of prejudice based \n     on actual or perceived race, gender, religion, sexual \n     orientation, ethnicity, or disability that are reported to \n     campus security authorities or local police agencies.

A bill to amend section 7703 of title 5, United States Code, \nto strengthen the ability of the Office of Personnel Management to \nobtain judicial review to protect the merit system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                THE MERIT SYSTEM PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the subcommittee having jurisdiction \nover civil service issues, I am introducing today, at the request of \nthe administration, legislation that would make two changes to the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978. I introduce this legislation as a \ncourtesy to the administration without taking a position on its merits \nso that it can be given proper consideration and so that concerned \nparties can have the opportunity to comment on its potential effects.\n  The two changes to the Civil Service Reform Act relate to the \nauthority of the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] to seek judicial \nreview of Federal personnel management decisions issued by the Merit \nSystems Protection Board [MSPB] and by arbitrators. The first change \nwould allow OPM 60 days, rather than the 30 days under current law, to \nfile a petition for review of an MSPB final decision with the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The time available for \nemployees to appeal would not be affected by this change.\n  The second change would eliminate the discretion of the Federal \ncircuit to decide whether to hear OPM petitions for review. Currently, \nOPM must file a petition with the Federal circuit and ask the court to \nhear its appeal. If enacted, this change would require the Federal \ncircuit to hear every appeal from a final MSPB decision brought by OPM.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MERIT SYSTEM JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       Section 7703 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(1) by striking ``provision of law,'' \n     and inserting ``provision of law except subsection (d),''; \n     and\n       (2) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in the first sentence, by inserting after ``filing'' \n     the following: ``, within 60 days after the date the Director \n     received notice of the final order or decision of the \n     board,''; and\n       (B) by striking the last sentence.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by section 1 shall take effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and apply to any suit, action, \n     or other administrative or judicial proceeding pending on \n     such date or commenced on or after such date.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1 would eliminate the discretion of the Federal \n     Circuit to decide whether to hear OPM petitions for review. \n     Currently, OPM must file a petition with the Federal Circuit \n     and ask the Court to hear its appeal. This section requires \n     the Federal Circuit to hear every appeal from a final MSPB \n     decision brought by OPM.\n       Section 2 would allow OPM 60 days, rather than the 30 days \n     under current law, to file a petition for review of an MSPB \n     final decision with the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Federal Circuit. The time available for employees to \n     appeal would not be affected by this change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1496. A bill to remove inequities between Congressional and \ncontract employees regarding access to health insurance; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        THE CONGRESSIONAL CONTRACTOR HEALTH INSURANCE EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nprovide employees of congressional contractors the same access to \nhealth coverage as other congressional workers. This bill should have \npassed last year, when I was thwarted in an effort to pass this measure \nas an amendment to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill.\n  Instead, another 12 months have gone by in which workers in this very \nbuilding lack health insurance while you and I and our staffs have \naccess to a wide variety of subsidized health plans.\n  In fact, about 1,900 employees of companies that contract with the \nFederal Government do not have employer-sponsored health insurance. \nEfforts to privatize even more services previously performed by Federal \nGovernment workers will exacerbate this situation.\n  Who are these contractors? They include House restaurant and mailroom \nstaff, electronics technicians, day care providers, accountants, data \nprocessors, and construction and maintenance workers.\n  They are like you and me and others with whom we work side-by-side in \nthe Halls of the Congress, except they don't have the kind of health \nsecurity we take for granted.\n  As we devise new ways to extend health coverage to uninsured children \nand workers between jobs, how can we in Congress allow individuals who \nprepare our meals, repair our equipment, maintain our buildings, and \ncare for our children go without the same coverage that we provide our \nstaff?\n  In good conscience, we can't.\n  That's why I am introducing a bill that would require firms that \ncontract with Congress to offer insurance to their employees. This \nrequirement would apply to firms that employ 15 or more workers, and \nthat have Federal contracts worth over $75,000.\n  These contractors could buy a private health plan, or they could \nselect a plan from FEHBP. In either case, they would be required to \ncontribute to employees' premiums, just as the Federal Government \ncontributes to its workers' coverage.\n  This would ensure that everyone working full-time for Congress has \naccess to high quality, comprehensive coverage.\n  This kind of action is not without precedent.\n  Several years ago, concern about high turnover among Senate daycare \nemployees led the Senate to give these contract workers FEHBP coverage.\n  And Congress has a long history of taking action to guarantee fair \nworking conditions for contract workers. For 65 years, the Davis-Bacon \nAct and other similar measures have guaranteed competitive wages to \nFederal contract workers.\n  This bill complements those efforts.\n  But passing of this measure is not just a humane gesture. It is a \npractical one.\n  Health costs for uninsured workers who become ill are simply shifted \nonto others. They are shifted onto public programs like Medicaid; to \ndoctors and hospitals in the form of charity care; and into the \npremiums paid by those with access to private coverage.\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\n  Clearly, we're all paying, one way or another, for those who have no \ninsurance. And we're paying more than necessary. The uninsured often \nforgo preventive care and early intervention only to end up in an \nemergency room or hospital bed instead.\n  Congress should not tolerate this kind of inefficient cost shifting. \nWe should be setting an example for the rest of the Government and the \nprivate sector.\n  Some may say this measure will reduce the cost savings from \nprivatization. I believe Congress should contract out services \nperformed more efficiently by the private sector. But reducing benefits \nlike health coverage to save money is penny wise and pound foolish. And \neven if outsourcing is the wave of the future, Congress should set an \nexample by protecting rights and benefits of those caught in the \ntransition.\n  Cutting costs by cutting benefits may be easy, but it's not \nefficient, and it's not responsible. Congress should not save money by \ndenying workers a basic benefit.\n  For many years now, Members of Congress have spoken on the floor \nabout the need to extend coverage to the uninsured. We all recognize \nthere can be no financial security without health security.\n  Let's show the country that what is good for Members of Congress and \ntheir employees is also good for the contractors who serve us.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to release contributors of ordinary trash and minor \namounts of hazardous substances from litigation under Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       THE EQUITY AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN SUPERFUND ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Equity and \nPublic Involvement in Superfund Act of 1997 [TEPI].\n  Hazardous sites, the legacy of our industrial growth, litter the \nlandscape across America. Many of those sites are toxic and pose real \nthreats to the groundwater, the air and our water, and accordingly, our \nhealth and the health of the environment. The worst of those sites are \nso foul and so polluted that they are beyond the capacity of most \nStates to handle. These sites, placed on the national priorities list \nfor clean up under the Comprehensive Environmental Response \nCompensation, and Liability Act commonly known as Superfund can take \nyears to clean up and cost tens of millions of dollars to clean up. \nThey are ticking time bombs that threaten the health and survival of \nentire communities.\n  Over the years the hazardous waste clean up program has been heavily \ncriticized as being too slow, involving too much litigation and too \nexpensive. Congress addressed many of those problems in 1986, and \nAdministrator Carol\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\nBrowner of the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] has instituted \nmany reforms to speed up the cleanup program. The results are dramatic. \nEPA has completed cleanup construction at 498 sites and more than 500 \nadditional sites are in construction. Taxpayers have saved $12 billion \nbecause polluters responsible for these sites are performing or funding \napproximately 70 percent of Superfund long-term cleanups. But, problems \nremain, partly because big corporate polluters are using the present \nlaw to drag tiny merchants and other parties who are minor polluters, \nor innocents who merely sent solid waste to a municipal landfill, into \nexpensive lawsuits.\n  A recent story televised by ``60 Minutes'' on the Keystone landfill \nin Pennsylvania showed the scope of the problem. The story centered on \nBarbara Williams, the owner of the Sunny Ray Restaurant in Gettysburg, \nPA, who was being sued by the sites' toxic polluters for $75,000 \nbecause of the mashed potatoes she sent to the dump. Tiny gift stores, \nand other small businesses were dragged into a Superfund suit because \nthey had sent regular trash to the Keystone Landfill.\n  EPA Administrator Carol Browner is aware of this problem and has been \ntrying to do something about it. She has offered expedited settlements, \nknown as de minimis settlements, to more than 20,000 parties nationwide \nwhose contribution to Superfund sites is comparatively small. She has \nalso offered settlements for as little as $1.00, known as de micromis \nsettlements, to parties whose contributions of hazardous waste to a \nsite are minuscule, but whose payments to lawyers have been immense.\n  While EPA has done an admirable job at ameliorating the aspect of the \nlaw that allows contribution litigation to happen, and indeed has \ndeterred instances of egregious litigation, EPA can only do so much \nwithin the confines of the law and within the context of litigation. \nThe law needs to be changed to put an end to these harassment suits. \nSince 1993, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nrepeatedly has tried to bridge the differences that exist on Superfund \nand send a reform bill to the President.\n\n  Mr. President, as the ranking Democratic member of the Superfund \nSubcommittee, I have spent many hours over the past several months with \nthe Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nChafee, and the Superfund Subcommittee Chairman Senator Smith, \nAdministrator Browner and Senator Baucus, the ranking Democratic member \nof the full committee. We've been negotiating a broad-based reform of \nthe Nation's hazardous waste cleanup program. We have narrowed the \ndifferences between our views of how to fix Superfund. On October 22, \n1997, Senators Chafee and Smith made a global proffer on each title of \ntheir chairman's mark. The next week, Senator Baucus and I made a \ncounter to their proffer that made significant concessions on each \ntitle of the bill.\n  We thought progress was being made. However, instead of responding to \nour last offer, the Republicans decided to end negotiations, at least \nfor now.\n  Mr. President, Superfund reform has taken too long and, as a result \nmunicipalities, small businesses and communities in and around \nSuperfund and brownfields sites are paying a high price for our \ninability to address their needs. It has long been my position that we \nshould move ahead in areas where we can agree, and not hold our \ncitizens and communities hostage to remaining disagreements. Earlier \nthis year, as I have before, I introduced S. 18, the Brownfields and \nEnvironmental Cleanup Act. I have also introduced S. 1317, the \nEnvironmental Health Protection Act, to move ahead to protect the \nhealth of citizens living near Superfund sites. These are non-\ncontroversial bills that could pass without objection. It is \nunacceptable and unconscionable that we would continue to leave \ncitizens subject to illness--and perhaps even death, by cancer--when we \ncan take steps now to reduce those risks. As a companion to those \nmeasures, today I am introducing the Equity and Public Involvement Act \nto address liability issues that enjoy virtual universal support. This \nbill addresses those Superfund failings of which most constituents \ncomplain, and contains solutions that have been agreed on by both \nRepublicans and Democrats for years.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today will bring relief to \nthe thousands of small businesses and municipalities who have been \nswept into the Superfund litigation net by high-paid lawyers for big \ncorporate polluters, even though those small businesses, churches and \ncharities sent only municipal solid waste, common garbage, to the site. \nThe provisions exempt individual homeowners, small business, and small \nnonprofits who have disposed only ordinary household trash. The \nprovisions also limit the liability of big business and municipalities \nwho have disposed household trash, consistent with an EPA draft policy, \nby allowing parties to cash-out on the basis of an easy-to-calculate \nformula that depends largely upon the volume of the trash these \nentities disposed, and the type of cleanup taking place at the site. \nSite did not have toxic pollutants driving up the cost of clean up. \nPlain and simple, these provisions prevent polluters from shifting \ncleanup costs to local taxpayers.\n  The bill also provides protection for other businesses who sent small \namounts of toxic waste to sites. Businesses which sent very small \namounts--less than two barrels--will be exempt from lawsuits. Those who \nsent small amounts, but more than two barrels, will be subject to an \nexpedited settlement process. For those small contributors and larger \ncontributors of toxic waste, the amount they will have to pay will be \ncushioned by their ability to pay.\n\n  The bill also protects landowners who live next door to hazardous \nwaste sites by clarifying that they are not liable parties under the \nSuperfund statute.\n  In addition, the bill expands the public's ability to participate in \nthe critical decisions concerning the cleanup in their neighborhoods. \nThroughout the negotiations, we have met extensively with community \nrepresentatives and stakeholders on Superfund to learn what works and \nwhat doesn't.\n  Stakeholders meetings with companies involved in multiple Superfund \nsites and cleanups at Department of Energy and Defense facilities \nshowed that when communities near sites are involved early in the \nprocess, remedies are selected more quickly and there is more trust in \nthe level of cleanup.\n  Community representatives argued passionately for the right to be \nfully informed and involved in these critical decisions. To respond to \nthis concern, this bill includes provisions that significantly increase \ncommunity input at all Superfund sites and in all aspects of the \nprocess of remedying the ill effects of toxic sites. Included in this \nbill are provisions for technical assistance grants, known as TAG's, to \ncommunities to hire technical experts to help them interpret the often \nhighly technical data. These provisions enjoy broad support.\n  Mr. President, the liability reform provisions I have outlined and \nthe community participation programs I have described are not \ncontroversial. Many were included in S. 8, a bill that Senators Chafee \nand Smith introduced with significant Republican support on the first \nday of the Senate session. However, that bill has not moved and \nnegotiations on a broader bill have broken down, at least for the \nmoment. Therefore, I think it is appropriate for the Congress to move \nahead to reform the law where we can agree, and continue to discuss and \nnegotiate the issues on which there remains disagreement.\n  The bill I am introducing today is simple: It frees the hostages of \nstalled Superfund negotiations--the small businesses, churches, \nmunicipalities and their taxpayers, as well as neighboring landowners \ncaught up in Superfund liability who have been waiting for years for a \nSuperfund reform bill. They should not be held hostage to forces intent \non repealing the principle of polluter pays and weakening cleanup of \nour natural resources who have not let a bill go forward because they \ncan't get their way on those issues.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not address all of the issues on which \nwe could move forward today with virtual unanimous support. But, in \nconjunction with other legislation I have introduced, it could solve \nmany of the worst of Superfund's problems.\n  This fall I introduced S. 1317, the Environmental Health Protection \nAct, to\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\nexpand the public health aspects of hazardous waste cleanup. That bill \nallows the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR] to \nstudy any location where there is concern that hazardous wastes \nthreaten public health and requires that ATSDR work closely with State \nand local health officials in making its assessment.\n  ATSDR is frequently criticized because its health assessments are \ncompleted too late in the process to be of any real value to local \nofficials struggling to manage the health impact of a hazardous waste \nsite on a community. S. 1317 changes the way EPA and the health \nauthorities do their job. It requires EPA to notify local and State \nhealth officials early in the process that an investigation is \ncommencing and to better coordinate their activities with local \nauthorities so that EPA's proposed remedy better reflects local \nconditions and needs.\n  Also, S. 1317 requires EPA to directly involve State and local health \nofficials in deciding where and how to take samples at hazardous waste \nsites. State and local health officials are often the frontline \nexperts. They have important first-hand information on how a toxic \nwaste dump affects their community. Working with EPA, they can better \ndetermine and analyze possible health problems in a community and \nwhether that pattern arises from a toxic waste dump. With this \ninformation, EPA can zero-in on those areas for additional sampling and \nfurther studies as well as design a site appropriate remedy that meets \nthe special circumstances of the affected community.\n  There is absolutely no reason why the Congress should not move ahead \nto approve S. 1317 now and every reason why we should. It would reduce \nhealth risks to our citizens and I know of no one who objects to it.\n  On the first day of this Congress, last January, I introduced S. 18, \nthe Brownfields and Environmental Cleanup Act of 1997. This bill would \nmake Federal grants for revolving loan funds used for remediation of \nbrownfields available throughout the country. It would also protect \ninnocent landowners and prospective purchasers of brownfield sites. Mr. \nPresident, if we could free this hostage, I know the Congress could \nmove quickly to agree on brownfields legislation.\n  Mr. President, we appear to be at a standoff in Superfund \nnegotiations for the moment. If that remains the case next January when \nwe reconvene, I hope the Congress will move ahead to enact this \nlegislation, along with my brownfields, community participation and \nenvironmental health protection bills. I also think we should extend \nthe Superfund excise and corporate income tax. The tax, which expired \nin 1995, brings in sufficient revenue to cover the entire fiscal year \n1998 Superfund appropriation. Without the tax, industry is saving $26 \nmillion a week--an amount sufficient enough to encourage some of those \nbusinesses to oppose any reform if the cost of reform is reinstituting \nthe tax. Mr. President, that tax must be reinstated.\n  Mr. President, on the first days of the session this year, Senator \nBaucus and I joined EPA Administrator Carol Browner to urge the Senate \nto pass a brownfields bill immediately and not hold it hostage to a \nbroader Superfund bill. I said at that time:\n\n       We have a long way to go before we get a bill that enjoys \n     bipartisan support, and that can be signed into law. We can't \n     wait. We need to do something now, not only to help the \n     environment, but to assist those urban areas which are \n     struggling with economic recovery. . . .\n       But that bill, because of the number of issues in \n     controversy, will not pass quickly. And while many people \n     believe that Superfund can only be passed as a comprehensive \n     package, last year we did pass some Superfund provisions \n     separately for lenders, fiduciaries and the Department of \n     Defense. . . .\n       In my view, we ought to sit down and quickly pass a \n     brownfields bill.\n       The sooner we do, the sooner we may be able to convert \n     thousands of abandoned industrial sites into engines of \n     economic development.\n\n  Mr. President, those words are even more true today than they were in \nJanuary. We've let an entire year go by, without results. Let's pass \nthis bill, the brownfields legislation, and community participation and \nenvironmental health programs. Let's make Superfund a shield to protect \nour communities, not a sword used to hold them hostage.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continuing negotiations with \nSenators Chafee, Smith, and Baucus next year to address the broader \nissues. But with a full year behind us, I believe we should serve up to \nour constituents what we can now deliver.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \ninserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require States to adopt laws prohibiting open \nalcoholic containers in automobiles; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n               the national drunk driving protection act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncombat our Nation's continual problem with drunk driving. This problem, \nthat attacks young and old alike, is multifaceted and must be combating \non several fronts. My bill addresses the need to take alcohol out of \nautomobiles by establishing a national policy prohibiting open alcohol \ncontainers in automobiles.\n  To put this problem in perspective, an average of one person every \nhalf hour dies as a result of drunk driving, and that worked out to be \n17,272 alcohol-related fatalities in 1996 according to the Department \nof Transportation. This figure is over 40 percent of the total number \nof traffic fatalities in the United States. The sad irony in these \nstatistics is that drunk driving is a preventable problem.\n  Even more heart wrenching is that drunk driving is killing a \ndisproportionate amount of our youth and young adults. In 1995, while \n30 percent of our driving population was between the ages of 21-34, 50 \npercent of the fatalities and 50 percent of the drunk driving injuries \nwere in this age group. That amounted to 6,760 dead and 95,800 injured \nyoung adults.\n  One way we must combat drunk driving is to ban the consumption of \nalcohol in automobiles. According to the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, in 22 States it is still legal for passengers in \na vehicle to be drinking while the vehicle is in operation. And in 10 \nStates, it is perfectly legal for a driver of a car to have one hand on \nthe steering wheel and drinking a bottle of whisky in the other. It \nseems inexcusable to me that we have a circumstance in this country \nwhere citizens cannot be assured that in every State and in every local \njurisdiction in the Nation that there are not laws against people \ndrinking and driving at the same time. This legislation will provide \nthat assurance and prohibit open containers in every State.\n  I hope that the Senate will have a good debate on drunk driving \nissues early next year when we return to debate the reauthorization of \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. I intend \nto offer this legislation as amendment to the ISTEA reauthorization and \nI urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord:\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the title XXVII of the Public Health Service \nAct and other laws to assure the rights of enrollees under managed care \nplans; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       the health insurance consumer's bill of rights act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health \nInsurance Consumer's bill of rights. I have been working closely on \nthis bill with Congressman Chuck Schumer, who has introduced companion \nlegislation in the House.\n  Our will address an increasing crisis of confidence in our Nation's \nhealth care system. This crisis of confidence is especially evident for \nthe increasing number of Americans enrolled in managed care health \nplans.\n  A recent survey conducted by the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation and \nHarvard University found that only 44 percent of enrollees in managed \ncare health care plans believe it is very likely that necessary \ntreatments would be covered if they became seriously ill. Fully 69 \npercent of enrollees in traditional fee-for-service plans believed they \nwould be adequately covered.\n  The survey found that the American people hold managed care plans \ngenerally in low esteem and they support efforts to improve the health \ninsurance system. That, Mr. President, is exactly what the Boxer-\nSchumer bill aims to do.\n  The Health Insurance Consumer's bill of rights requires all health \ninsurance plans to meet basic requirements for conduct, coverage, and \nconsumer disclosure.\n  Specifically, the bill requires that all managed care plans have an \nadequate number of primary care physicians and specialists to meet the \nhealth care needs of their enrollees. It requires health plans to cover \nemergency care, terminate so-called gag rules that limit communication \nbetween a doctor and a patient. It requires the annual disclosure of a \nwealth of important consumer information to enrollees and potential \nenrollees, and finally, this bill contains a number of important \nprovisions to ensure that women are treated fairly in managed care \nplans.\n  I want to make clear that the Schumer-Boxer bill is not antimanaged \ncare. On the contrary, the bill accepts that managed care plans are the \nchosen kind of coverage for millions of Americans. It is precisely for \nthat reason that Congress must act to ensure that managed care plans \nact responsibly and provide quality coverage.\n  I hope the Senate will consider this bill carefully and act upon it \nearly next year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Hawaii Tropical Forest Recovery Act to \nestablish voluntary standards for certifying forest products \ncultivated, harvested,\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n\nand processed in tropical environments in Hawaii and to grant a \ncertification for Hawaii tropical forest products that meet the \nvoluntary standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         the hawaii tropical forest products certification act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish voluntary standards for certifying tropical forest products \ngrown in Hawaii. Senator Inouye has joined me in cosponsoring this \nmeasure.\n  Agriculture has long been the backbone of the economy of rural \nHawaii. Recently, however, the decline of sugarcane has caused an \nupheaval for many of our rural communities. In the past 10 years, 21 \nsugarcane plantations have gone out of business and the State has lost \n115,000 acres of sugarcane production.\n  For more than 160 years, sugar provided jobs and a special way of \nlife for communities throughout the State. Cane is still king on Maui \nand parts of Kauai, but elsewhere it has disappeared from the \nagricultural map. Our great challenge is to develop new opportunities \nthat keep Hawaii green and economically productive for at least as \nlong--and hopefully longer--than our relationship with sugar.\n  For many landowners, the future of rural Hawaii is in forestry. But \nwhat will forestry in Hawaii look like 10, 20, or 50 years from now? \nMany people have strong feelings about how to answer this question.\n  Sustainability is the emerging idea in forest development. This means \npracticing stewardship that integrates the growth, nurturing, and \nharvesting of trees with the conservation of soil, air, water, and \nwildlife. Sustainable forests are managed to serve the needs of the \npresent generation without compromising the needs of future \ngenerations.\n  In Hawaii, the stewardship ethic is very strong, especially within \nthe forestry community. Hawaii's tropical forests are home to some of \nthe richest biological diversity on the planet, and our forest managers \nunderstand the importance of preserving our living heritage. But in \nmany countries, stewardship and responsible forest development is weak \nor nonexistent.\n  Around the globe, forests are disappearing at an unprecedented rate, \nand nowhere is this problem more severe than in the tropics. More than \nhalf of the world's tropical rain forests have been consumed, degraded, \nor destroyed in this century.\n  Because of the attention being given to forest degradation, consumers \nare asking questions about the source of the wood demand, and foresters \nto supply, wood products from well-managed forests.\n\n  As the demand for sustainable forest products has increased, criteria \nfor sustainable forestry have been formalized. The result is a world-\nwide movement to verify that sustainable forestry claims are genuine. \nThis process is known as certification.\n  In recent years, the Hawaii forestry industry has closely monitored \nthe certification movement. The bill I am introducing today will prompt \nan important dialogue on certification. I am inviting all stakeholders \nin this issue--Hawaii's forest industry, landowners, conservation \nexperts, and affected communities--to engage in a free and open \nexchange about forest certification.\n  What are the benefits of certification? For consumers, certification \nis a way of ensuring that forest products they purchase do not \ncontribute to forest degradation. Independent verification of forestry \npractices is the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval telling them that \nsustainable standards are being met.\n  To landowners, certification is a way of ensuring that their careful \nmanagement is rewarded in the marketplace. A certification label may \nresult in a premium for your products, better market access, and in \nsome cases, more secure supply agreements. The best way for the Hawaii \nforest industry to increase the value of their resource may be to sell \ncertified tropical wood products into a world market that recognizes \nthe abuse that tropical forests have suffered--and is willing to pay \nmore for a tropical product that has received proper certification.\n  Just how widespread is certification today? Forest certification is \nbig business. Certification is practiced in 25 countries. European and \nNorth American buyers groups are committed to wood products \ncertification. Eleven nations, including Germany and France, are \nrepresented in the European buyers group.\n  Certification is voluntary, not mandatory, and my bill reflects this \nfact. Over time, however, landowners who do not employ sustainable \npractices and do not seek certification may find it more difficult to \nmarket their timber.\n  My bill will establish standards certifying that Hawaii forest \nproducts are cultivated, harvested, and processed in a sustainable \nmanner. Although forestry certification standards are high, \ncertification will not require perfection. Like agriculture, forestry \nis subject to the forces of nature, and nature is often unpredictable.\n  For certification to become successful in Hawaii, I believe that a \nbottom up rather than top down approach to consensus-building makes the \nmost sense. With this in mind, in January, 1998, I will convene a \nmeeting in Hawaii to further the dialog about forest certification and \nthe bill I introduced today.\n  Certification can take root in Hawaii without action by Congress. \nHowever, my bill can jump start the dialog and provide a format for \ndiscussion. I will be the first one to cheer if certification becomes a \nreality with, or without, legislation by Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1501. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to improve protection for workers in multiemployer pension \nplans; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              THE WORKERS' PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Workers' \nPension Protection Act. This legislation will level the playing field \nfor millions of American workers who currently participate in defined \nbenefit multiemployer pension plans.\n  As I am certain many of my colleagues are aware, there is a \ndifference between multiemployer and single-employer pension plans. \nMultiemployer plans are maintained by a specific union, and supported \nby the various employers that union has organized, whereas single-\nemployer plans are established by one company for its own employees. \nThus, the Central States Teamsters pension fund covers individuals who \nwork for employers the Teamsters have organized in the Midwestern \nUnited States. By contrast, General Electric has its a single-employer \nplan, or plans, that it established for its own employees.\n  This bill is only concerned with multiemployer pension plans. It \nprotects workers' benefits by making sure that multiemployer plans are \nfunded so that benefits promised today will be available when workers \nretire in the future. Many of this country's multiemployer pension \nplans are underfunded by billions of dollars. It is true that a plan \ncan be underfunded by billions of dollars but the relationship of \nassets to liabilities can still be relatively high. However, we are \nlooking at plans that are not only underfunded by large amounts, but \nalso where liabilities seriously outstrip assets.\n  This legislation both increases funding and reporting requirements on \nmultiemployer plans, so that we know when plans are becoming riskier, \nand improves protections and benefits. American workers rely upon their \npensions to support them through their twilight years. Unfortunately \npension plans are not infallible and too often, the American workers \ndiscover that their plan is bankrupt and that all pension payments are \nnow in the hands of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC], \nthe Federal agency charged with insuring defined benefit pension plans. \nWhat these workers may not realize is that under a single-employer \nplan, up to $33,132 per year is protected by the PBGC's pension \ninsurance, but under the multiemployer pension insurance system, they \ncan only receive $5,850. My legislation will not completely eliminate \nthis unfairness, but it will slightly more than double the amount \npayable by the PBGC, by increasing benefits from $5,850 to $12,780. \nThis change in the guaranty benefit amount would be the first increase \nto those benefits since the multiemployer program was enacted in 1980.\n\n[[Page S12306]]\n\n  Next, this bill will require plans to fund their current pension \npromises before making new ones. Pension plan trustees would be unable \nto grant benefit increases if a plan is less than 95 percent funded. \nThis provision is needed to keep underfunded plans from going deeper in \nthe red if collective bargaining ignores the underfunding problem.\n\n  Third, this legislation will require multiemployer pension plans to \nuse single, identified interest rate and mortality table assumptions in \nall calculations. As in the single-employer pension plan reform \nlegislation of 1994, the interest rates and mortality tables must be \nstandardized and must conform to the most recent data available. With \nthis change, plans may not use one set of numbers when reporting the \nlevel of funding in their plan to the PBGC, and another set of numbers \nwhen determining liability associated with a withdrawal from the plan. \nThat amounts to manipulating interest rates to game the system. We \nrequire single-employer pension plans to use a specific interest rate \nand a mortality table. I believe it should apply to multiemployer \nplans, as well.\n  Fourth, the bill will require that plan trustees notify participants, \nannually and in plain English, of how well or poorly funded their plans \nare. Once and for all, multiemployer pension plan participants and \nbeneficiaries will have a chance to learn how secure--or insecure--\ntheir retirement benefits are. It is one thing to tell a plan \nparticipant what his or her expected benefit will be upon retirement. \nIt is quite another to let a participant know that their pension plan \ncould have 45 percent more in liabilities than it has in assets, or \nthat it may have accumulated $5 billion in underfunding.\n  The PBGC has told us that notification to participants of plan \nfunding has worked well for single-employer plans. Since it has been a \nsuccess for the single-employer insurance system, we should extend the \nsame protections to participants in multiemployer plans. With a better \nunderstanding of the worth of their benefits, workers can make informed \ndecisions about their retirement needs. I think such notification is a \nvitally important participant protection for multiemployer pension plan \nparticipants.\n  Finally, the bill will increase premiums imposed by the PBGC upon \nsponsors of multiemployer pension plans. Currently, premiums are $2.60 \nper participant but they have not been increased since the \nmultiemployer guaranty program was enacted in 1980. By contrast, the \nsingle employer premium has been increased by Congress eight times \nsince ERISA was passed in 1974. The minimum premium for fully funded \nsingle-employer plans is now $19 per participant, but some underfunded \nplans are charged hundreds of dollars per participant for PBGC \npremiums. If we are going to raise multiemployer benefits, it is also \ntime to raise multiemployer premiums. Over a 3-year period, my bill \nwill double premiums, increasing them to $5.20 per participant.\n  Mr. President, I realize that it is the end of the session. I am \nintroducing this measure now in order to permit review and comment by \ninterested parties in advance of hearings I will be holding on this \nissue next year. This bill takes modest, but overdue steps to protect \nparticipants of multiemployer pension plans. I hope that those \nconcerned with the safety and security of, and equity in, multiemployer \npension plans will not hesitate to step forward to be heard. There are \nslightly more than 1,800 multiemployer pension plans in this Nation \nproviding benefits to approximately 8.7 million individuals. This bill \nprotects those workers and retirees--and they need and deserve our \noversight. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to join me in \nsponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1503. A bill to protect the voting rights of homeless citizens; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n           the voting rights of homeless citizens act of 1997\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Voting \nRights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1997. I am proud to stand alongside \nthe distinguished House sponsor of this bill, Representative John \nLewis.\n  Mr. President, over the course of the last century, Congress has \nsystematically removed the major obstacles that once prevented many of \nour citizens from voting. Not too long ago, only land-owning white men \nhad the privilege of participating in our democracy. Women and \nminorities were prohibited from casting the ballot. More recently, \npeople had to pay a poll tax or take a test in order to qualify to \nvote.\n  Before the civil rights movement, there were areas in the southern \npart of this country where the vast majority of the population was \nblack, but there wasn't a single registered black voter. In 1964, three \nyoung men gave their lives while working to register people to vote in \nrural Mississippi. Many people over the course of our history have \nsacrificed their lives in order to expand voting rights for all \nAmericans.\n  In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson proposed that we ``eliminate every \nremaining obstacle to the right and opportunity to vote.'' Eight months \nlater, this Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, making it \npossible for millions of Americans to participate in the political \nprocess for the first time.\n  Our Nation has made even more progress since then. The motor voter \nlaw made voter registration more accessible to working people. But our \nhistoric strides have not taken us far enough. The time is long overdue \nto ensure that every American has the opportunity to exercise this \nfundamental right. It is reprehensible that there are still American \nadults who are unable to partake of the most important right of \ncitizenry.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to give the power to vote to \nhomeless citizens of this country. The bill would remove the legal and \nadministrative barriers that inhibit them from exercising this right. \nNo one should be excluded from registering to vote simply because they \ndo not have an address. But in many States, the homeless are left out \nand left behind. This is wrong. This is against the grain of this great \nnation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in opening the political process to \nevery American--even those without a home. I urge my colleagues to join \nme by cosponsoring and supporting passage of the Voting Rights of \nHomeless Citizens Act of 1997.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S.1503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the `Voting Rights of Homeless \n     Citizens Act of 1997'.\n\n     SEC. 2. VOTING RIGHTS OF HOMELESS CITIZENS.\n\n       No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or \n     standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied \n     by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the \n     right of any citizen of the United States to vote because \n     that citizen resides at or in a nontraditional abode.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to adjust the immigration status of certain Haitian \nnationals who where provided refuge in the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the haitian refugee immigration fairness act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on reaching an\n\n[[Page S12307]]\n\nagreement on what has been a very long and difficult negotiation \nrelative to Central American and other immigrants. I note that we have \nin the Chamber at this time two of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives who have been most active in achieving this result that \nis close to being reality, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and \nCongressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart. I extend my special thanks to them and \ncongratulations on the success of their hard work.\n  Many months ago, these two fine Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, and others, including Senator Mack, Senator Spencer \nAbraham, and Senator Kennedy, became interested in legislation that \nwould provide justice and fairness for individuals who, due to duress, \nextreme hardship and political strife in their native countries, had \nbeen welcomed into our Nation by President Reagan and President Bush. I \nwas proud to be part of this effort.\n  The agreement reached with our distinguished colleagues covers not \nonly Central Americans, but also other groups who have struggled \nagainst oppression. While I strongly believe that this agreement is \npositive and is in the American tradition of fair play, it is an \nincomplete resolution. It is incomplete because there is another \nrelatively small group of persons who have the same characteristics as \nthose who are being recognized for whom legislation is being passed \ntoday as part of the District of Columbia appropriations bill. That \ngroup is Haitians.\n  There are 11,000 Haitians who, because of their credible asylum \nclaims, were flown to the United States by our Government during the \nearly 1990's. These were men, women and children, Mr. President, who \nhad left Haiti because of the oppressive circumstances there.\n  Mr. President, this group of approximately 11,000 Haitians, who \nbecause of credible asylum claims were allowed to enter the United \nStates in the early 1990s, were part of a much larger group of over \n40,000 Haitians who had been detained at sea and temporarily were in a \nrefuge status at our Guantanamo naval station.\n  These were the 11,000 of that larger group who were found, based on \nscreenings administered by the Immigration Naturalization Service, to \nhave a credible claim of persecution should they be returned to Haiti. \nThe balance of those who could not meet that standard were in fact \nrepatriated to Haiti.\n  There is a second group of similar size and significant overlap in \nterms of the individuals who are part of the asylum backlog. These are \nthose who have had pending asylum cases since 1995.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in introducing this \nlegislation today which is entitled the Haitian Refugee Immigration \nFairness Act of 1997, with my colleague Senator Mack, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Abraham, and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.\n  Mr. President, fairness demands that we include this group in our \nlegislation. First, this is a relatively small group. The two groups \ntogether, the Guantanamo asylees and those who have a pending asylum \ncase combined, represent approximately 15,000 to 16,000 individuals. \nThis, in relationship to those who we are providing essentially the \nsame status to today, is a relatively small number.\n  Second, this group has been extensively screened. As I indicated, the \nGuantanamo asylees represent approximately one out of four of those \npersons who were, at one time, at the Guantanamo Naval Base and who \nwere found to have a credible legitimate fear of persecution in Haiti.\n  I might say, Mr. President, as one who visited Haiti several times \nduring this very tense period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the \nlevel of human rights abuses, the savagery, the violence were extreme. \nAnd these persons who established if they had been returned to Haiti at \nthat time, that they would have been significantly at risk, they were \nat risk in a very legitimately violent and hostile environment.\n  Deportations of this group, Mr. President, have already begun. Asylum \nofficers have begun to send back members of the Haitian community to \nHaiti. And so there is a sense of urgency of dealing with this \nlegislation before any additional injustices are committed.\n  And finally, the Guantanamo Haitians have established families in the \nUnited States. Many have had children born here who are United States \ncitizens. They have opened businesses. They have built homes. They have \nstrengthened our community here in the United States. They contribute \nto the diversity, the racial and social harmony, the positive traits of \nour increasingly multicultural Nation.\n  Mr. President, I would hope someday to have the opportunity to invite \nyou to join me at Miami Dade Community College, which happens to be the \nlargest community college in the Nation based on enrollment. It is \ninspiring to go to that campus, one of their several campuses, and see \nthe number of young Haitian men and women who are living the American \ndream of hard work and education and advancing themselves so that they \ncan better serve the interests of their families and our Nation.\n  This is a quality group of people who have made and will make \nsignificant contributions to our Nation.\n  They are making a contribution in many ways today. As an example, we \nhave in Haiti a large number of Americans of Haitian heritage who are \ncurrently serving as mentors to the newly established police force in \nHaiti. They are helping to make an organization which did not exist a \nfew years ago because there was no police force, all police activities \nwere done through the military and often done in a very aggressive \nmanner.\n  We are attempting to build a new institution to provide for security \nin Haiti. A key element of that are the large numbers of Americans of \nHaitian background who are assisting in that important effort within \ntheir former country.\n  That is just one dramatic example of the contributions which this \ncommunity is making to their new home in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues today to continue the fight for \njustice and fairness. We have taken a significant step in that effort \ntonight with the passage of the District of Columbia appropriations \nbill, which seems to be an odd place for such an important immigration \nbill to be lodged, but it is placed there.\n  This legislation will continue that effort by applying a similar \nstandard of fair treatment to this important population of Haitians \nwithin our Nation.\n  I send to the desk the legislation and ask for its referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such an alien \n     may not be required, as a condition on submitting or granting \n     such application, to file a motion to reopen, reconsider, or \n     vacate such order. If the Attorney General grants the \n     application, the Attorney General shall cancel the order. If \n     the Attorney General renders a final administrative decision \n     to deny the application, the order shall be effective and \n     enforceable to the same extent as if the application had not \n     been made.\n       (b) Aliens Eligible for Adjustment of Status.--The benefits \n     provided by subsection (a) shall apply to any alien who is a \n     national of Haiti--\n       (1) who filed for asylum before December 31, 1995, or was \n     paroled into the United\n\n[[Page S12308]]\n\n     States prior to December 31, 1995, after having been \n     identified as having a credible fear of persecution or \n     paroled for emergent reasons or reasons deemed strictly in \n     the public interest, and\n       (2) has been physically present in the United States for at \n     least 1 year and is physically present in the United States \n     on the date the application for such adjustment is filed, \n     except an alien shall not be considered to have failed to \n     maintain continuous physical presence by reason of an \n     absence, or absences, from the United States for any periods \n     in the aggregate not exceeding 180 days.\n       (c) Stay of Removal.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall provide by \n     regulation for an alien subject to a final order of \n     deportation or removal or exclusion to seek a stay of such \n     order based on the filing of an application under subsection \n     (a).\n       (2) During certain proceedings.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the \n     Attorney General shall not order any alien to be removed from \n     the United States, if the alien is in exclusion, deportation, \n     or removal proceedings under any provision of such Act and \n     raises as a defense to such an order the eligibility of the \n     alien to apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a), \n     except where the Attorney General has rendered a final \n     administrative determination to deny the application.\n       (3) Work authorization.--The Attorney General may authorize \n     an alien who has applied for adjustment of status under \n     subsection (a) to engage in employment in the United States \n     during the pendency of such application and may provide the \n     alien with an ``employment authorized'' endorsement or other \n     appropriate document signifying authorization of employment, \n     except that if such application is pending for a period \n     exceeding 180 days, and has not been denied, the Attorney \n     General shall authorize such employment.\n       (d) Adjustment of Status for Spouses and Children.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 245(c) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, the status of an alien shall \n     be adjusted by the Attorney General to that of an alien \n     lawfully admitted for permanent residence, if--\n       (A) the alien is a national of Haiti;\n       (B) the alien is the spouse, child, or unmarried son or \n     daughter, of an alien whose status is adjusted to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under \n     subsection (a), except that in the case of such an unmarried \n     son or daughter, the son or daughter shall be required to \n     establish that they have been physically present in the \n     United States for at least 1 year and is physically present \n     in the United States on the date the application for such \n     adjustment is filed.\n       (C) the alien applies for such adjustment and is physically \n     present in the United States on the date the application is \n     filed; and\n       (D) the alien is otherwise eligible to receive an \n     immigration visa and is otherwise admissible to the United \n     States for permanent residence, except in determining such \n     admissibility the grounds for exclusion specified in \n     paragraphs (4), (5), (6)(A), and (7)(A) of section 212(a) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act shall not apply.\n       (2) Proof of continuous presence.--For purposes of \n     establishing the period of continuous physical presence \n     referred to in paragraph (1)(B), an alien shall not be \n     considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical \n     presence by reason of an absence, or absences, from the \n     United States for any periods in aggregate not exceeding 180 \n     days.\n       (e) Availability of Administrative Review.--The Attorney \n     General shall provide to applicants for adjustment of status \n     under subsection (a) the same right to, and procedures for, \n     administrative review as are provided to--\n       (1) applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act;

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Graham, \nSenator Mack, Senator Abraham, and Senator Moseley-Braun in introducing \nlegislation providing permanent residence to Haitian refugees.\n  The Senate has now adopted legislation to enable Nicaraguan and Cuban \nrefugees to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants, and \nto enable Salvadorans and Guatemalans to seek similar relief on a case-\nby-case basis.\n  Haitian refugees deserve no less.\n  These families fled violence, torture, murder and other atrocities in \nHaiti. The Bush administration and the Clinton administration found \nthat the vast majority of these refugees fled from Haiti because of a \nlegitimate fear of persecution.\n  These deserving Haitian refugees have resettled in many different \nStates. They brought with them an unparalleled love of freedom, and a \nstrong commitment to our democracy. They honor the opportunity that \nAmerica offers.\n  They were welcomed by churches and neighborhood groups, who have \nhelped them rebuild their lives in communities across America. Today, \nthey are contributing and valued members of our society.\n  Immigration relief for Haitian refugees should have been included in \nthe legislation to assist the refugees from Central America.\n  President Clinton wrote to Speaker Gingrich to emphasize the \nimportance of comparable relief for Haitian refugee families at a time \nwhen Congress was acting on relief for other refugees. Haitian refugees \ndeserve the same immigration opportunities that the Republican \nleadership is proposing for refugees from Central America.\n  But the Republican leadership in Congress said no. They even rejected \nour efforts at least to provide immediate relief from deportation for \nHaitian families.\n  While the Republicans said no to these refugees, I understand that \nthe Clinton administration will be taking steps to assure these Haitian \nfamilies that they will be protected from deportation while Congress \nconsiders legislation in the coming months to allow the families to \nseek permanent residence here.\n  And I commend Senator Moseley-Braun for her extraordinary leadership \nin working with the administration to achieve this important result, as \nwell as Representative Carrie Meek for her tireless efforts for Haitian \nrefugees.\n  The legislation we are introducing will provide the fair relief that \nis greatly needed. It is a matter of simple justice.\n  It should be adopted as soon as possible and I regret it was not part \nof the measure enacted today.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Mack, \nKennedy, Abraham, and Graham in introducing the Haitian Refugee \nImmigration Fairness Act of 1997. I believe that this legislation will \nhelp mend a current shortcoming in the law.\n  During the early 1990's, our country flew in some 11,000 Haitians who \nfled the oppressive and dangerous conditions in their homeland during \nthe overthrow of Haiti's democratically elected government. As you may \nknow, this coup was marked by atrocious human rights abuses, including \nsystematic use of rape and murder as weapons of terror. The \nInternational Civilian Mission, which has monitored human rights \nconditions throughout Haiti, documented this tragedy, including horrors \nso awful as to be almost imaginable.\n  To allow such human rights violations to occur so close to home, \nwhile doing nothing would have been inconsistent with the stated goals \nof our foreign policy. So in 1991, the United States took in persons \nfleeing Haiti at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After intense screening, many of \nthese individuals were paroled into the United States to apply \naffirmatively for asylum. Between October, 1991 and May, 1992, over \n30,000 Haitians were interviewed. Less than one-third of these \nindividuals were paroled into the United States to seek asylum.\n  For the past 6 years, these individuals have had pending asylum cases \nwith the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Now, despite the fact \nthat these individuals have become a viable part of our Nation's \ncommunities, deportation of these Haitians has begun.\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\n The individuals that I am talking about today are the children, wives, \nbrothers, and sisters of soldiers and activists who stood up for \ndemocracy in Haiti and suffered a great deal because of the strength of \ntheir convictions. They fled to this country for refuge. They played by \nour rules. In the time that they've been here, they've built homes, \npaid taxes, and raised families in our country.\n  Two Presidential administrations have promised this class of people \nrelief, and I believe that we have an obligation to make good on those \npromises. There is no excuse not to give them the relief similar to the \nrelief that we have just recently granted to some 250,000 similarly \nsituated Central American nationals.\n  I believe that in order to be equitable and fair, we must grant \nsimilar relief to this small group of individuals. This bill grants \nthat relief. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and look forward to working with everyone to see that this \nissue is equitably resolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1508. A bill to authorize the Architect of the Capitol to \nconstruct a Capitol Visitor Center under the direction of the United \nStates Preservation Commission, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n legislation authorizing the construction of a capitol visitors center\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation that will authorize the Architect of the Capitol to \nconstruct a Capitol Visitor Center under the direction of the U.S. \nCapitol Preservation Commission.\n  The construction of a Capitol Visitor Center is a matter that has \nbeen discussed and contemplated for many years. In fact, both the \ncurrent and the preceding Architect of the Capitol have reviewed and \nsupported the project. Over the years, I have personally been involved \nin numerous Rules Committee hearings and briefings on the subject.\n  In my view, the time has come for Congress to move ahead with this \nproject. This legislation is an important step in that direction in \nthat it directs the Capitol Preservation Commission to develop a \ndetailed financial plan for constructing the project, largely with \nfunds donated by the American people.\n  The Capitol is the second most visited building in the entire \nWashington, DC area, having nearly 35,000 visitors pass through its \ndoors every day. For many visitors there are long lines and waits in \nhot sticky weather, or cold wet weather, as there is no place for \nvisitors to gather in preparation for their tour through the Capitol.\n  The Capitol Visitor Center will have a tremendous, positive impact on \nthe informational and educational experience afforded visitors to the \nCapitol. It will provide information regarding the history and role of \nCongress, along with additional information about the visitor's \nRepresentative and Senators\n  But for me, the most compelling need for the Capitol Visitor Center \nis to add a major element of enhanced security for the entire Capitol \nbuilding and environs. During the recent Capitol security hearings held \nin the Senate Rules Committee, the security benefits that a Capitol \nVisitor Center will provide were outlined clearly by the Capitol Police \nBoard. I strongly believe that the security benefits provided by a \nCapitol Visitor are not to be taken lightly.\n  I hope all Members will support this important legislation that will \ngreatly enhance the experience visitors receive when visiting our \nNations Capitol.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1509. A bill to authorize the Bureau of Land Management to use \nvegetation sales contracts in managing land at Fort Stanton and certain \nnearby acquired land along the Rio Bonita in Lincoln County, New \nMexico, to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   the fort stanton and rio bonito corridor vegetation management act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to authorize \nthe Bureau of Land Management to generate funds for the management of \nFort Stanton and the Rio Bonito Corridor in Lincoln County, NM. These \nfunds will be raised by authorizing the use of vegetation sales \ncontracts, which will allow the use of forage for livestock grazing.\n  The Fort Stanton and Rio Bonito Corridor Vegetation Management Act \nwill provide livestock producers with opportunities for additional \ngrazing in the Fort Stanton area, while providing the Bureau of Land \nManagement [BLM] the flexibility to manage the lands in this area \naccording to the recently approved Roswell Area Resource Management \nPlan.\n  Mr. President, as background, land in the Fort Stanton area has been \nacquired by the BLM through purchase, exchange, and transfer from the \nState of New Mexico. Fort Stanton itself came under the jurisdiction of \nthe BLM by transfer from the U.S. General Services Administration in \n1956. Certain tracts along the Rio Bonito in the Fort Stanton area came \nto the BLM by exchange in 1995. These lands are highly valued for their \nunique cultural, historic, and natural resources.\n  General, livestock grazing is managed by the BLM according to a \nnumber of laws, including the Taylor Grazing Act, and the regulations \nthat implement those laws. Currently, the Fort Stanton area lands are \nnot within an established grazing district, and are not administered \nunder the Taylor Grazing Act. To continue maintaining and improving the \nresources of these lands, and to fulfill the management objectives \nestablished through the Federal Land Policy and Management Act [FLPMA] \nplanning process, the BLM needs additional management flexibility. The \nmanagement of vegetation under this additional flexibility will allow \nfor improvement of watershed conditions and wildlife habitat, and will \nallow for the development of additional recreational opportunities on \nthese public lands, all of which provide benefits for the people and \neconomy of Lincoln County, NM.\n  The use of livestock grazing in this area has been employed \nsuccessfully by the BLM in the past. Rangeland improvements and \nvegetation treatments will emphasize the needs of wildlife and improve \nwatershed management as intended under the current management plan. The \nuse of vegetation sales contracts authorized by this legislation will \nallow the BLM to use livestock grazing without establishing grazing \npreferences on these lands.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the proceeds from vegetation sales contracts \nwill provide additional money for the BLM to use in the management of \nFort Stanton and the Rio Bonito Corridor. When offered by the BLM, \nthese contracts will be sold to the highest bidder, who will then be \npermitted to graze livestock in this area under specific terms and \nconditions. Some will wonder how the Senator from New Mexico, who has \nconsistently opposed the policy of competitive bidding for grazing \npermits on public lands, could offer such a proposal. Quite simply, Mr. \nPresident, the BLM's management plan for this area provides the rancher \nbidding on these contracts with facilities and a number of services at \nFort Stanton, that it simply cannot provide on the vast majority of the \n270 million acres it is charged with managing. This area will be \nsimilar to the furnished apartment--where facilities and services are \nprovided by the BLM as a part of the contract--which my colleagues have \nheard used as a comparison on the Senate floor in the past. Grazing \npermits offered on other public domain lands remain the unfurnished \napartment--where the BLM provides no facilities or services to grazing \npermittees.\n  At Fort Stanton, the BLM will be responsible for maintaining and \noperating the watering facilities, and will not require the lessee to \nconstruct improvements and pay for them out of his own pocket. \nAdditionally, the BLM already owns all of the livestock handling \nfacilities at Fort Stanton, and the lessee will be allowed to use them \nas a part of the contract. Under this legislation, part of the proceeds \nfrom the sale of these contracts will be available for BLM to provide \nimprovements to existing facilities, and a greater level of onsight \nmanagement than is available on other public lands. An additional \ndifference is that this public land has not been an integral part of an \nestablished ranch for the past 60 years, at least not in the same\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\nmanager as public land ranches governed by the Taylor Grazing Act. This \nmeans that providing opportunities for competitive bidding in this area \nwill not remove the heart of an existing family ranch that has been in \noperation for several generations.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the Senate will be able to move this \nlegislation through Congress rapidly next year, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1509\n\n     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Stanton and Rio Bonito \n     Corridor Vegetation Management Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary \n     surrounding Fort Stanton, New Mexico, contain historic and \n     natural resources that warrant special management \n     considerations by the Bureau of Land Management;\n       (2) the adjudication process for establishing grazing \n     preferences under the Act of June 28, 1934 (commonly known as \n     the ``Taylor Grazing Act'') (43 U.S.C. 315 et seq.) and other \n     applicable laws has not been conducted on lands acquired by \n     the Secretary at and near Fort Stanton, New Mexico, including \n     lands along the Rio Bonito in Lincoln County, New Mexico;\n       (3) in the management of renewable forage resources on \n     lands surrounding Fort Stanton, New Mexico, vegetation sales \n     contracts would be a beneficial tool for the Bureau of Land \n     Management to use to maintain and enhance the condition of \n     the forage and other natural resources of the area;\n       (4) the management of grazing animals under vegetation \n     sales contracts requires fiscal resources and personnel that \n     exceed that of the grazing preference system in place on \n     other public domain lands; and\n       (5) disputes over the legal description of lands acquired \n     by the Secretary along the Rio Bonito in Lincoln County, New \n     Mexico, make it necessary for the Bureau of Land Management \n     to pursue reasonable legal remedies under existing \n     authorities to resolve such disputes with adjacent \n     landowners.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (1) Fort Stanton.--The term ``Fort Stanton'' means land \n     under the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary at \n     Fort Stanton, New Mexico, as depicted on the map entitled \n     ``Fort Stanton and Rio Bonito Corridor, NM'', dated May 13, \n     1997.\n       (2) Rio bonito corridor.--The term ``Rio Bonito Corridor'' \n     means land under the administrative jurisdiction of the \n     Secretary near Fort Stanton, New Mexico, within the area \n     identified as the ``Rio Bonito Corridor'', as depicted on the \n     map entitled ``Fort Stanton and Rio Bonito Corridor, NM'', \n     dated May 13, 1997, which--\n       (A) was acquired by the Secretary before May 13, 1997; or\n       (B) is acquired by the Secretary (by purchase or exchange) \n     from willing landowners after May 13, 1997.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of \n     Land Management.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Any such contracts entered into \n     with respect to the land before the date of enactment of this \n     Act are ratified.\n       (b) Consistency With Land and Resource Management Plans.--\n     Management of Fort Stanton and the Rio Benito Corridor shall \n     be consistent with any applicable land and resource \n     management plan under the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).\n       (c) Distribution and Use of Proceeds.--Of the proceeds of \n     vegetation sales contracts entered into under subsection \n     (a)--\n       (1) 12\\1/2\\ percent shall be paid to the State of New \n     Mexico for distribution to Lincoln County, New Mexico, to be \n     used for purposes authorized by section 10 of the Act of June \n     28, 1934 (43 U.S.C. 315i);\n       (2) 12\\1/2\\ percent shall be deposited in the general fund \n     of the Treasury of the United States; and\n       (3) 75 percent shall be deposited in a special account in \n     the Treasury of the United States and shall be available to \n     the Secretary, without further Act of appropriation, for use \n     in managing Fort Stanton and the Rio Benito Corridor and to \n     achieve the management goals and prescriptions identified in \n     applicable resource management plans for the Rio Benito \n     acquired lands and the Fort Stanton area of critical \n     environmental concern, but none of the proceeds provided to \n     the Secretary under this paragraph shall be available for \n     land acquisition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n\n  S. 1510. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to convey certain lands to the county of Rio \nArriba, New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the rio arriba, new mexico land conveyance act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nI believe will provide long-term benefits for the people of Rio Arriba \nCounty, New Mexico. This legislation will direct the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture to convey real property and improvements at an \nabandoned and surplus administrative site for the Carson National \nForest to Rio Arriba County. The site is known as the old Coyote Ranger \nDistrict Station, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico.\n  This legislation is patterned after a similar transfer that the 103rd \nCongress directed the Secretary of Agriculture to complete on the old \nTaos Ranger District Station in 1993. As with the Taos station, the \nCoyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes, including \na community center, and a fire substation. Some of the buildings will \nalso be available for the County to use for storage and repair of road \nmaintenance equipment, and other County vehicles.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of \nno further use to them, since they have recently completed construction \nof a new administrative facility for the Coyote Ranger District. In an \nOctober 22 letter from the Regional Forester of the Southwest Region, I \nwas informed that on August 7, the Forest Service reported to the \nGeneral Services Administration that the improvements on the site were \nconsidered surplus, and would be available for disposal under their \nadministrative procedures. At this particular site, however, the land \non which the facilities have been built is withdrawn public domain \nland, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Because of the complicating factor of the land and the facilities \nbeing under the jurisdiction of two separate Departments of the Federal \ngovernment, I believe that this directed conveyance to Rio Arriba \nCounty will provide for a more efficient and expedited transfer. Under \nadministrative processes, not only will the Departments of the Interior \nand Agriculture have to go through their respective procedures, but \nthere will likely be some involvement of the General Services \nAdministration. This legislation simply directs the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture to negotiate the terms and conditions of the \nconveyance directly with officials from Rio Arriba County.\n  Mr. President, since neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the \nForest Service have any interest in maintaining Federal ownership of \nthis land and the surplus facilities, I believe that this should be a \nrelatively straight-forward issue for Congress to address. I hope that \nwe will be able to act on this legislation quickly next spring.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for its \nconsideration, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1510\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OLD COYOTE ADMINISTRATIVE SITE.\n\n       (a) Conveyance of Property.--Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall convey by \n     quit-claim deed to the county of Rio Arriba, New Mexico, \n     subject to the terms and conditions stated in subsection (b), \n     all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to \n     the land (including all improvements on the land) known as \n     the ``Old Coyote Administrative Site'' located approximately \n     \\1/2\\ mile east\n\n[[Page S12311]]\n\n     of the Village of Coyote, New Mexico on State Road 96, \n     comprising 1 tract of 130.27 acres and 1 tract of 276.76 \n     acres.\n       (b) Terms and Conditions.--\n       (1) Consideration.--The conveyance described in subsection \n     (a) shall be in consideration of an amount that is agreeable \n     to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and the county of Rio Arriba, New Mexico, \n     payable in full within the 6-month period referred to in \n     subsection (a), or, at the option of the county, in 20 annual \n     payments due on January 1 of the first year beginning after \n     the date of enactment of this Act and annually thereafter \n     until the total amount due has been paid. The county shall \n     not be charged interest on amounts owed the United States for \n     the conveyance.\n       (2) Release.--On conveyance of the property under \n     subsection (a), the county shall release the United States \n     from any liability for claims relating to the property.\n       (3) Reversion.--The conveyance under subsection (a) shall \n     be a conveyance fee simple title to the property, subject to \n     reversion to the United States if the property is used for \n     other than public purposes or if the consideration \n     requirements under paragraph (1) are not met.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Moynihan, and \n        Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1512. A bill to amend section 659 of title 18, United States Code; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with \nSenators D'Amato, Moynihan, and Torricelli that addresses the growing \nproblem of cargo theft. This crime, which covers the interstate theft \nof cargo from ports, airports, rails, and roads, causes losses as high \nas $10 billion a year in the United States. The ``Cargo Theft \nDeterrence Act of 1997'' increases the incentive for prosecutors to \npursue this crime and for defendants to cooperate with law enforcement. \nFurthermore, this legislation clarifies what is covered by existing \nlaw.\n  Cargo theft continues unabated as criminals discover that the risks \nof getting caught and prosecuted are far lower than for comparably \nlucrative crimes. This tends to be an under-reported crime that has \nreceived a relatively small amount of attention by Congress. I believe \nthis must change. Mr. President, let me cite a few statistics that \nshould demonstrate to my colleagues the seriousness of this crime and \nwhy we should act. In 1994, the dollar value in goods stolen from a \nsingle tractor-trailer rig in New Jersey was higher than all of the \nbank robberies combined in my state for that year.\n  While certain regions of the United States, such as New Jersey/New \nYork, Southern California, and South Florida, sustain higher cargo \ntheft losses than others, consumers nationwide are affected. For \nexample, one industry group estimated that computers cost an average of \n$150 more because of cargo theft, and that approximately $3.5 billion \nof computers, chips, and software are stolen annually. The risk \nmanagement director for one computer company said that ``it's a rare \ncompany that hasn't ever lost a truck.'' Most people do not realize \nthat the value of computer chips per pound is higher than gold. And, \nunfortunately, the resale value of stolen items is much higher than \nwhat one might believe. Many of these goods end up overseas while \nothers are sold in the same city.\n  Mr. President, virtually no product is safe from this crime. While \ntheft of computers and computer products, fragrances, and designer \nclothes are not uncommon, items ranging from frozen seafood, pineapple \npulp, cough drops, refried beans, and insulation have been reported \nstolen.\n  The industry maxim of ``cargo at rest is cargo at risk'' is no longer \na truism--all cargo is a risk--and contrary to the belief that this is \na victimless crime, an alarming number of tractor trailers have been \nhijacked. This occurred just several weeks ago in New Jersey, when a \ntruck was hijacked right after leaving a port. Fortunately the driver \nwas unharmed though one million dollars' worth of clothes were stolen. \nTighter measures taken by port authorities and manufacturers at their \nplants have caused such hijackings to increase.\n  Mr. President, the need for this legislation is not a criticism of \nour law enforcement. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, for \nexample, has made significant strides at curbing this crime in the New \nJersey/New York region. Unfortunately, existing law does not provide an \nadequate deterrent because the penalties are not sufficiently severe \nnor is there an incentive for defendants to cooperate with prosecutors.\n  Let me explain, Mr. President, what my legislation will do. It will \nbring efforts to fight this crime into the next century. Enacted in its \nearliest form in 1913, the statute that my bill modifies covers such \nolder modes of transportation and distribution of cargo as wagons, \ndepots, and steamboats. My bill recognizes the advances we have made in \nintermodal connections and transportation by adding such terms as \n``trailer,'' ``air cargo container,'' and ``freight consolidation \nfacility.'' The days of cargo theft from wagons are gone. Furthermore, \nthe Cargo Theft Deterrence Act broadens the statute's coverage to \nclarify that cargo is moving as an interstate or foreign shipment at \nall points between the point of origin and the final destination. \nMerely because a container is temporarily at rest awaiting transport to \nits final destination should not prevent law enforcement from \nprosecuting a defendant under this statute. Existing law currently \ncovers cargo moving as a part of interstate or foreign commerce.\n  My legislation increases the penalties for convictions under this \nstatute. Current law provides that those convicted of this provision \nshall be fined or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. My bill \nincreases this maximum prison term to three. This statute, as currently \nwritten, requires the government to prove that not only did a defendant \nembezzle, steal, or unlawfully take the cargo, it must show that he did \nso with the intent to convert to his own use. This seems duplicative at \nbest and is an unnecessary hurdle for the prosecutor to demonstrate. \nThe Cargo Theft Deterrence Act eliminates the term, ``with intent to \nconvert to his own use'' from this statute. Since we have removed this \nintent language, we have created the affirmative defense that the \ndefendant bought, received, or possessed the cargo with the sole intent \nof reporting the matter to either law enforcement or the owner of the \ncargo.\n  The Sentencing Commission is directed to provide a sentencing \nenhancement of two levels for this crime similar to enhancements made \nfor offenses involving organized schemes to steal vehicles or if the \noffense involved more than minimal planning. This Act also requires the \nAttorney General to report annually to Congress on the progress made by \nlaw enforcement investigating and prosecuting this crime. Additionally, \nupon motion by the Attorney General, a court may reduce the penalties \nif a defendant cooperates with law enforcement. Use of informants is \nessential in reducing this crime and this provision creates an \nappropriate incentive.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation creates a Cargo Theft Advisory \nCommittee that will study and make recommendations about the \nestablishment of a national data base of information about this crime. \nA constant complaint by industry and law enforcement is that there is a \nlack of good data about cargo theft. Industry tends to under-report it \nand law enforcement frequently classifies it in such categories as \ntheft, robbery, hijacking, and burglary. This Committee, which shall \nexist for one year and report its findings and recommendations to \nCongress and the President, will also review the desirability of \ncreating a centralized office within the federal government to oversee \nefforts designed to curb cargo theft and to increase coordination with \nthe private sector, and state and local law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, I thought an advisory committee was the most prudent \ncourse because legitimate questions have been raised about whether this \ndata base should be maintained by the public or private sector, who \nshould be able to access it, and what information should be collected, \nyet remain confidential. Moreover, there are several logical agencies \nthat could house an office on cargo security so I thought it is \nappropriate to have cargo security experts in both the public and \nprivate sector make this recommendation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the Judiciary Committee's \nconsideration of this legislation and urge my colleagues to support \nthis first step in addressing this crime that affects all Americans. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S12312]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \nunderlying legislation will ratify an agreement between the Aleut \nCorporation in Alaska, the Department of the Interior and the \nDepartment of the Navy concerning the reuse of lands occupied by the \nNavy.\n  When the Navy's lease expires in October of next year the lands and \nfacilities are to be relinquished back to the Department of the \nInterior for inclusion into the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife \nRefuge. The legislation\n\n[[Page S12315]]\n\nintroduced yesterday will facilitate the transfer of that land to Aleut \nCorporation in exchange for other ANCSA land selections made by the \nAleuts. The amendment I offer today will ensure that the private \nproperty on Adak Island is transferred to the Aleuts as well as the \nland and interests in that land. Without this amendment, Mr. President, \nthe facilities constructed on Adak Island by the Navy cannot be placed \ninto productive civilian use. If we are to help the Aleut Corporation \nestablish a community on Adak the ability to use these facilities is \ncritical.\n  I look forward to moving the underlying legislation and this \namendment through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee early next \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12314-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  FEINSTEIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 1619-1620\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by \nher to the bill (S. 1269) to establish objectives for negotiating and \nprocedures for implementing certain trade agreements;

(a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is the constitutional duty of the Congress to ensure \n     that the decennial enumeration of the population is conducted \n     in a manner consistent with the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States;\n       (2) the sole constitutional purpose of the decennial \n     enumeration of the population is the apportionment of \n     Representatives in Congress among the several States;\n       (3) section 2 of the 14th article of amendment to the \n     Constitution clearly states that Representatives are to be \n     ``apportioned among the several States according to their \n     respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in \n     each State'';\n       (4) article I, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution \n     clearly requires an ``actual Enumeration'' of the population, \n     and section 195 of title 13, United States Code, clearly \n     provides ``Except for the determination of population for \n     purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress \n     among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he \n     considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical \n     method known as `sampling' in carrying out the provisions of \n     this title.'';\n       (5) the decennial enumeration of the population is one of \n     the most critical constitutional functions our Federal \n     Government performs;\n       (6) it is essential that the decennial enumeration of the \n     population be as accurate as possible, consistent with the \n     Constitution and laws of the United States;\n       (7) the use of statistical sampling or statistical \n     adjustment in conjunction with an actual enumeration to carry \n     out the census with respect to any segment of the population \n     poses the risk of an inaccurate, invalid, and \n     unconstitutional census;\n       (8) the decennial enumeration of the population is a \n     complex and vast undertaking, and if such enumeration is \n     conducted in a manner that does not comply with the \n     requirements of the Constitution or laws of the United \n     States, it would be impracticable for the States to obtain, \n     and the courts of the United States to provide, meaningful \n     relief after such enumeration has been conducted; and\n       (9) Congress is committed to providing the level of funding \n     that is required to perform the entire range of \n     constitutional census activities, with a particular emphasis \n     on accurately enumerating all individuals who have \n     historically been undercounted, and toward this end, Congress \n     expects--\n       (A) aggressive and innovative promotion and outreach \n     campaigns in hard-to-count communities;\n       (B) the hiring of enumerators from within those \n     communities;\n       (C) continued cooperation with local government on address \n     list development; and\n       (D) maximized census employment opportunities for \n     individuals seeking to make the transition from welfare to \n     work.\n       (b) Any person aggrieved by the use of any statistical \n     method in violation of the Constitution or any provision of \n     law (other than this Act), in connection with the 2000 or any \n     later decennial census, to determine the population for \n     purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of members in \n     Congress, may in a civil action obtain declaratory, \n     injunctive, and any other appropriate relief against the use \n     of such method.\n       (c) For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the use of any statistical method as part of a dress \n     rehearsal or other simulation of a census in preparation for \n     the use of such method, in a decennial census, to determine \n     the population for purposes of the apportionment or \n     redistricting of members in Congress shall be considered the \n     use of such method in connection with that census; and\n       (2) the report ordered by title VIII of Public Law 105-18 \n     and the Census 2000 Operational Plan shall be deemed to \n     constitute final agency action regarding the use of \n     statistical methods in the 2000 decennial census, thus making \n     the\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\n     question of their use in such census sufficiently concrete \n     and final to now be reviewable in a judicial proceeding.\n       (d) For purposes of this section, an aggrieved person \n     (described in subsection (b)) includes--\n       (1) any resident of a State whose congressional \n     representation or district could be changed as a result of \n     the use of a statistical method challenged in the civil \n     action;\n       (2) any Representative or Senator in Congress; and\n       (3) either House of Congress.\n       (e)(1) Any action brought under this section shall be heard \n     and determined by a district court of three judges in \n     accordance with section 2284 of title 28, United States Code. \n     The chief judge of the United States court of appeals for \n     each circuit shall, to the extent practicable and consistent \n     with the avoidance of unnecessary delay, consolidate, for all \n     purposes, in one district court within that circuit, all \n     actions pending in that circuit under this section. Any party \n     to an action under this section shall be precluded from \n     seeking any consolidation of that action other than is \n     provided in this paragraph. In selecting the district court \n     in which to consolidate such actions, the chief judge shall \n     consider the convenience of the parties and witnesses and \n     efficient conduct of such actions. Any final order or \n     injunction of a United States district court that is issued \n     pursuant to an action brought under this section shall be \n     reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the \n     United States. Any such appeal shall be taken by a notice of \n     appeal filed within 10 days after such order is entered; and \n     the jurisdictional statement shall be filed within 30 days \n     after such order is entered. No stay of an order issued \n     pursuant to an action brought under this section may be \n     issued by a single Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       (2) It shall be the duty of a United States district court \n     hearing an action brought under this section and the Supreme \n     Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to \n     expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of \n     any such matter.\n       (f) Any agency or entity within the executive branch having \n     authority with respect to the carrying out of a decennial \n     census may in a civil action obtain a declaratory judgment \n     respecting whether or not the use of a statistical method, in \n     connection with such census, to determine the population for \n     the purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of members \n     in Congress is forbidden by the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States.\n       (g) The Speaker of the House of Representatives or the \n     Speaker's designee or designees may commence or join in a \n     civil action, for and on behalf of the House of \n     Representatives, under any applicable law, to prevent the use \n     of any statistical method, in connection with the decennial \n     census, to determine the population for purposes of the \n     apportionment or redistricting of members in Congress.

The Congress finds that progress on the peace \n     process in the Middle East is vitally important to United \n     States security interests in the region. The Congress \n     recognizes that, in fulfilling its obligations under the \n     Treaty of Peace Between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the \n     State of Israel, done at Washington on March 26, 1979, Israel \n     incurred severe economic burdens. Furthermore, the Congress \n     recognizes that an economically and militarily secure Israel \n     serves the security interests of the United States, for a \n     secure Israel is an Israel which has the incentive and \n     confidence to continue pursuing the peace process. Therefore, \n     the Congress declares that, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, it is the policy and the intention of the \n     United States that the funds provided in annual \n     appropriations for the Economic Support Fund which are \n     allocated to Israel shall not be less than the annual debt \n     repayment (interest and principal) from Israel to the United \n     States Government in recognition that such a principle serves \n     United States interests in the region.\n\n\n   prohibition on funding for abortions and involuntary sterilization\n\n       Sec. 518.

Accordingly, the United States and its NATO allies \n     should make this intention clear in negotiations with Russia, \n     including negotiations regarding adaptation of the \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of November \n     19, 1990.\n       (2) Limitations on commitments to russia.--In seeking to \n     demonstrate to Russia NATO's defensive and security-enhancing \n     intentions, it is essential that neither fundamental United \n     States security interests in Europe nor the effectiveness and \n     flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance be jeopardized. \n     In particular, no commitments should be made to Russia that \n     would have the effect of--\n       (A) extending rights or imposing responsibilities on new \n     NATO members different from those applicable to current NATO \n     members, including rights or responsibilities with respect to \n     the deployment of nuclear weapons and the stationing of \n     troops and equipment from other NATO members;\n       (B) limiting the ability of NATO to defend the territory of \n     new NATO members by, for example, restricting the \n     construction of defense infrastructure or limiting the \n     ability of NATO to deploy necessary reinforcements;\n       (C) providing any international organization, or any \n     country that is not a member of NATO, with authority to \n     delay, veto, or otherwise impede deliberations and decisions \n     of the North Atlantic Council or the implementation of such \n     decisions, including deliberations and decisions with respect \n     to the deployment of NATO forces or the admission of \n     additional members to NATO;\n       (D) impeding the development of enhanced relations between \n     NATO and other European countries that do not belong to the \n     Alliance;\n       (E) establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in Central or \n     Eastern Europe;\n       (F) requiring NATO to subsidize Russian arms sales, \n     service, or support to the militaries of those former Warsaw \n     Pact countries invited to join the Alliance; or\n       (G) legitimizing Russian efforts to link concessions in \n     arms control negotiations to NATO enlargement.\n       (3) Commitments from russia.--In order to enhance security \n     and stability in Europe, the United States should seek \n     commitments from Russia--\n       (A) to demarcate and respect all its borders with \n     neighboring states;\n       (B) to achieve the immediate and complete withdrawal of any \n     armed forces and military equipment under the control of \n     Russia that are deployed on the territories of the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union without the \n     full and complete agreement of those states;\n       (C) to station its armed forces on the territory of other \n     states only with the full and complete agreement of that \n     state and in strict accordance with international law; and\n       (D) to take steps to reduce further its nuclear and \n     conventional forces in Kaliningrad.\n       (4) Consultations.--As negotiations on adaptation of the \n     Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe proceed, the \n     United States should engage in close and continuous \n     consultations not only with its NATO allies, but also with \n     the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, \n     Ukraine, and the South Caucasus.\n       (c) Policy With Respect to Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Cooperation.--\n       (1) In general.--As the United States proceeds with efforts \n     to develop defenses against ballistic missile attack, it \n     should seek to foster a climate of cooperation with Russia on \n     matters related to missile defense. In particular, the United \n     States and its NATO allies should seek to cooperate with \n     Russia in such areas as early warning.\n       (2) Discussions with nato allies.--The United States should \n     initiate discussions with its NATO allies for the purpose of \n     examining the feasibility of deploying a ballistic missile \n     defense capable of protecting NATO's southern and eastern \n     flanks from a limited ballistic missile attack.\n       (3) Constitutional prerogatives.--Even as the Congress \n     seeks to promote ballistic missile defense cooperation with \n     Russia, it must insist on its constitutional prerogatives \n     regarding consideration of arms control agreements with \n     Russia that bear on ballistic missile defense.\n\n     SEC. 2703.

Mr. President, on Veterans' Day, I will be \nparticipating in a very special ceremony for a very special individual. \nThe occasion is the presentation of a Silver Star Medal 53 years after \nthe event to a World War II veteran named Albert Sponheimer. It gives \nme great pleasure to submit, for the Record, the text of my remarks:\n  The remarks follow:\n\n        Silver Star Medal Presentation to Albert Sponheimer, Jr.\n\n       I am so proud to be here today to honor Al Sponheimer in \n     front of his family and friends and, of course, all of you in \n     the audience--students who are fortunate enough to witness \n     this historic event.\n       This is the part of my job I love the most--the fact that \n     we are all here today, 53 years, 5 months and 5 days after \n     the event to witness the presentation of a Silver Star Medal \n     for heroism. Al Sponheimer, a veteran of the Second World \n     War, is a testament to the saying that perseverance pays off.\n       Al Sponheimer first contacted my office back in December \n     1994. In a characteristically modest manner, he asked for \n     information about how he might get his Silver Star, in the \n     absence of official documentation, 50 years after the fact. I \n     could see that Al was not comfortable pursuing this, but was \n     probably goaded into it by the four gentlemen sitting next to \n     him today.\n       Anyway, back to the story. Soon after, we received a letter \n     from Captain Heitz outlining Mr. Sponheimer's heroic actions \n     on June 6, 1944. He wrote:\n       ``PFC Sponheimer was one of two aides men assigned to my \n     battery. In fact, I was his first battlefield patient. He was \n     seen giving first aid to anyone who needed it, not \n     necessarily Battery A personnel. He roamed almost the full \n     length of Omaha Beach, helping where he could while many \n     around him were wounded by flying shrapnel or ricocheting \n     bullets fired from the Germans on the bluff of Omaha Beach''\n       Once the Army read this letter, I thought for sure they \n     would send Mr. Sponheimer's medal by return mail. This was \n     not the case. The time for consideration of WWII medal \n     requests had expired. We had to apply to the Board for \n     Correction of Military Records where the average length of \n     time for consideration of these requests is about 2 years. \n     The application was sent in on February 7, 1996. 18 months \n     later the Board made a favorable decision--Al would finally \n     receive his Silver Star.\n       And that is what brings us here today--appropriately on \n     Armistice Day--to correct a 53-year-old record and honor a \n     person who, under enemy fire, performed heroically.\n\n  Mr. President, thank you again for this opportunity to submit my \nremarks for the Record. I hope Mr. Sponheimer's story will inspire \nother veterans to pursue their entitlement to military medals or \nawards, even if the lapse in time seems insurmountable.\n  I also want to extend my condolences to the Sponheimer family at the \nrecent and untimely passing of Al's wife, Audrey. I know her absence \nwill be deeply felt by Al, their children and grandchildren on this \nspecial day. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12399-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE WALT DISNEY CO.: 1997 CORPORATION OF THE YEAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. Moore has worked to ensure that the U.S. \nindustry was technologically equal to any in the world, and that its \ncompanies are strong and well run.\n  Mr. Moore's efforts have greatly enhanced the position of our machine \ntool industry, and I congratulate him for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12399-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12399-S12400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WELCOME HOME 452D ARMY RESERVE ORDNANCE COMPANY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

The 452d is also a tier 2A high priority unit, which \nmeans that the members of this unit are well-trained, have adequate \nmanpower, and have a high level of readiness. The men and women of the \n452d pride themselves on their ability to quickly and effectively \nmobilize when their country calls upon them.\n  The 452d has an impressive history of serving the Nation. The 452d \nOrdnance Company was the first unit in the 6th Army to be deployed \nduring Operation Desert Storm. The members performed extremely well \nduring this mobilization and received the Meritorious Unit Commendation \nfrom the Secretary of the Army for their outstanding service. As you \nknow, Mr. President, this is an extremely prestigious award with only a \nhandful of National Guard and Reserve units having ever received it. \nFurthermore, the 452d was recently inspected and found to be performing \nat such an outstanding level that the unit is being recommended for the \nMeritorious Unit Commendation once again. Most units would be honored \nto simply be nominated for this award, and it is truly a sign of the \n452d's excellence that it may receive the award twice.\n  In addition to helping lead coalition forces to victory in the Middle \nEast, the 452d brought relief to many in their hometown of Aberdeen, \nSD, by aiding emergency management efforts in recent winter storms and \nflooding. The 452d is a shining example of how reserve units across the \ncountry are being called upon more frequently to serve their country \nboth at home and abroad.\n  The men and women of the 452d began their most recent, and perhaps \nmost demanding, mission in March of this year when 83 members of the \nunit were mobilized for duty in Europe. For the past 8 months, these \nindividuals were stationed at Taszar Air Base, Hungary, supporting \npeacekeeping efforts in Bosnia. Unit members were rotated into Bosnia \nfrom time to time, venturing inside one of the most politically \nvolatile areas in the world.\n  Of course, the soldiers who were mobilized were not the only ones who \nsacrificed in service to their country. The families of these \nservicemembers also exhibited extreme courage in facing new challenges \nand additional responsibilities in the absence of their loved ones. To \nhelp with that transition, the 452d Family Support Group provided \nguidance, assistance, and support. In fact, during the Persian Gulf \nconflict, the 452d Family Support Group received the Best Small Unit \nFamily Outreach Program Award from the 96th Army Reserve Command. The \n452d\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\nFamily Support Group met every Wednesday to discuss the ways in which \nthey could best support family members of the mobilized soldiers. On \nSaturdays, they frequently showed videos of the mobilized soldiers \nstationed in Hungary and provided access to e-mail for communication \nbetween soldiers and their family members.\n  Each and every family member deserves recognition, but at the risk of \nleaving someone out, I would like to mention the following officers of \nthe 452d Family Support Group: Sandy Robinson, South Dakota Reserve \nFamily Support leader; Ronnie Evenson, unit leader; Becky Parker, group \nleader; Lois Beckner, group leader; Mary Ewalt, group leader; and Donna \nSchulte, assistant group leader.\n  I would also like to mention the important service provided by the \nunit members who were not mobilized, but who remained in South Dakota \nand provided the ever-important moral support to their colleagues \nserving overseas. These individuals, including mechanics, \nadministrative personnel, and others, continue to ensure that the unit \nis ready to serve their nation at a moment's notice.\n\n  It is also important to recognize those employers who stood by their \nemployees called upon to serve their nation. The commitment of \nemployers like these allow our country to rely so heavily on its \nreserve and guard forces.\n  It is with much relief and pride that I join the family members of \nthe 452d and all South Dakotans in welcoming the following troops \nsafely home from their mission. It is from this service that the 452d \nhas formed a strong bond with the community of Aberdeen and the State \nof South Dakota, and I thank them for their service.\n  Sgt. Brian Allmendinger, Spc.

Mr. President, in recent days, Chairman McCain and \nI have addressed the Commerce Committee's communications agenda for \nnext year. I expect the Communications Subcommittee, which I chair, to \nhave an active and full slate of issues as we approach the second \nsession of the 105th Congress.\n  Chairman McCain and I have agreed that the Communications \nSubcommittee will hold a series of oversight hearings on the \nimplementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. We will examine \nthe degree to which the act has met its objectives of promoting \ncompetition and deregulation. We will examine the level of competition \nin the local and long-distance markets, between cable companies and \nalternative video providers, competition in the wireless industry and \nother important issues. We will devote considerable attention to \ninterconnection issues and universal service.\n  I would like to address in some depth an issue that will be one of \nthe most important issues before the Communications Subcommittee, that \nof international satellite reform.\n  The Communications Subcommittee has already begun to examine the \ninternational satellite communications market. On July 25 of this year, \nthe subcommittee held a very informative hearing on this vital issue. \nWe learned of the need for further changes in the regulation of the \ninternational market. We need to promote greater competition \ninternationally while lifting unneeded regulations domestically. The \nissues in this debate are complex--they involve trade policy, fair \ntreatment for those with existing investments, allocations of spectrum \nand orbital slots, market access, and elimination of outdated \nregulations.\n  Recently, my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, introduced S. \n1328, which is virtually identical to a bill introduced earlier this \nyear in the House by Chairman Bliley. Senator Inouye has stated that he \nhopes his bill will help ``spur debate on this important issue.'' I \nshare this hope. Senator Inouye's bill has been referred to the \nCommerce Committee. I look forward to working with him and others next \nyear to develop an appropriate international satellite policy for the \nfuture, and also to address other domestic satellite issues.\n  As we move forward, I am going to be guided by the principles of \nformer President Ronald Reagan. In 1984, President Reagan signed an \nExecutive order that effectively eliminated outdated regulations and \nallowed U.S.-licensed satellite companies to compete around the world. \nThat competition has resulted in greater consumer choices, lower \nprices, and the ability to reach anyone anywhere in the world.\n  Now as we approach the turn of the century, we need to complete \nPresident Reagan's vision. The Satellite Act, which was enacted in 1962 \nat a time when satellites were still experimental, has become outdated. \nThis country cannot afford to have an industry guided by rules that \nwere created in the days of Sputnik. We need to look forward at ways to \nroll back unwarranted regulations and fully unleash the potential \nthat this industry holds.\n\n  I share the goals of increasing competition, privatizing \nintergovernmental organizations, and enhancing market access abroad for \nAmerican satellite companies. Any legislative action should be designed \nto promote opportunities for American businesses, while making sure \nthey are not harmed by the very effort that seeks to enhance their \nability to succeed in the international marketplace. These are \nextremely complex issues and there may be different paths that lead to \nthe same goals. The approach the subcommittee will take in further \nexploring these issues will be balanced. We will examine in detail how \nbest to eliminate outdated regulations, address universal service \nconcerns and provide for the needed flexibility to achieve an \ninternational agreement on satellite policy.\n  I will continue to work with the Communications Subcommittee on this \ncritical issue. I look forward to holding further hearings, and intend \nto develop legislation with Chairman McCain, ranking member Hollings, \nSenator Inouye, and other committee members to establish fair rules \nthat are competitively neutral for the international market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12400-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12400-S12401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ``ONE GOOD COW'' PROJECT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of two outstanding Montana cattlewomen, Michelle Tebay \nand Lisa Schmidt of Whitehall, MT.\n  This past year has been tough in Montana and across the West for many \ncattle producers. They incurred severe losses due to floods and \nblizzards. But thanks to the hard work and vision of Michelle Tebay and \nLisa Schmidt, hope is on the horizon. They initiated a project called \n``One Good Cow,'' and it certainly deserves our attention.\n  In Montana, we pride ourselves on looking out for one another--\nespecially\n\n[[Page S12401]]\n\nduring challenging times. When Michelle heard about all the cattle \nlosses Western ranchers were suffering, she contacted Lisa who works as \nan Ag Extension agent for Madison and Jefferson Counties. Together, the \ntwo women formulated a plan. And, that plan was to convince ranchers \nwho survived the storms to help the less fortunate replenish their \nherds. The dream has become reality.\n  Today, the ``One Good Cow'' project is working to collect and \ntransport 80,000 healthy, pregnant cows to folks who lost significant \nportions of their herds last winter. And the good news is that their \nfellow ranchers from across the Nation are donating these cattle. This \nteamwork has resulted in success for all. It has even gained national \nmedia attention and will be featured on national TV network news later \nthis week.\n  The ``One Good Cow'' program is a prime example of how ranchers from \nall over the United States can work together in times of adversity. \nThat shouldn't surprise anyone. Ranchers have always relied on each \nother as they face the worst that Mother Nature has to offer.\n  But the real credit goes to Michelle and Lisa. Mr. President, it is \nimpossible to count the number of lives that will be touched by their \nidea. I would just like to add my voice to all the others and say \n``Thank you, so much, Michelle and Lisa.''\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to become familiar with the ``One \nGood Cow'' Program and give it their full support. Our ranchers are \ndepending on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12400-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROTECTION OF U.S. BORDERS\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when we convene for the second \nsession of the 105th Congress, I will introduce legislation which will \nauthorize the U.S. Customs Service to acquire the necessary personnel \nand technology to execute their duties at our international borders \nwith Mexico and Canada. Specifically, my proposal is designed to reduce \ndelays at border crossings to not more than 20 minutes, while \nmaintaining--in fact, strengthening--our commitment to interdict \nillegal narcotics and other contraband.\n  In working with local officials, businesses, the Border Trade \nAlliance, and several of my colleagues, it has become evident that the \nbest way to accomplish these objectives is to increase Customs staffing \nand provide the technological resources that can give them the best \nchance at accomplishing their mission. Customs staffing needs to be \nincreased significantly to facilitate the flow of substantially \nincreased traffic on both the Southwestern and Northern borders. The \npractical effect of these personnel increases will be to open all the \nexisting primary inspection lanes where congestion is a problem during \npeak hours and enhance investigative resources on the Southwest border.\n  I am very concerned about the impact on Texas and the Nation of \nnarcotics trafficking and have worked closely with Federal and State \nlaw enforcement officials to identify and secure the necessary \nresources to battle the onslaught of illegal drugs. At the same time, \nhowever, our current enforcement strategy--which is burdened by \ninsufficient staffing and a virtual absence of vital interdiction \ntechnology--is effectively closing the door to legitimate trade.\n  Long traffic lines at our international crossings serve no useful \npurpose and are counterproductive to improving our trade relationship \nwith Mexico. At a time when NAFTA and the expanding world marketplace \nare making it possible for us to create more commerce, freedom, and \nopportunity for people on both sides of the border, it is important \nthat we eliminate the border crossing delays that are stifling these \ngoals.\n  My bill will be designed to shorten those lines and promote \nlegitimate commerce, while providing the Customs Service with the means \nnecessary to eliminate the drug trafficking operations that are now \nrampant along the 1,200-mile border that my State shares with Mexico. I \nwill be speaking further to my colleagues about this initiative and \nurge their support for the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12401-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12401-S12403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAST-TRACK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer some thoughts on the \nproposed fast-track legislation.\n  A number of other Members have made some excellent points on this \nsubject, in large part reflecting my own views.\n  This is especially true of the comments made by the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], and I want to commend him for his \nconstancy on this critical issue of preserving the constitutional role \nof Congress in matters of trade.\n  He has rightly framed this issue, not as a question of favoring or \nopposing free or fair trade, but as a question of what role Congress \nplays in trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, the fast-track proposal we are considering, and its \npredecessors, are quite recent inventions.\n  Prior to the Tokyo round of the GATT, there was no fast-track \nmechanism.\n  In fact, of the hundreds and hundreds of trade agreements our Nation \nhas negotiated and entered into, only five have used the fast-track \nprocedures.\n  Mr. President, this should dispose of the argument that fast track is \nnecessary for us to negotiate trade agreements.\n  Fast track has been the exception, not the rule, with regard to trade \nnegotiations.\n  I understand this Administration has negotiated and implemented over \n200 trade agreements without fast track.\n  What were some of those agreements?\n  Well, Mr. President, they included: the market access agreement with \nArgentina for textiles and clothing; the market access agreement with \nAustralia for textiles and clothing; the agreement on bilateral trade \nrelations with Belarus; the market access agreement with Brazil for \ntextiles and clothing; an agreement concerning intellectual property \nrights with Bulgaria; an agreement between the United States of America \nand the Kingdom of Cambodia on trade relations and intellectual \nproperty rights protection; the agreement on salmon and herring with \nCanada; the agreement on ultra-high temperature milk with Canada; the \nagreement on trade in softwood lumber with Canada; the agreement on \nintellectual property rights protection with Ecuador; a memorandum of \nunderstanding on trade in bananas with Costa Rica; several agreements \nwith the European Union; an agreement on intellectual property rights \nprotection with India; several dozen agreements with Japan; several \ndozen agreements with Korea; and many, many more agreements with dozens \nof other countries.\n\n  And not only bilateral agreements, Mr. President, but also \nmultilateral agreements such as the complex Multilateral Agreement on \nInvestment, the Information Technology Agreement, and the Telecomm \nAgreement--these last two having been both negotiated and implemented \nwithout fast-track procedures.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the phrase ``fast-track negotiating \nauthority'' is a misnomer.\n  The President already has the authority to negotiate and implement \ntrade agreements.\n  That broad authority was most recently extended indefinitely to the \nPresident as part of the 1994 GATT Uruguay round implementing \nlegislation.\n  That authority, called ``Proclamation Authority,'' has its roots in \nthe Reciprocal Trade Act of 1934, which allowed a President to ``enter \ninto foreign trade agreements * * * and to proclaim such modifications \nof existing duties and other import restrictions * * * as are required \nor appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement.''\n  Mr. President, while the ability to negotiate and enter into \ninternational agreements are inherently part of the President's \nconstitutional powers, the Constitution grants exclusive authority to \nCongress ``to regulate Commerce with foreign nations.''\n  Congress has sole constitutional authority over setting tariff levels \nand making or changing federal law.\n  With the 1934 act, though, Congress delegated some of its authority \nto the President when the number and frequency of trade negotiations \nbegan increasing.\n  It is under this ``Proclamation Authority'' that President Clinton \nhas negotiated and entered into over 200 trade agreements.\n\n[[Page S12402]]\n\n  And he is free to continue that work.\n  He did not need fast track to negotiate those agreements, and he does \nnot need it to negotiate additional agreements.\n  At a recent meeting on this very issue, one of the participants \nsuggested that everyone ought to pay a one dollar fine every time they \nused the phrase ``fast-track negotiating authority,'' because it was so \nfundamentally misleading.\n  Mr. President, the Senate might consider adopting such a rule, and if \nwe did adopt a $1 fine for using the phrase ``fast-track negotiating \nauthority,'' we might balance the budget ahead of schedule, maybe even \nbegin to pay down the debt.\n  Until we do adopt such a rule, Mr. President, we will just have to be \nalert to the misuse of that phrase, and correct those who employ it.\n  Mr. President, those who support fast track constantly make the \nargument that if you want free trade, you have to enact fast track.\n  They equate fast track with free trade.\n  The reason is obvious.\n  The arguments for free trade are powerful.\n  Indeed, I agree with those arguments.\n  We as a nation are better off in a world with freer trade than we are \nwithout it.\n  But the underlying premise, that we need fast track to achieve free \nand fair trade, is absolutely false.\n  Mr. President, I have referred to the hundreds of trade agreements \nnegotiated by this Administration without fast-track procedures.\n  That is evidence enough.\n  But let me also argue that not only is fast track not necessary for \nfree trade, it may actually undermine it.\n  Mr. President, one of the greatest defects of the recently enacted \nNAFTA and GATT agreements was the perception that those agreements \npicked winners and losers.\n  I believe strongly that those perceptions are based on reality, that \nsome industries were huge winners in those agreements, while other \nindustries were effectively written off.\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin had more than its share of those industries \nthat were written off, and at the top of that list, at the very top was \nthe dairy farmer.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that other industries were given a \nhigher priority than our dairy farmers, and the results of those \nagreements underscore that feeling.\n  Under the GATT, the European Union is allowed to export 20 times the \namount of dairy products under subsidy that the United States is \nallowed to export.\n  Mr. President, not only did we formally provide the EU this \nsignificant advantage in that agreement with respect to dairy, \napparently the EU is not even complying with those incredibly generous \nlimitations.\n  The lower priority industries do not end with dairy, and while our \nmore populous cities--Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay--experienced \nserious job the fallout from the winners and losers approach extended \nto many smaller communities.\n  Even if we only use the extremely conservative statistics collected \nby the Department of Labor--statistics which many argue grossly \nunderstate actual job loss--smaller communities all over Wisconsin have \nbeen the victim of this winners and losers approach to trade \nagreements.\n  These include places such as: DeForest, with 40 lost jobs; Elkhorn, \nwith 50 lost jobs; Hawkins, with 443 lost jobs; Mauston, with 48 lost \njobs; Merrill, with 84 lost jobs; Montello, with 25 lost jobs; \nPeshtigo, with 69 lost jobs; and Platteville, with 576 lost jobs.\n\n  Mr. President, to trade negotiators whose focus was on advancing the \nprospects of those industries they predetermined to be winners, the \nlosses experienced elsewhere apparently were unfortunate but \nacceptable.\n  For the communities I mentioned, Mr. President, those losses were \nreal--real workers with real families to support.\n  Mr. President, the fast-track procedures under which GATT and NAFTA \nwere negotiated and implemented invites this kind of polarization at \nthe negotiating table.\n  And it is this kind of economic disparity produced by these trade \nagreements--the picking of winners and losers--that undermines broad \npublic support for pursuing free trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, free trade ought to benefit all sectors of the \neconomy.\n  Without fast-track procedures, our negotiators will know their work \nproduct will undergo rigorous congressional scrutiny.\n  And they will know that it will be much more difficult to enact a \ntrade agreement that disproportionately benefits some while \ndisadvantaging others.\n  Mr. President, it is this kind of trade agreement--one which benefits \nthe entire economy--that will enhance the cause of free trade.\n  Mr. President, fast track also encourages another disturbing trend in \ntrade agreements, namely advancing the short-term interests of \nmultinational corporations over those of the average worker and \nconsumer.\n  The increasing globalization of the economy confronts us every day.\n  Few can doubt the enormous power multinational corporations wield in \ntrade agreements, from the negotiating table itself to the closed-door \nbargaining that will go on before the implementing legislation is sent \nto Congress.\n  Fast track procedures make it all the easier for those interests to \nadvance an agreement that may include provisions which conflict with \nthe interests of our Nation.\n  With opposition to the entire agreement the only alternative left to \nCongress, and with the considerable weight of the multinational \ncorporate interests behind any proposal, it is likely that Congress \nwill swallow even a deeply flawed agreement.\n  Mr. President, what does that do for the public support necessary for \nfree trade?\n  It severely undermines it, Mr. President, and puts future trade \nagreements that can enhance our economy at risk.\n  Fast-track also undermines the cause of free trade in another \nimportant way, Mr. President.\n  The proposal we are considering partitions off a number of issues \nthat are vital to achieving a sustainable trade agreement, including \ncurrency stability, human rights, and worker and environmental \nprotections.\n  None of these issues is brought under fast-track procedures.\n  Mr. President, we have only to look to recent Mexican history, their \npolitical turmoil and fiscal roller coaster culminating in the peso \ncrisis, to understand the importance of these other issues to the long-\nterm success of any trade agreement.\n  Even NAFTA's most ardent supporters will concede these events \nseverely undermined any benefits to our economy that were hoped for \nunder that agreement.\n  Mr. President, one might have thought those events would have been a \nlesson on which we could draw.\n  Instead, the fast-track proposal actually backslides in this area.\n  And for what reason, Mr. President?\n  What possible reason can there be to specifically exclude these areas \nfrom fast-track procedures?\n  Some might suggest the reason is that while our national long-term \ninterests could be well served by including these issues in a trade \nagreement to ensure a rising quality of living with our trading \npartners, such issues might conflict with the short-term goals of some \nmultinational interests that look only at next year's bottom line.\n  Others might argue the reason stems from the desire of some interests \nto pursue a race to the bottom in worker and environmental protection, \nand in basic human rights.\n  Such interests can use the leverage of international trade to change \nthose fundamental standards they have been unable to change directly.\n  Mr. President, there is certainly no argument that specifically \nexcluding these issues from fast-track procedures will enhance our \nability to negotiate.\n  Human rights, working conditions, environmental protections --these \nare all great strengths of this Nation.\n  Preventing our trade negotiators from drawing on these great national \nstrengths limits our flexibility at the table.\n  There is no reason to tie our negotiators hands in these areas.\n  In this important regard, the fast-track proposal we are considering \nis a barrier to a sustainable free trade agreement.\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me turn to another provision in the current fast-\ntrack proposal.\n  It may surprise some to know that while specific issues closely \nrelated to the long-term success and sustainability of any trade \nagreement are excluded, the provisions which offset the costs of any \ntrade agreement--provisions which have absolutely no connection to the \ntrade agreement or the willingness of our partners to negotiate with \nus--those funding provisions are covered by fast-track procedures.\n  What does this mean, Mr. President?\n  It means that Congress cannot amend, it cannot even strike, \nprovisions which are attached to implementing legislation to offset the \ncosts of the trade agreement.\n  It means that the most unjustified funding mechanism attached to \ntrade implementing legislation under fast track will remain unscathed.\n  Mr. President, let me stress these funding provisions are not part of \nthe trade agreement itself.\n  Our trading partners do not get a say in how we offset the cost of a \ntrade agreement.\n  One might ask, if our trading partners have no say in the offset \nprovisions, why are those provisions included under fast-track \nprocedures.\n  An excellent question, Mr. President.\n  Many of us will recall the GATT implementing measure which included \nsome controversial funding provisions, including a change in the \nactuarial standards of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. and what \nmany viewed as a sweetheart deal for certain media giants that gave \nthem preferential treatment with respect to FCC licenses.\n  Neither of those offsets had anything to do with the underlying trade \nagreement.\n  Both certainly deserved more scrutiny than they received under the \nconstraints of fast-track procedures.\n  Whatever justification there may be for providing special procedures \nfor trade agreements, procedures which supporters argue are necessary \nto attract our trading partners to the table, there is no such \njustification for shielding the funding provisions from thorough \ncongressional scrutiny and review.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about possible tax increases here.\n  Though not required, as I understand it, among the offsets that \ncomply with our budget rules are tax increases.\n  To put it gently, it is ironic that many who would amend our \nConstitution to require a supermajority vote before any taxes could be \nincreased are now prepared to support a fast-track bill that sweeps \naway even the most modest review of possible tax increases.\n  Evidently, as long as it is done in the name of free trade, even the \nmost outrageous inconsistency is permitted.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that many of us who support free and \nfair trade find nothing inconsistent with that support and insisting \nthat Congress be a full partner in approving agreements.\n  Indeed, as Senator Byrd has noted, support for fast-track procedures \nreveals a lack of confidence in the ability of our negotiators to craft \na sound agreement, or a lack of confidence in the ability of Congress \nto weigh regional and sectoral interests against the national interest, \nor may simply be a desire by the administration to avoid the hard work \nnecessary to convince Congress to support the agreements it negotiates.\n  Mr. President, I can think of no better insurance policy for a sound \ntrade agreement than the prospect of a thorough Congressional review, \ncomplete with the ability to amend that agreement.\n  Not only would the threat of possible Congressional modification spur \nour negotiators to produce the best product possible, that potential \nfor Congressional intervention could serve as an effective club in the \nhands of our negotiators when bargaining with our trading partners.\n  Mr. President, with hundreds of trade agreements negotiated and \nimplemented without fast track, the refrain we hear again and again, \nthat we need to enact fast track in order to negotiate trade \nagreements, is off key.\n  We do not need fast track to negotiate trade agreements.\n  As I have argued today, in several important ways, fast-track invites \nbad trade agreements.\n  It produces agreements that pick winners and losers instead of \nadvancing all sectors of the economy together.\n  It produces agreements designed to respond to the short-term \ninterests of multinational corporations instead of fostering long-term \nsustainable economic growth.\n  It produces agreements that encourage a race-to-the-bottom in \ncritical areas of human rights, and worker and environmental \nprotection, instead of improving those standards around the World.\n  It protects the completely unrelated funding provisions in trade \nimplementing legislation, and as such invites enormous abuse.\n  Mr. President, fast track is bad for free trade.\n  We don't need it, and we shouldn't enact it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation, and in \ndoing so, voting for free and fair trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President. As 1998 rolls around, so does another \nelection. But this upcoming campaign season will be different from any \nother that I have ever known. For the first time since I entered public \noffice in 1974, a certain dapper reporter with a flower in his lapel \nwill not be there reporting the facts of the campaign and offering his \nassessments. Don O. Noel, Jr., who is one of the most prominent and \nrespected journalists in Connecticut history, has retired after working \nfor 39 years as a political reporter in Hartford.\n  Don Noel's career as a journalist dates all the way back to 1958, the \nyear that my father was elected to the first of two terms as a U.S. \nSenator. It is amazing for anyone to have such a long career in any \nfield, particularly in an area as mentally, physically, and emotionally \ndemanding as journalism.\n  Don Noel started out as a writer for the Hartford Times, where he \nworked for 17 years. For a change of pace, he ventured into television \njournalism and spent a decade at WFSB-TV Channel 3. He eventually \nreturned to print journalism in 1984 when he became a political \ncolumnist for the Hartford Courant, where he stayed until his \nretirement.\n  Don Noel was an old-school reporter in the truest and best sense of \nthe term. He was always courteous and respectful of the people he \ninterviewed and wrote about. At the same time, he refused to skirt \naround difficult issues and never refrained from asking stinging \nquestions or making pointed comments. He felt that part of his role as \na journalist was to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\n  Don Noel was able to succeed for so long because he was a reporter of \nsubstance who cared about the truth and cared about his readers. He \nunderstood that his role as journalist was to hold politicians \naccountable for their actions and to serve as a watchdog on behalf of \nthe general public.\n  Don Noel did more than simply report the facts, he also interpreted \nthem. As an editorial page writer, he was responsible for offering his \nopinions on the issues of the day. Not everyone agreed with his ideas, \nbut everyone respected them because they were always thoughtful and \nwell-developed. Most of Mr. Noel's criticisms were aimed at those who \ntended to be a bit more conservative, but to the end he remained an \nequal opportunity critic. It didn't matter if you were a Democrat, \nRepublican, or Independent; if you were a public official and Don Noel \nthought that you were anything less than an upstanding public servant, \nit's safe to say that your name would be in the paper that week.\n  One of his colleagues at the Hartford Courant noted that Don Noel was \nan institution not because of the number of years he put into service, \nbut how well he applied them. I strongly concur with these sentiments \nand believe that Don Noel was one of the finest people that I have had \nthe pleasure of knowing during my career in politics.\n  While his retirement is truly a loss for the people of Connecticut, I \nam glad that he will finally have more time to do the things that he \ntruly enjoys. He has said that he plans to spend a good deal of his \nnew-found free time doing community service work in the neighborhoods \nof northwest Hartford, where\n\n[[Page S12404]]\n\nhe has volunteered for more than a decade. He also hopes to travel with \nhis wife and have an opportunity to try other kinds of writing in which \nhe won't have a deadline hanging over his head. Whatever he chooses to \ndo in his retirement, I wish him only the best, and I thank him for his \nmany years of service to the people of Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12403-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PIETRO PARRAVANO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nPietro Parravano, a remarkable individual who has distinguished himself \nnot only as an outstanding commercial fisherman, but as an eloquent \nambassador for the fishing industry, regionally, nationally, and \nabroad.\n  A graduate of Eastern Michigan University, Mr. Parravano was an \ninstructor of physics before becoming an active commercial fisherman 15 \nyears ago. Mr. Parravano sails his vessel, the F/V Ann-B, from the port \nof Half Moon Bay in northern California.\n  A leader in the community, Pietro Parravano has represented the \nfishing industry in a variety of capacities. He has served as president \nof the Half Moon Bay Fishermen's Marketing Association, president of \nthe Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, and chair of \nthe Institute for Fisheries Resources. He is also a member of both the \nLocal Fisheries Impact Program and the California Seafood Council.\n  Mr. Parravano has often played an important role in shaping \nsustainable fishing policies. He was appointed by the Governor to the \nBay-Delta Advisory Committee, has been elected commissioner to the San \nMateo County Harbor Commission, and will soon serve as a United States \ndelegate to the World Forum of Fish Harvesters and Fishworkers to be \nheld in India.\n  Time and again, his colleagues, the community, and the Government \nhave trusted Pietro Parravano to represent the interests of fisher men \nand women.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate Pietro Parravano upon receiving the \n1997 Highliner of the Year Award, the fishing industry's highest honor.\n  Mr. Parravano is a credit to the fishing industry and to the State of \nCalifornia. I applaud his record of outstanding and dedicated public \nservice and extend to him my sincerest appreciation for his commitment \nto sustainable fishing and the betterment of the lives of fishing men \nand women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12404-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH STAMP ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSnowe in introducing the Prostate Cancer Research Stamp Act of 1997 and \nurge the support of my colleagues. S. 1389 is a companion bill to \nRepresentative Sherrod Brown's bill, H.R. 2545, which has 41 \ncosponsors.\n  The Prostate Cancer Research Stamp Act would authorize a new first-\nclass stamp priced at up to 8 cents above a regular first-class stamp. \nPostal patrons who choose to purchase the prostate cancer stamp will be \ncontributing to prostate cancer research at the National Cancer \nInstitute. As important, a special prostate cancer stamp will help to \nraise awareness of this disease, promote screening, and save lives.\n  Prostate cancer, the most common form of cancer in American men, will \ntake 41,000 lives this year, nearly approaching the breast cancer death \ntoll of 44,300. One of every eight is at risk of getting prostate \ncancer. Unfortunately, as the number of prostate cancer cases rises \ndramatically, research funding lags far behind what is needed to fight \nthis disease. Although prostate cancer accounts for nearly 25 percent \nof diagnosed non-skin cancer, only 3.7 percent of Federal cancer \nresearch dollars are devoted to fighting it.\n  Apart from the important contribution to prostate cancer research, \nthe prostate cancer stamp will raise awareness of this disease and help \nto persuade men over age 40 to have annual prostate exams. Prostate \ncancer is detectable, and when found early is often fully treatable \nthrough several different methods, including surgical removal of the \nprostate and radiation treatment. Men must demand both a PSA blood test \nand a digital-rectal exam as part of their annual medical exam. At the \nrecent Senate Aging Committee hearing on prostate cancer, I commented \nthat we men are such crybabies that we go out of our way to avoid \nmedical tests. The women at the hearing erupted in laughter, but the \nmen were pretty quiet. The fact is that prostate cancer can only be \ntreated early if it's detected early, and the long list of survivors \nall say that early detection made the difference.\n  The sooner we enact this bill and make a postage stamp available, the \ngreater the number of men who will get tested; and more testing means \nmore men will survive prostate cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12404-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WETHERSFIELD TEEN THEATER COMPANY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute the \nWethersfield Teen Theater Company, which is about to celebrate its 10th \nanniversary. This company was founded in 1988 by 15-year-old Bill \nFennelly who was frustrated by the lack of opportunities in the theater \nfor young people in the Wethersfield area, and the name of the company \nthat Bill created indicates what makes this group so unique and \nspecial--it is run by and for teenagers.\n  Whether it's the director, the choreographer, or a member of the \nlighting crew, every member of the company must be between the ages of \n11 and 21. The company members have complete artistic control over \ntheir productions, and they are also responsible for raising money and \ndoing publicity for each play. Not only has the Wethersfield Teen \nTheater given hundreds of young people an opportunity to express \nthemselves artistically and experience the feeling of performing live \non the stage; but this company also gave many young people leadership \nopportunities that people their age don't traditionally enjoy. People \nwho participate in the Wethersfield Teen Theater learn lessons about \npersonal responsibility that they will carry with them throughout their \nlives.\n  When the theater company was founded there were many doubters. Not \nonly were people skeptical that a group of teenagers would be able to \nput on a quality theatrical production, there were questions about \ntheir ability to raise the money to stage a production. The \nWethersfield Teen Theater put on a spring review called ``On \nBroadway,'' and they were able to raise the money to stage a production \nof ``Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat.''\n  ``Joseph'' was major success, and in 1990, the teen theater gained \nthe official sponsorship of the Wethersfield Recreation and Parks \nDepartment. While the sponsorship provides the company with free \nrehearsal and performance space, the theater company is not a budgeted \nprogram and the teens still must earn all the money required to produce \neach show.\n  Since its founding, the Wethersfield Teen Theater Company has put on \na major summer and spring production every year. In addition, the \ncompany also sponsors children's workshops that are designed to get \nchildren interested in theater. They also perform at local community \nevents, elementary schools, and hospitals.\n  For a decade, people have been enjoying the talent, enthusiasm, and \ncreativity of the Wethersfield Teen Theater Company, and on January 3, \n1998, the group will celebrate its 10th Anniversary with the \nperformance of a production called ``Our Time.'' I am certain that this \nproduction will be a great success, and I hope that this wonderful \ntheater company will continue enriching the lives of young people in \nthe Wethersfield area for many decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12404-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12404-S12405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF THE OGONI 9\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to commemorate the \nanniversary of the tragic deaths of nine Nigerian activists. Two years \nago this week, Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders were \nbrutally executed by the regime of Gen. Sani Abacha.\n  Ken Saro-Wiwa was a renowned playwright and author, who also happened \nto be the president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni \nPeople, or MOSOP. He and several other colleagues were arrested shortly \nafter four rival Ogoni leaders were killed by a mob in May 1994. They \nwere detained without charge for a year, until May 19, 1995. Then, \nafter trials that are\n\n[[Page S12405]]\n\nwidely believed to have been unfair and politically motivated, Saro-\nWiwa and eight others--Barinem Kiobel, Saturday Doobee, Paul Levura, \nNordu Eawo, Felix Nuate, Daniel Gbokoo, John Kpuinen and Baribor Bera--\nwere convicted of complicity in the 1994 murders, and sentenced to \ndeath by a civil disturbances special tribunal run by the military.\n  Mr. President, when the death sentences of these individuals were \nfirst made public, I and many other members of Congress asked General \nAbacha to have mercy and exercise his prerogative of executive \nclemency. We wrote to President Clinton and made calls to the Nigerian \nrepresentatives to the United Nations and Washington. But, alas, our \nefforts were to no avail. The nine men were hanged on November 10, \n1995.\n  Now, Mr. President, 19 other Ogoni activists remain in prison in \nNigeria on the same trumped up charges and could face a similar fate. \nAccording to reports from several human rights organizations, the Ogoni \n19 have been severely beaten and tortured, and many are suffering from \nill health. They reportedly are kept in insanitary prison conditions, \nare denied food and medical treatment, and rarely, if at all, are \ngranted access to outside visitors, including their lawyers. This lack \nof contact has stalled attempts to have the detainees released on bail \nor brought to trial before ordinary, civilian courts. The situation is \nso dire that, in August, the detainees went on a hunger strike for 10 \ndays to protest the continuing obstructions to their release or trial. \nThe authorities reportedly have had no response.\n  Alas, the deplorable condition of these Ogoni activists is not unique \nin Nigeria. Hundreds of individuals remain in detention centers or \nprisons for seemingly political motivations. The flawed judicial \nprocess that led to the 1995 death sentences is still in place and \nthreatens the lives of these political prisoners. Numerous Nigerian \nlaws allow for arbitrary detention for reasons ranging from ``personal \npique by a senior official to `national security,''' according to \ninformation provided to me by the State Department.\n  With a population of more than 100 million people and vast natural \nresources, Nigeria has the potential to be one of the most important \nplayers on the African stage. But the military junta led by General \nAbacha is squandering the country's future by rampant corruption, \nsevere economic mismanagement, and brutal policies that threaten basic \nfreedoms. Moreover, the so-called transition program bears little hope \nof ensuring a transition to a fairly elected civilian government.\n  As we remember the lives of the Ogoni 9, let us not forget those \nNigerians whose struggle for basic freedoms continues even now. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in honoring this solemn occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12404-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RETIREMENT FROM CONGRESS OF REP. FLOYD H. FLAKE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Adlai E. Stevenson remarked of \nEleanor Roosevelt that ``She would rather light candles than curse the \ndarkness and her glow has warmed the world.'' So it is with my dear \nfriend and colleague, Representative Floyd Flake of Queens, who will be \nretiring from Congress this Saturday, November 15. Few individuals can \nmatch his accomplishments, which have materially and spiritually \nbenefited so many. I view his departure as bittersweet. He is going \nhome to his church, answering God's call ``to a greater ministry and to \na greater work,'' as he has put it. Surely, his congregants will be \nhappier for his decision. But we will sorely miss him here in Congress.\n  Representative Flake was born in Los Angeles and raised in Houston--1 \nof 13 children born to parents with fifth- and sixth-grade educations. \nModest circumstances. But in the words of an October 19, 1997 New York \nTimes magazine article by James Traub, ``they (people who told Flake he \nwould never go to college) hadn't reckoned on his mother, who taught \nthe kids how to sew and wash and cook, or his fiercely self-improving \nfather.''\n  Representative Flake received an undergraduate degree from \nWilberforce University, the first black college in America, founded in \n1856 in Ohio under the auspices of the African Methodist Episcopal \n[A.M.E.] Church and named after the great English statesman and \nabolitionist, William Wilberforce. From there, on to graduate study at \nPayne Theological Seminary and Northeastern University and jobs early \nin his career as a Head Start social worker and market analyst for \nXerox.\n  In 1976, Representative Flake--barely 31--became pastor of the Allen \nA.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens. At that time, the church congregation \nnumbered about 1,200; the church's annual budget was about $250,000. \nThere were three employees. Now, some 20 years later, the congregation \nhas grown to nearly 9,000 souls. The church and its subsidiaries have \nan annual budget exceeding $24 million. Tithes and offerings alone \nexceed $5 million--this from a mostly middle-class congregation.\n  When considering Reverend Flake's stewardship, the Parable of the \nMustard Seed comes to mind. Allen A.M.E. Church-sponsored community \ndevelopment enterprises now include a 300-unit apartment complex for \nthe elderly; the Allen Christian School, which has an enrollment of \nsome 400 elementary students--and a growing waiting list; hundreds of \nsingle-family and two-family homes; a strip mall; an office complex; a \nhome care agency; a credit union; and a transportation company. The \nAllen A.M.E. Church and its subsidiaries employ 800 people. Only \nKennedy Airport employs more people in the Sixth District.\n  In the middle of this remarkable stewardship, he earned a Doctorate \nof Ministry degree from the United Theological Seminary in Dayton, OH, \nand he became a Member of Congress. He has ably represented the Sixth \nDistrict, which covers southern and southeastern Queens, since 1986. As \na result of his efforts, the Food and Drug Administration and the \nFederal Aviation Administration are building major facilities in the \ndistrict. As a senior member of the House Committee on Banking and \nFinancial Services, he has been an indefatigable architect of \ninnovative public and private urban investment programs. While other \npoliticians have abandoned urban communities, Floyd Flake has found \nways for such communities not only to survive, but to thrive. While \nothers curse the darkness, Floyd Flake lights candles.\n  Perhaps the capstone of his accomplishments is the new Allen A.M.E. \nChurch cathedral on Merrick Boulevard. The $23 million cathedral is \n93,000 square feet and seats 2,500. It is the largest church structure \nto be built in New York City since 1954. Heinrich Heine remarked that \nit takes more than mere opinion to erect a cathedral, it takes \nconviction. Indeed it does. Reverend Flake secured a $15 million \nmortgage for the project from Chase Manhattan Bank Corp.--the largest \nloan Chase has ever made to a religious institution. That's conviction.\n  Given all of these commitments, it is understandable that Floyd Flake \nfeels he must go home and minister to his church community full-time. \nThe community will be richer for his presence. We here will be poorer.\n  Mr. President, the inscription on Sir Christopher Wren's tomb in St. \nPaul's Cathedral reads, Si monumentum requiris circumspice. ``If you \nwould see the man's monument, look around.'' If you would see Floyd \nFlake's monument, go to Jamaica, or to St. Alban's, or to Rosedale, or \nto Laurelton, or to nearly any neighborhood in Queens, and look around.\n  And so, to my friend, his wife Elaine, his daughters, Aliya and \nNailah, and his sons, Rasheed and Hasan, I say, ``Godspeed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12405-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12405-S12406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HEROES SHINE IN NORTH DAKOTA FLOOD\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as my colleagues in the Senate are \nwell aware, one of the Nation's worst weather-related disasters of the \nyear was the devastating flooding in Grand Forks, ND and the entire Red \nRiver Valley. This historic flood captured the attention of the Nation \nin late spring as over 95 percent of the residents of Grand Forks and \nEast Grand Forks were evacuated from their homes and much of North \nDakota's second largest city's downtown district was ravaged by fire \nand water.\n  Disasters have a way of bringing out the true character of people, \nand that certainly was the case in North Dakota. History will have a \ndramatic record of the loss and devastation of\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\nthe flood. I also hope that it will record the tremendous efforts made \nby many North Dakotans to survive and to rise to the occasion with \nheroic feats.\n  Now that a few months have passed since the waters have subsided, it \nis time to reflect back on some of the many heroes--people that stepped \nup when their community needed them--whose efforts shined despite the \nrising waters.\n  In a disaster the extreme importance of a communication system is \npivotal in fighting back and preserving the safety of those in the \narea. Today, I would like to recognize the efforts of several US West \nCommunications employees who worked tirelessly to maintain critical \ntelephone service to the Grand Forks area throughout the flooding.\n  On April 19, 1997 a crew of nine central office technicians \nbarricaded themselves into the US West building in the heart of Grand \nForks to keep the communication systems of the area up and running \nduring the disaster. The extensive preventive work that the US West \nworkers completed to get ready for the flooding would now be tested as \ntheir building was surrounded by 4 feet of water, and sat just one \nblock away from a raging fire. The work of these men and women \nsustained phone service to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nFederal Aviation Administration, State and local emergency workers, and \nso many others in the flooded region.\n  To give you an idea of the challenges facing these workers, they \nlabored night and day to keep the wires dry as 26 inches of water \nthreatened basement cables. Sustained by the food, clothing, and cots \ndelivered via boat by the National Guard, these folks stayed on as the \narea was evacuated by all other people. In light of this adversity--and \narmed with high-volume pumps, drying machines, and sandbags--these \ncourageous people sustained service to 50,000 area customers and \nhundreds of emergency workers.\n  I would like to recognize these heroes by name for their dedicated \nservice is appreciated by me and many others touched by their efforts. \nThe members of the initial emergency team were: Denny Braaten, Linda \nPotucek, Larry McNamara, Bob Schrader, Dan Kaiser, Dale Andrews, Glenda \nWiess, Rick Hokenson, and Lew Ellingson.\n  Two days later, US West reinforcements arrived to provide additional \nsupport and hard work. I would like to recognize these workers now: Don \nJordan, Ray Jacobsen, Tim Kennedy, Roger Jones, Bruce Bengston, Gary \nBoser, Jim Falconer, Bion McNulty, Jack Olson, and Tim Rogers.\n  I am tremendously proud of the courage and dedicated service \ndemonstrated by the US West employees in Grand Forks. They, along with \nso many others who volunteered and continue the rebuilding efforts \ntoday, exemplify the North Dakota spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12405-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education appropriations bill that the Senate passed \nyesterday provides the National Institutes of Health and other \nGovernment health initiatives with funding needed to continue their \nwork on diseases that afflict so many millions of Americans. I am glad \nto see that this budget will continue to place a priority on health \nresearch and, in particular on women's health. Although we have seen \nmany advances in women's health over the past several years, much more \nprogress needs to be made especially on such intractable problems as \nbreast cancer.\n  The key to successful breast cancer treatment is early detection. \nMammography has been and will continue to be a key diagnostic tool in \nearly detection for women in the high-risk category for breast cancer. \nDigital mammography is the next generation technology in mammography \nimaging for cancer, and it offers a number of advantages over the \ncurrent film technology, including: improved image quality and \ndiagnosis; improved lesion visualization; lower overall cost of image \nstorage and retrieval; and increased use of telemammography as a means \nto facilitate expert consultations.\n  There is a second generation digital mammography technology on the \ndrawing boards that offers the prospect not only of improving the \nability of radiologists to identify lesions in the breast, but also of \nsignificantly reducing the cost of digital mammography. One such \napproach, a Metal-Halide technology, holds out the promise of meeting \nthese goals. This technology has the potential to result in an imager \nthat could be used to replace the film imagers in existing mammography \nmachines--rather than needing to replace the entire mammography \nmachine.\n  There are significant technical hurdles that must be overcome before \na product of the necessary quality of resolution for mammography can be \nintroduced. The research and development risk may be too great for \nprivate sector companies to move forward, thus making it ideal for a \nGovernment-industry partnership.\n  I urge the administration to consider addressing this issue in its \nfiscal year 1999 budget by creating a program that would focus on key \ntechnologies that could improve women's health. This new program could \nplace particular emphasis on technologies that will make a significant \ndifference for women, have a high likelihood of near-term commercial \ndevelopment, and are likely to see widespread and rapid diffusion \nthroughout the medical community.\n  Mr. President, the war on breast cancer and many other diseases has \nnot been won. In the private and public sectors, we must be creative in \nlooking for new approaches to address and overcome these challenges. It \ndoes little good if we make a breakthrough in the lab or corporate \nresearch facility, if we can't bring that breakthrough to market in \nsuch a way that the maximum number of people benefit. I hope the \nadministration will give careful consideration to these kinds of new \nand innovative ideas in crafting its budget for the upcoming fiscal \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12406-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12406-S12407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAN VECE, SR.\n\n Mr. DODD.

The Vece \nfamily's contributions to town life were even honored in 1995, when the \nPierson School gazebo was renamed the Vece Gazebo. But the greatest \nillustration of what this family meant to the vitality of this small \nNew England shoretown could be seen once a week at a local restaurant. \nEach Sunday from 4 to 8 p.m. for the past 16 years, a diverse group of \npatrons would gather at Bill's Seafood Restaurant to enjoy the music of \nClinton's favorite band. The people of Clinton loved coming out and \nsinging the songs that they all knew, but what they loved most was the \nband's leader--Dan Vece, Sr. What set Mr. Vece apart from other \nbandleaders was not the great musical skill with which he played the \nbanjo. What made Dan Vece so special was his zest for life. That, and \nthe fact that he was over 100 years old.\n  Seeing Dan Vece on stage wearing his trademark sailor's cap and \npicking at his 1919 Gibson banjo, served to remind countless people \nthat life was meant to be enjoyed. He served as an inspiration to \nanyone who was fortunate enough to meet him. Sadly, on September 23, \n1997, Dan Vece, Sr. died at the age of 101.\n  Dan Vece, Sr. grew up and lived in New Haven, CT until he enlisted in \nthe Army during World War I. After being discharged from the Army, he \nreturned to New Haven where he married his wife of 68 years, Tilly \nTullo. Together they moved to Clinton in 1919, where they operated a \nretail plumbing store and service. In addition to his business, Mr. \nVece was one of Clinton's first police officers and served as a \nfireman, beginning the longstanding family tradition of public service. \nMr. Vece enjoyed working and didn't retire until he was 80 years old, \nand he continued doing odd jobs until he was 88. He played golf until \nhe was 96, and drove a car until he was 98, transporting senior women \nto the grocery store. Dan Vece was involved in countless activities, \nbut his true passion was always his music.\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\n  He had no formal musical training, but he taught himself to play most \nany musical instrument that he could get his hands on. His wife was a \ntrained musician and together they formed a band with Tilly on piano \nand Dan on the drums. They played together at the ice shows in Clinton \nand all the big jobs from New Haven to New London. And after each gig, \nthey always loved to go out dancing.\n  Eventually, Tilly retired from performing, but Dan carried on and \nfronted a band that played at restaurants and resorts along the \nConnecticut shoreline, various jazz festivals, nursing homes, schools, \nand of course Bill's Seafood Restaurant on Sunday evenings. Whenever \nanyone asked why he was still performing, Mr. Vece would always say \nthat his doctor told him that music was the best medicine and he should \nkeep on playing as long as possible.\n  Well, Dan Vece followed his doctor's orders, and as a result he \nbrought happiness into the lives of countless individuals. Dan Vece, \nSr.'s good humor, devotion to his community and remarkable vitality \nmade him a beloved figure in Clinton and throughout Connecticut. He was \nloved and revered by all, and he will be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12406-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12407-S12408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VETERANS' BENEFITS ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Minority Member \nof the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the \nSenate is considering S. 714, as amended, a bill that would make \nvaluable changes to a number of veterans benefits and services. In the \nwaning days of this session, the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittees were able to reach compromise on a wide range of programs \nand services for veterans--from programs to assist homeless veterans, \nto providing home loans to Native American veterans, and I urge my \ncolleagues to give their unanimous support to this measure. It is \nparticularly fitting that we make these improvements for veterans \nprograms now, as Veterans Day is just a few days away.\n  Mr. President, because all the provisions of this measure--which I \nwill refer to as the ``compromise agreement''--are set forth in the \njoint explanatory statement which Senator Specter will place in the \nRecord, I will discuss here only some of the issues which are of \nparticular interest to me. The explanatory statement was developed in \ncooperation with the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and that \nCommittee's Chairman, Bob Stump, will insert the same explanatory \nstatement in the Record when the House considers this measure.\n\n\n extending and improving the native american housing loan pilot program\n\n  Mr. President, section 201 of the compromise agreement will extend \nfor four years the authority for the Native American Housing Loan Pilot \nProgram, under section 3761, title 38, United States Code. This pilot \nprogram was created in 1993 to provide loans to eligible Native \nAmerican veterans to purchase, build, or improve dwellings on Native \nAmerican trust lands. This program is so important because commercial \nlenders will not finance the purchase of homes on Native American \nlands, as lenders cannot foreclose in the event of default. Therefore, \nthe traditional VA loan guaranty program is not, in effect, available \nto Native American veterans residing on tribal lands.\n  This program has been very successful in financing purchases of homes \nby Pacific Islanders. However, it has been somewhat underutilized by \nother Native American populations. Therefore, this bill would also \nprovide for enhanced outreach by VA to inform Native American veterans \nof the availability of this program. It further tasks VA with analyzing \nwhat is working and what could be improved in its administration of the \nprogram.\n  I would like to commend Senators Akaka and Campbell for their \ntireless advocacy on behalf of Native American veterans.\n\n\n                      reinventing va's eeo system\n\n  Title I of the compromise agreement will establish a new employment \ndiscrimination complaint system of the VA. This provision ensures that \nthe employees who perform equal employment and opportunity (EEO) \ncounseling and investigations are professional and independent by \ncreating a new office to adjudicate complaints, separate from line \nmanagement.\n  The Committee has had grave concerns about how VA has handled several \nhigh profile EEO complaints filed against senior staff members. \nTherefore, this bill also provides for VA to submit a separate report \nregarding complaints filed against senior level employees, based on \ntheir personal conduct. I believe it is critical that VA's actions be \nsubject to Congressional scrutiny, in order to assure accountability.\n  I want to thank Senator Graham for his leadership on this important \nissue.\n\n\n                   spina bifida eligibility clarified\n\n  Mr. President, section 404 of the compromise agreement will clarify \nthe eligibility--for compensation, health care, and educational \nassistance--of the children with spina bifida born to Vietnam veterans \nexposed to Agent Orange. Currently, the eligibility of the child is \ndetermined by looking to the veteran father. However, under title 38 of \nthe United States Code, a former service member who received a \ndishonorable discharge is generally not considered a veteran, and is \ntherefore not eligible for veterans benefits from the VA.\n  It was Congress' intention to provide benefits to all Vietnam \nveterans' children with spina bifida. Congress did not mean to exclude \nthe children of veterans with dishonorable discharges.\n  This provision will clarify the eligibility criteria to include the \nchild with spina bifida of a Vietnam veteran regardless of the \ncharacter of his discharge. This is a minor modification in the law, \nbut to the children who suffer from spina bifida, these benefits can \nmake a significant difference in their lives. These benefits can \nimprove their quality of health care, provide educational \nopportunities, and enhance their quality of life. It would be great \ninjustice if these children were denied these benefits because of their \nfather's discharge status.\n\n\n                           mammography policy\n\n  Section 208 of the compromise agreement seeks to address a \ndiscrepancy between VA's stated principles and their clinical practice \nwith respect to breast cancer programs. Though a guiding principle of \nthe Veterans Health Administration states that ``the quality of care in \nVHA must be demonstratively equal to, or better than, what is available \nin the local community,'' in my view, VHA's breast cancer detection \npolicy fails to achieve community standards because it only targets \nwomen between the ages of 50 to 69.\n\n  Mr. President, it is very important that veterans have access to \npreventive diagnostic tests to protect their health. Because breast \ncancer is the leading cause of cancer in women, I look forward to \nreceiving VA's national policy on breast cancer detection.\n  I thank Senator Specter for his leadership on this issue.\n\n\n                HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the authority for the Health \nProfessional Scholarship Program has been extended for one year. \nAspiring health professionals have a strong interest in the scholarship \nprogram, and it has proven to be an effective recruitment tool for the \nVA in the past. Staffing analyses done within the VA have identified a \nneed to increase the levels of nurse practitioners and physician \nassistants to adjust to the shift from inpatient to outpatient care, \nand this program is well suited to assist individuals in these career \npaths. We will continue to evaluate this program and look for other \nopportunities that will increase both recruitment and retention of \nhealth professionals in the VA.\n\n\n       MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Of the projects authorized under Title III of this bill, I am \nespecially pleased that we have included the authorizations for \nprojects in Northern California. I have been concerned that veterans in \nNorthern California have not been receiving convenient VA health care \nservices ever since the Martinez VA Medical Center was closed in 1991.\n  The conference agreement authorizes VA to move ahead with plans to \ncreate an accessible network of VA health care by specifically \nauthorizing funds for upgrades and enhancements to McClellan Hospital \nat Mather Field in\n\n[[Page S12408]]\n\nSacramento and improvements to the outpatient clinics at Mare Island in \nVallejo and at Martinez. Once the McClellan Hospital is completed, VA \nexpects capacity for 55 inpatient beds and 110,000 outpatient visits \nper year, and the projected workload for the outpatient clinics will \nexceed 140,000 outpatient visits per year.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I acknowledge the work of my colleagues in \nthe House--Chairman Bob Stump and ranking Minority Member Lane Evans--\nand our Committee's Chairman, Senator Specter, in developing this \ncomprehensive legislation.\n  Mr President, I thank the staff who have worked extremely long and \nhard on this compromise--Mike Durishin, Jill Cochran, Mary Ellen \nMcCarthy, Adam Sachs, Susan Edgerton, Carl Commenator, Pat Ryan, Mike \nBrinck, Ralph Ibson, Kingston Smith, Sloan Rappoport, and others on the \nHouse Committee, and Jim Gottlieb, Kim Lipsky, Mary Schoelen, Charlie \nBattaglia, Bill Tuerk, and John Bradley, with the Senate Committee. I \nalso thank Bob Cover And Charlie Armstrong of the House and Senate \nOffices of Legislative Counsel for their excellent assistance and \nsupport in drafting this compromise agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12407-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BERNARD G. SEGAL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the \ngreatest lawyers in recent American history--Bernard G. Segal, who died \nearlier this year. Bernard Segal, who served as the president of the \nAmerican Bar Association in 1969-70, was known as the conscience of the \nbar, and some of his colleagues said that he promoted individual rights \nand the rule of law more than any other lawyer of our time.\n  Bernard Segal's legal accomplishments began at an early age, as he \nwas named directly out of Penn Law School to serve as deputy attorney \ngeneral of Pennsylvania. At age 24, he was the youngest person to ever \nhold this post, but he still proceeded to write many important pieces \nof legislation, including the State's banking code. He left this \nposition to be a founding partner of the Philadelphia law firm of \nSchnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis. As a member of the firm, he was very \nsuccessful, representing many blue-chip clients such as Bell Telephone, \nNBC, and United Parcel, and during his career he argued nearly 50 cases \nbefore the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result of his legal prowess, Mr. \nSegal was tapped to serve as the chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar and \npresident of the American Bar Association, becoming the first Jewish \nman to serve in either post.\n  Mr. Segal continually dedicated himself to legal causes, and one of \nhis most successful crusades was his mission to improve the selection \nprocess for federal judges. As chairman of the ABA's standing committee \non the Federal Judiciary, Mr. Segal helped to persuade President \nEisenhower to establish the practice of submitting prospective Federal \njudicial appointments to the ABA for review. In order to convince the \nPresident of the need for this procedure, Mr. Segal asked the former \ngeneral this simple question: ``Would you appoint a general without \nasking the colonels what they thought of him.''\n  Bernard Segal's legal career was truly exemplary, but what made this \nman so extraordinary was his commitment to helping the less fortunate \nmembers of our society. Mr. Segal described the hallmark of the law \nfirm that he helped found as its ``dedication to the higher calling,'' \nthat is ``the lawyer's obligation to assume an active role in the \npursuit of a just and ordered society, in helping to solve the emerging \nproblems of social, economic and political importance * * * to serve \nthe public as his or her client, as she or he would serve a full-paying \nclient.''\n  Mr. Segal's commitment to preserving equal justice under the law for \nall Americans particularly shone during the civil rights movement. In \nthe 1960's, many people in the country viewed civil rights as a \nSouthern problem, one over which they had little influence or control. \nFortunately, Bernard Segal did not share this view.\n  In 1963, when Alabama Governor George Wallace announced that he would \ndisregard the Federal court order that prohibited interference with the \nadmission of African-American students at the University of Alabama, \nBernard Segal saw the need for the Nation's legal community to speak \nout publicly against the Governor's actions. He quickly got 46 \nprominent lawyers, including three former U.S. Attorneys General, to \nsign a public letter condemning the Governor's defiance of the law.\n  Shortly afterward, President Kennedy announced that he was creating a \ngroup known as the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and \nthe President named Bernard Segal as one of the organization's two co-\nchairmen. This committee of 246 private lawyers helped build support \nfor the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and its call for peaceful compliance \nwith court orders had a persuasive impact on future integration efforts \nin the South.\n  In the wake of the civil rights movement, Bernard Segal remained \nsocially active. President Johnson chose him to head the National Legal \nService Program, which established legal services for the poor. And \nmuch like he did at his own law firm, Mr. Segal worked diligently to \nenlist lawyers to provide legal assistance for the indigent.\n  Bernard Segal's efforts did not go unrecognized. Among his many \nhonors were the American Bar Association's Gold Medal, the National \nCivil Rights Award by the U.S. Attorney General, the National Human \nRelations Award by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the \nJudge William H. Hastie Award by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the \nWorld Peace Through Law Award as the ``World's Greatest Lawyer.''\n  Bernard Segal represented the highest standards and ideals of the \nlegal profession, and all those who were fortunate enough to know this \ngreat man will miss him dearly. He is survived by his wife, Geraldine, \nhis daughter Loretta, his son Richard, three grandchildren, one great-\ngrandchild, his brother, and his sister. I offer my heartfelt \ncondolences to them all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12408-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREAUTHORIZING THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH, ENGINEERING \n                        AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for \nworking with me over the past few weeks, and in particular the past few \ndays, to enact legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) Research, Engineering, and Development (R,E) \naccount for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.\n  Senators McCain, Hollings, and Ford joined me in introducing this \nimportant legislation. The Commerce Committee recently took up the \nHouse bill and reported it out with an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute. The leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee and the \nHouse Science Committee have already met to resolve the differences \nbetween the House and Senate versions of the bill. I am pleased to \nreport that the floor amendment to H.R. 1271 reflects the agreement \nthat the conferees have reached on a final package. The House should be \nable to accept and approve H.R. 1271, as amended, before this session \nends.\n  The FAA R,E account finances projects to improve the safety, \nsecurity, capacity and efficiency of the U.S. aviation system. These \nsignificant research and development efforts include the development of \nnew fire-resistant insulation materials for use on aircraft, the \ndevelopment of procedures for enhancing terminal area capacity and \nsafety, the improvement of aircraft collision avoidance technology, and \na host of other noteworthy projects.\n  This bill also fosters the strong public-private partnership that has \nbeen established in the aviation research and development area. The \nFAA, for instance, is working with Boeing to develop a world-class \nairport pavement testing facility. Boeing is providing one-third of the \ncosts of this project, which total $21 million. This project will help \nensure that the U.S. keeps pace with the rest of the world in \ndeveloping the infrastructure to accommodate the new super jumbo \naircraft.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues' commitment, and their assistance with \nthis effort.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12408-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12409]]\n                   TRIBUTE TO GEN. JOHN SHALIKASHVILI\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to Gen. \nJohn Shalikashvili. His life's story is one of the greatest in our \nNation's history. General Shali, as he is affectionately known, came to \nthis country when he was 16, and after graduating from college, he was \ndrafted into the U.S. military. During his 39 years of public service, \nhe rose from the ranks of Army private to the highest military office \nin the land. He is an embodiment of the principles for which this \nNation stands, and I would like to pay tribute to him on the occasion \nof his retirement earlier this year as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff.\n  Anyone he worked with will tell you that he did a tremendous job as \nChairman. During these times of military downsizing, he has been \nresponsible for shaping a military that is smaller, but better. In \norder to do so, he had to ensure that our troops were better prepared \nand better equipped than any other force in the world. He succeeded \nmightily.\n  During his tenure as Chairman, U.S. troops were tested in more than \n40 operations. In places like Bosnia, Haiti, and Iraq our troops \nperformed superbly in their efforts to defend democracy and further the \ncause of peace.\n  General Shalikashvili's courage and bravery were unquestioned, as \nevidenced by the Bronze Star he earned for his combat service in the \nVietnam war. But what made General Shali such an effective leader was \nhis compassion, and his ability to understand the human element of \nmilitary operations.\n  He was the head of the 1991 operation to provide relief to the Iraqi \nKurds who had been exiled from their homes by Saddam Hussein. Thousands \nof men, women, and children were dying in the mountains of northern \nIraq and eastern Turkey, and he helped many of these families return to \ntheir homes, personally providing comfort to these individuals who were \nsick and suffering.\n  America's troops could look at General Shali and see a man who \nunderstood their needs, because he had stood in their shoes. He worked \nhis way through the ranks, but never forgot his own past.\n  General Shalikashvili spent his 39-year career fighting to protect \nfreedom, and I think that the greatest tribute and reward for his \nservice came this past July in the city of Warsaw. At that time, \nGeneral Shali watched on as President Clinton invited Poland to become \na member of NATO. Who would have ever imagined that the young Polish \nchild, who was 3-years-old when Hitler's tanks rolled in from the East, \nwould 1 day return to Poland as the highest-ranking officer of the U.S. \nmilitary and stand before thousands of cheering Poles as his native \ncountry was welcomed back into the family of free nations?\n  General Shalikashvili is truly an inspiration to us all, and our \nNation is richer and stronger as a result of his contributions. I want \nto personally thank him for his service, and I wish him and his wife, \nJoan, all the best as they enjoy retirement together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12409-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPLORING THE FAILURE TO FUND A PUGET SOUND CRAB LICENSE BUYBACK\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, despite the efforts in conference \nof Senator Gregg and his staff, the Conference report provides no \nfunding for a Puget Sound crab license buyback. I deplore this \nomission, which reportedly resulted from the House conferees' \nresistance to providing Federal funding for buyouts in State fisheries. \nMr. President, even if Federal funding of buyouts in State fisheries \nwas not specifically authorized, as it is, in section 312 of the \nSustainable Fisheries Act of 1996, I firmly believe that the Federal \nGovernment has a particular responsibility to the nontribal commercial \nDungeness crabbers in Puget Sound who have lost 50 percent of their \nstock as a result of a Federal court interpretation of a Federal \ntreaty.\n  This is not an instance in which the hardship the buyout would have \nalleviated resulted from past actions or inactions on the part of \ncommercial fishers. Overfishing and poor management are not to blame. \nRather, this hardship was judicially imposed. In 1995, a Federal \ndistrict court determined that Indian tribes were entitled by Federal \ntreaty to take up to 50 percent of the harvestable shellfish. The \nsmall, 250 vessel non-tribal commercial Puget Sound crab fishery that \nhad existed for generations, was suddenly overwhelmed. I understand \nthat because of the Federal court order, there are now about 450 \nadditional tribal crab fishers.\n  Mr. President, the majority of the nontribal commercial crabbers in \nPuget Sound are self-employed. The vessels they own may account for a \nlarge portion of their assets. As the Governor of Washington State, \nGary Locke, has stated, ``The federal court action leaves them in a \ndifficult financial position with vessels, equipment and related debt \ntied to an occupation that is no longer viable at its current licensed \ncapacity.'' Again, I deeply regret the House conferees' failure to \nassume Federal responsibility for the consequence of a Federal \naction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12409-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGET RESOLUTION AGGREGATES AND \n                  APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Lachance, of Maine, to be Director of the Office \n     of Personnel Management for a term of four years.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Kevin Gover\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we work through the Executive Calendar \nin the closing hours of the first session of the 105th Congress, I want \nto call my colleagues' attention to the President's nominee to be \nAssistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, Kevin Gover of \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico.\n  This appointment is important to my state and my constituents. \nApproximately 70,000 Native Americans live on nine reservations in \nSouth Dakota. Their daily lives are greatly affected by the activities \nof the BIA.\n  The appointment is also important to the nation as a whole. Anyone \nfamiliar with American history or who believes in the American dream of \nequal opportunity for all has a stake in federal Indian policy.\n  The Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs play a \ncritical role in setting the agenda for the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand has a great impact on the success or failure of federal Indian \npolicy. He or she must understand the history of federal/Indian \nrelations and have a vision for the future of this relationship. The \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs must not only be accessible to \ntribal leaders, but also serve as an effective advocate for Indian \npeople within the Executive branch decision-making circles. Finally, \nthe Assistant Secretary must be a manager of the agency as well as a \nspokesperson for Administration policy.\n  Kevin Gover is a strong nominee to lead the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \nHe is an enrolled member of the Pawnee Tribe of Oklahoma and is a \npartner in the law firm Gover, Williams and Janov in Albuquerque, New \nMexico. He received his JD from the University of New Mexico and has \nspecialized in federal Indian law, natural resource law, environmental \nlaw and housing law.\n  Kevin Gover has not only the intellectual capability and legal skill, \nbut also the practical experience needed to be effective as Assistant \nSecretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs. He has worked in Indian \nCountry long enough to see the successes and failures of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, and he has the perspective to help chart its course to \nthe future.\n  Those of us in this chamber who represent significant Indian \nconstituencies can all attest to the magnitude, complexity and \nsignificance of the challenges facing the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \nTribal leaders in South Dakota have discussed with me their concerns \nabout broad and important issues such as economic development, \neducation, housing and health care. The BIA must be prepared to play a \nfair and constructive role in addressing these and other concerns about \nthe quality of life on our reservations. I expect we all want the next \nAssistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs to possess the \nintellect, vision, leadership skills and wisdom to make this \norganization more effective and responsive to the ever-changing needs \nof those it serves. I believe Kevin Gover possesses these qualities.\n  There has been some concern expressed about the role Mr. Gover played \nas a private attorney in gaming activities in New Mexico. Senator \nCampbell, Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and Senator \nInouye, Vice Chair of the Committee, have both had an opportunity to \nreview the FBI background report on Mr. Gover. They reported in the \nCommittee hearing that they found nothing that should disqualify Mr. \nGover from serving as Assistant Secretary. This review obviously \nincluded his activities as counsel to tribes with gaming operations in \nNew Mexico. Moreover, in his confirmation hearings, Mr. Gover made \nclear that while he makes no apology for his support of Indian gaming, \nas Assistant Secretary he will not tolerate illegal gaming.\n  Kevin Gover has strong support throughout Indian Country. He enjoys \nthis support because tribes realize that the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nneeds a leader like Kevin Gover to move the BIA into the 21st century. \nI support this nomination and encourage my colleagues to do likewise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12409-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate will consider, and I \ntrust pass, S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1997. The \nHomeowners Protection Act, which I introduced earlier this year, and \nthe Banking Committee passed by a 16-to-1 vote, is truly important \nlegislation. This bill will protect homebuyers from excessive mortgage \ninsurance premiums for homebuyers. It is a great product of great deal \nof hard work by a number of the Banking Committee's members. As a \nresult, the legislation contains the consumer protections of the \noriginal bill; at the same time, the bill will be less of a compliance \nburden for the businesses that are subject to the legislation.\n  Mr. President, the substitute amendment that Senator Sarbanes and I \nwill offer for Senate consideration is the result of a great deal of \nhard work by Members on both sides of the aisle. First, I would like to \nbegin by thanking my colleague and friend from North Carolina, Senator \nFaircloth, for his hard work on this issue. Senator Faircloth and his \nstaff have worked tirelessly to help craft compromise language that \nencompasses real consumer protection without undue regulatory burden. I \nwould also like to offer my thanks to ranking minority member Paul \nSarbanes and the bill's cosponsors, Senator Dodd and Senator Bryan, for \ntheir continuous support. I truly appreciate their valuable input in \npreparing the floor amendment that we are considering today. Likewise, \nI would like to commend Senators Grams and Moseley-Braun for their \nsuccessful handling of the lender paid mortgage insurance issue, and my \nfriend from Utah, Senator Bennett, for helping to craft compromise \nlanguage regarding class action liability.\n  Once again, I would particularly like to thank Representative James \nHansen (R-UT), who has been the leader in the House in the fight to \naddress PMI abuses.\n  Mr. President, by passing this bill we can remedy a market \ndysfunction--unnecessary private mortgage insurance premiums. These \npremiums are being paid by tens of thousands of American homeowners. \nPrivate mortgage insurance is typically required when a homebuyer \ncannot make the standard 20-percent downpayment. For many creditworthy, \ncash-poor potential homebuyers, private mortgage insurance has been a \nblessing. Unfortunately, it can also become a curse.\n\n  I will present just one example of this unfair practice. A homebuyer \npurchases a $100,000 home with a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage and a 10-\npercent downpayment. After 10 years and $3,500 in mortgage insurance \npremiums, it is likely that the homeowners would have a 20-percent \nequity stake in his or her home. At this time, private mortgage \ninsurance is no longer necessary. However, if that homeowner is unaware \nof the right to cancel--as many are--and continues to pay for \nunnecessary insurance, he or she could spend an additional $7,000 in \npremiums over the life of the loan. And this is less costly than many \nof the horror stories we hear. In fact, private mortgage insurance \nrates average between $20 and $100 per month, meaning that some \nconsumers are unknowingly paying from $240 to $1,200 a year for \nabsolutely no reason. Situations like these are nothing less than a \nfleecing of the American homeowner.\n  The private mortgage insurance industry extended coverage on nearly \n900,000 of the approximately 4.4 million mortgages made for the \npurchase of single-family homes in 1995. At a Banking Committee hearing \nearlier this year, the spokesman for the private mortgage insurance \nindustry stated that of the approximately 5 million homeowners repaying \nmortgages covered by PMI, 5 percent could be eligible for cancellation. \nThat amounts to 250,000 hardworking families. And some estimates go \nmuch higher.\n  In fact, according to a recent Washington Post article by Ken Harney:\n\n       An eye-opening new estimate of the extent of the problem \n     came last week when a Dallas-based loan portfolio analyst \n     said he believes that as much as one-fifth of some lenders' \n     mortgage portfolios consist of PMI-insured loans with \n     equities that are greater than 20 percent of current market \n     resale value.\n\n  Mr. President, clearly, American homeowners, particularly middleclass \nand firsttime homeowners need our help--and I can say today that that \nhelp is on the way. The committee print enables homeowners to initiate \ncancellation when they have accumulated 20-percent equity. Otherwise, \nthe general rule is that PMI must be automatically canceled at 22 \npercent.\n  The bill also requires that all existing mortgagors who currently \nmaintain PMI will receive an annual notice informing them that under \ncertain circumstances their insurance may be canceled. The notice must \ninclude information to allow the homeowner to contact his or her \nservicer regarding cancellation requirements. New homebuyers will be \ninformed of their cancellation rights at closing, and will be informed \nof their right under this law at closing and annually.\n  Mr. President, let me state for the record: I am opposed to \nunnecessary and excessive government regulation. This bill accomplishes \nthe goals of S. 318 without imposing excess regulation. Clearly, the \nCongress should allow the free market to resolve most problems. This \nbill is only needed because, due to the peculiar nature of the PMI \nmarket, the market has not remedied this problem. I am grateful for the \ncooperation of all the industries and consumer groups that have helped \nbring us to this point.\n  Mr. President, the Homeowner's Protection Act is evidence of what \nthis body can accomplish with hard work on a bipartisan basis. \nCurrently, unnecessary PMI premiums are wrong--when this bill becomes \nlaw, they will be illegal. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant bill and to vote for its passage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1623\n\n                   (Purpose: To provide a substitute)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator D'Amato has a substitute amendment at the desk. \nI ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] for Mr. D'Amato, \n     for himself and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1623.\n\n\n[[Page S12414]]\n\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today in strong support for passage \nof S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1997. This important \nconsumer legislation would end the odious practice of forcing hundreds \nof thousands of homeowners to pay for private mortgage insurance long \nafter they, or their lender, cease to derive any benefit from it.\n  Private mortgage insurance--or PMI as it's known--has played a very \nimportant role in expanding homeownership opportunities for people who \nhave had less than the traditional 20 percent downpayment that many \nlenders required. In the event of a default, the PMI provides insurance \nto the lender for the difference between the downpayment and 20 percent \nor, in rare instances, some other predetermined percentage--equity \nlevel. This is also known as an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio.\n  As beneficial as PMI has been, it has also developed some less savory \ncharacteristics. Principally, the problem with PMI as it exists today \nis that it is virtually impossible for a homeowner to stop making the \npremium payments, even after the PMI no longer provides any protection. \nAs a result, literally hundreds of thousands of homeowners pay as much \nas $1,200 a year in unfair and unnecessary payments.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would change all that in a fair and \nsimple way. First, the bill provides simple and meaningful disclosure \nto the borrower at the time of the mortgage closing, so that the \nborrower understands when and how they can cancel their PMI. In fact, \nthe borrower receives an amortization table that gives them a date \ncertain when they may voluntarily cancel the PMI and a date certain \nwhen the PMI will be automatically canceled. Second, the bill requires \nthe mortgage servicer to provide annual notices to the homeowner and \nthen to let the homeowner know that they've reached 80 percent loan-to-\nvalue ratio, based upon the original amortization table, and therefore, \nthe homeowner may have the right to cancel. Third, the bill provides \nthat for the vast majority of homeowners, their PMI will be \nautomatically canceled at 78 percent loan-to-value ratio, based upon \nthe original amortization table. Lastly, there are some very, very \nnarrow exceptions for high-risk loans that allow the continuation of \nPMI to the halflife of the loan.\n  Let me put it more simply, Mr. President: for the overwhelming \nmajority of homeowners, when you've got 20 percent equity in your home, \nyou have the right to initiate cancellation of your PMI. If you choose \nnot to initiate the cancellation, your PMI will be automatically \ncanceled at 22 percent equity. It's that simple. And the result of \nthese reforms will save hundreds of thousands of homeowners as much as \n$1,200 a year.\n  As easy as the problem was to identify, it was a complicated and \ndifficult process to achieve this legislative remedy. I particularly \nwish to acknowledge the outstanding work of Chairman D'Amato, with whom \nI joined in this effort back in February. I would also like to thank \nSenator Sarbanes, Senator Faircloth, and Senator Bennett for their \ntireless efforts to achieve a bill that serves the interest of \nconsumers without inadvertently disrupting the mortgage lending \nindustry.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues on the \nBanking Committee for their tireless efforts to craft this piece of \nlegislation so that the final bill can enjoy such broad bipartisan \nsupport. The Banking Committee has passed positive legislation to \nprotect consumers and give them new rights for canceling private \nmortgage insurance.\n  Private mortgage insurance has been a great tool to increase \nhomeownership. But there have been too many cases where people had \ntrouble canceling the insurance long after it was needed. This bill \ngives consumers the opportunity to cancel their private mortgage \ninsurance at 20-percent equity and requires automatic cancellation at \n22-percent equity. S. 318 requires that homebuyers be informed about \ntheir right to cancel private mortgage insurance. It creates a national \nstandard for cancellation that is clear and simple for consumers to \nunderstand. I believe it is a winner for all kinds of consumers.\n  When S. 318 was first introduced about 9 months ago many on the \ncommittee could not support it. It created unnecessary government \nmandates and controls on the entire mortgage industry by setting a \nbright line rule for cancellation. As a result, S. 318 as introduced, \nwould have increased the cost of obtaining a low downpayment mortgage \nand would have put homeownership out of the reach for many families.\n  The version that was reported out of the committee, by a 16-to-1 vote \non October 23, still provides consumers with important rights, but \neliminates the Federal Government's role in the marketplace so that \nindustry can continue to create innovative products for future \nhomebuyers. Further, the bill provides meaningful limitations on class \naction lawsuits without stripping consumers of their enforcement \nmechanisms in the bill.\n  I believe that S. 318, as written today, is a good bill for consumers \neverywhere. Mortgage insurance is a valuable financial tool that allows \npeople to get into homes years sooner than they would otherwise. But I \ndo not want anyone to pay for it longer than it is needed. This bill \ngives consumers that protection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nconsidered as read and agreed to, the bill be considered as read a \nthird time and passed as amended, the title amendment be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1623) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 318), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: A Bill to require automatic \ncancellation and notice of cancellation rights with respect to private \nmortgage insurance which is required as a condition for entering into a \nresidential mortgage transaction, to abolish the Thrift Depositor \nProtection Oversight Board, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12410-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CANCELLATION DISAPPROVAL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

One of our \nmost exemplary Federal grantees, Alu Like, Inc., has been administering \nthe Native Hawaiian Library Project since 1985.\n  Native Hawaiian children in the State's public school system start \nschool well behind other students when it comes to crucial vocabulary \nskills. Hawaiian children enter kindergarten with lower vocabulary \nscores than other children (12th percentile: Peabody Picture Vocabulary \nTest--Revised, 1989), and in achievement tests of basic skills, \nHawaiian students continue to perform below national norms and other \ngroups in Hawaii. On the Reading Comprehension Subtest of the Stanford \nAchievement Test administered by the Hawaii State Department of \nEducation in the spring of 1990, Hawaiian eighth grade students scored \nat the 18th percentile, the lowest of the four principal ethnic groups \nin Hawaii. A recent study in Hawaii by the Governor's Council for \nLiteracy shows that Native Hawaiian adults have low literacy rates, \nwith 30 percent at the lowest level compared with 19 percent of adults \nstatewide.\n  It is these statistics, and the need to assure that parents have \nreading skills sufficient to foster learning and reading skills in \ntheir preschool and school-age children, that the Native Hawaiian \nLibrary Project has sought to address. This has been made possible \nbecause of the federal resources that have been made available under \nthe Library Services and Construction Act. The initial funding for this \nprogram was $590,123 and 1985, and because of the program's documented \neffectiveness, it has been funded each year thereafter for a total of \n$7,223,297. Funding in the past fiscal year was $635,025.\n\n  It is my understanding that in enacting the Museum and Library \nServices Act, the Congress sought to extend the authority for the \nlibrary services programs that have proven to be so effective in \nenriching the reading and vocabulary skills of Americans of all ages. \nIn our State, it has enabled Native Hawaiian children to begin to \nperform on a par with other students, it has effected a reduction in \nthe drop-out rates of Native Hawaiian students and demonstrated a \nmarked improvement in their performance on achievement tests, and has \nenabled adults with new literacy skills to secure employment.\n  It is because of the importance of this program to the Native \nHawaiian people of our State that I seek your clarification that the \nbill to provide technical and conforming amendments to the Museum and \nLibrary Services Act, specifically section 6 of that measure, is \nintended simply to maintain the status quo relative to the federal \nsupport for Native Hawaiian library services by extending the authority \nfor grants to Native Hawaiian organizations for this purpose.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator from Hawaii is correct in his reading of \nthe\n\n[[Page S12417]]\n\nbill. It is our intent to assure that .25 percent of appropriated funds \nare reserved to provide services to Hawaiian Natives. This authority \ndid exist under the Library Services and Construction Act.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee for this clarification and urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1505) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support, along \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senators Murray, Snowe, Landrieu, \nFeinstein, Boxer, Mikulski, Moseley-Braun, and Collins this concurrent \nresolution to grant recognition to the effort now underway to establish \nThe Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future.\n  This important museum, being sponsored by the Foundation for Women's \nResources in Texas and to be completed in 2000 in Dallas, will \nappropriately be designated by this resolution as a national millennium \nproject for the United States. While the resolution will not preclude \nother official events and activities commemorating the turn of the \nmillennium, it will serve to highlight the contributions of women in \nour Nation and world and how those contributions promise to continue to \nexpand and evolve into the next century and millennium. The Women's \nMuseum: An Institute for the Future will become a focal point for this \nrecognition and appreciation of the role of women in our lives and \nculture and in commerce, politics, art, music, the sciences, and \nvirtually every other field of endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I am especially excited about the tremendous potential \nof this museum to educate all people, particularly young women and \ngirls, about the growing opportunities women have today--opportunities \nthat were only dreams a few decades ago. These visitors to the museum \nwill have the opportunity to learn about the past, present, and \npotential future lives and accomplishments of women, using a variety of \ntraditional and innovative exhibits and interactive experiences. \nMoreover, the museum will serve as a center where people may gather to \ndiscuss and research the history and trends of issues affecting women.\n  The museum will be housed in the historic Texas State Fair Coliseum, \nlocated on the grounds of Fair Park in Dallas, which receives over six \nmillion visitors a year and is already home to a host of cultural and \nartistic attractions. The Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future \nwill be an exciting addition to this state and national asset, and I am \nconfident will continue to attract the enthusiastic support of \ngovernments, individuals, and corporations across the nation and across \nthe world. It is my hope that this concurrent resolution will help \nfocus even more attention on this effort to acknowledge and understand \nthe virtually limitless potential of women in our society.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the concurrent resolution be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12418]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 151, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Warner and Ford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 151) to amend the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate to require the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration to develop, implement, and update as necessary \n     a strategic planning process for the functional and technical \n     infrastructure support of the Senate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, it is my job to ensure that our colleagues have the \nsupport services they need to perform our constitutional \nresponsibilities. Almost all of those services rely on information \ntechnology which must be coordinated between various authorities in the \nSenate. Ultimately, however, it is the Rules Committee that sets the \noverall policies for these services and remains responsible for \nensuring that the needs of Senators and committees are met.\n  With the explosion in information technology, and the increasing \nsophistication of our user community, it is almost a full time job to \nensure that the Senate keeps up with changes in technology in a timely \nmanner. To assist in our responsibilities, the Committee sought the \nadvice of outside experts with considerable experience advising both \ngovernmental entities and private industry in making the information \ntechnology and infrastructure support delivery decisions.\n  The consulting firm of Booz-Allen & Hamilton thoroughly reviewed our \nservice delivery systems in the Senate, with considerable cooperation \nand participation by members' offices and the officers of the Senate. \nBooz-Allen has advised the Committee that the implementation of a \nstrategic planning process for reviewing and coordinating the \ninformation technology and infrastructure support services of the \nSenate would enable us to make more cost-effective decisions about how \nto deliver those services.\n  The ranking member, Senator Ford, and I agree that this is a business \npractice that can prove very beneficial for the Senate. The resolution \nthat we offer establishes that strategic planning process. I urge the \nadoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Committee on Rules and Administration \nhas the responsibility of ensuring that everything runs smoothly in the \nSenate. We have to stay current on the latest technology to be \nresponsive to the needs of Senators and committees, and to make sure \nthat we are using taxpayers' dollars wisely. There is a very delicate \nbalance to strike between taking care of Members' individual needs and \nensuring that the overall administration of the Senate functions in a \ncoordinated and efficient manner.\n  To help the Rules Committee meet our responsibilities under the \nStanding Rules, the Committee solicited the advice of the consulting \nfirm of Booz-Allen & Hamilton. Booz-Allen came before the Committee and \npresented their recommendations for how the Committee, and the Senate \nas a whole, can ensure that information technology and infrastructure \nsupport are more effectively and efficiently delivered in the Senate. \nTheir recommendations include applying concepts that have worked in the \nprivate sector to bring efficiencies to technology and infrastructure \nsupport delivery. Specifically, Booz-Allen recommends that the Senate \nimplement a strategic planning process for the delivery of information \ntechnology and infrastructure support.\n  This resolution provides for the creation of a strategic planning \nprocess in the Senate. I urge adoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1506, introduced earlier today by \nSenators McCain and Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1506) to amend the Professional Boxing Safety \n     Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this legislation, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Bryan of Nevada, would add a small but important amendment to \nthe Professional Boxing Safety Act (P.L. 104-272), that was signed into \nlaw last year. This proposal would add language to the act to prevent \npromoters from exploiting professional boxers with respect to a certain \nunethical contracting practice. It would prohibit promoters from \nforcing a boxer, as a pre-condition to signing a contract for a bout, \nto hire a relative or associate of the promoter as their manager.\n  Testimony at the Commerce Committee's May 22nd 1997 hearing on the \nprofessional boxing industry detailed this practice, and prominent \nstate commissioners have further advised Senator Bryan and I that the \n``forced hiring'' of a promoter's relative does indeed occur. The most \noffensive result of this coercive practice is that boxers are forced to \nturn over at least one-third of their earnings to an individual with \nwhom they have no business or personal relationship whatsoever. If the \nboxer refuses, they are effectively blacklisted from being able to \ncompete in the lucrative bouts they have fairly earned. Their career \nmay be over.\n  This practice is simply indefensible, and it clearly takes advantage \nof the fact that most professional boxers have little leverage in an \nindustry dominated by a handful of powerful promoters. This legislative \nwould end it. This amendment would add a provision to the new federal \nboxing safety and ethics law (P.L. 104-272) which was enacted with \nbipartisan support in the Senate and House of Representatives last \nyear. Senator Bryan played a tremendously vital role as cosponsor of \nthe Professional Boxing Safety Act, and he recently joined me in \ndeveloping this proposal.\n  If enacted, this modest proposal will provide further assistance to a \ngroup of athletes who have had few advocates for too long. I know this \nlegislation will be strongly welcomed by the courageous athletes who \nsustain the professional boxing industry, as well as the state \ncommissioners who have the responsibility to regulate professional \nboxing events.\n  For a promoter to force a boxer to turn over one-third or one-half of \nhis earnings, by threatening to deny them the chance to compete in a \nmajor bout, is extremely offensive and unethical. This practice would \nnever be tolerated in any other sport or profession in the U.S. Indeed, \nit would probably result in the promoter being kicked out of a \nprofessional sports league or be the subject of a law enforcement \nproceeding. The only reason that it has occurred in professional boxing \nis because the overwhelming majority of boxers in America are \ncompletely powerless when it comes to their own financial futures. They \nare often at the whim of the powerful business interests who dominate \nthe sport. Furthermore, with no union or private industry association \nto help advocate their causes and interests, boxers are routinely \nignored by business entities in the sport.\n  I am sure that every Member of the Senate would join senator Bryan \nand I in ending this egregious practice if they were aware of it. This \nmodest legislative proposal will achieve this goal, and stop one form \nof exploitation against a group of athletes who have been subject to \nfraudulent and coercive business practices for decades. I hope my \ncolleagues will support the swift passage of this proposal.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Congress approved \n     the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n       (2) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects are major \n     components of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, \n     and contribute to the national economy by generating a \n     substantial amount of hydropower and impounding a substantial \n     quantity of water;\n       (3) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects overlie the \n     [western] eastern boundary of the Lower Brule Indian \n     Reservation, having inundated the fertile, wooded bottom \n     lands of the Tribe along the Missouri River that constituted \n     the most productive agricultural and pastoral lands of the \n     Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the homeland of the members of \n     the Tribe;\n       (4) Public Law 85-923 (72 Stat. 1773 et seq.) authorized \n     the acquisition of 7,997 acres of Indian land on the Lower \n     Brule Indian Reservation for the Fort Randall project and \n     Public Law 87-734 (76 Stat. 698 et seq.) authorized the \n     acquisition of 14,299 acres of Indian land on the Lower Brule \n     Indian Reservation for the Big Bend project;\n       (5) Public Law 87-734 (76 Stat. 698 et seq.) provided for \n     the mitigation of the effects of the Fort Randall and Big \n     Bend projects on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation, by \n     directing the Secretary of the Army to--\n       (A) as necessary, by reason of the Big Bend project, \n     protect, replace, relocate, or reconstruct--\n       (i) any essential governmental and agency facilities on the \n     reservation, including schools, hospitals, offices of the \n     Public Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n     service buildings, and employee quarters existing at the time \n     that the projects were carried out; and\n       (ii) roads, bridges, and incidental matters or facilities \n     in connection with those facilities;\n       (B) provide for a townsite adequate for 50 homes, including \n     streets and utilities (including water, sewage, and \n     electricity), taking into account the reasonable future \n     growth of the townsite; and\n       (C) provide for a community center containing space and \n     facilities for community gatherings, tribal offices, tribal \n     council chamber, offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \n     offices and quarters of the Public Health Service, and a \n     combination gymnasium and auditorium;\n       (6) the requirements under Public Law 87-734 (76 Stat. 698 \n     et seq.) with respect to the mitigation of the effects of the \n     Fort Randall and Big Bend projects on the Lower Brule Indian \n     Reservation have not been fulfilled;\n       (7) although the national economy has benefited from the \n     Fort Randall and Big Bend projects, the economy on the Lower \n     Brule Indian Reservation remains underdeveloped, in part as a \n     consequence of the failure of the Federal Government to \n     fulfill the obligations of the Federal Government under the \n     laws referred to in paragraph (4);\n       (8) the economic and social development and cultural \n     preservation of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe will be enhanced \n     by increased tribal participation in the benefits of the Fort \n     Randall and Big Bend components of the Pick-Sloan Missouri \n     River Basin program; and\n       (9) the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is entitled to additional \n     benefits of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1624) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I delighted that the Senate is about to \npass the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997, S. 1189. I am a \nproud cosponsor of this legislation.\n  This legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, \nlaw enforcement officers and their families. Specifically, our \nlegislation would: increase the maximum prison term for forcible \nassaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation or interference with a \nFederal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 \nyears; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or \ninfliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement \nofficer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the \nmaximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of \nthe immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from \n5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department \nof Justice, the United States Judicial Conference, the United States \nSentencing Commission and the United States Marshal Service.\n  It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs \nthis legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in \nour Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, \nunfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence \nagainst officials of our Federal government.\n  Earlier this year, for example, a courtroom in Urbana, Illinois was \nfirebombed, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This follows the \nhorrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office building in \nOklahoma City two years ago. More recently in my home state, a Vermont \nborder patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl \nDrega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement \nofficers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and \nkilled two state troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. \nApparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who \nhad ruled against him in a land dispute.\n  I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the hospital and met his \nwife and young daughter. Thankfully, Agent Pfeiffer has returned to \nwork along the Vermont border. As a federal law enforcement officer, \nAgent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater protection under our \nbill.\n  There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking \nthe law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or \nlaw enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshal Service is concerned \nwith more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement \nofficers.\n  The extreme rhetoric that some are using to attack the judiciary only \nfeeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in \nthe House of Representatives was recently quoted as saying: ``The \njudges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not behave, ``we're \ngoing to go after them in a big way.'' I know that House Republican \nWhip Tom DeLay was not intending to encourage violence against any \nFederal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade \nFederal judges in the eyes of the public.\n  Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate \nand violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve \nwithin it with the respect that is essential to its preserving its \npublic standing.\n  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people \nand countries around the world that are struggling for freedom. It is \nthe independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives \nit the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that \nhas for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and \nserved as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, \nthose more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the \nmoment.\n  We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the \nFederal Judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a \ntremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the \nhard-working public servants that make up the federal government, who \nare too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that \nit takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal \nJudiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that \nthese are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. \nThey deserve our respect and our protection.\n\n[[Page S12422]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

No. 104-\n     130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996), has been placed in issue;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(c), 706(a), and 713(a) of \n     the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. 288b(c), \n     288e(a), and 2881(a), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     appear as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate in any \n     legal action in which the powers and responsibilities of \n     Congress under the Constitution are placed in issue: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is directed to \n     appear as amicus curiae on behalf of the Senate in the cases \n     of City of New York, et al., v. William Clinton, et al.; \n     National Treasury Employees Union, et al., v. United States, \n     et al.; and Snake River Potato Growers, Inc., et al., v. \n     Robert Rubin, to defend the constitutionality of the Line \n     Item Veto Act.\n       Sec. 2. That while the Senate is adjourned the Senate Legal \n     Counsel is authorized to appear as amicus curiae on behalf of \n     the Senate in other cases in which the constitutionality of \n     the Line Item Veto Act is placed in issue: Provided, That the \n     Joint Leadership Group authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to \n     appear as amicus curiae on behalf of the Senate in such other \n     cases.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last year, after years of legislative \nconsideration and debate, Congress enacted into law\n\n[[Page S12423]]\n\nthe Line Item Veto Act. For the next several years, this act gives the \nPresident authority, within carefully circumscribed limits, to cancel \nparticular items of appropriation, direct spending, or limited tax \nbenefits. The President must send Congress a special message reporting \nhis cancellations within five days after he approves the bill \ncontaining the spending or tax provisions, and Congress may then \nconsider, under expedited procedures, whether to pass a new law \ndisapproving the President's cancellation.\n  Congress delegated this responsibility to the President as a means of \nfurthering our goal of balancing the federal budget. Congress's \nenactment of the Line Item Veto Act followed vigorous debate in the \nSenate, in which some opponents raised doubts about the law's \nconstitutionality. All Members recognized that these constitutional \nquestions likely ultimately would be resolved only in the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Last January, the day after the law took effect, in the case of Byrd \nv. Raines, six of our colleagues filed suit challenging the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. On January 22, 1997, the \nSenate directed the Senate Legal Counsel to appear on behalf of the \nSenate as amicus curiae in Byrd v. Raines to defend the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. In June the Supreme Court \ndismissed the case on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked legal \nstanding to bring their suit. The Court did not address the \nconstitutional question.\n  In August, the President began using the Line Item Veto Act's \ncancellation authority for the first time. As a result of the \nPresident's cancellations, three new actions have recently been filed \nin the United States District Court for the District of Columbia again \nchallenging the constitutionality of the Act. The plaintiffs assert \nthat the Act violates the lawmaking provisions of Article I of the \nConstitution by authorizing the President to nullify the effect of \nportions of recently enacted laws. These challenges call into question \nthe full range of cancellation authority provided by Congress in the \nAct, as the three cases address direct spending, discretionary \nappropriations, and limited tax benefits, respectively.\n  Mr. President, as with the Senate's appearance amicus curiae in Byrd \nv. Raines, appearance in these cases as an amicus curiae would again \nenable the Senate to present to the courts its reasons for enacting the \nLien Item Veto Act and the basis for the Senate's conviction that the \nlaw is consistent with the Constitution. Accordingly, this resolution \nwould authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to appear in these cases in \nthe name of the Senate as amicus curiae to support the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.\n  The Senate would not take a position on questions about the legal \nstanding of any of these plaintiffs, as it did not in the prior \nlitigation. However, as in the earlier litigation, the Senate Legal \nCounsel will be expected to describe to the courts, in the course of \nsupporting the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, the \nstatutory limits embodied in the Act that constrain the President's use \nof this authority to the particular circumstances and conditions \ncarefully prescribed by the Act.\n  Finally, this resolution also would authorize the Senate Legal \nCounsel to appear in the name of the Senate as amicus curiae to support \nthe constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act in any other cases \nchallenging the constitutionality of the Act that may occur during the \nadjournment of the Senate, if authorized to do so by the Joint \nLeadership Group. This is the procedure the Senate has used in the past \nto protect its legal interests during adjournments.\n\n                              S. Res. 153\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Sherry Yvonne Moore v. Capitol \n     Guide Board, Case No. 1:97CV00823, pending in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia, a \n     subpoena has been issued for the production of documents of \n     the Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. 288b(a) and \n     288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to represent \n     Members, officers, and employees of the Senate with respect \n     to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony or document \n     production relating to their official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistently with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the \n     Senate is authorized to produce documents relevant to the \n     case of Sherry Yvonne Moore v. Capitol Guide Board, except \n     where a privilege should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2. That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent the Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate \n     in connection with the production of documents in this case.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the case of Sherry Yvonne Moore v. Capitol \nGuide Board, pending in the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia under the Congressional Accountability Act, \ninvolves claims of employment discrimination by the plaintiff, former \nemployee of the Sergeant at Arms who worked for the Capitol Guide \nService.\n  The plaintiff in this case has issued a subpoena for documents to the \nSenate Sergeant at Arms. The enclosed resolution would authorize the \nSergeant at Arms to produce such documents, except where a privilege or \nobjection should be asserted. It wou8ld also authorize the Senate Legal \nCounsel to represent the Sergeant at Arms in connection with the \nproduction of such documents.\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Magee, et al. v. Hatch, et al., No. \n     97-CV02203, pending in the United States District Court for \n     the District of Columbia, the plaintiffs have named Senator \n     Orrin Hatch as a defendant;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(1) (1994), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     defend its Members in civil actions relating to their \n     official responsibilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent Senator Hatch in the case of Magee, et al. v. \n     Hatch, et al.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Magee, et al. v. Hatch, et al. is an action \narising out of Congress's enactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act of 1996. The suit names Senator Orrin G. Hatch and \nSpeaker of the House Newt Gingrich as the sole defendants. This \nresolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator \nHatch in this matter. If so authorized, the Senate Legal Counsel will \nseek dismissal of the complaint.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12422-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12423-S12424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MAMMOGRAPHY QUALITY STANDARDS REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . FALSE ADVERTISING OR MISUSE OF NAME TO INDICATE \n                   UNITED STATES MARSHALS SERVICE.\n\n       Section 709 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting after the thirteenth undesignated paragraph the \n     following:\n       ``Whoever, except with the written permission of the \n     Director of the United States Marshals Service, knowingly \n     uses the words `United States Marshals Service', `U.S. \n     Marshals Service', `United States Marshal', `U.S. Marshal', \n     `U.S.M.S.' or any colorable imitation of any such words, or \n     the likeness of the United States Marshals Service badge, \n     logo, or insignia on any item of apparel, in connection with \n     any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet, software, or \n     other publication, or any play, motion picture, broadcast, \n     telecast, or other production, in a manner that is reasonably \n     calculated to convey the impression that the wearer of the \n     item of apparel is acting pursuant to the legal authority of \n     the United States Marshals Service, or to convey the \n     impression that such advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet, \n     software, or other publication, or such play, motion picture, \n     broadcast, telecast, or other production, is approved, \n     endorsed, or authorized by the United States Marshals \n     Service;''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to support this measure with my \namendment to prevent the misuse of the name and likeness of the U.S. \nMarshals Service.\n  The U.S. Marshals Service is the Nation's oldest Federal law \nenforcement agency. Since 1789, U.S. marshals have served the country \nthrough a variety of vital law enforcement activities, such as the \nprotection of Federal judicial officials, the apprehension of Federal \nfugitives, and the transportation of Federal prisoners. Today, \napproximately 4,000 deputy U.S. marshals and career employees perform \nthese important services across the Nation. I receive frequent reports \nabout the day-to-day activities of the Service from Vermont's U.S. \nmarshal, Jack Rouille, who has been a model public servant and has been \na linchpin of coordination for Federal and local law enforcement \nagencies in Vermont.\n  The amendment I have offered will assist the Marchals Service by \namending 18 U.S.C. 709--the part of the U.S. Code that deals with \nmisuse of names to indicate Federal agencies--to include the Marshals \nService among the Federal agencies whose name and likeness are \nprotected from imitation on items of apparel or in connection with any \ncommercial enterprise.\n  At present, the name and likeness of many other Federal law \nenforcement agencies are protected under law. For instance, the name \nand likeness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], Secret \nService, and Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA] are protected under 18 \nu.S.C. 709. Moreover, the name and likeness of several non-law \nenforcement agencies are protected under law. For example, the name and \nlikeness of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National \nCredit Union, the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, and\n\n[[Page S12427]]\n\nthe U.S. Mint, to name a few, are protected under 18 U.S.C. 709.\n  The lack of protection for the Marshals Service has generated serious \nsecurity concerns. At a minimum, the public may be falsely lead to \nbelieve that the Marshals Service approves or endorses an unauthorized \nproduct. Even more problematic is the possibility that unauthorized \nindividuals may wear apparel to look like marshals to effectuate \ncriminal purposes or to gain undesired access to secured areas such as \ncourtrooms or witness security facilities.\n\n  Recent cases highlight the need for this amendment:\n  In 1994, an individual dressed in full marshal ``swat team'' apparel \nand in possession of a loaded weapon made a series of presentations to \na group of students at a local high school in Virginia.\n  An organization known as the United States Marshals and Peace \nOfficers Association of America markets home security systems. Its \nadvertisements use a replica of the Marshals Service badge, implying \ngovernment endorsement of the organization and its product. The \norganization is not endorsed or authorized by the Marshals Service.\n  A Texas company offers bullet-resistant panels as an alternative home \nprotection system. The company advertises that these bullet-proof \npanels are approved by the Marshals Service. This product is not \nofficially endorsed by the Marshals Service.\n  While the amendment that I am introducing would protect the Marshals \nService against these illegitimate uses of its name and likeness, the \namendment is purposely limited in its scope. Specifically, this \namendment would not prevent the use of the name or likeness in those \ninstances where the use would not be reasonably calculated to convey \nthe impression that either, first, the wearer of the item of apparel \nwith the name or likeness is acting pursuant to legal authority; or, \nsecond, the use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Marshals \nService.\n  Thus, for example, there was a case brought before the Patent Office \nTrademark Trial and Appeal Board in 1971 in which a French clothing \nmanufacturer used the initials FBI in conjunction with the words \n``Fabrication Bril International'' on clothing. The Trial and Appeal \nBoard ruled that the law did not create an absolute prohibition against \nthe use of the initials FBI, but was applicable only in those cases in \nwhich the initials were used in a manner reasonably calculated to \nconvey a mistaken impression that the item of clothing was approved, \nendorsed, or authorized by the FBI. In that case, the Board ruled, \nthere was little chance that anyone would think that the clothing was \napproved, endorsed, or authorized by the FBI, hence there was no \nviolation of the statute.\n  In a case of political satire, the use of the Marshals Service name \nor likeness would almost always be permissible. In such instances, \nthere would be little chance that any reasonable person would think \nthat the satirist was acting pursuant to legal authority. This \namendment should not interfere with the Capitol Steps or other \nsatirists. As the court stated in Cliff Notes versus Bantam Doubleday \nDell Pub. Group in 1989, trademark law courts have uniformly ruled that \nnoncommercial parodies and satires do not infringe legitimate \ntrademarks because there is little chance of confusion as to \nsponsorship.\n  Allowing unauthorized individuals to pose as Marshals Service \nofficials or allowing unauthorized individuals to use the name in a \nmanner that mistakenly conveys the impression that the use is \nsanctioned by the Marshals Service is an affront to those who \nlegitimately and nobly serve under its banner and wear its badge. For \nthis reason, I am delighted that the Senate has accepted this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1628) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1629\n\n (Purpose: To combat telemarketing fraud through reasonable disclosure \n          of certain records for telemarketing investigations)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Mr. Harkin and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1629.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN RECORDS FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF \n                   TELEMARKETING FRAUD.\n\n       Section 2703(c)(1)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``or'' at the end of clause (ii);\n       (2) by striking out the period at the end of clause (iii) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iv) submits a formal written request relevant to law \n     enforcement investigation concerning telemarketing fraud for \n     the name, address, and place of business of a subscriber or \n     customer of such provider, which subscriber or customer is \n     engaged in telemarketing (as such term is in section 2325 of \n     this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Every year thousands of Americans are \nvictimized by fraudulent telemarketing promotions. And, unfortunately, \nthese scam artists prey most often on our senior citizens. The losses \nevery year are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. My amendment \nwill help law enforcement to more effectively combat these abuses.\n  Today, it's all to easy for telemarketing rip-off artists to profit \nfrom the current system. How do these rip-offs occur? Advertisements \nregarding sweepstakes, contests, loans, credit reports and other \npromotions appear in newspapers, magazines, and other direct mail and \ntelephone solicitations. The operators of many of these phoney \npromotions set up telephone boiler rooms for a few months in which a \nnumber of phones are operated to receive calls responding to their ads. \nThey steal thousands--even millions--of dollars from innocent victims \nand then they simply disappear. They take the money and run--moving on \nto another location to start all over again.\n  Here's just one example. Not too long ago, 30,000 Iowans received \npostcards from an organization calling itself Sweepstakes \nInternational, Inc. The postcard enticed recipients to call a 900-\nnumber and they were charged $9.95 on their phone bill.\n  Based on a Postal Service investigation, civil action was initiated \nin U.S. District Court in Iowa. As a result, the promotion was halted \nand $1.7 million was frozen. This represented just one and a half \nmonth's revenue from the scam!\n  My amendment will protect telemarketing victims by providing law \nenforcement the authority to more quickly obtain the name, address, and \nphysical location of businesses suspected of telemarketing fraud. Phone \ncompanies would have to provide law enforcement officials ONLY the \nname, address and physical location of a telemarketing business holding \na phone number if the officials submitted a formal written request for \nthis information relevant to a legitimate law enforcement \ninvestigation. It will make it easier for officers to identify and \nlocate these operations. This is similar to the procedure that is \nalready in place for post office box investigations.\n  Mr. President, it is necessary to crack down on serious consumer \nfraud. With this change, we will have many more successful efforts to \nshut down these rip-off artists like several recent cases in my home \nstate of Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1629) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be considered read the \nthird time, and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move that the Senate concur in the \namendments of the House with a further amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for Mr. D'Amato, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1630.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support immediate passage of \nthe ``Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act'' (S. 562). This \nlegislation contains essential provisions which are urgently required \nto protect our senior citizens from further exploitation by fraudulent \noperators who are manipulating the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's (HUD) home equity conversion mortgage program. The bill \nalso contains a number of housing and flood insurance program \nreauthorizations and technical corrections which are needed to ensure \nthe effective and efficient continuation of existing programs.\n  The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act, which I introduced on \nApril 10, 1997, was originally passed by the Senate on April 25, 1997. \nIt seeks to prevent unscrupulous middlemen, posing as ``estate \nplanners'', from taking advantage of seniors by charging unnecessary \nand excessive fees to assist them in obtaining a home equity conversion \nmortgage. These predators have charged elderly homeowners fees ranging \nfrom 6 to 12 percent of the loan amount. Hundreds of very low-income \nseniors have been manipulated into paying several thousand dollars in \nreturn for ministerial and often meaningless services. HUD provides \ninformation on reverse mortgages at no charge.\n  These abuses must be halted at once. This bill provides two important \nsafeguards to stop such exploitation. First, it provides a requirement \nthat the mortgagor has received a full disclosure of all costs of \nobtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate planning, \nfinancial advice or other related services. Second, it clarifies that \nthe HUD Secretary has authority to impose restrictions to ensure that \nthe mortgagor is not charged any unnecessary or excessive costs for \nobtaining a reverse mortgage.\n  This legislation also provides temporary extensions of certain public \nand assisted housing policy reforms which have been previously extended \nin VA-HUD appropriations legislation since Fiscal Year 1996. An owner's \nright to prepay a Federal Housing Administration-insured multifamily \nmortgage, subject to certain conditions, is clarified.\n  The bill reauthorizes several federally assisted multifamily rental \nhousing programs under the jurisdiction of HUD and the Rural Housing \nService of the Department of Agriculture. Such extensions will assure \nthat much needed rental programs for low-income families continue in an \nuninterrupted fashion. The National Flood Insurance Program, which is \nvital for our homeowners residing in floodplain and coastal areas, is \nalso reauthorized.\n  Last fall, Congress passed the Native American Housing Assistance and \nSelf-Determination Act of 1996. The legislation presented before you \ntoday makes technical and conforming changes to ensure the effective \nimplementation of that Act.\n  I would like to commend Senator Connie Mack, Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community \nDevelopment, for his leadership in the development of this legislation. \nI applaud Senator Mack, Ranking Minority Member Paul Sarbanes and \nSubcommittee Ranking Minority Member John Kerry for their fine \nstewardship of housing and community development programs under the \nBanking Committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, S. 562 should be law by now. By delaying action on the \nbill for 5 months, the House of Representatives has left our senior \ncitizens unprotected and vulnerable to predatory practices--and for no \nreason other than to engage in parliamentary gamesmanship. Mr. \nPresident, I cannot condone this delay.\n\n[[Page S12430]]\n\n I urge the House of Representatives to pass this bill, which now \ncontains additional provisions the House has insisted upon. There is no \nopposition to this bill to my knowledge.\n  I respectfully urge the Senate and the House of Representatives to \ngrant passage of this bill before adjournment. It is imperative that we \nensure that our nation's most vulnerable homeowners are no longer \nvictimized. Without final passage of this bill, our very low-income \nelderly homeowners may continue to be preyed upon. I ask for immediate \nsupport of this vital legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/09/senate-section/article/S12428-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12430-S12434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                50 STATES COMMEMORATIVE COIN PROGRAM ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes have an \namendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions), for Mr. D'Amato \n     for himself and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1631.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 14, strike lines 4 through 10.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act \n     shall be construed to evidence any intention to eliminate or \n     to limit the printing or circulation of United States \n     currency in the $1 denomination.\n\n  Mr. BOND. With respect to the Manager's Amendment, I would like to \nask the Senator to clarify his intent. As I understand the amendment \nregarding the dollar coin language, it is your intent, as chairman of \nthe committee, and it is the intent of the Banking Committee that S. \n1228, as amended, will not in any way restrict the continued printing \nand circulation of the dollar bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct. Moreover, when S. 1228, as amended, is \nadopted, this will similarly indicate the intent of Congress that the \ndollar bill shall continue to be printed and shall remain in \ncirculation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. There is a provision in the amended version of S. 1228 \nthat I feel needs clarification. In setting the design parameters for \nthe new dollar coin, the legislation makes clear that the coin should \nbe golden in color, have a distinctive edge, and include other features \nto ensure that the coin is not confused with any existing coins. The \nlast design parameter within the legislation states that the coin \nshould have anticounterfeiting properties of coinage in circulation at \nthe time of the bill's enactment. I ask the Senator, is this provision \nintended to require the Mint to use clad coin technology in the new \ndollar coin?\n  Mr. GRAMS. No, that provision is intended to be descriptive. The Mint \nis instructed to utilize anticounterfeiting technology.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank Senator Grams for his answer. Is this provision \nintended to limit the Mint's choice of technology in the development of \nthe dollar coin? For instance, could the Mint choose a plated coin \nrather than a clad coin?\n  Mr. GRAMS. This provision is not intended to limit the U.S. Mint's \nuse of technology or approach to design. We intend for the Mint to \ndevelop a dollar coin that meets the needs of the public and is not \nsubject to counterfeiting. If the Mint believes that a plated coin will \noffer the best approach to meeting its needs, then a plated coin could \nbe developed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thus, it is not the Committee's intention to limit the \nMint's flexibility, to require a certain coin technology or to limit \ncompetition among potential suppliers of coin blanks?\n  Mr. GRAMS. The Senator from Tennessee has stated the situation \nexactly. The Committee is directing the Mint to develop the best \npossible dollar coin. We have not sought to limit the Mint or require a \nclad coin.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator for his answer.\n\n[[Page S12432]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the one \ndollar coin bill is a part of this legislation. I have long been a \nsupporter of legislation authorizing the production of a new dollar \ncoin, and was an original cosponsor of the dollar coin bill, which \nbecame part of this coin legislation.\n  Changing the currency or the coinage of the United States always \ninvolves an element of controversy. After all, virtually everyone uses \nmoney--every day. Americans are familiar with our currency and coinage, \nand they understandably and justifiably have opinions on whether to \nchange it. There are a number of reasons, however, why this change is \nnecessary.\n  Unfortunately, today's dollar is not worth what it once was. In fact, \nthe dollar's value has declined by over a factor of four in just the \nlast 35 years. When I was a teenager, you could get a hamburger, fries \nand a small coke at McDonald's for 42 cents. Now the cost is over $2. \nYou could get a Chicago Tribune and a Chicago Sun-Times for 10 cents. \nNow the Tribune costs 50 cents and the Sun-Times 35 cents. I could go \non and on, but the point is simple--inflation has made the dollar worth \nless than a quarter was when John F. Kennedy was President of the \nUnited States.\n  Perhaps the most telling illustration of the erosion of value of our \ncurrency and coinage is the fact that so many stores now have a \n``penny'' dish in front of their cash registers--inviting their \ncustomers to take a penny or two or leave a penny or two to make their \ntransactions come out to the nearest nickel. It is that kind of change \nin the value of money that led Great Britain to replace the one-pound \nnote with a one-pound coin. And it is that fact that led Canada to \nreplace its one-dollar bill with a one-dollar coin.\n  These foreign countries, and many others, understood that they needed \nto update their currency and coinage to fit present-day economic \nrealities--and that need is no less real in this country. That is why I \ncosponsored this legislation, because I believe that updating our money \nto reflect current economic realities is long overdue. I think we \nshould act carefully. I think the coin must be designed carefully. We \nneed to learn from past mistakes, but we should not let those past \nmistakes keep us from taking the action that is necessary now.\n  Secondly, in many instances, a dollar coin would be more practical \nthan a paper note. I'm sure we've all had a run-in with a balky dollar \nbill changer, one that simply won't take our dollar for a subway ride \nor a soft drink, no matter how many times we straighten the dollar.\n  Finally, the use of a dollar coin would save money. For example, the \nChicago Transit Authority would save over $2 million annually, because \ncoins are easier and less expensive to process than bills. Many \nmanufacturers that serve the vending industry and coin-operated \nindustry would also save money because it is less expensive to retrofit \nmachines to accept dollar coins, than to add a dollar bill changer to \nmachines.\n  However, the dollar coin we have currently, known as the ``Susan B. \nAnthony,'' lacks sufficient public acceptance to make it effective. \nThis coin too closely resembles the quarter in appearance and texture. \nMoreover, according to the Mint, the supply of these coins is \ndecreasing, and more would have to be minted within the next few years \nif the coin were not replaced. This legislation calls for the \nreplacement of the Susan B. Anthony coin with a coin that is golden in \ncolor and smooth edged so that it is more easily differentiated from \nthe quarter.\n\n  The Susan B. Anthony coin is, unfortunately, the only American \ncurrency in circulation that honors the achievements of a woman. Since \nthe Susan B. Anthony coin will no longer be widely circulated, it is \nonly appropriate that the design of this new coin depict a woman or \nwomen of historical significance. To that end, I believe that the new \ncoin should depict the images of Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady \nStanton, Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony. These four women were \nstaunch abolitionists, and fought for equal rights for women. It is \nlargely through their efforts that women have opportunities for higher \neducation, the right to control their own property and children, the \nright to hold public office and the right to vote.\n  Three of these women, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and \nSusan B. Anthony, have been honored with a statue in the Capitol. This \nstatue, however, was carved in 1921, and failed to include Sojourner \nTruth, the great abolitionist, feminist and preacher. This coin \nprovides an excellent opportunity to recognize the contributions of \nSojourner Truth, along with her fellow women's rights advocates.\n  Sojourner Truth was born into slavery in 1797 in New York State. \nFreed in 1827 under the New York State Emancipation Act, she spent the \nnext 53 years preaching and lecturing about God, abolition and women's \nrights.\n  Sojourner Truth was an advocate of women's rights. She consistently \nsupported equality among all people. In 1851, Sojourner Truth spoke at \na Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. Despite widely voiced \nconcerns by many of the white women in attendance that they did not \nwant an African American speaking, potentially confusing and tarnishing \ntheir cause, Sojourner Truth rose to respond to male preachers who were \ndenouncing women's rights based on the inherent frailty of women:\n\n       I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's \n     rights. I have as much muscle as any man and can do as much \n     work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and \n     chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have \n     heard much about the sexes being equal; I can carry as much \n     as any man, and can eat as much, too, if I can get it. I am \n     as strong as any man that is now . . . Why, children, if you \n     have woman's rights, give it to her and you will feel better. \n     You will have your own rights, and they won't be so much \n     trouble . . .\n\nShe inspired the Convention and women's rights advocates as she did all \nof her audiences.\n  Sojourner Truth dedicated her life to achieving equality. She \nconsidered herself to be on a sojourn to tell the truth, a sojourn \ndirected by God. It would be a fitting tribute to Sojourner Truth and \nto the truth which she preached, to honor her by depicting her image on \nthe dollar coin, along with her fellow women's rights crusaders, \nElizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony.\n  Along with a number of my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee, \nI filed additional views with the committee report of this legislation, \nindicating our support for the four suffragettes. We also intend to \nmake our views known to Secretary Rubin, who has the authority to \nselect the design of the coin. I urge my colleagues to support this \neffort to ensure that the mistake made in 1921 is rectified and that \nSojourner Truth can take her rightful place with the other suffragettes \nwho fought for equal rights for all Americans.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1632\n\n       (Purpose: To make an amendment relating to coinage.)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Coats has an \namendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama Mr. Sessions, for Mr. Coats, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1632.\n       On Page 8, line 11, strike ``clad''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be agreed to, the committee amendment be agreed to, the bill \nbe considered read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1631 and 1632) were agreed to.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1228), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``50 States Commemorative Coin \n     Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is appropriate and timely--\n       (A) to honor the unique Federal republic of 50 States that \n     comprise the United States; and\n\n[[Page S12433]]\n\n       (B) to promote the diffusion of knowledge among the youth \n     of the United States about the individual States, their \n     history and geography, and the rich diversity of the national \n     heritage;\n       (2) the circulating coinage of the United States has not \n     been modernized during the 25-year period preceding the date \n     of enactment of this Act;\n       (3) a circulating commemorative 25-cent coin program could \n     produce earnings of $110,000,000 from the sale of silver \n     proof coins and sets over the 10-year period of issuance, and \n     would produce indirect earnings of an estimated \n     $2,600,000,000 to $5,100,000,000 to the United States \n     Treasury, money that will replace borrowing to fund the \n     national debt to at least that extent; and\n       (4) it is appropriate to launch a commemorative circulating \n     coin program that encourages young people and their families \n     to collect memorable tokens of all of the States for the face \n     value of the coins.\n\n     SEC. 3.
