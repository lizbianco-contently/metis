Madam President, last week I received a letter from the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] on the subject of a task \nforce which he had been asked to chair convened by the Council on \nForeign Relations on the subject of Russia, its neighbors, and an \nenlarging NATO.\n  Senator Lugar's letter discusses the highlights of the findings and \nagreements that were reached by this impressive task force made up of \nexperts on foreign policy and national security. I think it is \nimportant for the Senate to consider and review carefully the task \nforce report and the information in that as we are beginning serious \nconsideration now in the Foreign Relations Committee and soon in this \nChamber proposals for the enlargement of NATO. We have already had \nother agreements which have been widely publicized this week--\nthe charter or the framework between Russia and the United States on \nthe subject of NATO enlargement. So it is very timely, in my view, for \nus to begin to get all of the information and all of the viewpoints \nthat we can from those who deserve respect on these issues so we will \nbe fully advised as we are called upon to make decisions on proposals \nfrom the administration.\n\n  In his letter, Senator Lugar points out that ``The Task Force reached \na strong bipartisan consensus that the enlargement of NATO and improved \nNATO-Russia relations need not be incompatible.'' First he pointed out \nthat the goal of this task force ``was to determine whether Russia's \nconcerns could be managed and its internal transition bolstered without \nstopping or slowing NATO enlargement. The Task Force also looked,'' he \nsaid, ``at the security concerns of the Baltic states and Ukraine.''\n  He says the Task Force ``agreed that it is in the United States \ninterest to try to achieve both'' enlargement of NATO and a \nstrengthening of NATO-Russian relations. So we also should ``negotiate \nfrom a position of strength and not allow the NATO Alliance to be held \nhostage in any manner by Moscow. We strongly caution,'' he said, the \nTask Force said, ``that NATO's core mission of collective defense of \nits members--both old and new--not be diluted in any manner.''\n  Other highlights include an urging of the administration and NATO \nallies ``to take very specific steps, to reassure the Baltic states and \nUkraine that they will not be left in a security no-man's land.''\n  And in conclusion, he says the Task Force recommends endorsing \n``NATO's decision to add new, `full' members at the Madrid summit in \nJuly 1997, and suggests the Alliance remain open to the possibility of \nadding more new members in the future.''\n  The Task Force said, and he quotes from their findings:\n\n       We believe that the goal of NATO's enlargement with Russia \n     should not be to provide compensation for enlargement. \n     Rather, it should be to forge a new NATO-Russia relationship \n     that builds on opportunities offered by a new Europe, a \n     Russia in transition and an adapting NATO.\n\n  The Task Force recommended also ``To engage Russia, negotiate a \nformal NATO-Russia charter,'' which is being done, ``and a consultative \nmechanism\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nthat offers both sides incentives to cooperate on shared problems,'' \nand to ``Update Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty,'' which we \napproved this week.\n  In conclusion, he points out that the Task Force suggests that we,\n\n       Reject vigorously any efforts by Moscow to dictate the \n     terms of Baltic or Ukrainian relations with NATO. The Task \n     Force urges the administration and the Alliance to offer \n     special assurances to the three Baltic states and Ukraine, \n     including confirmation that NATO's open-door policy applies \n     to all Partnership for Peace states; increased efforts to \n     include all four countries in Partnership for Peace planning \n     and training exercises; affirmation that the United States \n     shares the aspirations of the Baltic states to become full \n     members of all European institutions; and conclusion of a \n     NATO-Ukraine agreement to deepen practical consideration over \n     the coming years.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nletter from Senator Lugar and the media remarks that he made on May 5 \nat the announcement of the task force findings and report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Thad: There is no more important foreign policy issue \n     today than the future of European security. Our investments \n     now in Europe's future will make a dramatic difference to our \n     own security. NATO's decision to enlarge is a key element of \n     that investment.\n       But so too is our investment in Russia's transition. Our \n     security and the security of every nation in Europe will be \n     affected by whether Russia succeeds or fails in becoming a \n     fully democratic state, at peace with its neighbors and \n     integrated into Europe. Yet Russia's leaders claim the \n     enlargement of NATO is a threat not only to Russian security \n     but also to the success of Russia's transformation.\n       I was recently asked to chair a Council on Foreign \n     Relation's Task Force on the subject of ``Russia, Its \n     Neighbors, and an Enlarging NATO'', and to pull together some \n     of the best minds in the country to look at this dilemma. Our \n     goal was to determine whether Russia's concerns could be \n     managed and its internal transition bolstered without \n     stopping or slowing NATO enlargement. The Task Force also \n     looked at the security concerns of the Baltic states and \n     Ukraine, given their history with Russia, its anxiety about \n     their relations with NATO, and their strong desire for closer \n     ties with NATO.\n       With NATO enlargement imminent, the premise behind this \n     Task Force's deliberations was not ``whether and when'' NATO \n     should expand, but ``how.'' We looked not only at how the \n     Alliance might engage Russia, but also at how the process of \n     enlargement, how NATO's own internal adaptation and how \n     conventional and nuclear arms control, could improve the \n     security climate across Europe, without dangerous concessions \n     to Russia.\n       The Task Force reached a strong bipartisan consensus that \n     the enlargement of NATO and improved NATO-Russia relations \n     need not be incompatible, despite continued Russian \n     opposition to enlargement. We agreed that it is in the U.S. \n     interest to try to achieve both, so long as we negotiate from \n     a position of strength, and do not allow the NATO Alliance to \n     be held hostage in any manner by Moscow. The U.S. and the \n     Alliance can offer Russia reassurances about its security and \n     role in the new Europe that make sense on their own merits, \n     without compromising NATO's effectiveness or independence.\n       In the process, however, we strongly caution that NATO's \n     core mission of collective defense of its members--both old \n     and new--must not be diluted in any manner. As discussions \n     with Russia proceed, the Task Force warns the Administration \n     and the Alliance to remain vigilant regarding Russian efforts \n     to step or stall expansion, to turn NATO into a social \n     club or debating society, or to have a veto over its \n     decisions. We also caution against trying to compensate \n     Russia for expansion with arms control or other \n     concessions.\n       All NATO-Russia and U.S.-Russia political and security \n     arrangements must be reciprocal. We also urge the \n     Administration and our NATO allies to take very specific \n     steps in the coming months and years to reassure the Baltic \n     states and Ukraine that they will not be left in a security \n     no-man's land.\n       The bipartisan Task Force brought together experts on \n     Europe and the former Soviet Union from government, think \n     tanks, universities, and the business community. Participants \n     included Robert Blackwill, former Principal Deputy Assistance \n     Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs and for \n     Political Military Affairs; Richard C. Holbrooke, former \n     Assistant secretary of State for European and Canadian \n     Affairs; William Kristol, Editor of The Weekly Standard \n     magazine; Thomas Pickering, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, \n     Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor; and Robert \n     Zoellick, former Counselor of the State Department and \n     Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs. \n     There was wide agreement among the Task Force participants \n     with the report's major findings and recommendations; \n     additional comments reflecting divergent positions are \n     presented in the report to help frame the dabate.\n       The Task Force calls for a series of measures to address \n     Russia's concerns as NATO enlarges, but states ``we believe \n     that the goal of NATO's engagement with Russia should not be \n     to provide `compensation' for enlargement. Rather, it should \n     be to forge a new NATO-Russia relationship that builds on \n     opportunities offered by a new Europe, a Russia in transition \n     and an adapting NATO.''\n       Among the Task Force's conclusions and recommendations.\n       Endorses NATO's decision to add new, ``full'' members at \n     the Madrid summit in July 1997, and suggests the Alliance \n     remain open to the possibility of adding more new members in \n     the future. The report asserts that an expanded Alliance does \n     not threaten Russia; in fact Russia will benefit from \n     increased European stability.\n       To engage Russia, negotiate a formal NATO-Russia charter \n     and a consultative mechanism that offers both sides \n     incentives to cooperate on shared problems. However, NATO-\n     Russia arrangements must not: stop or slow expansion; give \n     Russia a veto over NATO decisions or dilute the effectiveness \n     of the North Atlantic Council; allow ``second class \n     citizens'' in the Alliance or exclude any Partnership for \n     Peace (PfP) participant from future membership consideration; \n     or preclude any Alliance member from calling for a meeting \n     without Russia present.\n       Update Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty in a way \n     that: eliminates its current bloc-to-bloc character in favor \n     of national limits and reciprocal overall troop reductions \n     and does not make second-class citizens of the new NATO \n     members; does not isolate the Ukraine; does not impinge upon \n     NATO's future ability to extend a full security guarantee to \n     other potential members, and does not set an arbitrary \n     deadline for the conclusion of the treaty negotiations or \n     link them the NATO expansion timetable.\n       Continue to reject vigorously any efforts by Moscow to \n     dictate the terms of Baltic or Ukrainian relations with NATO. \n     The Task Force urges the Administration and the Alliance to \n     offer special assurances to the three Baltic states and \n     Ukraine, including confirmation that NATO's open-door policy \n     applies to all PfP states, increased efforts to include all \n     four countries in PfP planning and training exercises; \n     affirmation that the U.S. shares the aspirations of the \n     Baltic states to become full members of all European \n     institutions; and conclusions of a NATO-Ukraine agreement to \n     deepen practical cooperation over the coming years.\n       I attach a copy of the Task Force Report, along with my \n     summary of its findings and recommendations that I presented \n     at a recent press conference to mark the Report's \n     publication.\n       I recommend both to your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                             Richard G. Lugar,\n\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations NATO Task Force Press Conference: Remarks \n               by U.S. Senator Richard Lugar, May 5, 1997\n\n       I am delighted to have had the opportunity to chair this \n     very distinguished Task Force on ``Russia, its Neighbors and \n     an Enlarging NATO'' and to present its findings to you today.\n       I agreed to chair this group because there is no more \n     important foreign policy issue today than the future of \n     European security. Just as our investments during the Cold \n     War led directly to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the \n     Warsaw Pact, our investments now in Europe's future will make \n     a dramatic difference to our own security. NATO's decision to \n     enlarge is a key element of that investment. But so too is \n     our investment in Russia's transition. Our security and the \n     security of every nation in Europe will be affected by \n     whether Russia succeeds or fails in becoming a fully \n     democratic state, at peace with its neighbors, and integrated \n     into Europe. Yet Russia's leaders claim the enlargement of \n     NATO is a threat not only to Russian security, but also to \n     the success of Russia's transformation.\n       The goal of the Task Force was to pull together some of the \n     best minds in the country to look at this dilemma and to \n     determine whether Russia's concerns could be managed and its \n     internal transition bolstered without stopping or slowing \n     NATO enlargement. We also looked at the security concerns of \n     the Baltic States and Ukraine, given their history with \n     Russia, its anxiety about their relations with NATO and their \n     strong desire for closer ties with NATO.\n       With NATO enlargement imminent, the premise behind this \n     Task Force's deliberations was not ``whether and when'' NATO \n     should expand, but ``how.'' We looked not only at how the \n     Alliance might engage Russia, but also at how the process of \n     enlargement, how NATO's own internal adaptation and \n     conventional and nuclear arms control, could improve the \n     security climate across Europe, without dangerous concessions \n     to Russia.\n       I am pleased to announce that we reached a strong \n     bipartisan consensus that the enlargement of NATO and \n     improved NATO-Russia relations need not be incompatible, \n     despite continued Russian opposition to enlargement. We \n     agreed that it is in the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\n     interest to try to achieve both, so long as we negotiate from \n     a position of strength, and do not allow the NATO Alliance to \n     be held hostage in any manner by Moscow. The U.S. and the \n     Alliance can offer Russia significant reassurances about its \n     security and role in the new Europe that make sense on their \n     own merits, without compromising NATO's effectiveness or \n     independence.\n       In the process, however, we strongly caution that NATO's \n     core mission of collective defense of its members--both old \n     and new--must not be diluted in any manner. As discussions \n     with Russia proceed, the Task Force warns the Administration \n     and the Alliance to remain vigilant regarding Russian efforts \n     to stop or stall expansion, to turn NATO into a social club \n     or debating society, or to have a veto over its decisions. We \n     also caution against trying to compensate Russia for \n     expansion with arms control or other concessions. All NATO-\n     Russia and U.S.-Russia political and security arrangements \n     must be reciprocal. We also urge the Administration and our \n     NATO allies to take very specific steps in the coming months \n     and years to reassure the Baltic states and Ukraine that they \n     will not be left in a security no-man's land.\n       Let me now mention some of our specific recommendations. \n     For a more complete list, I call your attention to the short \n     ``Statement of the Task Force'' which covers the longer \n     report.\n       First, the Task Force endorses NATO's decision to invite \n     new members to join the Alliance at the Madrid summit this \n     July, and its commitment that these will be full members, not \n     ``second-class citizens.''\n       On future enlargement, we recommend that NATO affirm that \n     it remains open to the possibility of other new members. We \n     believe Alliance selection of future members should depend on \n     three factors: (1) The strategic interests of NATO members; \n     (2) the Alliance's perception of threats to security and \n     stability; and (3) future members' success in completing \n     their democratic transitions and in harmonizing their \n     political aims and security policies with NATO's.\n       At the same time, we believe NATO should offer ideas to \n     draw Russia closer to the Alliance to deal with mutual \n     security concerns in a reciprocal fashion, to support \n     Russia's consolidation of a non-imperialist, stable \n     democracy, and to reassure Moscow that we don't seek to \n     isolate or weaken Russia.\n       Specifically, we endorse efforts to negotiate a NATO-Russia \n     charter and a consultative mechanism that offers both sides \n     incentives to cooperate on shared problems. These could \n     include non-proliferation, aggressive nationalism, \n     territorial disputes, security and safety of nuclear weapons, \n     and peacekeeping.\n       That said, we strongly caution the Administration and the \n     Alliance against even the appearance of trying to \n     ``compensate'' Russia for NATO enlargement or allowing Moscow \n     to weaken or hamstring the Alliance in any way. Specifically, \n     NATO-Russia arrangements must not:\n       (1) stop or slow NATO enlargement;\n       (2) NATO-Russia arrangements must not give Russia an actual \n     or de facto veto over NATO decision-making, or the ability to \n     stall or divide the Alliance;\n       (3) NATO-Russia arrangements must not create ``second class \n     citizens'' in the Alliance or exclude any participant in the \n     Partnership for Peace program (PFP) from future consideration \n     for NATO membership;\n       (4) NATO-Russia arrangements must not subordinate NATO to \n     any other decision-making body or organization;\n       (5) NATO-Russia arrangements must not dilute the \n     effectiveness of the North Atlantic Council or preclude any \n     Alliance member from calling for a meeting without Russia \n     present.\n       We also support adaptation of the Conventional Forces in \n     Europe Treaty in a way that will facilitate both NATO \n     enlargement and NATO-Russia cooperation, including \n     eliminating the bloc-to-bloc nature of the treaty in favor of \n     national limits and reducing the amount of equipment the \n     treaty permits all signatories.\n       But we caution the Administration and NATO states, as \n     negotiations proceed, to ensure that all geographic limits \n     are reciprocal, and that future equipment limits do not make \n     de facto ``second class'' citizens of the new Alliance \n     members.\n       We further caution against any agreement that would isolate \n     Ukraine or make it more vulnerable to Moscow's pressure. We \n     urge that the revised limits in no way impinge on NATO's \n     ability to extend a full security guarantee to other \n     potential members in the future.\n       We also argue strenuously against setting an arbitrary \n     deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations or linking \n     such a deadline to the timetable for NATO enlargement.\n       On the nuclear side, the linkage between NATO enlargement \n     and nuclear arms control is clearly more political than \n     strategic. That said, we believe the U.S.-Russian \n     arrangements with regard to START II and START III reached at \n     Helsinki have improved the climate for Russian acceptance of \n     the first tranche of enlargement as well as for Duma \n     ratification of START II, while advancing our own security \n     interests. This will not happen overnight, and probably not \n     before the Madrid Summit in July. But Helsinki represented a \n     good-faith effort on the part of the United States to address \n     some Russian and Duma concerns.\n       Finally, with regard to the Baltic states and Ukraine, we \n     believe the Alliance must continue to reject vigorously any \n     efforts by Moscow to dictate the terms of these countries' \n     relations with NATO, and to exercise a veto over their future \n     membership.\n       We urge the Administration and the Alliance to offer \n     reassurances to the Baltic states and Ukraine that they will \n     not be discriminated against as a result of their history \n     and geography. Such assurances could include:\n       (1) confirmation that NATO's open door policy applies to \n     all Partnership for Peace states, including the Baltics and \n     Ukraine;\n       (2) affirmation that the U.S. recognizes and shares the \n     aspirations of the Baltic states to become full members of \n     all the institutions of Europe including the EU and NATO, and \n     will assist them in this goal;\n       (3) conclusion of a NATO-Ukraine agreement to deepen \n     practical cooperation over the coming years, particularly \n     until Ukraine decides whether or not it will eventually seek \n     Alliance membership; and\n       (4) increased efforts to deepen the involvement of all four \n     countries with NATO through active participation in the \n     Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace.\n       If we proceed in this manner, as recommended by the Task \n     Force, we believe the choice will ultimately be up to Russia \n     to accept the hand of cooperation NATO has offered and to \n     participate in crafting the new Europe, or to isolate itself.\n       Our concluding point is that NATO enlargement and deeper \n     NATO-Russia relations both have value for the United States \n     and the Alliance if they are pursued properly. A zero-sum \n     debate about them therefore misses the point. The best \n     outcome for the United States is for both tracks to succeed. \n     This is also the best outcome for the Baltics and Ukraine \n     that may have to live between an enlarged NATO and Russia for \n     some time to come.\n       Now, before I turn to your questions, I want to say just a \n     word about the deliberations of our group. We met four times \n     between December and March, here in Washington. Overall, I \n     was encouraged by the breadth of consensus we were able to \n     achieve, considering the different perspectives and \n     backgrounds of the individual participants. The caliber of \n     the group was exceptional--so exceptional in fact that, \n     during the course of our deliberations, four of our members \n     were tapped by President Clinton to join the administration \n     in the second term.\n       But, as the attached additional comments and the one \n     dissent by General Scowcroft indicate, there were a couple of \n     important points where views differed significantly. I point \n     these out to you because I think they are instructive about \n     the larger debate in this country and the challenges we will \n     face when NATO enlargement comes up for ratification in the \n     Senate.\n       The most controversial issue for our group was not what \n     should happen this summer at Madrid, but what should happen \n     thereafter to NATO and in Europe. Several of our members are \n     less confident than others that the time will ever be right \n     for a second, third or fourth tranche of NATO enlargement. \n     General Scowcroft and Bob Blackwill call for a formal \n     ``pause'' or breathing space after Madrid. A couple of other \n     members question the Report's support for the Baltic states' \n     aspirations to join NATO eventually.\n       My own personal view is that it would be a huge mistake to \n     declare a formal pause in expansion after Madrid. This would \n     cede precisely the kind of veto over NATO's plans to Moscow \n     that the Report warns against. Making that pause permanent \n     would effectively draw a new line across Europe slightly \n     further east. It would relegate whole parts of Europe to a \n     permanent security gray-zone, and would undermine any \n     incentive those countries' leaders have to make the kinds of \n     democratic changes that Alliance membership demands.\n       While I agree that NATO must proceed cautiously after \n     Madrid and take time absorbing the new members, it is \n     essential that the Alliance make clear at Madrid that the \n     first new members will not be the last. Such a pledge would \n     be particularly important for the Baltic states, which were, \n     after all, also captive nations throughout the Cold War.\n       I endorse strongly all the cautions in the report that \n     NATO's effectiveness as a defensive alliance not be diluted \n     in any way. It is also essential that NATO's new members be \n     full members and not ``second class citizens.'' In that \n     regard, I want to close my comments today by lending my \n     personal endorsement to one of the notes Bob Zoellick \n     appended to the report. He cautions that between Madrid and \n     the formal ratification of enlargement by all sixteen NATO \n     parliaments, the new candidate members must enjoy all the \n     privileges Russia might receive through a NATO-Russia charter \n     and consultative arrangements. It would indeed be ironic, if \n     over the next 2 years, Russia enjoyed closer ties to the \n     Alliance than Poland.\n       I welcome your questions now.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I took time to comment and read some \nexcerpts because in my view this is excellent work, and Senator Lugar \nought to be strongly commended for his leadership not only in chairing \nthis traffic force on these important issues but in his work on the \nForeign Relations Committee in connection with NATO enlargement, United \nStates-Russia relations which are the subject of this work.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n  Madam President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senate Concurrent \nResolution 5, which was introduced by Senator Roth, supporting the \nexpansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because I believe \nthe NATO alliance will be strengthened by including new members and \nthat its capacity to contribute to stability and freedom will be \nenhanced by such expansion.\n  Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 specifically mentions four nations: \nHungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia, which should be \nconsidered for membership in the alliance, but I do not think the \nconsideration of the Foreign Relations Committee should be limited to \nthose countries. Serious consideration should also be given, in my \nopinion, to Romania, and maybe to others as well.\n  The Romanian Government has a record of cooperation with the United \nStates and Western nations. During the Persian Gulf crisis, for \nexample, Romania supported U.N. resolutions imposing sanctions against \nIraq and voted to authorize the United States and other nations to \nenforce the sanctions and liberate Kuwait. In 1993, Romania supported \ncontinuation of a 30-year U.N. embargo against Cuba, and its military \nforces participated in the U.N. action in Angola in 1995.\n  Romania also supported the U.N. trade embargo against the former \nYugoslavia, and following the Dayton accords, it deployed a 200-troop \nbattalion to assist in the NATO-led IFOR mission. Romania has \nparticipated in many Partnership for Peace exercises and was the first \nnation to sign the Partnership for Peace framework document in 1994.\n  The Romanian Government has sought entry into several Western \neconomic and security alliances. In 1993, Romania became an associate \nmember of the European Union, and in 1995, it submitted an application \nto become a full member of the EU. In 1994, Romania became a member of \nthe Council of Europe.\n  The people of Romania strongly support joining the NATO alliance. A \nrecent European Commission poll of 20 Eastern and Central European \nnations shows a higher percentage of Romanians favoring membership in \nNATO than any other prospective new member's citizenry.\n  Since the fall of Romania's Communist government in 1989, the people \nof Romania have made great progress to achieve the goal of democracy, \nby showing respect for the rule of law, moving to a free market \neconomy, and imposing civilian control over the military. By the end of \n1996, Romania had completed a round of elections at all levels of \nGovernment, including both Parliamentary and Presidential elections. \nObservers from the Council of Europe classified the November \nPresidential elections ``reasonably fair and transparent,'' and it \nshould be noted that they resulted in the first peaceful transfer of \npower since 1937. The current political situation is particularly \nremarkable when compared with the regime which held power in 1989.\n  In addition to strengthening the elements common to democracies \nworldwide, the Romanians have directly confronted and worked to abate \nboth internal and external ethnic conflicts. In March of this year, the \nPrime Minister outlined steps the Government will take to ease domestic \nethnic tensions. In an effort to discourage ethnic conflict with \nthe Hungarians living in Romania, the Government negotiated and signed \na treaty with Hungary. The ruling party coalition includes the party \nmost closely associated with ethnic Hungarians. I understand also that \nthe Romanians are nearing the end of treaty negotiations with Ukraine \nover remaining border issues. Both of these cases demonstrate a \nwillingness to settle disputes with its neighbors in a peaceful way. \nNATO Secretary General Solana has cited the programs that Romania, \namong other nations, has made toward resolving outstanding bilateral \ndifferences.\n\n  Including Romania in NATO would enhance European security. Romania's \nmilitary forces are among the largest in Europe. Of the countries \ncurrently being considered for NATO membership, only Romania and Poland \nhave army, navy, and air force capabilities.\n  On the day their Minister of Defense was sworn in, he declared that \none of his administration's highest priorities would be to prepare \nRomania's military for interoperability with existing NATO structures. \nAs a result, Romanians have undertaken strenuous efforts to update \ntheir military equipment and improve their ability to operate in \nconcert with the forces of other nations.\n  Perhaps the most concerted efforts of the Romanian people have been \ndevoted to improving their economy. The results of the last election \ndemonstrated a preference for leaders who favor privatization, freer \nmarkets, and a continuation of reform. Within 3 weeks of the decisive \nPresidential election, senior representatives from the International \nMonetary Fund, the European Union, and the World Bank traveled to \nBucharest to finalize the details of a comprehensive reform package \naimed at reducing inflation, cutting the deficit, and speeding \nprivatization. This plan for reform--released in February--will be \nchallenging for the Romanian Government and its people over the next \nfew years, and the Government has planned certain countermeasures \nduring the transition, such as a strengthening of the welfare program \nin anticipation of temporary unemployment. However, it appears that \nRomania is committed to this economic plan.\n  In August 1996, the United States granted MFN status to Romania, and \nthis year our Department of State reported that 80 percent of Romanian \nfarming and 70 percent of retail sales are being generated by private \nenterprises. This spring the International Monetary Fund announced a \n$400 million loan to Romania. To supplement this IMF assistance and \nsupport the Government's reforms, the European Commission has pledged \n$140 million. Indicators such as these all offer assurance to foreign \ninvestors, whose contributions are important to the growth and \nstability of Romania's economy.\n  Madam President, I am impressed and encouraged by the progress \nRomania has made, and I urge serious consideration of Romania for \ninclusion in NATO. I hope the Foreign Relations Committee will conduct \na full and careful review of Romania's political, economic, and \nmilitary strengths when it considers legislation on NATO expansion.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, are we in a period of morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a period for the transaction \nof routine morning business.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, is each Senator allowed a period of 5 \nto 10 minutes to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia would be permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4625-5", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4628-S4633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, my good colleague from Missouri, \nSenator John Ashcroft, recently introduced legislation that would \nprovide increased opportunities for working parents to spend more time \nwith their families without losing 1 cent in compensation.\n  It is popularly called flextime. It is legislation that allows a \nworker an opportunity to trade time-and-a-half for just time. I think \nit is a very, very important piece of legislation and very timely, \nbecause there have been so many changes in the workplace.\n  This bill would allow employees to choose to work additional hours, \nmore than 40, in one workweek and use those extra hours to fill in for \na shorter workweek later. Or an employee could choose to take time off \nin lieu of overtime pay at a rate of 1\\1/2\\ hours for each hour of \novertime. An employee could also choose to work 80 hours over a 2-week \nperiod in any combination.\n  Here is the important point, Madam President, that all of these \nchoices are voluntary. These flexible options can only be exercised if \nthe employee and employer agree to the concept. None of these choices \nwould result in lower pay, and, in the case of comptime off,\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\nthose hours not used, up to 240 could be cashed in at overtime rate \npay.\n  The point here is no one is being shortchanged. The point is that \neverybody has new flexibility, in terms of managing their workweek.\n  One might have thought that President Clinton would have embraced \nthis initiative wholeheartedly, but, no, President Clinton has \nthreatened to veto these options, to strike down the opportunity for \nthese workers to have these voluntary flexible options. He claims that \nthe legislation will force employees to take time off in lieu of \novertime pay. In other words, the employee would be forced to not \nreceive the overtime pay but to take the time off.\n  Some in the media have repeated this claim and then wrongly insisted \nthat overtime would start only after an employee had worked 80 hours in \n2 weeks, instead of 40 hours in 1 week, which is the current law.\n  There is one thing wrong about these claims that have been made by \nthe President and by some in the media: They are not true. They are not \njust a little off base, but utterly false. The administration and these \nother opponents need to read the bill. I have taken particular notice \nthat critics never actually quote from the bill.\n  Madam President, here is what the bill actually says, and I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of it. The bill allows:\n\n       Employers to offer compensatory time off, which employees \n     may voluntarily elect to receive, and to establish biweekly \n     work programs and flexible credit hour programs, in which \n     employees may voluntarily participate.\n\n  Is that too hard for our critics to figure out? Just in case, here is \nwhat the bill has to say to employers who have other ideas. Employers,\n\n       . . . may not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten \n     or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce, \n     any--\n\n  Any--\n\n       . . . employee for the purpose of interfering with the \n     rights of such employee under this section to elect or not to \n     elect to [participate in one of the programs offered in the \n     bill].\n\n  Madam President, if they do coerce, threaten or intimidate their \nemployees, they are subject to criminal and civil penalties.\n  This is a bill that benefits working parents. The bill has been \nendorsed by Working Women and by Working Mothers magazines and, yes, \nthe New York Times. It does not mandate anything. Some employees may \nlike the new options, others may not. That is the whole point. \nEmployees should be able to decide what is best for them. This \nlegislation ought to be a slam dunk.\n  So why, you might ask, is the legislation even necessary? Because \ncurrent Federal law prohibits such voluntary arrangements for \neverybody, except for Federal employees who have enjoyed these choices \nsince 1978.\n  I am going to repeat that. If you are a Federal employee, the very \noptions and flexibility that we are trying to make available for hourly \nwage workers are already enjoyed by Federal employees that surround \nthis Capitol. But it isn't good enough for the hourly worker in the \nprivate sector.\n  Who would support the status quo? Who wants to leave it the way it \nis? I have already alluded to the fact that the President has \nthreatened to veto any legislation that would provide these \nopportunities and this flexibility. Labor leaders, the labor bosses \noppose it. When you think about it, the kinds of issues that exist \nbetween an employee and employer boil down to just two categories: \nhours of employment and compensation, whether in the form of health \ncare plans, time off, salary, or overtime. If employers and employees \ncan work out these issues by themselves, I believe that these union \nleaders feel they will be out of business.\n  President Clinton has, thus, obliged the unions by producing his own \nproposal, which naturally gives the Secretary of Labor the discretion \nto decide which workers would be extended the kinds of scheduling \nchoices we support. This doesn't meet the laugh test. Perhaps someone \nshould notify the administration the election is over. Ordinary hard-\nworking Americans, not labor bosses and leaders, reelected President \nClinton and returned a Republican majority to Congress. They expect us \nto work together providing choices that allow families more time \ntogether, and that is a very good place to start working together.\n\n  Madam President, I was reading a piece in a recent magazine, and the \narticle is entitled, ``Work and Family Integration.'' I will just quote \na couple paragraphs:\n\n       Economic changes have direct consequences on work and \n     family life. It is increasingly common for all adult family \n     members to spend a greater number of hours at work in order \n     to make up for declining median family incomes . . .\n\n  I might point out that that decline has a lot to do with increasing \ntax burdens on these families.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       to fulfill personal career goals, or to cater to growing \n     workplace demands. Married women with children have entered \n     the labor force in record numbers; they therefore have less \n     time for care-giving in the home. Many parents, both mothers \n     and fathers, feel conflicted and torn between spending time \n     with their families and meeting workplace demands. Work and \n     family life should not be in opposition, but should enrich \n     each other.\n\n  That is exactly what this legislation attempts to do. It attempts to \nmake the workplace adjustable so that families who have these new and \nadded pressures can make changes voluntarily to suit the requirements \nand needs of their families.\n  When I first arrived here, there was a great hue and cry that the \nCongress operated under a different set of laws than American families \nand businesses. The new majority changed that. The Congress now lives \nunder the same laws as the rest of the land. It is time that the hourly \nwage workers in America received the same breaks as the Federal workers \nin their Capital City, and this is the legislation that ought not to be \nfilibustered and ought to be passed and sent to the workplace as a new \noption and opportunity for American workers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from Georgia \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I want to thank, first of all, the Senator from \nGeorgia. I appreciate his work. Incidentally, I ask unanimous consent \nthat his time be charged against the time under my control from 10:30 \nto 11 o'clock, and other reservation of time be restored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The opponents of this bill, who don't want to let us \neven have a chance to vote on it, voted to stop us from even voting, to \nkeep us from getting cloture and moving to a vote, have indicated that \nthey have an alternative. They want to increase the amount of family \nand medical leave, and they call our bill the Paycheck Reduction Act.\n  Will the Senator clarify for me, now, under family and medical leave, \nwhat kind of time off is that and do you get paid when you take that \ntime off?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You absolutely don't, but I would make an even greater \ndistinction. Your legislation, which I have been proud to coauthor, and \nI commend the work of the Senator from Missouri, as I did before the \nSenator arrived, leaves the decision about what families need and don't \nneed to the families, the workers themselves.\n\n  The alternatives proposed--and there are several. One is to turn the \ndecision over to Secretary Shalala. I think that is a pretty big job to \ntry to figure out what the millions of working families need and don't \nneed. I think she might not be up to that. Or to try to construct \nFederal law that manages time off, which may or may not deal with the \ncircumstances of a family, and, no, it would not be pay.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So their proposal is, if you want to take time off with \nyour family, you have to take a pay cut to do it?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Correct, and the Senator's proposal doesn't cost them \none penny.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So you could make up the time under the flextime or \ncomptime provisions, take time with your family and not take the pay \ncut.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Georgia started to make the point, \nthough, that is also important, which is this flextime and comptime \nopportunity isn't just for specific things with your family. If you \nwanted to\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\ntake this time off once you have earned it--\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You could go fishing.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. You can do what?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You could go fishing.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I can go fishing. I believe I might.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You can go camping. You might have an emergency you \nare dealing with. You might have a graduation. Again, the point I am \nmaking is the principal distinction, and it appears so often between \nour two sides, is that the legislation of the Senator from Missouri \nleaves the choice to the worker and his or her family, the choice about \ntime-and-a-half or trading the time-and-a-half.\n  Their view is that it has to be managed by the Government or by \nSecretary Shalala. I just don't think they can figure out what the \nrequirements and needs are of each one of those workers all across the \nland from Missouri to Georgia to Nome, AK.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator pointed out that the Federal Government \nworkers have had this full range of options now for almost 20 years. \nHas the Senator from Georgia had a lot of Federal Government workers \nstreaming into his office to say, ``Please, take us out from under this \nsystem, it's a problem to us''?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. To the contrary. Imagine the hue and cry if the way we \nwere to equalize this was to remove that option from Federal employees \nso that they would be treated like these other hourly workers. Talk \nabout a hailstorm. They have enjoyed the benefit, and no one that I \nknow of has issued the first complaint about those flexible options \nthat are enjoyed by Federal employees.\n  I mentioned a moment ago that when we came here, the Congress \nfunctioned under a different set of laws than American businesses. Now \nwe have the Congressional Accountability Act, and we have put Congress \nunder the same confines. It is time to let the private hourly workers \nenjoy the same benefits as Federal employees.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is not just Federal employees.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Salaried, and those in the boardrooms.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. All the corporate presidents, all the salaried workers, \nand the Government workers have comp or flextime, but the hourly \nworkers, who are a minority of the workers in this country; less than \nhalf of the workers, do not have this. The other folks all have it.\n  I thank the Senator for coming to the floor to talk about this.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Missouri. He is a very \neloquent spokesperson on this issue. I do think anything we can do that \nmakes it easier for families to be in the workplace--we know they are \nunder enormous duress today, with both parents working--anything we can \ndo to make it more manageable for them we ought to do. Your bill, our \nbill, lowering their taxes, all of these things need to happen in \nworking America.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his contribution \nto this debate and his insight. In fact, the insight which is most \nvaluable is that families have the capacity intellectually, and ought \nto have the capacity legally, to make decisions about their own family \nand not to have Government trying, from 1,000 miles away, to tell you \nwhether or not you should be able to do something or not with your kids \nor whether or not you should be able to take time off to meet your own \npersonal needs.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Absolutely. Thank you.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has until 11:30.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I want to talk about benefits that people enjoy as \nworkers in America, benefits which are enjoyed by Federal workers, \nbenefits which are enjoyed by State workers, benefits which are enjoyed \nby executives, by supervisors, by managers, benefits which are enjoyed \nby all salaried workers, but benefits which do not inure to the \nadvantage of individuals who work by the hour.\n  There are about 59 million people in this country who work by the \nhour; 28.9 million women who work by the hour. These are the \nindividuals who do not have the flexibility to adjust their schedules. \nThey do not have the capacity to say, ``I'm going to take Friday \nmorning off and work a little extra Monday afternoon.'' They do not \nhave the ability to say, ``I need to quickly take a few minutes away \nhere. I need to go to the school and pick up my child who needs to be \ntaken to the doctor's office.'' They do not have that capacity.\n  The majority of Americans do have that benefit. Far more, millions \nmore, people have that benefit than those who do not. But the hourly \npaid workers do not.\n  If you work for the Federal Government, you can schedule your \nworkweek to get an extra day off every other week while keeping a full \npaycheck. If you took Friday off every other week in the same way and \nyou are not in the Federal Government, you are going to find yourself \nshort on cash. If you are an hourly worker in the private sector, you \njust cannot do it; you do not have that benefit.\n  If you work for the Federal Government, you can choose compensatory \ntime; in other words, take time off with pay later on instead of being \npaid time and a half when you have been asked to work overtime. You do \nnot have that choice, you cannot make that choice if you are an hourly \nworker in the private sector. It is against the law for your employer \nto say to you, ``Well, if you'd really rather have time and a half off \nlater with pay instead of taking paid time and a half for your overtime \nnow, I'll do that for you.'' Then the employer is in violation, the \nemployer suffers the penalty, the heavy hand of law enforcement, and \nthe Government comes down on him if he does that.\n  It simply is something that cannot be done for people in the hourly \ncategory in the private sector. The boardroom, yes. If the boardroom \nboys want to go play golf, they want to have Friday off, they have \nflexibility. The salaried workers have the flexibility. Government \nworkers have that kind of flexibility. But private, hourly paid \nemployees, whether they be men or women, they do not have it. It is not \nfair.\n  If you work for the Federal Government, you can bank hours 1 week, \nyou can work a couple hours extra this week in order to take a couple \nhours off next week. That sounds reasonable. It is something that \npeople could do to adjust to the needs of their families.\n  If there is an awards assembly at the school, if there are PTA \nconferences, if you need to get your driver's license renewed, you have \nto retake the test, or just have to have your eyes checked and you have \nto do it during the hours when government offices are open, the \ndepartment of motor vehicles, you need to do that, if you are a \nGovernment worker, you can put a couple hours in comptime this week and \ntake the time off next week. Or, of course, if you are a manager or \nboardroom executive or a salaried worker, that is something that can be \ndone.\n\n  But your employer cannot trade 2 hours this week for 2 hours next \nweek if you are an hourly worker. That is a benefit that people in the \ngovernmental system enjoy. It is a benefit to be able to bank some \nhours this week and take them off next week. It is a benefit to be able \nto use time off and take compensatory time off with pay instead of \nbeing paid the time-and-a-half overtime, take compensatory time and a \nhalf off without losing pay.\n  It is a benefit to be able to schedule your workweek so that you can \ntake Friday off every other week the way Federal employees can. These \nare benefits which belong to the majority of the members of the work \nforce in our culture which do not belong to hourly workers.\n  What S. 4 is all about is providing an opportunity for hourly workers \nto have some of the same benefits that have been available to \nindividuals in other quadrants of the culture. Private-sector workers \nhave fewer benefits than Government workers.\n  I think a lot of folks, when they have worked in the private sector--\ncertainly I knew that--they work just as hard. Private-sector families \nneed moms and dads just as much as public-sector families do. Private-\nsector kids play soccer. Private-sector kids get in trouble and need \nthe folks to show up at the\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nschool to get them out of trouble and help straighten them out. My mom \ncame to school occasionally when I did not want her to, but it helped \nme, and I am glad she was able to. Private-sector workers need the \nbenefit of being able to do those kinds of things.\n  Now, I do not understand how Senators can be for flextime and \ncomptime for public-sector workers and not be for flextime and comptime \nfor private-sector workers. S. 4 is just trying to give to people in \nthe private sector the same benefit that these Senators have provided \nfor their public-sector employees--the same choices.\n  I have not had a single Government worker come to me and say, ``Wow, \nthese choices are terrible. I wish we didn't have choices like flexible \nscheduling. I sure wish I didn't have the capacity to bank an hour this \nweek and take it off next week. I really wish I didn't have the \nopportunity to schedule so that I had every other Friday off. And, man, \nI hate this concept of being able myself to choose whether I wanted the \nmoney from overtime work or I wanted to take time and a half off with \npay at some other time.''\n  I have been here now for--well, I am in my third year, and have not \nhad the first Federal worker knock on my door and say, ``It's terrible \nto have this kind of flexibility,'' and I don't think I ever will. As a \nmatter of fact, when people were interviewed in the system by the \nGeneral Accounting Office, at a 10-to-1 ratio they said this was the \nbest thing since sliced bread. This is what people need. This is a way \nfor people to accommodate the demands of their families.\n  Incidentally, people all need to take time off. Everybody knows there \nare going to be demands that will require you to take some time off. \nThe question is, are you going to be able to be paid for it? You know, \nmost of the time when you have to take time off to be with your family, \nthat is when you need the money.\n  Folks on the other side of the aisle say we should have more family \nand medical leave. That is leave without pay. I ask a simple question \nto my colleagues, and it should be easy--this is what we call a ``no \nbrainer''--when you take your kid to the doctor, do you need more money \nor less money than if you are not taking your kid to the doctor?\n  In my experience, if I have to take my child to the doctor or to the \ndentist, I have a need for additional resources, not fewer resources. \nIf all I get offered by Government is a plan that says you can take a \npay cut if you want to take your kid to the doctor--wait a second, it \nrelieves the tension I feel within me, I do need to be able to take my \nchild to the doctor, but if I have to take a pay cut to do it, how am I \ngoing to pay the doctor?\n  We have a system that is in place where the benefits are available to \nthe Federal worker, the benefits are available to the boardroom, the \nbenefits are available to those who are salaried workers. We include \nthis kind of flexibility, not taking pay cuts, but a capacity to meet \nthe needs of your family without having your paycheck docked. I think \nit ought to be available to private workers.\n  You know, not one that I know of of the employees of the Federal \nGovernment have come to me or any other Senator saying ``It's a \nterrible system. We ought to abandon it.'' There are 56 Senators who \nare still in the U.S. Senate who supported flexible scheduling benefits \nfor Federal workers, and they are refusing to give these benefits to \nthe millions of sales clerks, secretaries, factory workers, the kind of \nhourly individuals, mechanics across our country. We have a lot of \nfolks here in this Senate who gave it to the Government workers.\n\n  Now, not all the 56 are refusing. I should not say that. If I did, I \nmisspoke and I need to be corrected, because there are a number of \nSenators on this side of the aisle who voted for that and who have \nsaid, yes, it was good for Government, and it would be good for the \npeople in the private sector to have these choices. It is totally \nvoluntary at the option of the worker and cannot be done unless it is \nalso voluntary by the employer; otherwise, the same system stays in \nplace that is in place right now.\n  But when employers and employees can agree, we ought to have these \nbenefits for the people in the private sector just like this benefit is \navailable to people in the public sector. There are 56 Senators still \nin this body who voted to give it to people in the public sector.\n  How can you be for bigger benefits for Federal workers, but fewer \nbenefits for the people who work by the hour and who pay our salaries \nwhen they pay their taxes? It seems to me to be an irony which is \nstrange indeed that we would say to those who pay our salaries, who \nhire us to represent them in this town to do what they need to have \ndone--and we make second-class citizens of those whom we represent and \nthose who pay us to be here. It is inconceivable.\n  Some people say, well, we need to protect the workers. We have built \nprotections into this. Those who are saying that we need to protect the \nworkers in the private sector, let us find out what kind of protections \nthey put in when they voted for the workers to have this flexibility in \nthe public sector. It is kind of interesting.\n  In the public sector, workers can be required to participate as a \ncondition of employment. Participation is strictly voluntary, it cannot \nbe required in comptime under our bill.\n  They say we have to protect the private-sector workers. They did not \ndemand that protection when they issued this whole set of opportunities \nfor public-sector people.\n  They say we have to protect workers from management. Did they say \nthat when they put the public-sector program in place? Management can \ndecide when a worker must use comptime. What we have put in our bill, \nworkers cannot be coerced into using their comptime. Penalties are \ndoubled for direct or indirect coercion.\n  It is hard for me to understand how people could say we need tougher \npenalties than this when they invented this program for the public \nsector and they authorized management to make the decision.\n  Here is another benefit.\n  Comptime paid in cash only when the worker leaves the job in the \npublic sector. What have we done for private-sector workers to try to \nprotect them? Comptime must be cashed out any time it is requested by \nthe worker; must be cashed out at the end of the year if it has not \nbeen used.\n  Was that something that they felt was an important protection when \nthey voted for the system in the public sector? Comptime paid in cash \nonly when the worker leaves the job. The worker had to quit if he \nwanted the money.\n  I think what we have here is a clear situation where we need to give \nprivate-sector workers the same benefits which people in the public \nsector have been enjoying. I agree that we want to have them protected. \nBut as Shakespeare, I think, said in one of the plays, ``I think he \ndoth protest too much.''\n  They are asking for a full range of protections saying, ``I can't do \nthat in the private sector because you don't have private-sector \nprotections.'' Well, we have big enough protections in every case for \nthe private worker in this bill than they demanded when they passed \nthis for the public sector in the bill which now controls the public-\nsector effort.\n  It is pretty clear to me S. 4 would give private hourly workers real \nchoices. They are real choices with protections. They are protections \nwhich are much stronger than anything that was written into the bill by \nthose Senators who wrote in the public sector framework.\n  It is high time we stop having an approach which tries to \ndiscriminate against the private hourly workers. It is high time we \nsaid that the benefits that have been available in the public sector \nshould be available to those in the private sector who work by the \nhour. The benefits that have been available to the vast majority of \nAmerican workers, public sector, salaried workers, the boardroom folks, \nthe managers, and the supervisors, those benefits need to be available \nto the individuals who, as a matter of fact, work by the hour in this \ncountry.\n  We should give them the opportunity to choose a set of benefits that \nhave not been rejected when available to the private-sector workers. \nThey have been embraced by public-sector workers.\n  We are for protecting workers. Senator Kennedy has argued our bill \ndoes not protect workers. Senator Kennedy was a cosponsor of the \npublic-sector\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\nbill. He was a conferee on the committee, and it did not provide the \nprotections in the public sector which we have in the private sector. \nIt did not give workers the same kind of choices. I think it is time \nfor us to say, ``Let's be reasonable,'' and understand for private- and \npublic-sector workers we have to provide the capacity for people to \nmeet the needs of their families if we want America to be successful in \nthe next century.\n  This debate can be talked about as if it is a debate about theory, \nabout law, and about benefits. In fact, this is a debate about people. \nThis is a debate about families. Are we going to give people the \ncapacity to have families that are as successful as possible?\n  Let me just talk to you about a young woman named Kim Buchanan, from \nSt. Louis, MO, a crisis clinician at the Meritz Behavioral Care \nfacility in St. Louis, MO. Her husband is a Federal employee at the \nveterans hospital in St. Louis. Her husband enjoys the benefits of \nflextime. They have a son who is 3 years old. Like many American \nfamilies, Kim Buchanan and her husband, Rocky, both work full time. Kim \njust landed a new job which requires her to work on shift hours through \nthe week. She must also work weekends. She now needs to find a new day \ncare provider for her children while she tries to keep up with her new \nwork schedule. Fortunately, the Buchanans are getting some help from \nRocky's new employer, the Federal Government. Yes, what the Federal \nGovernment provides is flexible working arrangements. He is allowed to \nwork flexible schedules in order to keep up with some of the family's \nactivities. That means Rocky can work a few more hours one week in \norder to take some time off, with pay, at a later date.\n  Now, here is a statement that Kim Buchanan made:\n\n       Rocky will pick up our son on Monday, Tuesday, and \n     Wednesday. Those are the days I'm going to have him in day \n     care. Rocky has flextime at his job. I would like to see that \n     everyone has it. I don't work for the Federal Government, and \n     it would be nice to have that kind of flexibility especially \n     when you have children. It would be really nice to have that \n     kind of flexibility instead of putting one parent in the \n     bind.\n\n  I think Kim is right. Kim has a pretty dramatic situation. Her \nhusband works for the Federal Government and is privileged to have \nflexible work arrangements. She works in private industry and it is \nillegal for her employer to cooperate with her. I wonder what her \nchildren think? Daddy works for the Government and gets special \nprivileges, and Mommy works for the private sector and it is illegal \nfor the private sector to help families the way the public sector does.\n  Virtually everything we do has some function of being a teacher and \nteaching us. I do not know what we are teaching kids when we tell them \nthat it is illegal and wrong for private businesses to help families \nthe way the Government does by giving flexible work arrangements. When \nyou have Kim and her husband, Rocky, and one can be flexible and have \ngood arrangements and offer choices because he works for the \nGovernment, and Kim, who works for the private sector, would be in \nviolation of the law to participate in such a plan, it just does not \nmake a lot of sense.\n  Let me talk about another individual. Here is Leslie Langford, a \nsecretary in Massachusetts. Her husband is a printer. They have a son \nwho is about to have his first birthday and a daughter who is 5 years \nold.\n  Listen to what Leslie says:\n\n       I've been an hourly employee for the past 14 years. As a \n     full-time employee and a mother of two young children, \n     including an 11-month-old, time is one of the most valuable \n     commodities in my life, and I can't afford to waste any of \n     it. Like many of you, I find it a challenge to juggle the \n     needs of my employer and my family. Luckily I work for a boss \n     in a company that makes this great balancing act a little \n     easier to manage; I strongly support the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act. This legislation would give millions of \n     workers the flexibility to be with their families when they \n     are needed most. Family friendly legislation such as this \n     is not only desperately needed but long overdue in this \n     country to benefit working parents and their children.\n\n  I am sure if you were to ask Leslie Langford if she thought \nGovernment workers should have a range of benefits that private workers \ndid not have, that there could be rules for Government workers that \nsaid it was OK to have choices about flextime and comptime, and to \nspend time with your family for Government workers, but it would be \nillegal to do that for the private sector, I suspect Leslie would say, \nhow can that be? And the entirety of this country is saying how can \nthat be? Why can we not allow hourly-paid workers in the private \nsector, who are a minority of the workers in this country, why can we \nnot allow them some of the benefits enjoyed by public-sector workers \nand many of the salaried private workers across the country?\n  Here is an interesting letter that came to my office from a 25-year-\nold single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters. Listen to this letter \nfrom a single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters. She says,\n\n       Recently I heard of your Family Friendly Workplace Act. My \n     employer does not allow a flexible work schedule or overtime. \n     My understanding of this act is that I will be able to have \n     flexibility in my work schedule giving me the opportunity to \n     make up work hours lost because of illness in the family and \n     doctor appointments.\n\n  Now her employer cannot offer flexible work schedules and overtime \nlike we have in the public sector. It is illegal. That is not a hit on \nher employer, it is just that we said this benefit that you might want \nto be able to share with your employers--you cannot do that.\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       As a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old \n     daughters--[she has her hands full]--the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act would be extremely beneficial to my situation. \n     My children were born with a congenital heart disease and \n     they need to attend checkup appointments on a 3-month basis, \n     with a cardiologist. These appointments have to allow a full \n     day, since our specialist is in Springfield, MO, and \n     especially because both of my children attend the \n     appointments. Also, since my children have a heart disease \n     they need special attention if they are ill.\n       As a single mother, it is very difficult to lose any days \n     financially. [I bet it is] The opportunity to make up any \n     lost work days would be incredibly helpful. The Family \n     Friendly Workplace Act would give me the opportunity to take \n     time off from work, without the loss of pay because of those \n     days my children are ill or need to attend a doctor's \n     appointment.\n       Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and your \n     consideration of the many working parents who would \n     appreciate such an act. Please go forward with the Family \n     Friendly Workplace Act.\n\n  ``Please go forward.'' I think that means don't filibuster. I think \nit means get to a vote on this act. I think it means share the same \nbenefits with those of us in the private sector who are needed \ndesperately by our families as you already allow for people who work \nfor the Federal Government, the boardroom already enjoys, as salaried \nemployees already enjoy, as the majority of workers in America already \nenjoy, please address the needs of those of us who are in the minority \nhere, the hourly-paid workers in the private sector.\n  Madam President, we have a great opportunity to serve the people of \nthis country, to let them make choices. We have developed a framework \nfor that choice, which is a solid framework that protects the worker. \nIt protects the worker far more profoundly than the workers who are \nprotected in the public system, and there are no complaints in the \npublic system, virtually no complaints. I do not know if the Presiding \nOfficer has ever had a Federal worker rush in and say, ``This is a \nterrible system which gives us flextime--abolish.'' I doubt, seriously, \nif that has been the case.\n\n  We have built more protections into this bill for the private sector \nthan there are for the public sector, and the 56 Senators in this body, \nincluding many on the other side of the aisle, and the lead opponent on \nthe other side of aisle against this measure is the Senator from \nMassachusetts. He was a cosponsor of the measure which provided \nbenefits to public-sector workers and a cosponsor of that measure which \ndoes not provide nearly the same protections for workers. I think it is \ntime for us to confess that if benefits are available to the public \nsector they ought to be available in the private sector.\n  My grandfather used to say ``God is no respecter of persons.'' People \nare the same, they have the same challenges. Public-sector workers have \nfamilies and they need to be able to spend time with their families and \nthey can with the special law that we have for them. Salaried workers \nneed to, and\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\nthe law allows that. The boardroom boys need to do that for whatever \nthey need to do when they leave early. But salaried workers and \nboardroom folks and Government workers are special citizens compared to \nhourly workers. I think just as God is no respecter of persons, we \nshould not be a respecter of persons that says one category of American \nworkers has the freedom to help their family, and for others it is \nillegal. I think that ought to cause us all to cringe, and I think the \nones that ought to be cringing the most are the ones that have provided \nit, voted to provide it, even without protections to the public sector \nwho are saying now we cannot provide that to the private sector until \nwe make it so cumbersome it would not work.\n  Madam President, we have a great opportunity to help the families of \nAmerica help each other. The success of this Nation is not going to be \ndetermined by what happens in Washington, DC. The success of this \nNation will be determined around the kitchen table in American homes. \nThat is where values are built. That is where we develop the kind of \ncharacter that really determines the future of a country. We have to do \nwhat we can to make the homes as strong as possible, and we cannot have \na group of American workers that are--they are a minority of the \nworkers. It is clear the majority already have flexible work \narrangements. We cannot have the 59 million American workers say, \n``Your home is not important enough. You could not make this decision. \nYou are not bright enough.'' The truth of the matter is they deserve \nthe opportunity to have flexible working arrangements to choose \ncompensatory time off instead of overtime if they want it, and then to \nchange their mind if they want and to ask for the money instead.\n  I think the great opportunity we have is something we can capitalize \non next week. I look forward to voting on it at that time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4628-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4633-S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the American workplace has changed \ndrastically since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act--nearly \n60 years ago. In those days, for example, a small percentage of working \nmothers toiled in the fields, factories, and general stores. Today, \nnearly 70 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 are now \nworking.\n\n  The constant refrain of both mothers and fathers in the nineties is: \n``There's just not enough hours in the day.''\n  Well, the U.S. Senate can't put more hours in a day, but we can give \nworkers more choices on how to spend those hours each day.\n  The time has come to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act.\n  Taking a look at this bill that Senator Ashcroft has so skillfully \nput together and advocated. I think that the Family Friendly Workplace \nAct is one of the best opportunities we've had in a long time to make a \nsubstantial contribution to America's working families. This bill is \nbased on the comments and experiences of men and women who know the \ndifficulty of balancing work and family.\n\n  Recently, a good friend of mine, Bill Stone, from Louisville, KY, my \nhometown, testified in support of S. 4 at a hearing before the \nEmployment and Training Subcommittee of the Labor Committee upon which \nI serve. Bill runs the Louisville Plate Glass Co. Approximately three-\nfourths of this company's Louisville work force is paid on an hourly \nbasis and would be directly impacted by S. 4.\n  As Bill explained to our subcommittee, he said, ``S. 4 will give a \nnew and greatly needed measure of flexibility to our employees who are \ntrying to meet the demands of raising children in single-parent or two-\nworker families. It will also,'' Bill stated, ``be a huge benefit to \nour employees who are pursuing training or educational activities.''\n  Now, let us take a look, Mr. President, at the compensatory time off \nprovided for under the bill. If an employee at the Louisville Plate \nGlass Co. has to work overtime, then compensatory time off allows him \nto choose if he wants to be compensated with time-and-a-half pay or \ntime-and-a-half time off.\n  A recent poll by Money magazine found that 66 percent of the American \npeople would rather have their overtime in the form of time off than in \nhourly wages. And an astonishing 82 percent of people support \nlegislation to allow workers to have this type of choice and \nflexibility.\n  The findings of this survey point to one conclusion, as explained by \nAnn Reilly Dowd of Money magazine. She put it this way. She said, \n``People are considering time much more precious than money right \nnow.'' And that is an enormous change in our society, Mr. President. \nMoreover, as Ms. Dowd concluded, ``it seems that people are working so \nhard and being so torn between the mounting demands of their job and \ntheir family life that they really, really want more free time and \nthey, particularly, want more flexible schedules.''\n  The Senate has a responsibility to respond to this overwhelming \nnational need for choice and flexibility in the workplace.\n  Passing comptime legislation is just the first step in our response. \nUnfortunately, comptime alone is not enough. A bill that only includes \ncomptime provisions will only include a small percentage of workers who \nactually work overtime.\n  S. 4 also includes two important provisions for workers who typically \ndo not get the opportunity to work overtime. In most cases these \nworkers are women.\n  For example, nearly three out of four workers reporting overtime pay \nare\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\nmen. In order to accommodate working mothers, as well as other \nemployees who do not regularly work overtime, S. 4 includes the \nbiweekly work program and the flexible credit hours program.\n  If a working mother chooses to work 45 hours in week 1 so that she \ncan work 35 hours the next week and have 5 hours to spend on a school \nfield trip with her children, then the biweekly work program allows her \nto do that without sacrificing either pay or vacation time. Or if an \nemployee chooses to work extra time in any one workweek, then flexible \ncredit hours allows him or her to put those additional hours in the \nbank, so to speak, and take paid time off at a later date.\n  Compensatory time off, the biweekly work program and flexible credit \nhours have two things in common: choice and paid time off. Simply put, \nthis bill just makes good sense. It is about nothing more than giving \noptions to employees.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act gives employees the opportunity to \nget paid time off at virtually no cost to the employer. Everybody wins.\n  The opponents of the Family Friendly Workplace Act argue that our \ncountry's employees will not be able to handle this flexibility. The \nskeptics argue that the employees will be coerced.\n  First, let me say, Government employees have had comp and flextime \nprivileges for years--Government employees have had that right--and \nthere is virtually no hard evidence to support the potential horror \nstories conjured up by opponents of S. 4.\n  Second, our bill contains strong penalties for any employer who \nforces an employee to accept time over money.\n  Diane Buster, an hourly employee from my hometown of Louisville, KY, \nrecently spoke very passionately to the need for S. 4. She explained \nthat\n\n       . . . for the last 15 years I have been in the full-time \n     work force bound by an archaic law, the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act, passed in 1938 when only about 20 percent of women \n     worked . . . [Under this law], the privilege of compensatory \n     time is denied to hourly employees in private business while \n     it is permitted to salaried employees in the private sector \n     and to employees of the Federal Government.\n\n  Ms. Buster ultimately concluded that ``this seems patently unfair and \nsmacks of elitism, if not discrimination. A vote for fairness seems in \norder.''\n  The Paducah Sun in my State issued a similar statement a few weeks \nago in an editorial that concluded that ``the comp time bill ought to \nbe passed * * * The language guarantees the right of workers to take \novertime pay if they desire, so labor's objection that the companies \ncan't be trusted is only so much old-school us-against-them thinking.''\n\n  Finally, I would like to point out that in Government settings union \nleaders routinely demand that employers allow flexible scheduling \nprovisions as part of a collective bargaining agreement. I must confess \nthat it strikes me as a little bit odd that union leaders are now \nfighting to block all hourly employees from receiving the very benefit \nthey seek for their own union employees.\n  In the words of The Courier-Journal, which is our largest State \nnewspaper, ``[Comptime] looks like a win-win situation. Workers and \nemployers would get more flexibility in working out schedules, and \nneither side would be forced to participate. What's Bill Clinton scared \nof?'' said the Courier-Journal.\n  The answer to that newspaper's question, sadly enough, may be that \nthe President and the union bosses are simply playing politics at the \nexpense of the American worker.\n  The presidents of the UAW, the Steelworkers, and the Machinists wrote \na letter to President Clinton on April 28 of this year that sums up the \npolitics which threaten to block S. 4. I would like to quote from that \nletter. This is what the union bosses had to say:\n\n       Politically, any compromise with Senate Republicans on the \n     comp time legislation . . . would undermine the Democratic \n     Party's political base among working men and women, and \n     jeopardize our ability to energize workers to achieve the \n     goal of electing a Democratic House and Senate [in 1998].\n\n  That pretty well says it all, Mr. President. That pretty well says it \nall. You have to give them points for candor.\n  Mr. President, there may be some valid arguments out there for \ngenuine debate on S. 4, but it is surely not those arguments. We should \nnot block legislation that is good for the American worker and the \nAmerican workplace simply because it may ``undermine the Democratic \nParty's political base'' and ``jeopardize [the] ability to energize \n[campaign] workers.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statements of Bill \nStone and Diane Buster and the editorials of the Paducah Sunday and the \nCourier Journal be printed in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by William A. Stone Before the Subcommittee on Employment and \n                      Training, February 13, 1997\n\n       My name is William A. Stone, I am President of Louisville \n     Plate Glass Company in Louisville, Kentucky. We are the \n     majority stockholder in two Atlanta glass manufacturing \n     firms, Tempered Glass, Inc. and Insulating Glass of Georgia. \n     I am the Chief Executive Officer of both Atlanta companies. \n     Louisville Plate Glass is a member of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing an underlying membership of more than three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, \n     and region. I am a member and former Chairman of the \n     Chamber's Labor Relations Committee. I also served on the \n     Chamber's Small Business Council and Board of Directors for \n     five years.\n       Our companies manufacture architectural glass products \n     primarily for commercial buildings and employ about 116 \n     people in three locations. I purchased the Louisville Plate \n     Glass Company 25 years ago. We had only 19 employees at the \n     time. Now, approximately 110 people are employed by these \n     companies, with about 40 working in Louisville and the others \n     in Atlanta. Approximately three-fourths of the Louisville \n     workforce are paid on an hourly basis and record their work \n     hours on a time clock. They are primarily production workers, \n     truck drivers, and shipping personnel.\n       The average Louisville employee usually works about 10 \n     overtime hours per week. The truck drivers usually work more \n     overtime hours than the employees in the plant. Our hourly \n     employees are scheduled to work five days per week and, when \n     extra work is necessary, they prefer to work longer days \n     during the week than to work on Saturday. However, sometimes \n     it is necessary to schedule some employees to work on a \n     Saturday. If an employee is unable to report for work, he or \n     she must use accumulated vacation time or other paid time \n     off, if any is available.\n       We have had few, employees ask to take time off without \n     pay, and instead be scheduled or allowed to work extra hours \n     during the same pay period as their absence in order to earn \n     the pay they would have received had they not missed work. \n     They do not even bother to ask for this arrangement because \n     they know that in most cases, the necessary arrangements \n     cannot be made within the well-known restrictions of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n       Today you are considering The Family Friendly Workplace Act \n     (S. 4). This bill provides that hourly employees can, with \n     their employers' agreement, earn time off instead of overtime \n     pay so they can take time off to attend to personal or family \n     business. I am here to tell you that passage of this bill \n     will provide many employees, like those of Louisville Plate \n     Glass, with what they perceive as a new and very valuable \n     benefit. If this bill becomes law, my company will \n     immediately make every effort to allow our employees to \n     earn compensatory or ``comp'' time. I have no doubt at all \n     that almost all, if not all, of our employees will ask to \n     be able to earn time off instead of, or in addition to, \n     overtime pay for the extra hours that they work. They will \n     quickly see that with even modest amounts of accrued comp \n     time, they will be able to attend to personal and family \n     business without suffering a loss in pay because of their \n     absence.\n       Of course, it would be not only unwise but essentially \n     unworkable to allow employees with accrued comp time to use \n     that accrued time whenever they pleased. Our production and \n     shipping schedules, with our limited staff, will not permit \n     extended or frequent worker absences without reasonable \n     notice and arrangements. I am confidant that we will be able \n     to make the necessary arrangements for most employees to use \n     their accrued time off most of the time.\n       The comp time arrangement envisioned in S. 4 will give a \n     new and greatly needed measure of flexibility to our \n     employees who are trying to meet the demands of raising \n     children in single-parent or two-worker families. It will \n     also be a huge benefit to our employees who are pursuing \n     training or education activities. In fact, with the FLSA \n     changes embodied in S. 4, especially comp time, there would \n     little or no need for most of the provisions of the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Few employees would opt for \n     partially paid leave under the FMLA when they could use \n     accumulated compt time and receive their normal paychecks \n     even though they were absent.\n       Employees in the public sector have been able to use comp \n     time for over ten years. I understand that federal government \n     employees have had this benefit for even longer. There is \n     absolutely no reason that private-sector workers, like those \n     at Louisville Plate\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n     Glass and other businesses large and small, should not have \n     the comp time benefit that the government saw fit to provide \n     to its own employees long ago. It's time that family-friendly \n     employers in the private sector be permitted to have the \n     flexibility to work with employees to meet not only their \n     workforce needs but the needs of their employees as well.\n       In my years of involvement in public policy, I have always \n     been able to see that, no matter how contentious the issue, \n     the other side had legitimate points. However, in this case \n     there does not seem to be any legitimate reason not to allow \n     private-sector employees the same opportunity for flexibility \n     that their brothers and sisters in the public sector enjoy.\n       Thank you for the privilege of allowing me to speak on \n     behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on this important \n     issue. I would be happy to answer any questions.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Statement by Diane Buster\n\n       My name is Diane Buster, I reside in Louisville, Kentucky \n     where I work as Administrative Assistant to the Executive \n     Director of a small, local, not-for profit corporation. Why, \n     you may wonder, would I get up at 4:00 a.m., take a day off \n     without pay and travel here to speak on the issue of \n     workplace flexibility? Why? Because I am passionate about the \n     need for the passage of the Work and Family Integration Act.\n       As part of the labor force in this country for almost \n     thirty years, always in position where I have been paid an \n     hourly wage, I have lobbied in every position I have had for \n     flexibility to manage my home, family and personal life. \n     Always the price I paid for that flexibility was a lesser \n     wage and less responsibility as I settled for part-time work \n     to enable me to manage the demands of my responsibilities as \n     homemaker and mother in addition to my work duties.\n       For the last 15 years I have been in the full-time work \n     force bound by an archaic law, The Fair Labor Standard Act, \n     passed in 1938 when only about 20% of women worked as \n     compared to the almost 60% of women currently in the labor \n     force. This act mandates that I may only work 40 hours per \n     week and that, should I exceed that amount of hours in any \n     seven contiguous days, my employer is required to pay me one \n     and one half times my normal wage, even though I would prefer \n     to be allowed time off in lieu of the overtime pay. This law, \n     I'm told, applies to hourly workers whose duties are not self \n     directed. Tell me I'm not self directed when I am the only \n     one left in the office when the non-classified staff, \n     privileged to direct their own schedule, has all left early \n     to attend family functions, shop, play golf or indulge in \n     some similar recreation!\n       As a working mother and grandmother, with family all \n     residing out of state, helping out in emergency situations \n     and caring for the needs of my immediate family members would \n     be infinitely more possible with a bank of compensatory time \n     to draw on to use for such emergency care needs. The meager \n     budget of the small non-profit corporation where I work, \n     whose staffing needs fluctuate, would quite obviously be \n     better off not having to pay me overtime wages, permitting me \n     compensatory time when the workload is less. In know I am not \n     alone, but one of thousands of workers for whom the stress of \n     balancing the demands of work, home, personal and family \n     needs would be greatly alleviated by having more control over \n     my work schedule. Small businesses, the backbone of our \n     communities, who are being choked to death, forced to adhere \n     to laws and restrictions which make no sense for their time \n     and place in our economy today, would also be enormously \n     helped by being able to predicate their work schedules on the \n     specific demands of their particular business.\n       As the law currently stands, the privilege of compensatory \n     time is denied to hourly employees in private business while \n     it is permitted to salaried employees in the private sector \n     and to employees of the Federal government. This seems \n     patently unfair and smacks of elitism, if not discrimination. \n     A vote for fairness seems in order.\n       Passage of the Work and Family Integration Act will, I \n     believe, immensely help to alleviate stress for the working \n     population and greatly assist small businesses.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the Paducah Sun, Feb. 7, 1997]\n\n                             Pass Comp Bill\n\n       Opposition by some congressional Democrats and their \n     supporters in organized labor to a plan to allow compensatory \n     time off for hourly workers in lieu of overtime pay has an \n     odd ring to it.\n       The bill pushed by the GOP Congress, and endorsed by \n     President Clinton, would give employees the option of taking \n     the time, at the rate of 1\\1/2\\ hours for each overtime hour, \n     if the employer agrees. Workers would be able to bank time \n     for personal use, as many obviously would prefer. Many \n     companies also would rather give the employees time off \n     instead of the extra money.\n       Unions have criticized the idea as an attack on the \n     traditional 40-hour work week. The don't trust employers not \n     to pressure their employees to take the time off rather than \n     the overtime compensation.\n       But the real reason for the political opposition to the \n     plan is revealed in this statement by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, \n     Democrat of California: ``It will be flexible for the \n     employer. We must ensure that the employee has 100 percent \n     choice.'' Translation: The legislation is wrong because it \n     doesn't force the employer to do anything. Never mind that \n     the bill would give the worker a potential choice the \n     existing law denies him completely.\n       The family leave issue, it is recalled, was \n     enthusiastically embraced by Democrats as a great step \n     forward for working families. The law gives workers the \n     option of taking 12 weeks unpaid leave to deal with family \n     needs. In other words, they voluntarily give up money in \n     exchange for time off and flexibility, just as the comp time \n     bill would do.\n       So what's the difference? It is the mandate issue. Under \n     family leave, the company has no choice but to allow the \n     absence. To liberals, providing an avenue where an employee \n     and his boss can work out a mutually satisfactory arrangement \n     is not good enough. In fact, the whole idea apparently is so \n     obnoxious to them they would rather leave matters as they are \n     and give the worker no legal option for a more flexible work \n     schedule.\n       The comp time bill clearly ought to be passed. Salaried and \n     government employees already have the privilege, so why not \n     extend it to hourly workers? The language guarantees the \n     right of workers to take the overtime pay if they desire, so \n     labor's objection that the companies can't be trusted is only \n     so much old-school us-against-them thinking.\n       The late Paul Tsongas once made a trenchant observation to \n     the effect that too many of his fellow Democrats love jobs \n     but hate employers. Rep. Woolsey and others have done their \n     part in proving him right.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Courier-Journal, Mar. 22, 1997]\n\n                         It's ``Comptime'' Time\n\n       What's so scary about ``comptime''?\n       In the debate leading up to its passage by the U.S. House \n     of Representatives this week, a bill offering new flexibility \n     on wages and working hours was denounced by some opponents as \n     a threat to freedom, fairness and the American way.\n       And President Clinton has warned that he'll veto it in its \n     present form. That's a formidable threat since the bill \n     passed by only 12 votes in the House. (All five of Kentucky's \n     Republican members voted for it. Democrat Scotty Baesler \n     voted against.)\n       We're puzzled by Mr. Clinton's opposition. The bill doesn't \n     endanger the 40-hour work week at the heart of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938. All it says is that, if workers and \n     their employers agree, comptime can be substituted for \n     overtime pay. An employee who works, say, 45 hours in a week \n     would have the option of getting paid time-and-a-half for the \n     five hours or of getting 7\\1/2\\ hours of comp time.\n       At the end of the year, any accrued comp-time would be \n     converted to overtime pay. And the total amount of comptime \n     during a year couldn't exceed 160 hours.\n       Employers could choose not to participate in a compensatory \n     time agreement or, if they were in one, could withdraw after \n     30 days notice. Workers could withdraw at any time by \n     submitting a written request. (In unionized work places, work \n     schedules and rules for overtime would be set by contract.)\n       This looks like a win-win situation. Workers and employers \n     would get more flexibility in working out schedules, and \n     neither side would be forced to participate.\n       What's Bill Clinton scared of?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I challenge my colleagues to enact this simple, \nsensible legislation. The family friendly workplace is about nothing \nmore than choice and paid time off. S. 4 is the Federal Government at \nits best--benefits for working families with no Federal mandates and no \nexcessive costs for small businesses. I also particularly commend \nSenator Ashcroft for his leadership in developing this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes by previous order.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, on May 14, 1997, I along with my \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein of California, received a communique from \nPresident Clinton that I would like to read at this point. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     counterdrug cooperation between the United States and \n     Mexico. I want to take this opportunity to tell you about \n     my visit to Mexico and the efforts my Administration is \n     making to advance our counternarcotics strategy in a \n     bipartisan spirit.\n       President Zedillo and I had a full and frank discussion on \n     ways we can achieve greater progress toward attacking the \n     abuse and trafficking of illegal drugs. The Binational Drug \n     Threat Assessment report that General McCaffrey and Attorney \n     General Madrazo presented to us sets forth in plain terms a \n     common view of all aspects of the drug phenomena striking at \n     our societies. On that basis, President Zedillo and I agreed \n     to form\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\n     an Alliance Against Drugs, which commits our two governments \n     to prepare a common counterdrug strategy this year to achieve \n     16 specific objectives.\n       These objectives, which reflect your own thoughtful \n     contributions, include reducing demand through anti-drug \n     information campaigns directed at our youth, bringing the \n     leaders of criminal organizations to justice through \n     strengthened law enforcement cooperation, attacking \n     corruption, improving extradition (for example, by \n     negotiating a protocol to the extradition treaty to allow \n     trials in both countries prior to completion of sentences in \n     either country), fully implementing laws to combat money \n     laundering and increasing interdiction and eradication. \n     Achieving all these objectives in the short term is \n     unrealistic, but I believe we can make progress and that \n     President Zedillo's effort to restructure Mexico's anti-drug \n     forces is an essential starting point.\n       I want to keep the Congress informed of the progress we are \n     making toward achieving the objectives set forth in my 1997 \n     National Drug Control Strategy and the U.S.-Mexico Alliance \n     Against Drugs. ONDCP Director McCaffrey will provide further \n     details on these issues to Members of both Houses in the near \n     future. My Administration will also provide the Congress by \n     September 1, 1997, a report covering each of the issues \n     contained in the Senate resolution passed in March as \n     elaborated in your recent letter and discussions with my \n     Administration. In addition, we will provide reports, as you \n     have requested, commenting on prospects for multilateral \n     hemispheric cooperation and on the feasibility of enhancing \n     truck inspections at the border.\n       I appreciate your continued efforts to work with my \n     Administration to ensure that our children face a future free \n     of drugs and the crime they breed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. President, this letter is in direct response to the legislation \noffered by myself and Senator Feinstein in March of this year, passed \noverwhelmingly by the Senate but which had not yet become law because \nof differences between the House and the Senate.\n  Because the President was going to be in Mexico and in Central \nAmerica, that led to extensive discussions between myself and Senator \nFeinstein and the administration, culminating with a discussion between \nmyself and the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, during the trip \nto Mexico wherein the administration agreed to provide this letter of \nassurances to myself and Senator Feinstein, and in spirit the Congress \nand the other Senators who worked so diligently to pass these \nlegislative proposals.\n  From my point of view--and the Senator will speak for herself--it is \na new platform. It is an acknowledgement of the issues that the Senator \nand I were trying to bring before the Congress, the Nation and the \npeople of Mexico. I personally accept it in the spirit of cooperation \nand eagerly await the information to be provided to us in September. \nFrom my point of view, it is the acceptance of the point that was being \nmade during the debate that the status quo was unacceptable for either \ncountry and that we had to move to a new era of more candor and more \nrealism about the ravaging drug war and the damage it has done to both \nour countries and to the hemispheric democracy. So, I appreciate the \nNational Security Adviser's conversation. I believe he and the \nadministration fulfilled the discussion, at least to the level that I \nhad it.\n\n  I appreciate, again, and want to acknowledge the work of the Senator \nfrom California on this issue. It has been very dedicated, very \nfocused, and very meaningful. I have enjoyed working with her on this \nmatter. I believe the drug war in our hemisphere could potentially \ndestabilize the hemisphere. It is doing enormous damage to the youth of \nour country and is an issue that must receive far more attention than \nit has to date. I hope this communique is not the end, but the \nbeginning of much more work to be done by the Members of the Senate and \nthe Congress.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my colleague from \nCalifornia is prepared to talk on the subject, and I welcome her \nremarks.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California, by previous \norder, is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking the senior \nSenator from Georgia for his leadership in this matter. This has been a \ndifficult area, I think, for both of us, because I believe we both \nrespect Mexico. We know that Mexico is an ally, a friend, a neighbor, \nand we want to see relations become much better and much more fully \ndeveloped. We do not want to see a rift continuing to develop, so, we \nhave worked with that spirit in mind. Yet, one can want this equal \npartnership but also continue to point out the facts of what is \nhappening in our States and our region, and particularly along the \nsouthwest border. So I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nleadership. It has been, as he knows, a great pleasure for me to be \nable to work with him. It has been a wonderful experience. We will keep \nit going.\n  I also want to extend my thanks to the President and to the National \nSecurity Adviser, Sandy Berger. Both Senator Coverdell, as he \nindicated, and I--we have met separately with the administration. We \nhave both made the same request that this report, described by our \nSenate resolution, be rendered by the administration to this body.\n  Let me begin by saying the administration could easily have said no. \nThere is no legislative vehicle that accompanies this request. But they \ndid agree, in our negotiations, to honor this request, and they have \nkept that commitment and, in effect, will produce the report on \nSeptember 1. I am heartened by that. As my colleague just spoke, we are \nheartened because we hope it will be a new day of cooperation between \nthe executive and the legislative branches in what is rapidly becoming \nthe soft underbelly of this Nation as well as the Mexican nation, and \nthat of course is drugs.\n  As many know, I have a bill which is now in the Judiciary Committee's \nbill called the Gang Violence Act. What we have discovered is that \ndrugs are fueling a new extension of gangs working across the States. \nOne of the steps I am hopeful this body will be taking is passage of \nthat bill and, in essence, applying to street gangs, who are organized \nand moving across State lines, the same racketeering statutes that we \nwould apply to Mafia-type organized crime--expanding the Travel Act, \nputting in asset seizures and forfeitures, effectively doubling Federal \npenalties for Americans who participate in major drug trafficking, gun \nrunning, and other criminal activity, across State lines.\n  So, we will take major steps in this Nation to combat our problem, \nwhich is one of demand for drugs. The report that we have asked the \nadministration to produce will deal with Mexico's progress in the \nfollowing areas:\n  Efforts to combat drug cartels--four big Mexican drug cartels are \noperating with impunity beyond our border; bilateral law enforcement \ncooperation--we are very interested in a partnership between our Drug \nEnforcement Administration and Mexican drug authorities, but to have \nour agents in Mexico unable to arm themselves makes no sense, \nparticularly with the record of assassination that the cartels have \nestablished; improved border enforcement--obvious; extradition of \nMexican nationals wanted in the United States on drug charges; \nimplementation of money-laundering laws; increased crop eradication; \nrooting out corruption; and improved air and maritime cooperation. All \nof these points are elucidated in our Senate resolution requesting this \nreport, and the administration has agreed, unilaterally, to provide it. \nFor that I am very thankful.\n  Let me talk about one area, and that area is extradition. This is an \narea which for me is a litmus test as to whether there is cooperation. \nI want to give one case that was just written up in the May 13, 1997 \nLos Angeles Times by Anne-Marie O'Connor. It is not a traditional case, \nin terms of names like Amado Carillo-Fuentes--well-known cartel names. \nThis case deals with a family by the name of Reynoso: Antonio Reynoso \nand two brothers, Jose and Jesus Reynoso. They were indicted among 22 \nalleged members of a vast ring that transported cocaine from Mexico to \nLos Angeles to Chicago and to New Jersey, using Lear jets, boilers, and \ncanned vegetables. They are named in an extradition request presented \nby this country to the Mexican Government. Last September, Jose Reynoso \npled guilty on a drug-smuggling charge. Both Antonio and Jesus are \nunder indictment for conspiracy to import and possess cocaine with \nintent to distribute, as well as for money laundering. In the last 2 \nyears, they have built a magnificent home within a\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nstone's throw of the border between San Diego and Tijuana. There is a \nsmall picture in the Los Angeles Times, which shows the border fence \nand then this drug lord's home right across the border fence. I want to \ndescribe it to you for a moment. I am quoting from the Los Angeles \nTimes.\n\n       To their profound annoyance, Justice Department officials \n     say, Reynoso, 53, is putting the finishing touches on an \n     ostentatious walled residence that backs right up to the U.S. \n     border. If he wanted to, he could hit a tennis ball into San \n     Diego County.\n\n  The article goes on to describe the mansion:\n\n       Encircled by a forbidding wall that ascends 35 feet, \n     chateau Reynoso rises like a ship over San Diego County, not \n     far from a binational gulch called ``Smuggler's Canyon.'' \n     [Where I have been.] With its turret, a glass pool atrium and \n     a dazzling green roof worthy of Oz, it is so conspicuous that \n     Border Patrol agents sometimes point it out to visitors.\n       U.S. law enforcement officers note its fortress \n     architecture and its protected position at the end of a \n     narrow cul-de-sac. So close to the United States, they \n     complain, yet so far from a San Diego courtroom.\n       ``I wish we could just tunnel back and grab him,'' a \n     Justice Department attorney said.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       . . . Reynoso's name has appeared on lists of traffickers \n     given to Mexican authorities by United States Attorney \n     General Janet Reno. But no discernible action has been taken. \n     U.S. officials have no indications that Reynoso is even a \n     wanted man in Mexico.\n\n  This same family was the mastermind behind a huge tunnel, 60 feet \nbelow the ground, between Otay Mesa and San Diego. This tunnel had \nelectricity, it had air conditioning, and it was used by this family to \nsmuggle drugs under the border into the United States. It was one of \nthe most sophisticated tunnels, really, ever known. This family spent \n$1.1 million buying the lot in Otay Mesa where the passage's exit was \nto be located.\n  This is a clear indication, I believe, of what Senator Coverdell and \nI will be looking for in terms of actions taken by the Mexican \nGovernment. We will have another round on certification. It is \nimportant to both of us, as well as, I believe, to a majority of this \nbody, that there be actions taken in this equal partnership between the \nUnited States and Mexico. Let me just summarize.\n\n  The response from a good friend, a neighbor, and an ally that drugs \nare exclusively a U.S. problem is simply not adequate. We admit that we \nhave a demand problem. We have taken steps to strengthen our laws, to \nallocate funds for prevention programs. Still, we know we must do more \nand we are willing to say we will and do it.\n  But when Mexican nationals run meth labs throughout California--and \nover 700 meth labs have been seized by the State Bureau of Narcotic \nEnforcement in California alone in the last year, 700 of them--and \nMexico refuses to enforce its border, the drug problem is not our \nproblem alone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator her 10 minutes \nhave expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I ask for 1 minute to wrap up, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. When drug cartels are brazen enough to kill \nGovernment officials and church leaders in cold blood, the drug problem \nis not our problem alone. When the cartels are operating with such \nimpunity that they do not hesitate to bribe officials on both sides of \nthe border and, as ``Nightline'' has just pointed out, to buy up \nbusinesses along the border, the drug problem is not our problem alone. \nSo the drug problem is a problem for both sides. What we need is a \ncooperative effort of both nations acting as full partners. Neither the \nUnited States nor Mexico can win this battle alone.\n  The report that the President has now committed to provide to the \nCongress on September 1 will be an important indicator of whether or \nnot Mexico has taken the decision to approach this terrible problem in \na cooperative partnership and in a fully committed way. Unless the \nreport can cite significant and demonstrable progress in cooperation, \nthe answer, very sadly, will be that Mexico has not yet taken such a \ndecision. I hope that is not the case on September 1.\n  To me, this report is very meaningful. The point I want to make is \nthat I believe the expectation of a majority of this body is that there \nbe tangible and substantial steps taken that are visible, discernible, \nand real to combat the cartels and to stop the corruption, the bribing, \nand the sort of total disregard for law which is now characteristic of \nthe situation.\n  I, for one, will watch the extradition picture especially carefully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the May 14 letter from \nthe President be printed in the Record, I thank the Presiding Officer \nfor his forbearance, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dianne: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     counterdrug cooperation between the United States and Mexico. \n     I want to take this opportunity to tell you about my visit to \n     Mexico and the efforts my Administration is making to advance \n     our counternarcotics strategy in a bipartisan spirit.\n       President Zedillo and I had a full and frank discussion on \n     ways we can achieve greater progress toward attacking the \n     abuse and trafficking of illegal drugs.

Mr. President, I was working in my office on some \nother matters, and it came to my attention that several of my \ncolleagues, I\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\nthink Senator Ashcroft and perhaps Senator McConnell of Kentucky, came \ndown to speak about the comptime-flextime bill that Senator Ashcroft \nintroduced, S. 4. I want to respond to some of what they had to say \nbecause I think it is important that people in the country understand \nthis debate and how it affects their lives.\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments that was made was that \nDemocrats--it was a curious argument--by coming out on the floor, and I \nwas one that did so, and Senator Kennedy was out here and there were \nothers, that by speaking in opposition to S. 4, we did not want to \ndebate. The legislation was stopped. There were not enough votes to \nproceed. So somehow we did not want to debate the bill.\n  Mr. President, we should be clear about the difference between trying \nto get some legislation passed that will lead to an improvement in the \nquality of lives of people, as opposed to bringing out legislation \nwhich you know will never become law.\n  At the top of the issues I care most about is campaign finance \nreform. I keep being told we do not have time to do it on the floor of \nthe Senate. We have core issues to debate. Mr. President, I disagree \nsharply with my colleagues. I make the point that when you bring a bill \nto the floor of the Senate which the President has already said he \nwould veto, when you bring a bill to the floor of the Senate, S. 4 in \nthe form it was brought to the floor, knowing full well that you will \nhave a significant number of Senators, certainly well over 40, in \nopposition, this is hardly the way to pass legislation. You can score \npolitical points. You can come to the floor today and try and score \npolitical points, but that is not a substitute for a substantive \nargument and debate.\n  Now, Mr. President, we should be clear about what we oppose because I \ndo not think it is a question of what I oppose, as the Senator from \nMinnesota. I think it is a question of how people in the country may \nview this.\n  S. 4 is an overreach. It did not go anywhere on the floor of the \nSenate. It was to be vetoed by the President. It will never become the \nlaw of the land because it is an overreach. It takes the Fair Labor \nStandards Act--we are talking about 50 years of people's history, if \nyou will, with the idea being that when you work overtime you get \ncompensated at time and a half--and it turns it on its head. It goes to \nan 80-hour work period so that an employee could end up working 60 \nhours one week, 20 hours the next week with no overtime pay.\n  Now, if you think in theory all employees will have the power to say \nto employers, ``No, we do not want to work under these conditions,'' if \nyou are naive enough to believe that, believe it. If you do not know \nmuch about the world of the workplace, believe it. But that is why we \nhave some protections for working people. We are not about to stand and \nwatch the 40-hour workweek overturned. We are not about to see fair \nlabor standards that have been so important to working families, so \nimportant to their wage levels, so important to people being treated \nwith dignity and respect, overturned.\n  It is, as they say, a nonstarter. That is why that legislation, when \nit came to the floor was a nonstarter. We had debate. I heard \ncolleagues say we did not want to debate. We had debate.\n  The second point, both the 80-hour 2-week framework and flextime at \nhour for hour, where you get an hour off for an hour of overtime, but \nno time and a half, these are, essentially, cuts in pay. So, get real.\n  We should talk about the purported goal of the bill that was \nintroduced and what should be our goal, which is to give employees more \nflexibility. If, in fact, a woman or a man wants to bank time--now I am \ntalking about comptime--by working overtime 1 week and then saying, \n``Look, I would like to take that as time off rather than getting paid \ncash time and a half. Rather than getting an hour and a half in pay for \nthe hour I worked overtime, I would like to have an hour and a half in \npaid time off. I could do some things with my family that would be \nimportant to my family.'' Great. But make sure that is what the \nlegislation is. That is not the legislation that was on the floor of \nthe Senate. Two out of the three options, the flextime proposal and the \n80-hour 2-week proposal, represent cuts in pay for people.\n\n  It represented an all-out assault on the Fair Labor Standards Act, an \nall-out assault on the idea of decent jobs, overtime pay for overtime \nwork. So, now let's talk about where there could be common ground.\n  Before I do that, Mr. President, let me deal with a couple of other \narguments that were made that I think are really quite important. Mr. \nPresident, one of the arguments that was made was that people do not \nhave, and I cannot believe my colleagues made this argument, that, \nright now, because of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the laws we live \nunder, there is no way to have flexibility.\n  I am the ranking minority member of the subcommittee which has \nconsidered this topic, with Senator DeWine, who has been an excellent \nchair, by the way. We had people come in and testify about the existing \nflexibility. There are people in the country who work four 10-hour days \nand then they do not work on a Friday. There are people who work four \n9-hour days and then they work half a day on Friday or Monday. There \nare people that come in at 7 o'clock and work to until 3 o'clock or \ncome in and 10 o'clock and work until 6 o'clock, whatever the case \nmight be. There are all sorts of ways in which there can be flexibility \nright now. The sad thing is a lot of companies do not provide that to \ntheir employees, but we should not confuse the issue. That has nothing \nto do with the Fair Labor Standards Act. That cannot be used as a \npretext for overturning the Fair Labor Standards Act. We are not going \nto let that happen. To argue there is no flexibility or no way that \ncurrent law allows it is just simply not the case.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri also claims that his \nbill simply makes available to private-sector workers the same benefits \nthat Federal employees have. He is wrong. The Federal employee program \ngives employees the right to choose whether to have flexible schedules. \nS. 4 does not do that. The Senator also overlooks the many and \nsubstantial job protections that Federal employees enjoy that do not \napply to the private sector workers.\n  By the way, when it comes to health care benefits and pension \nbenefits and much larger percentage of Federal employees being \nunionized and having bargaining powers, I would be pleased to join with \nmy colleagues to achieve parity for people in the private sector. Mr. \nPresident, first and foremost, Federal workers are covered by civil \nservice rules requiring good cause for discharge or discipline. That \nis, Federal employees cannot be suspended, discharged, or disciplined \nwithout notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond in a \nhearing. Private employees, by contrast, are typically ``at will'' \nemployees. An employer can discharge or discipline those employees for \nany reason. It is completely different. People in the private sector do \nnot have the protection Federal employees have. Private employees can \nbe fired because the employer does not like the color of their hair. \nThey can be suspended because the employer does not like their \npolitical beliefs. These workers have no redress. They cannot complain \nto anyone. They have no right to a hearing, and they certainly do not \nhave the right to get their jobs back. Only if private employees are \ncovered by a collective bargaining agreement do they have the right to \na hearing before they can be fired, and only about 15 percent of the \nprivate work force in this country is covered by such a contract.\n  Mr. President, these are critical differences between public and \nprivate employees. They underscore how careful we must be before we \nblindly apply Federal programs to the private sector. The possibility \nfor exploitation of private-sector employees is far greater than in the \npublic sector.\n\n  Let me give an example of something that happened in the Labor \nCommittee. We will see what happens when the bill returns to the floor. \nI had an amendment that says we should give the employees real \nflexibility. Now, if Mary Jones has banked 20 hours that she earned by \nworking overtime and she now wants to take that time off and she asks \nfor the hour and a half paid time off for each of those overtime hours \nworked, if she wants to do it for reasons that are laid out in the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, because a family member is ill, or a new \nchild has\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nbeen born, she should be able to do it. She should not have to have \nthat approved. Those are her hours she banked, her earned compensation. \nGive her the flexibility. Do not just leave it in the hand of the \nemployer to ultimately decide to sign off on everything. That amendment \nwas defeated. Mr. President, if we want to make sure that private \nemployees have flexibility, then we must have such a provision.\n  Mr. President, there are no sweatshops, my colleague mentioned, in \nthe Federal sector. The Department of Labor found that 50 percent of \ngarment shops failed to comply with minimum wage, overtime, or child \nlabor laws--50 percent. Yet the Republican bill would give employers in \nthe garment industry one more tool to abuse their employees. I had an \namendment that said we should exclude people that work in some of these \nsectors of the work force that are already exploited because otherwise \nyou are giving employers another way of not paying people overtime. \nThat amendment was defeated. I repeat on the floor of the Senate, that \namendment was defeated. Very revealing. We offered an amendment in the \nLabor Committee to exclude garment workers and other especially \nvulnerable employees of the bill. It was defeated on a party-line vote.\n  The Senator from Missouri quoted a song very familiar to me on the \nfloor this week. I said, ``I know that song, Florence Reese wrote \nthat.'' I know that because my wife's family is from Appalachia and \nthis was about the coal mining struggles. Florence Reese was from \nHarlan County, KY.\n  Mr. President, I think the vote to deny an exemption to garment \nworkers and other vulnerable employees shows pretty clearly which side \nthe Republicans are on in this debate. I think the vote not to provide \nan exemption for those employees, who we already know are exploited--\nthe evidence is irrefutable and irreducible--shows clearly which side \ntoo many of my Republican colleagues are on. And by the way, not the \nside that Florence Reese was singing about, which is the side of \nworking people.\n  Mr. President, another important difference between the public and \nprivate sector is that the Federal agencies do not go bankrupt. \nContrast this with private businesses. In 1995, 52,000 American \nbusinesses filed for bankruptcy. The rate of business failures in the \ngarment industry is twice the national average. In construction, the \nrate of bankruptcy is much higher than the national average. If an \nemployer goes bankrupt when an employee has comptime banked, the worker \nloses all his or her time and money. Mr. President, under S. 4 comptime \nhours do not count as wages in a bankruptcy proceeding, so the worker \nwho accepted comptime instead of paid overtime would be out of luck. We \nhad an amendment ready in the Labor Committee markup to fix this \nproblem but, it is not in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague on the floor and I do not want to \ntake up so much time that he does not have an opportunity to speak but \nlet me make one of many other points I could make by way of correcting \nthe Record.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Missouri said Democrats have not \nread the bill. I read the bill. I can say, and I do no damage to the \ntruth, that this bill violates the 40-hour week and sets up an 80-hour \n2-week framework, and people can work 50 hours or 60 hours one week and \nthey get no overtime pay if the employer decides the arrangement should \nbe such that the employee can choose to get some time off the next \nweek, but they do not get time and a half compensation as either cash \nor time. I can safely say that there is no effort here to really \nproviding employees the flexibility to choose when to use comp time.\n\n  Mr. President, under the Ashcroft bill, flexible credit hours are \ndefined as hours that the employer and the employee jointly designate \nfor the employee to work so as to ``reduce the hours worked'' at a \nlater time. This is on page 19, lines 14 through 18 of the bill.\n  My colleague from Missouri claimed that the opponents of S. 4 would \nsupport the legislation, if only we would read the bill. Mr. President, \nI respectfully suggest that my colleague needs to take another look at \nthis legislation. It doesn't do what the proponents claim. The language \nshows that.\n  Federal law defines ``credit hours'' as hours which the employee \nelects to work. Let me repeat that. Federal law defines ``credit \nhours'' as hours which the employee elects to work so as to vary the \nlength of the workweek or workday. Under the Ashcroft bill, you have to \nhave the employer and the employee together designating this. If the \nemployer doesn't want to go along with this--and the employers quite \noften have the power--the employee doesn't get to make that decision.\n  So let's not say that this bill is going to give employees in the \nprivate sector what employees in the Federal sector have. It is right \nthere in the bill on page 19, lines 14 to 18.\n  Mr. President, I think I have made my case. We have had some time to \ndebate this bill. The bill went nowhere because the bill, as opposed to \nproviding employees flexibility, ends up being a way in which too many \nemployers all across the country can basically cut the pay for workers. \nIt amounts to a paycheck cut for workers.\n  We are not going to let that happen. The President wouldn't let that \nhappen.\n  So I suggest that my colleagues, next time we have the debate, do not \ncome out on the floor and say that we have not read the bill. We read \nthe bill. That is why I oppose it. Don't come out on the floor and say \nthat we are going to give the private-sector employees the same \nopportunities as the Federal-sector employees have. That is not the \ncase. Don't come out on the floor and say that this will provide \nflexibility for employees. It doesn't.\n  Don't come out on the floor and pretend that you have not done damage \nto the very cherished idea of a 40-hour workweek, and, that, by golly, \npeople should get the functional equivalent of overtime pay, paid time \noff at time and a half, because this bill doesn't really provide real \nguarantees that it will happen.\n  And don't come out here on the floor of the Senate and say that all \nthese great things are going to happen in the work force when we have \nclear examples of people who work, such as in the garment industry, who \nare already being exploited, and you don't want to provide them any \nkind of exemption or any kind of special protection. The arguments just \nsimply don't carry the day.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest to my colleagues that I came out on \nthe floor to correct the Record, that there is a good reason why the \nbill went nowhere, there is a good reason why the President is going to \nveto it. I hope we will see some serious work that we will do together \nto make some major corrections and have a really strong piece of \nlegislation that will provide working women and men with the \nflexibility they need, and which will be family friendly.\n  And, by the way, I think Senator Murray has an excellent idea to \nexpand the Family Medical Leave Act for some additional hours off for a \nfamily. There are a lot of things that we can do to really make this a \npiece of legislation that is family friendly, that is worker friendly. \nAnd that is what I think we will do.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield for \na question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I actually have to leave the floor in a moment. I \nwould be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the \ndescription of the bill by my colleague from Minnesota. I think it is \nsafe to say there is no one in the Chamber who really doesn't subscribe \nto the notion that there ought to be greater flexibility in the \nworkplace, and that there is merit to giving an employee the \nopportunity to decide whether they want comptime as opposed to \novertime. I don't think there is much disagreement about that issue.\n\n  But I ask the Senator from Minnesota, is it the case that, when we \ntalk about overtime pay for American workers, 80 percent of the workers \nin this country that are getting overtime pay are workers earning less \nthan $28,000 a year? Then therefore, by definition, these are workers \nsomewhere toward the lower end of the economic scale who get less than \n$28,000 a year, and many of them rely on overtime pay. They need it. It \nis very important to them.\n  To the extent that anybody opposes a bill that says let's provide \nflexibility in\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\nthe workplace in a manner that might threaten the opportunity for those \nwho want and need the overtime pay, especially those at the bottom of \nthe pay scale, boy, that is not moving in the right direction in terms \nof providing flexibility.\n  Is it the case that the preponderance of people getting overtime in \nthe workplace are people below $28,000 a year?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota is \nabsolutely correct. That is why I said earlier that I would want to \npoint to the critical distinction between coming out here on the floor \nwith a piece of legislation that you know threatens the labor standards \nof working people, that you know doesn't provide the flexibility, that \nyou know is not going to get the votes to pass, that you know the \nPresident is going to veto, and doing what should be done, if, in fact, \nwe care about working people and children, which is to come out with a \npiece of legislation that really does provide the comptime, the \nflexibility, without threatening people who really rely on that \novertime pay.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Isn't it the case that the bill that was brought to the \nfloor says to you, if you are an employer and you have somebody working \nfor you making $14,000 a year, working hard, working two 40-hour weeks, \n``By the way, we will give you some flexibility; you can tell that \nworker next week that they are going to work 60 hours, and that you can \nlet them work fewer hours the week after, so as long as it adds up to \n80 hours, whatever the requirement of work for the first time?''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. It takes the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nwhich, as I said the other day, is based on a lot of sweat and tears of \na lot of working families, and turns the whole idea of fairness on its \nhead. That is absolutely right.\n  That is why that piece of legislation went nowhere on the floor of \nthe Senate, nor should it.\n  That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One additional question: There is a way to do what people \nhave said needs doing, and what, I think, needs doing; that is, \nhonestly provide greater flexibility. If people want to take comptime \ninstead of overtime, there certainly is a way to do that without \npotentially hurting people at the lower end of the economic ladder. \nIsn't that the case?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would say to my colleague that he is correct. I \nthink the key issues are, when you have proposals in here, first, what \nyou do, if you are serious about passing a piece of legislation that is \ngoing to help working families, is you take the extreme and harsh parts \nout, like overturning the 40-hour week.\n  Second of all, you make sure you don't have a lot of coercion at the \nworkplace, and that employees really do have a choice, whether it be a \nwoman or a man. And, if so, they get either that at time-and-a-half pay \nor they get that time-and-a-half off when they want and need to take \nit.\n  If you can make sure that happens, if you make sure that you have the \nimportant provisions to make sure that happens, and if you make sure \nthere isn't exploitation, then it is absolutely the right direction to \ngo.\n  That would be, I hope, the common ground.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to use the time \nreserved for the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor, and was interested in \nthe comments offered by my colleague from Minnesota. I agree with his \ncomments. That has been the issue on the floor of the Senate for the \nlast couple of weeks. I expect we will have more debate on it. But I \ncame to talk about several other issues, and I would like to take the \ntime to make some points to my colleagues that are important to me, to \nmy home State of North Dakota, and to others.\n  So let me begin talking about the first of the three issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4649-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4652-S4654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first is the disaster appropriations bill.\n  Last week the Senate passed an appropriations bill to provide \nsupplemental appropriations for the disasters that have occurred in our \ncountry, and it is especially important to me and to our region.\n  This bill would provide substantial amounts of resources and money \nfor people who have been victims of the disaster in North Dakota, South \nDakota, and Minnesota.\n  I am enormously impressed that the House of Representatives last \nevening passed a disaster bill that contains almost identical amounts \nof money for the disaster relief that we put in here in the Senate. We \nadded $500 million to the bill--$100 million that the President \nrequested be added, and $400 million above that for what is called \ncommunity development block grants. That represents the most flexible \nof Federal spending that goes to State and local governments. It \nprovides great flexibility for them. It is packaged in a way that helps \nthem resolve their problems and help their people who are victims of \nthe disaster.\n  While I am very pleased of the actions of the House last evening, we \nnow go to conference. I will be a conferee because I am on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. But we go to conference with a bill that has \nawfully good news in it for victims of the disaster in our region of \nthe country. But the bill also contains a very controversial amendment \nthat has nothing to do with this bill. This is an amendment that has to \ndo with ending Government shutdowns at the end of the fiscal year if \nthe appropriations bills are not passed on time. They are called \ncontinuing resolutions. CR's, they are called.\n  This disaster appropriations bill contains an amendment, dealing with \nthe continuing resolution which is very controversial. The President \nsaid long ago would this amendment require him to veto the bill, if it \nis in the bill. And, nonetheless, the Senate has passed the bill and \nthe House has passed a bill that constrains this very controversial \namendment.\n  I hope very much that this weekend, and in the early days of next \nweek, as we work through this conference, that we can convince all of \nthe people who are interested in this bill that the best interest of \nthe people of the region who are victims of the disaster will be served \nby removing from this bill these amendments that have nothing to do \nwith the disaster appropriations bill.\n  We should not in any way attempt to delay or derail a disaster bill \nwith extraneous amendments. It just shouldn't be done. I have not done \nit in the past. I have voted for disaster funds to help people who have \nbeen victims of floods, fires, tornadoes, blizzards, earthquakes, and I \nhave been pleased to vote for those because I think it is important for \npeople all over this country to extend a helping hand to those who are \nvictims of a disaster. But I don't think it is appropriate for Members \nof Congress to decide this is a bill which is critical and important, \nthat provides needed help to victims, and, therefore, because it is a \nbill that the President somehow must sign, they should put a \ncontroversial amendment on it that has nothing to do with the bill. \nThat is exactly what has happened.\n\n  I ask, with great respect to all of those involved in that effort to \ndecide to do something different, to withdraw that amendment from this \nbill. Let's pass this bill out of conference, send it back to the House \nand to the Senate, and then to the President in a manner so that he can \nsign it.\n  Why on Earth would the Congress include something in a bill that they \nknow the President is going to veto, and thereby just create a delay in \nthe aid to victims?\n  There are thousands of North Dakotans and Minnesotans who woke up \nthis morning not in their own beds and not in their own homes. They are \nhomeless. It has been weeks since this flood of a 500-year level hit \nthe Red River and evacuated 95 percent of the people in the city of \n50,000, Grand Forks, ND. On the other side of the river, 100 percent of \nthe city of East Grand Forks, MN, some 9,000 people were evacuated from \ntheir homes.\n  In Grand Forks, ND, alone, somewhere between 600 and 800 homes are \ndestroyed. No one will move back into those homes. They are destroyed. \nAnother perhaps 1,000 homes are severely\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\ndamaged. Where are those families today? They are not home today. They \nare victims living with relatives, some in shelters, many in other \ntowns struggling to try to figure out what they do and how they put \ntogether the pieces. Many people live paycheck to paycheck, struggling \nto try to figure out how they pay the bills.\n  Many businesses are not open in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks \nbecause much of the town is still uninhabited. People do not have jobs. \nPeople do not know how they are going to pay their bills. Yes, FEMA is \nhelping. FEMA is writing checks and helping people with their immediate \nneeds. But these are victims of a disaster. They need help, and they \ndon't need people to play a game with a disaster appropriations bill by \nadding an extraneous amendment that has nothing to do with the bill in \na way that will delay and jeopardize the bill.\n  I ask all of those who are involved in that, don't do that. Bring \nyour proposal up next week or the week after. It doesn't matter to me. \nLet's debate it. You have every right to bring any idea to the floor of \nthe Senate and have a debate on it. But don't delay or jeopardize the \ndisaster bill. It is fundamentally unfair to people this morning who \nstill woke up without a home and without a job wondering what their \nfuture holds and looking to us for some hope.\n  I have shown the pictures before. But I think it is important to do \nit again. Let me explain how we got where we are so that you understand \nthe dimensions of it.\n  We had 3 years' worth of snow in 3 months in my State. This is a \nsnowbank. This happens to be flat ground. There is a farmer in front of \na snowbank. It gives you a little idea of how high those snowbanks \nbecame in the middle of our blizzards in North Dakota. That is about an \n18-foot snowbank.\n  There were anywhere from six to nine serious blizzards, most of which \nclosed down most of the roads in North Dakota. Some of them closed down \nevery road in North Dakota. We had whiteout conditions. You could not \nsee your hand in front of your face. The last blizzard, incidentally, \nwas anywhere from 18 to 24 inches of snow dumped in about 48 hours on \ntop of the record snowfall we had previously. So we had about 9 to 10 \nfeet of snow in North Dakota during this winter. Then what we had was a \nrapid spring melt in which all of this snowpack melted down. The Red \nRiver on the eastern side of our State is one of the few rivers that \nruns north. This river ran right into an ice pack up in Canada. We had \nthis massive melt that created not a river but created a lake out of \nthe Red River. And, this lake was 150 miles long by about 20 to 30 \nmiles wide.\n  The result was that a massive quantity of water became a giant, \ncoursing stream through Wahpeton, Breckenridge, Fargo, Moorhead, Grand \nForks, and East Grand Forks. They were fighting floods in 80 locations \nin our region. The head of the Corps of Engineers said that he has \nnever seen that kind of effort by local people to fight a flood. It was \nthe most extraordinary effort he had ever seen.\n  Down in Wahpeton and Breckenridge, they won some and lost some \nbattles. Up in Fargo, they largely won the battle after very tense \nnights and days. In Grand Forks, the flood prediction was set at 49 \nfeet, the highest flood in the history of the Red River in Grand Forks. \nBut the flood that came was 54 feet. It broke the dike and inundated \nthe town.\n  I traveled throughout Grand Forks. I viewed Main Street, downtown \nGrand Forks, and all of the neighborhoods in a Coast Guard boat.\n  Take a look at the farms in the Red River Valley. This is a picture \nof a farm. It does not look like it. It looks like a building \nsurrounded by a lake but it is farmland. We had 1.7 million acres under \nwater.\n  Then there were dead cattle. We lost somewhere around 150,000 head of \ncattle. A fellow who had just come from North Dakota told me yesterday. \nHe was in town the day before and visiting with a fellow rancher, and \nthe rancher said he had to go home and shoot some more calves. These \nyoung calves were born during calving season. Now their hooves were \nfalling off. Their feet were falling off because they had been frozen. \nFarmers and ranchers lost some 150,000 head of cattle that were killed \nas a result of these storms.\n  We had farmers calling radio stations saying they had lost their \nentire herd of cattle. They asked if anybody had seen their herd of \ncattle. There were dairy cows with udders frozen. In the last storm, \nwhich was the worst storm in 50 years, came in the middle of calving \nseason. The Senator from Kansas knows very well about weather problems \nduring calving season.\n  So that is what people were confronted with. When the flood came, it \ninundated Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, and the towns were \nevacuated. In the midst of the flood, the downtown section of Grand \nForks caught on fire. We had fire fighters in Grand Forks, as you can \nsee from this picture, waist deep in ice cold water, some suffering \nhypothermia, fighting a fire. In the early stages they were fighting \nwith fire extinguishers because they could not get pumper trucks in \nbecause of the flood. These are heroes. These folks who fought that \nfire are true heroes. We lost parts of three blocks of downtown Grand \nForks, including 11 of the wonderful old historic buildings. That part \nof the historic city of Grand Forks burned to the ground.\n  That is what was faced in this set of disasters. These are the \nvictims up and down the Red River Valley who today wait for a message \nof hope from the Congress. They wait for the disaster bill that both \nthe House and the Senate have now enacted that will go to conference. \nThey wait for the President's signature on a bill that provides much-\nneeded help to these victims.\n  It is critically important that those who have now added \nan amendment, which has nothing to do with this bill and that is very \ncontroversial, decide to withdraw it.\n\n  Mr. President, all of us are proud of our States, all of us are proud \nof where we come from. I am enormously proud to be a North Dakotan, and \nI feel privileged every day I get up and come to work to represent \nNorth Dakota in the Senate. The most important thing I have done in my \nlife, I guess, is representing North Dakotans in the Senate. It will \nundoubtedly be one of the most wonderful privileges I will have had in \nmy lifetime when my service here is through.\n  I do not, and have not in my years in both the House and Senate come \nto the Chambers of Congress asking for special help for our region. \nBut, if ever a region needed help, our region does now. It is almost \nunprecedented that major communities in our country had to be \nevacuated. Now weeks after the evacuation, the communities are still \nnot very functional. People are still homeless. People are still \njobless.\n  None of us quite knows the menu of exactly how you put all this back \ntogether. How do you restart an economy that was stopped dead still? \nHow do you give hope to men and women who had a small business \nsomewhere and have now lost all their inventory, and lost their \nbuilding? Their business is gone and they have no money. How do you \nrestore their hopes and dreams?\n  How about a rancher or a farmer whose land is totally under water and \nwho lost their entire herd of cows and calves? They wonder what will \nthey do next? This is a case where our region needs help.\n  We are a generous people in North Dakota, and we have always been the \nfirst to help. Just as America is a generous nation, and been the first \nalmost anywhere in the world to offer help to people who need help. We \nhave done the same in North Dakota to offer help to victims of \nhurricanes and earthquakes and floods elsewhere.\n  This is a time that I am proud of Members of Congress for standing up \nin the Senate and in the House saying that we want to offer a package \nof help that in the bill passed by the Senate totaled somewhere close \nto $1.2-$1.3 billion of help for that region. It included $500 million \nof community development block grants which are the most flexible kind \nof resources available. I am enormously proud that Members of the House \nand Senate have done that. Now if we can do one more thing that will \nmake me proud, it will be for those who have offered the controversial \namendment that will attract a veto to this bill to decide it is not the \nright thing to do. This is not the right bill to do it on. It is not \nfair for the people of this region to do it now. It is time for them to \ndecide to withdraw this amendment. Then we can have the conference, and \nget a bill we can send to\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nthe President and have the President sign it. Then this critically \nneeded assistance can flow to people of our region. It will be, I \nthink, a very proud moment for all of Congress. I hope that will be the \ncase in the coming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4652-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4654-S4655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAST-TRACK TRADE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to mention quickly two other \nsubjects. The first is a letter that I have sent to the President with \nmy colleague from Maine, Senator Olympia Snowe, about the issue of \nfast-track trade authority, and then, second, I would like to offer a \ncomment about the budget agreement.\n  First, on the issue of fast-track trade authority, Mr. President, \nSenator Olympia Snowe and I have sent a letter to President Clinton \nindicating to him that we do not believe it is appropriate to extend \nfast-track trade authority and that we would oppose the extension of \nfast-track trade authority.\n  This may not mean much to a lot of folks. Fast-track trade authority \nis a kind of inside baseball term, I suppose, for Members of Congress. \nWhat is fast-track authority? Fast track is a trade procedure by which \nthe Congress says to an administration, any administration, you go out \nand negotiate a trade agreement with some other country or group of \ncountries, and then the trade agreement is brought back to the Senate \nor the House and must be considered on something called fast track. \nThis means the Senate and House must vote on it up or down with no \nopportunity to amend it. Fast track means no opportunity to amend it. \nYou bring it to the Senate. The Senate votes yes or no, and that is the \nend of it.\n\n  We do not use fast-track authority on the arms control agreements. We \ndid not have fast-track authority on the chemical weapons treaty that \nthis Senate passed a couple of weeks ago. Only on trade agreements do \nwe have what is called fast track. It is fundamentally undemocratic, in \nmy judgment.\n  The reason I do not support fast track and the extension of fast-\ntrack authority is fast track has been the wrong track for this \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to take a look at our trade deficit. We \ntalk about eliminating the budget deficit, and there is great merit in \nthat, and I am going to be supportive of that.\n  What about the other deficit? What about the trade deficit, which is \nthe largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country \nright now? This is the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history \nof this country, and you do not hear a word about it, not a word. We \nhave had trade agreement after trade agreement, and guess what. After \nevery trade agreement, we have greater hemorrhaging of red ink and \ngreater trade deficits.\n  This is a chart that shows those trade deficits. We had the Tokyo \nround in 1981. That year we had a $28 billion merchandise trade \ndeficit. Then we went out and we added the United States-Canada Free-\nTrade Agreement, and that year we had a $115 billion trade deficit. \nThen there was NAFTA. Then it was the Uruguay round. Every time we have \na new trade agreement, our trade deficit increases.\n  I would like to get the names and pictures of those folks who are \nnegotiating these things and ask them, by what standard do you view \nsuccess? Is it successful to have successive trade agreements that mean \nthis country goes deeper into merchandise trade debt? I do not think \nso. That is not how I would define success.\n  This is a chart which shows what has happened with our two neighbors. \nFirst we had the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Then we had \nthe North American Free-Trade Agreement, called NAFTA, with Canada and \nMexico, and the Mexico Free Trade Agreement.\n  Guess what has happened. Before we had the trade agreement with our \nneighbors, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. Then we go off and \nnegotiate a trade agreement with the Mexicans and the Canadians. Now we \nhave a combined deficit that totals nearly $40 billion.\n  Look what has happened to the trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. \nWe had a $2 billion surplus with Mexico in 1993. Now we have a $16 \nbillion deficit. We had all these economists who said, if we would just \ndo this, we would get 250,000 new jobs. Well, guess what. In fact, the \nmajor economist who pledged the 250,000 new jobs said, ``Whoops, I was \nwrong. I guess there are no 250,000 new jobs; there is more trade \ndebt.''\n  Harry Truman once said: I want to get a one-armed economist. I am \ngetting tired of economists saying ``on this hand'' and ``on the other \nhand.'' We do not need economists who give us this kind of advice.\n  What about the trade deficit? Where is this trade deficit? Well, 92 \npercent of the trade deficit is with six countries. First there is \nJapan. Then there is China, and this one is growing to beat the band, \nby the way. Then we have Canada and Mexico where the deficits have been \ngrowing substantially. Finally, there are Germany and Taiwan.\n  I want to remind those who want to extend fast track about the \nConstitution. The Constitution of the United States, article I, section \n8, says ``The Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with \nforeign nations.'' It does not say anything about fast track. It does \nnot say anything about handcuffs or straitjackets. It does not say \nanything about having some nameless negotiator run off to foreign \nshores someplace and negotiate a bad agreement and then come back to \nthe Congress and say, by the way, vote on this, and you have no \nopportunity to amend it.\n  I wonder how many in this Chamber know what kind of tariff exists on \na T-bone steak you send to Tokyo. I bet not many. Not too many years \nago we negotiated with Japan, with whom we have a very large, abiding \ncontinual trade deficit. We negotiated a beef agreement. We wanted to \nget more United States beef into Japan. So our negotiators went out on \nbehalf of our beef producers and others and negotiated with Japan.\n  All of a sudden one day in the newspapers we see in a big headline \nthat we have reached agreement with Japan on a beef agreement. They \nwere having a day of feasting and rejoicing. You would have thought all \nthese negotiators just won the gold medal in the Olympics. Then we find \nout that, yes, we have a new agreement with Japan and, yes, we are \ngetting more American beef into Japan. But, guess what? Try sending a \nT-bone steak to Tokyo. What is the tariff to get T-bone into Tokyo? \nIt's up to a 50-percent tariff on beef to Japan.\n  Would that be considered successful in any area of the world in \ninternational trade? No. That would be defined as a colossal failure in \nevery set of circumstances except when our negotiators are negotiating \nan agreement with Japan. They define that as success. They line up to \nget their blue ribbons.\n  It's like they had a steer at the county fair and had just won blue \nribbons and want to get congratulated for it. Yes, we got more beef in \nJapan. Just think what we take into our marketplace from Japan in \nexchange for that. And we hit a 50-percent tariff.\n  I could talk about potatoes from Mexico, I could talk about Durum \nwheat flooding our markets from Canada. I could talk forever about \nthese trade problems. I don't want to do that today. I only want to say \nthis to the President, to the administration, and to the Members of \nCongress: Don't talk about fast track until we have straightened out \nthe trade agreements that we have had in recent years that have put our \nproducers and our workers at a disadvantage. Don't talk about fast \ntrack until you have negotiated the problems dealing with Canada and \ngrain.\n  I was in a little orange truck going up to the Canadian border one \nday with 200 bushels of Durum wheat. That little orange truck couldn't \nget over the border into Canada. Do you know why? They stopped us at \nthe border and said you couldn't take Durum wheat into Canada. All the \nway up to the border we found truck after truck, semi-loads, dozens of \nthem, hauling Canadian grain south, but we couldn't get a harmless \nlittle orange truck north.\n  In fact, one North Dakotan couldn't get a grocery sack of wheat into \nCanada. She married a Canadian and was back home visiting, and wanted \nto take a grocery sack of wheat into Canada to grind it and make whole \nwheat bread, and guess what, they wouldn't let her take a grocery sack \nof wheat north. All the while, hundreds of semi-trucks full of Canadian \nwheat come south.\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\n  That is just one example. I say, Mr. President, and others, if you \nwant fast-track authority? Then straighten out the trade problems that \nnow exist. Yes, straighten out the problems with Canada and Mexico and \nJapan and others and I will be the first to line up and say let's talk \nabout new trade authority. But until we solve the vexing and difficult \nproblems of trade agreements that have now resulted in the largest \ntrade deficit in the history of this country, we ought not be moving \ntowards fast-track trade authority.\n  Before I finish that subject, let me put in a word about Charlene \nBarshefsky, our new Trade Ambassador. I like Charlene Barshefsky. She \nhas some spunk and she has some life. She is out there, trying to say \nto our trading partners that we expect reciprocal trading policies. If \nwe open our market to your goods you have a responsibility to open your \nmarket to ours. She has been in Canada, telling the Canadians what you \nare doing with Canadian grain is wrong and it abrogates the treaty.\n  In fact--just one more point about the Canadian grain--when the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement passed the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, and I was on the committee, the vote was 34 to 1. That \n``1'' was me. I said at the time I felt that treaty was going to result \nin a serious problem for us. And it has.\n  Clayton Yeutter, the Trade Ambassador at that point, said, ``No, no, \nno. Your concerns about an avalanche of Canadian grain flooding the \nUnited States market and undercutting American farmers, that is \nnonsense. That will not happen.''\n  I'll tell you what he said. Mr. Yeutter said, ``I'll tell you what, I \nwill give it to you in writing. I will make the promise in writing.'' \nAnd he wrote it down. He said that his agreement with the Canadians was \nwith the understanding that good faith would be subscribed to by both \nsides by not dramatically changing the quantity of grain coming across \nthe border. That was his agreement. So he wrote it down. That was good \nfaith. That was his understanding. That is what he negotiated. However, \nit was not worth the paper it was written on.\n  The second the ink was dry and the minute the treaty was done, what \nwe saw was an avalanche of grain come south. At the same time you \ncouldn't take a grocery sack full north. It undercut our markets in \nDurum wheat especially, and cost our farmers massive amounts of lost \nincome.\n\n  So, why am I a little sore about some of those things? I am angry \nbecause we have negotiated trade agreements that have undercut our \nproducers and we ought not do that. I am for free trade. I am for \nexpanded trade. But I am for fair trade. If it is not fair, than the \nagreement is not right.\n  Charlene Barshefsky is a breath of fresh air and she is trying. She \ncan only do what any administration allows her to do. I urge the \nPresident and others to understand that in order to have trade \nnegotiating authority of anything resembling fast track, they first \nmust address the serious problems in the previous agreements that have \nbeen negotiated. Until that happens, at least a number of us, including \nSenator Snowe and I, based on the letter we have sent to the President, \ndo not support the extension of fast track for all the reasons I have \nmentioned previously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4654-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4655-S4656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk about one other topic \ntoday. It is a subject that is in the paper this morning--the balanced \nbudget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I do not know all of the details of the agreement. I \nknow the outline and the skeleton of the balanced budget agreement that \nhas been reached through a substantial amount of negotiation. I expect, \nwere I to negotiate a balanced budget agreement, it might be different \nthan that which was negotiated and that which I read about this \nmorning. I have been party to many briefings, including the most \nsubstantial briefing yet on what has been negotiated, but I confess, \nlike most Members of the Senate who have not been in the room during \nall the negotiations, I may not know all the provisions of this \nagreement.\n  However, I have said repeatedly during the debates that we have had \non a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and in many other \ncircumstances, that I support balancing the budget. I think there is \nmerit in fiscal discipline. I think we should balance the budget. And I \nthink we should work together to do that.\n  In 1993 I voted for a deficit reduction act that was a very \ncontroversial piece of legislation. And we passed that by one vote. It \nhappened to be the Vice President's vote. My party voted for it, the \nother party didn't. I am not going to make judgments about that today. \nI suppose that's the time for a political discussion.\n  We paid, in my party, a significant price for that vote in 1993, \nbecause it was not popular. I said at the time, and I have said \nrepeatedly since, I am glad I voted the way I did. It wasn't easy. It \ncut some spending. It raised some taxes. It wasn't a very easy vote, \nbut I am glad I voted the way I did because I believe that it was the \nfirst significant step in deciding we are going to do the tough thing \nto reduce the budget deficit.\n  What happened since that time? We have had year after year of \ndeclining budget deficits. The unified deficit has come down, way \ndown--not just down a bit, but way down, by 75 percent. But the job is \nnot yet done. And that is why there have been negotiations between the \nPresident and Members of Congress about how to finish the job.\n  I think we will find that the agreement that has been negotiated will \nreceive fairly substantial support in the Senate and the House. I want \nto vote to finish the job. I voted to start the job and I want to vote \nto finish it. I think we ought to tell the American people there is \nfiscal discipline in this place. There is merit in a balanced budget. \nAnd there is no difference in desire on either side of the aisle about \nwanting to live within our means. That is not a political question \nbetween the two parties. I think that is demonstrated by what we did in \n1993. I hope it will be demonstrated by what we all do this year.\n  Now, is part of this agreement smoke? I think so. I mean, I can \ndescribe certain areas of it where I think it is a fair amount of \nsmoke, or fog.\n\n  But is some of it real? Is it moving us in a bipartisan way in the \nright direction? I think so. Importantly, it does it the right way. \nWhat we have said for a long time is there is a right way to do things \nand a wrong way to do things. I have said on the floor there is a big \ndifference between deciding to invest in star wars or star schools. I \nam not saying one is all right and one is all wrong, but I am saying \nthey are very different. Because it suggests one believes education is \ncritically important and the other says no, the priority is over here \nin defense.\n  My point is what we have done, I think, in these negotiations is to \ndecide, yes, let us balance the budget, but let us preserve the \npriorities that are important. Let us as a nation decide that education \nis still at top of the national agenda and there is not anything much \nmore important in our country than making sure all our kids in this \ncountry, every young boy, every young girl, have the opportunity to be \neverything they can be. And that we will invest in their lives, \nstarting, yes, at Head Start, and going all the way through college. We \nwill invest in their lives, to decide that all of our children should \nbecome whatever their talents will allow them to become; whatever hard \nwork and opportunity will allow them to be, as Americans. A major part \nof that is our decision to make a significant investment and attachment \nto education as a priority. And this budget agreement does that.\n  This President said I will not be a part of the budget agreement and \nI won't sign a budget bill unless it retains the priority of education. \nAnd this budget agreement contains room for new investments in \neducation, which is critically important.\n  The agreement also has room for new investments in health care. It \nsays that 5 million kids, about half of the population of kids without \nhealth care, 5 million can be insured. There is room here so we can \ninsure you, provide insurance for health care for 5 million kids.\n  There is room here to continue to make progress on issues in the \nenvironment. The President said, ``I won't sign\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\na bill unless it meets these priorities.'' And he negotiated and \nnegotiated, and we negotiated, and we have a piece of legislation that \nis going to balance the budget but does preserve those priorities.\n  On the environment, just as an aside, I'll bet there is not a person \nserving in the Congress today who, 20 years ago, would have said this: \nWe can double the use of energy in America in the next 20 years and we \nwill end up with cleaner air and cleaner water. I'll bet there is not \none person who would have predicted that, because all the experts \npredicted we would increase dramatically our use of energy and have \ndirtier air and dirtier water as a result.\n  But it did not happen. We doubled our use of energy as a nation, and \nour air is cleaner and our water is cleaner. Why? Because the \nGovernment said those who continue to pollute our air and water are \ngoing to be penalized. Congress said it will no longer be business as \nusual. The environment is important. We are going to insist that those \nwho are polluters in our country are going to stop polluting.\n  We don't have a perfect situation, but I am saying we are moving in \nthe right direction, we have cleaner air and cleaner water, even as we \nhave doubled the use of energy.\n  So, what the President was saying is, on education, on health care, \non the environment, there are certain things that must be in this \nlegislation. Even as we balance the budget we must make room to invest \nand continue to make progress in those areas. This piece of legislation \ndoes that.\n  I know there are some who have heartburn because it does it. But I \nthink it is the right impulse, for us to decide what is important for \nall of us, Republicans and Democrats, to do in this country to advance \nthe interests of America.\n  One of them is to help to invest in our future by investing in our \nkids' education.\n  One of those is to say to those in this country who do not have the \nopportunity and do not have the resources to have health care coverage, \nespecially for kids, that we want to help get health care coverage. \nThis agreement will provide it for 5 million kids.\n\n  And one of those is to say the environment is important. We should \nnot back up or retreat on the environment. What we should do is \ncontinue to move forward and make progress to clean up our Earth and \nclean our water and say to polluters it is not appropriate to pollute \nthis country. Part of the cost of production is to clean up as you \nproduce. Fortunately, that is not so controversial anymore, because we \nhave made so much progress and the American people so value living in a \nclean environment that now, most all politicians, I think, understand \nthe value of that.\n  But I wanted to simply come today to say that we have made a lot of \nprogress. In 1993 we took the first flight of stairs, and I am pleased \nI made that vote. It was a long flight of stairs. It was a tough vote \nto make. Now we are climbing the second flight of stairs. I think this \nis going to be a bipartisan effort and I am pleased that is the case.\n  No, this bill is probably not perfect. But I would say this. We are \nmoving in the right direction in this country. The fact is, our economy \nis better than it was. Unemployment is down. Inflation is down. More \npeople are working. We are moving in the right direction, largely \nbecause, I think, going from a period when we had Federal deficits of \n$300 billion a year, everyone in this country now sees that the \nPresident is serious and the Congress is serious about getting our \nfiscal house in order. That gives people more confidence about the \nfuture.\n  If people, yes, even the market--especially the market, I suppose--if \nthey have confidence about the future and about the fiscal discipline \nthat can come from a President and a Congress working together, we will \nsee them making the investments in the future because they have more \nconfidence in the future. That is what this is all about.\n  So, I wanted to say, when I got up this morning and read the \nnewspaper, I was pleased to see that we are taking another step toward \nagreement.\n  I don't happen to view bipartisanship as something that is bad for \nthis country. I think it is something that is good for this country. \nThere are some, incidentally, who think being bipartisan is inherently \nbad, because both sides ought to fight like the devil for whatever it \nis they believe and whatever is the outcome is the outcome.\n  I do not believe that. That is not the way we did most things in this \ncountry. We have an interstate highway that goes from Fargo, ND, to \nBeach, ND. It was not one group of people out there who said, ``Let's \nhave a big fight about an interstate highway.'' It was a bipartisan \napproach in the 1950's, to say, ``Let's create an interstate highway in \nthis country.''\n  The interesting part about it is I don't suppose, when Dwight \nEisenhower, then President, and Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House, sat \ndown at the White House and reminisced about what they were going to do \nhere, I don't suppose they actually stopped to think how do we justify \nto the American people the cost of building a 4-lane interstate highway \nfrom Beach, ND, to Fargo, ND, where 600,000 people live?\n  I suppose Citizens Against Government Waste and the National \nTaxpayers Union, or some other group these days--if someone were to try \nto do that--would say, ``What on Earth are you doing?'' How on Earth \ncan you justify that expenditure, going across sparsely populated \nstates?\n  Of course we now know it was one of the great achievements in the \nmiddle of this century, building an interstate highway system that \nopened up vistas of commerce and opportunity.\n  My point is, I think bipartisanship is a wonderful thing. I think \nthere ought to be more opportunities for us to work together. And I \nhope, if this budget agreement is as we are to understand it to be and \nis a bipartisan effort, that in the coming weeks, we can demonstrate to \nthe American people we do care about fiscal responsibility, we do want \nto abolish the Federal budget deficit, and we do want to provide \ngreater hope and opportunity to the American people by doing so.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4655-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4656-S4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to a few points \nmade on the floor this morning concerning the so-called Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act. My colleagues from Georgia and Missouri said this \nmorning that Democrats were filibustering this bill. They complained \nthat working Americans are crying out for flexibility, and that \nDemocrats are arbitrarily standing in the way of progress.\n  I would like to set the record straight. We began debate on this bill \nTuesday morning, May 13, and spent just over 2 hours discussing the \nlegislation. Then the Republican leadership filed a petition to cut off \ndebate. There was no filibuster. There were no Senators on the floor \nreading from irrelevant materials in an effort to thwart the will of \nthe majority.\n  We had no more discussion on the bill on Tuesday afternoon, or on \nWednesday the 14th. Yesterday morning, May 15, we had 45 minutes of \ndebate, followed immediately by a vote on the cloture petition. By a \nvote of 53 to 47, the Senate refused to cut off debate on the bill.\n  I do not think that 3 hours of debate is enough. This bill would \nfundamentally alter the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law that has been \non the books for almost 60 years. Three hours of debate simply is not \nenough time for adequate discussion on changes in so basic a protection \nfor the Nation's workers. This is not a filibuster, Mr. President. We \nsimply want full and fair consideration of this fundamental change in \nlabor standards.\n  My colleagues from Missouri and Kentucky also said this morning that \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act forbids flexible work schedules for hourly \nemployees. This, too, is false. If employers\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\ngenuinely want to provide family-friendly arrangements, they are free \nto do so under current law. The key is the 40-hour week. Employers can \nschedule workers for four 10-hour days a week with the fifth day off, \nand pay them the regular hourly rate for each hour. No overtime pay is \nrequired.\n  Employers can also arrange a work schedule of four 9-hour days plus a \n4-hour day on the fifth day--again, without paying a dime of overtime. \nUnder current law, some employees can even vary their hours enough to \nhave a 3-day weekend every other week.\n  Employers also can offer genuine flex time. This allows employers to \nschedule an 8-hour day around core hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and let \nemployees decide whether they want to work 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. or 10 a.m. \nto 6 p.m. This, too, costs employers not a penny more.\n  But only a tiny fraction of employers use these or the many other \nflexible arrangements available under current law. The Bureau of Labor \nStatistics found in 1991 that only 10 percent of hourly employees are \noffered flexible schedules.\n  Current law permits a host of family friendly, flexible schedules, \nbut virtually no employers provide them. S. 4 has a different purpose. \nIt would cut workers' wages. That is why employer groups support it \nunanimously. Obviously it is not just small businesses that wish to cut \npay and substitute some less expensive benefit instead.\n  My colleagues made another point that cries out for response. They \ncontend that S. 4 gives employees the choice when to use accumulated \ncompensatory hours. Once again, this is incorrect. Under S. 4, the \nemployer could deny a worker's request to take comptime and the \nemployee would have no redress. Even if the employer failed to comply \nwith the bill's stated standards governing the use of compensatory \ntime, the employee would have no right to protest, and no remedy for \nany protest that was lodged nonetheless.\n  Contrary to my colleagues' contentions, the Democratic alternative \nthat was offered on May 14 by Senators Baucus, Kerrey, and Landrieu \nactually gives the employee the choice of when to use accrued \ncompensatory time. My colleagues' statements to the contrary \nnotwithstanding, it is not the Government that would make that decision \nunder our alternative, nor is it the Secretary of Labor.\n  Instead, the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu amendment gives the worker the \nchoice. If an employee wants to use compensatory time for any reason \nthat would qualify for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nthe employee has an absolute right to do so. This simply gives \nemployees the ability to be paid for leave that they already have a \nright to take on an unpaid basis. Thus, an employee could in fact use \ncomptime to care for a seriously ill child, or deal with a newborn or \nnewly adopted child. Supporters of S. 4 claim this is what they want \ntheir bill to accomplish. The Democratic alternative actually achieves \nthat goal.\n  Under the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu amendment, if an employee gives more \nthan 2 weeks' notice, the employee can use comptime for any reason as \nlong as it does not cause substantial and grievous injury to the \nemployer's operations. Thus, if a worker wants to use comptime 3 weeks \nfrom today to attend the school play, he or she can do so unless the \nbusiness would suffer this acute level of disruption. Again, the \nproponents of S.4 allege that they want to give employees the ability \nto do this. But only the Democratic alternative actually gives \nemployees the choice.\n  If an employee gives less than 2 weeks notice of a request to use \ncomptime, under the Democratic alternative the employer must grant the \nrequest unless it would substantially disrupt the business. Once again, \nthis supplies real choice to employees while protecting employers' \nability to run their businesses. Flexibility in the workplace must run \nin both directions. The Republican bill gives all the flexibility to \nthe employer, and gives the employee nothing but a pay cut.\n  One final point requires a response. My colleague from Missouri \ncontends that S. 4 simply gives hourly employees the same benefits that \nState and local government workers have enjoyed since 1985. He argues \nthat Democratic support for that earlier legislation is inconsistent \nwith our opposition to S. 4.\n  But the facts belie this contention. As the Senator from Missouri \nwell knows, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended in 1985 to allow \npublic sector comptime principally to allow State and local governments \nto avoid the costs of overtime pay. The Senator from Missouri was \nGovernor of that State in 1985, and he testified in support of the \nchanges before the Senate Labor Subcommittee.\n  Historically, State and local governments had not been subject to the \novertime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. When that was \nreversed by a Supreme Court decision, those governments were faced with \nsubstantial new costs. They immediately sought relief from Congress so \nthat they could avoid the costs of overtime pay.\n  For example, the National League of Cities claimed that, without \nrelief, ``the cost of complying with the overtime provisions of the \nFLSA * * * will be in excess of $1 billion for local governments.'' The \nNational Association of Counties reported that ``It will cost States \nand localities in the billions of dollars to maintain current service \nlevels under this ruling. * * * We need flexibility to use compensatory \ntime and volunteers as alternatives to meeting the public's demand for \nincreased services when we are faced with budget shortfalls.''\n  Such estimates, along with similar dire warnings from other States, \nled to the enactment of comptime legislation for State and local \ngovernment employees in 1985. As Senator Hatch put it, that legislation \nwas meant ``to prevent the taxpayers in every single city in America \nfrom suffering reduced services and higher taxes.''\n  Deny it as they will, supporters of S. 4 have precisely the same \nmotive. Saving money is precisely what the supporters of S. 4 want to \naccomplish. A representative of the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses testified before the Labor Committee in February that small \nbusinesses support S. 4 because they ``cannot afford to pay their \nemployees overtime.'' Cutting workers' wages is unacceptable to those \non this side of the aisle. That is why we oppose S. 4.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4656-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Savings Act of 1974 \nto promote retirement income savings through the establishment of an \noutreach program in the Department of Labor and periodic national \nsummits on retirement savings; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n       the savings are vital to everyone's retirement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to address a problem of critical importance to this \ncountry: The dismal level of individual retirement savings. This \nmeasure would encourage retirement savings by initiating an education \nproject and creating a national summit on retirement savings.\n  Before I go any further let me read you some statistics:\n  Our national net savings fell from 7.1 to 1.8 percent from the 1970's \nto the 1990's. On an individual level, this means that individuals may \nnot be able to retire when they desire with the lifestyle that they \ndesire.\n  In a 1994 survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute [EBRI]: \n14 percent of workers who were saving for their retirement did not know \nmuch they had saved, and 13 percent saved less than $1,000.\n  In another survey by Merrill Lynch of workers in their forties and \nearly fifties, savings levels had dropped by 6 percent from 1988 to \n1994.\n  According to the 1996 Retirement Confidence Survey released earlier \nthis year by the EBRI: Only one-third of American workers have \ncalculated how much money they will need to have saved by retirement in \norder to live comfortably; of the workers that have tried to determine \nhow much money they should be saving, only one-third felt very \nconfident that they had determined an accurate figure; when asked how \nmuch they calculated that they would need to save, 42 percent could not \ngive an amount; and less than 20 percent had a specific number with \nwhich to work.\n\n  So, the problem is twofold: There is a lack of adequate retirement \nsavings, and Americans workers do not understand the importance of \ndetermining how much money they should be saving in order to retire \ncomfortably. The Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held its \nfirst hearing on meeting the challenges of the retiring baby boom \ngeneration. At that hearing, witness after witness stressed the need to \nstart a national public education campaign. This downward trend in \nsavings couldn't be happending at a worse time, given the retirement of \nthe first wave of baby boomers is in just over 10 years. When baby \nboomers retire we will be unable to sustain, as presently structured, \nthe programs on which the elderly rely for their health and income \nsecurity. Educating the public about the necessity to save for their \nretirement is vital. That is why I am introducing the Savings Are Vital \nto Everyone's Retirement, or SAVER, Act of 1997.\n  The SAVER Act would direct the Department of Labor to maintain an \nongoing retirement savings education program. This program would \ninclude public service announcements, public meetings, the creation and \ndissemination of educational materials, and establish a site on the \nInternet. This project will give the American people the information \nthey need, in terms they can understand, to develop retirement savings \ngoals and a plan to achieve those goals. The information will include \nthe tools necessary for individuals to cacluate how much an individual \nwill need to save. Just a important, this educational effort will also \nfocus on how employers can establish different retirement savings \narrangements for their employees.\n  My legislation will also convene a national summit on retirement \nsavings. The summit will bring together in one forum experts in the \nfield of employee benefits and retirement savings, leaders of \nGovernment, and interested parties from the private sector and the \ngeneral public. By bringing these delegates together we hope to advance \nthe public's knowledge and understanding of the need to put money away \nfor retirement, urge American workers to set aside adequate funds, and \nidentify the impediments for small employers in setting up retirement \nsavings arrangements for their employees.\n  I want to commend Congressmen Harris Fawell and Donald Payne, \nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employee-Employer \nRelations of the Education and Workforce Committee, for their \nleadership. The House legislation, H.R. 1377, has bipartisan support \nwith over 30 cosponsors across the political spectrum. In addition the \nbill is endorsed by the several organizations including the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, and the American Association of Retired Persons.\n  Today's workers need to have confidence and feel good about their \nretirement and quality of life. One of the most important things \nGovernment can do is encourage individuals to acquire the knowledge \nthat will help them achieve a secure retirement. The SAVER Act is by no \nmeans a solution to the problem of inadequate retirement savings, but \nit is a critical first step to facing the future demographic tidalwave.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 758. A bill to make certain technical corrections to the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act of 1995; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        THE LOBBYING DISCLOSURE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Lobbying Disclosure \nTechnical Amendments Act of 1997. Last\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\nyear, Congressmen Charles Canady and Barney Frank sponsored a similar \npiece of legislation and moved it through the House of Representatives. \nUnfortunately, a last minute dispute over one of the provisions \nprecluded the Senate from passing the bill and sending it to the \nPresident for signature. The bill I am introducing today contains all \nbut one of the key elements of the bill passed by the House last year; \nthe provision that was problematic to some Members of the Senate has \nbeen omitted. I hope that the Senate will act expeditiously to pass \nthis revised bill, so that we can clear up the technical issues \nidentified by our colleagues on the House side in the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, just 2 years ago, Congress enacted the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act [LDA], the first substantive reform in the laws \ngoverning lobbying disclosure in 50 years. The LDA was designed to \noverhaul our lobbying disclosure statutes and plug the glaring \nloopholes in those laws. Lobbying of congressional staff is no longer \nexempt; lobbying of executive branch officials is no longer exempt; \nlobbying on nonlegislative issues is no longer exempt; and the much-\nabused primary purpose test has been eliminated. For the first time \never, all paid, professional lobbyists are required to disclose who is \npaying them how much to lobby Congress and the executive branch on what \nissues.\n\n  At the same time, the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act made the lobbying \ndisclosure laws more understandable and easier to comply with by \nproviding clear, sensible disclosure rules; establishing sensible de \nminimis requirements; eliminating duplicative and overlapping \ndisclosure requirements; replacing quarterly reports with semi-annual \nreports; authorizing the development of computer-filing systems; \nrequiring a single registration by each organization whose employees \nlobby instead of separate registrations by each employee-lobbyist; \nrequiring good-faith estimates of total, bottom-line lobbying \nexpenditures; and allowing entities that are already required to \naccount for lobbying expenditures under the Internal Revenue Code to \nuse data collected for the IRS for disclosure purposes as well. \nDetailed guidance provided by the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk \nof the House of Representatives have also helped provide clear lines as \nto who is required to register and what must be disclosed. I would like \nto commend the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives for the tremendous job that they have done in \ndeveloping guidance, communicating with the public, and handling huge \nquantities of new information, with almost no lead time to prepare.\n  There is already substantial evidence that this reform is working. \nPreliminary reports indicate that the number of organizations and \nindividuals registered under the new law in the first year was almost \ntriple the number of organizations and individuals registered a year \nearlier, under the old law. Reporting of lobbying expenditures appears \nto have increased to an even greater degree and may now be as much as a \nbillion dollars a year. The new lobbying disclosure forms not only \ncontain more accurate information than the old forms, they also convey \nit in a manner that is far more readable and easier to understand. As a \nresult, the public is getting a far more accurate picture than ever \nbefore of what issues are being lobbied, who is lobbying them, and how \nmuch is being spent.\n  I remain disappointed that the Lobbying Disclosure Act does not cover \npaid efforts by professional lobbyists to stimulate grassroots \nlobbying--so-called astroturf lobbying--and I would like to see faster \nprogress in the development of computer filing systems and automated \ndata bases to make filing easier and lobbying information more \naccessible. But already, in just 1 year, we have made huge progress in \nshining the light of public disclosure on the lobbying industry.\n  The legislation now before us would make minor adjustments to the \nLDA, to ensure that the law continues to operate as intended. In \nparticular, the bill would:\n  Clarify the definition of a ``covered executive branch official'' \nunder the LDA;\n  Clarify that any communication compelled by a federal contract, \ngrant, loan, permit or license is not considered to be a lobbying \ncontact;\n  Clarify that the official representatives of international groups \nsuch as NATO and the United Nations are public officials who are not \nrequired to register as lobbyists;\n  Clarify how estimates of lobbying income and expenditures may be made \non the basis of the tax reporting system;\n  Clarify that organizations lobbying on behalf of foreign commercial \nentities should register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, even if \nthey engage in only de minimis lobbying; and\n  Make a conforming change to the terminology of the Foreign Agents \nRegistration Act which was inadvertently omitted in the LDA.\n\n  Mr. President, the most significant provision of this bill addresses \nthe coordination of IRS and LDA reporting requirements for companies \nand organizations that are required to report to the IRS in accordance \nwith the Internal Revenue Code [IRC]. The IRC's definition of \n``lobbying'' is different that the one contained in the LDA.\n  The IRC's definition of lobbying encompasses the local, State and \nFederal levels. The LDA's definition is limited to the Federal level.\n  The IRC's definition covers lobbying only on legislative issues. The \nLDA's definition includes non-legislative lobbying as well.\n  Because Congress did not want to require entities that lobby to keep \ntwo sets of books on their lobbying activities, the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct permits entities that are subject to IRS lobbying requirements to \nuse the IRS definitions in lieu of the LDA definitions in regard to \nseveral LDA reporting requirements: the dollar amounts spent on \nlobbying activities, whether there has been a contact that triggers \nreporting, and the 20-percent test for determining who is a lobbyist. \nAs for the requirement to report who was lobbied and the issues that \nwere the subject of the lobbying, the Secretary of the Senate and the \nClerk of the House have interpreted the Lobbying Disclosure Act to \nrequire that reporting be done in accordance with the LDA definition of \nlobbying.\n  The LDA provisions authorizing entities to use, for LDA purposes, the \nsame information they submit to the IRS make sense, as far as they \napply to the reporting of dollar amounts. However, the application of \nthese provisions to other aspects of lobbying leads to confusing \nresults--most notably in connection with the triggering contacts and \ncalculating whether an individual has crossed the 20-percent line and \ntherefore is required to register as a lobbyist. When registrants are \nallowed to use IRS definitions in these situations, they may be \nrequired to list their State and local government lobbyists--since the \nIRS definition includes State and local lobbying--but not all of their \nFederal Government lobbyists, since the IRS definition excludes \nlobbying Congress on nonlegislative matters. In other words, we get \nboth too much information and too little. The intent of the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act is to provide a full picture of lobbying on the Federal \nlevel without being overly burdensome. That means we don't need to know \nabout State and local lobbyists, but we do need to know about lobbying \nof Congress on legislative and nonlegislative matters.\n\n  This bill would continue to allow registrants subject to the IRS \nlobbying requirements to apply the IRS definition of lobbying \nactivities to the requirement under the LDA for reporting the amount of \nmoney spent on lobbying activities. At the same time, it would address \nthe problem caused by applying IRS definitions for other purposes. In \nparticular, the bill would:\n  First, require the application of the LDA definition with respect to \nlegislative branch lobbying for the determination of contacts, the \napplication of the 20 percent test, and the reporting of who was \nlobbied and on what issues.\n  Second, allow such registrants to use the IRS definition with respect \nto executive branch lobbying for these same reporting requirements. \nThis approach would produce more useful information, while reducing the \nproblem of tracking lobbying to two different definitions by allowing \nlobbyists to follow IRS definitions in regard to executive branch \nlobbying.\n  Mr. President, when we passed the Lobbying Disclosure Act 2 years \nago, we had a clear goal in mind: We wanted\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nto get a full overview of Federal level lobbying. The bill I am \nintroducing today is designed to ensure that the act achieves that goal \nin the most effective manner without imposing an undue burden on the \nregistrants. The Lobbying Disclosure Act has already proved its worth. \nThis technical amendments bill will, through a few commonsense \ncorrections, make the LDA even more useful.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nappear in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 758\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I introduce the Federal Electronic and \nInformation Technology Disability Compliance Act of 1997. In an effort \nto make it easier for persons with disabilities to work, this \nlegislation will allow the Federal Government to take the lead in \nproviding Federal employees who have disabilities with critical access \nto technological tools in the workplace.\n  The Federal Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility \nCompliance Act of 1997 strengthens Federal requirements that electronic \ntools and information technology purchased by Federal agencies be made \naccessible to their employees. Additionally, it would require States \nthat receive Federal resources toward disability programs to meet \naccessibility guidelines when they purchase technology. Section 508 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires such compliance, but currently \nthere is no enforcement mechanism to assure that this is done. The \nHouse of Representatives today passed similar legislation introduced by \nRepresentative Anna Eshoo.\n  Barriers to information and technology must be broken down. By giving \nFederal employees with disabilities the opportunity to utilize \ntechnological advancements, we provide them hope and encourage self-\nsufficiency.\n  Additionally, I believe these new efforts will encourage the private \nsector to adopt similar procedures. Let the Federal Government provide \na good example to the private sector in its efforts.\n  Concrete examples of technological advancements that have aided \npersons with disabilities include: Telephones and fax machines with \nvoice features for the visually impaired; voice mail that is converted \nfor the deaf or hearing impaired; and CD-ROM or network-based \ninformation systems that can be equipped with audio descriptions of \nvisual elements.\n  Nationally, there are 49 million Americans who have disabilities. It \nis critical, Mr. President, that given the rapid introduction of new \ntechnologies, persons with disabilities not be allowed to fall behind. \nThe more we can do to promote their equality, independence, and \ndignity, the better.\n  I want to commend Mr. William Paul of United Technologies Corp., in \nmy state of Connecticut, for first bringing this matter to my \nattention. Mr. Paul has identified a critical need among members of our \nsociety. His civic-minded actions deserve to be commended not only by \npeople with disabilities, but by all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I believe this a modest measure, that will improve the \nlives of the millions of Americans who have disabilities across this \ncountry and benefit our society as a whole. I hope to have my \ncolleagues support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4658-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4660-S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Durbin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend title \n46, United States Code, to extend eligibility for veterans' burial \nbenefits, funeral benefits, and related benefits for veterans of \ncertain service in the United States merchant marine during World War \nII.\n\n\n                                 S. 75\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nBennett] was added as a cosponsor of S. 75, a bill to repeal the \nFederal estate and gift taxes and the tax on generation-skipping \ntransfers.\n\n\n                                 S. 202\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Montana [Mr. \nBurns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 202, a bill to amend title II of \nthe Social Security Act to eliminate the earnings test for individuals \nwho have attained retirement age.\n\n\n                                 S. 263\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Specter] was added as a cosponsor of S. 263, a bill \nto prohibit the import, export, sale, purchase, possession, \ntransportation, acquisition, and receipt of bear viscera or products \nthat contain or claim to contain bear viscera, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Grassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 537, a bill to amend \ntitle III of the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend the \nmammography quality standards program.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 24\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint \nResolution 24, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to equal rights for women \nand men.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 85\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the name of the Senator from Mississippi\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 85, a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that individuals affected \nby breast cancer should not be alone in their fight against the \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4660-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  EMPLOYEE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I recently added my name to the list \nof 37 cosponsors of S. 127 on behalf of those hard-working folks who \nare trying to get ahead in their jobs by going back to school while \nthey work. The Employee Educational Assistance Act will make permanent \nthe tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance under \nsection 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. By doing so, it will remove \nthe penalty part-time students face in the form of higher taxes when \ntheir employers provide educational assistance.\n  Mr. President, this bill's sponsor, Senator Moynihan, said it well: \nThis is a very effective program which requires no bureaucracy and \nwhich administers itself. Employers and employees arrange for the \neducational assistance, and the Government's role is to stay out of the \nway. For example, MSE Technologies Inc. in Butte, MT, provides \nassistance to its employees who are working on undergraduate or \ngraduate degrees. For MSE this is a wise investment in its employees \nand helps to keep the company competitive. With section 127 in place, \nemployees can receive up to $5,250 annually in tuition reimbursements \nfrom their employer without paying additional taxes. Without section \n127, employees are taxed on the educational assistance they receive. \nThis tax is exactly the wrong message to send to businesses and their \nemployees trying to stay ahead.\n  Section 127, which first went into effect in 1979, will expire in 3 \nmonths. The provision has been extended numerous times, and it has \nwidespread support. But the uncertainty of the provision's future has \nbeen disruptive to workers and made planning ahead difficult. The full \npotential of its benefits to workers and employers is not being met, \nand it won't be until we make it permanent. Let's make helping American \nworkers stay competitive a top priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4661-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ABORTION\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I agree with a May 10, 1997, New \nYork Times editorial regarding legislation to ban so-called partial-\nbirth abortions and the alternatives to it which we are considering \ntoday in the Senate. The editorial states,\n\n       These proposed bills, while well intentioned, still \n     interfere in judgments best left to doctors and their \n     patients. Some of the 40 states that have passed or are \n     considering bans on `partial-birth' abortions have fallen \n     into the same trap. Whether at the state or the Federal \n     level, these political intrusions into medical practice and \n     attempts to limit women's access to abortions deserve to be \n     defeated.\n\n  I am opposed to the Government making medical decisions that should \nbe handled by qualified physicians on a case-by-case basis. During my \n22 years in the Senate, I have voted to uphold the Supreme Court's 1973 \nRoe versus Wade decision that a woman's right to choose whether to have \nan abortion is protected, within specified limits, under the \nconstitutional right to privacy. This means that a woman can make her \nown choice, based on her moral and religious beliefs and in \nconsultation with her family, her physician, her priest, rabbi, \nminister, or whomever she chooses. I respect the heartfelt views of \nthose who are opposed to abortion, but I do not believe they should be \nimposed on those who hold a different but equally firm conviction.\n  Having said that, I did support Senator Feinstein's amendment as a \nsubstitute to the partial-birth abortion ban. Senator Feinstein's \namendment would have banned postviability abortions, but like Roe \nversus Wade, it includes exceptions for cases where the attending \nphysician makes a medical decision that the abortion is necessary to \npreserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health \nconsequences. As you know, under the provisions of Roe, States can pass \nsuch laws now. If this amendment had passed, I believe late-term \nabortions would remain available to women who need them for serious \nmedical reasons.\n  I opposed Senator Daschle's amendment because I believe its health \nexception could provide roadblocks to a woman seeking a late-term \nabortion for serious medical reasons. I have concerns about the \nconstitutionality of the health exceptions in this amendment because \nthey are more restrictive than those in Roe versus Wade.\n  Mr. President, the American people overwhelmingly support the right \nof a woman to choose regarding abortion. This does not mean they are \npro-abortion, it means they are pro-choice as I am. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the partial-birth abortion ban, which is clearly \nunconstitutional, and to allow women and their physicians to make the \nbest decisions based on each individual case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4661-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               RAINN DAY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, in 1995, there were over 350,000 \nvictims of rape or sexual assault. The Uniform Crime Reports indicate \nthat means that there is one forcible rape every 5 minutes. The most \nstartling aspect of sex crimes is that they go unreported. There are \nestimates that only 37 percent of all rapes are reported to the police.\n  Victims of rape and sexual assault need a place to turn to and \nRAINN's national toll-free hotline for survivors of sexual assault \nreaches them. The hotline provides callers access to counseling 24 \nhours a day, from anywhere in the country.\n  RAINN is an acronym for rape, abuse, and incest national network. \nWhen a survivor calls the 800 number, a computer identifies the \ncaller's location by reading the area code and the first three digits \nof the phone number. The call is routed to the rape crisis center \nnearest the caller. If the line is busy, the call will be routed to the \nnext closest center.\n  RAINN networks with 628 crisis centers across the Nation, responding \nto victim's immediate needs. Since its inception in 1994, this \norganization has helped more than 140,000 victims of sexual assault.\n  I am bringing attention to the tremendous work of RAINN because at \nnoon today, on May 16, radio stations across the United States will \ninterrupt their regular programming to play a song from a rape \nsurvivor, Tori Amos. This is a nationwide call to action--a way to \nraise public awareness to what is happening to those victimized by \nrapists.\n  I am proud to be an honorary co-chair of RAINN and commend all those \ninvolved in working on this national hotline, one of the most valuable \nresources for the survivor of rape or sexual abuse.\n  RAINN was founded in July 1994 with grants from the Atlantic Group \nand Warner Music Group. Support is also provided by Westwood One, MCI, \nthe Jacobs Family Foundation, the Ryka Rose Foundation, and the \nNational Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/16/senate-section/article/S4661-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 19, 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
